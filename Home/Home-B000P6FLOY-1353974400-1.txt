review/summary: Great For Beer Brewers with Cooler Mash Tunsreview/text: I've been using it with my cooler mash tun for beer brewing and it's been working great through 5 batches. Also the alarm is wonderful for raising temperatures and walking away from the pot. I wish it had a wireless monitor but other than that it's an awesome tool.
