review/summary: Rice rice and more rice!review/text: I bought this as a gift for my wife as she wanted a rice maker for years now. Well I must say this rice maker does not disappoint. We have been using it for 9 months now and we use it very regularly. Perfect rice every time with pleasing music upon completion for the easily amused. Rice was a rarity in our home, but with this rice cooker simplifying life so much, and making such delicious meals, we keep a 5 pound bag on hand. Zojirushi definitely makes a great product, and I have a bread maker made by them which is equally awesome!
