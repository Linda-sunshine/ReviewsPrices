review/summary: Not bad for $70review/text: When our Kenmore canister vacuum died after 14.5 years I really didn't want to spend $250+ just for a vacuum cleaner. So I went for cheap. I'm glad I did at this point.I've only used this vacuum 3 times so far. Hence the 3 stars. It seems to work find. Picks up what it should. Doesn't leave anything behind. It is loud, but probably no louder than the Kenmore. I don't know how long it will last but it's doing the job for nowWhen my wife used it she had some trouble with it leaving 'black hair balls' on the carpet. Hasn't happened when I've used it.
