review/summary: Praise the Nordic Warereview/text: This has to be my best-buy of the year.Just took a shot, after reading the other reviews and I can't be more pleased with this purchase.I would never buy this gadget in a store off the shelve, only after reading the users reviews and decided what the heck it's less than 10$.Here's my take so easy to use just follow the easy and short directions and your eggs are always perfect with no attention from you. The microwave shuts off automatically and I'm off doing other choirs, after 20 or 30 min giving them a chance to cool down, and it maybe my imagination but seems the egg comes out of the shell cleaner, quicker and easier than when they were boiled in water.\Some say had a problem with the unit. It is delicate and needs to be opened and closed with care, just take your time opening and closing, pay attention to the seal and there is no problem. Slam it on without paying attention to how it seals - will surely cause a problem.
