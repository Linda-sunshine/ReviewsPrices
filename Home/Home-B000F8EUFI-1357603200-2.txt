review/summary: less than a year and it's partially brokenreview/text: when it worked it seemed to have worked well but it didn't last long. I use it less than once a week and now about 10 months after I bought it, the dust bin is showing some cracks... I don't know how that could have happened. not sure if it's gonna shatter in the middle of an operation or something so I'm concerned now.
