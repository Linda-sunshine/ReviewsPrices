review/summary: Turned me into a green juice junkiereview/text: I had never juiced before, but after reading so much about the health benefits, I just had to give it a try. I love veggies, but I was skeptical about how good raw kale and brussels sprout juice could be. Well, the answer is, as long as they're properly combined with sweeter juices like celery, carrot, and apple: Really, really good.The high points of this juicer: It's quiet. It's hella powerful and I've run it for literally hours without it overheating. It wrings more juice than you would believe out of leafy greens, along with every other veggie under the sun. And importantly, it's really easy to clean -- IF you clean it as soon as you're finished juicing. I mean, you can mostly just rinse it in hot water, and you're done. All you need is a quick brush of the mesh with the included brush, and you're ready to go again.What to watch out for: You should alternate vegetables to keep the auger from getting fouled. As long as you alternate soft (like tomatoes) with hard (like celery), the auger cleans itself and keeps chugging along. If it gets fouled, just press the "reverse" button and it's fixed.I'm a veggie juice junkie now, and I make shopping trips for armloads of greens, apples, etc, which I juice all at once and quickly freeze in batches, since my schedule won't allow daily juicing. Fortunately, defrosted juice tastes just as good and retains pretty much all the nutrients. I often have green juice for breakfast, and I've come to crave it now!So, in short, should you buy this? Yes. It's a great juicer, and the juice is amazingly tasty, nutritious, and life-giving.Oh, and here's a bonus tip: Almost any juice you make tastes better with just a little bit of whole ginger added to the juicer.
