review/summary: I can taste the differencereview/text: I switched from a Brita to a Pur about a year ago because I just love the size of my Pur, and love the taste. When I switch out the filter I can actually taste a difference in quality, and the water also filters faster. They say you should switch it out every few months, but I smudge it a little and have gone longer with no real consequences. Great investment if you care about the quality of your drinking water.
