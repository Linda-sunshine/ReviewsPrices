review/summary: Great mattress for long term usereview/text: We bought this mattress for occasional use and the day it arrived a friend moved in for the long term. She has been sleeping on it since March 17th, pretty much every day. This mattress has held up very well. I was concerned that it would wear out and it has not. She adds air every 5 or 6 days.One thing that is important to note for people who say it never held air. These mattresses are basically vinyl and it stretches. You need to fill it full then expect that it will appear to lose air initially. In our case, as I was told, it didn't lose air, the vinyl stretched so it appeared to have lost air. After the first two days, the stretching was done and it stayed firm long term.so glad we bought this one!
