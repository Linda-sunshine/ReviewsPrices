review/summary: Love!!review/text: I bought this to replace my Keurig brewer, which was becoming expensive to use for someone who drinks several cups of coffee during the day. The timer works beautifully and is a snap to set up. The sleek lines look great in my kitchen and next to my stainless appliances. Most importantly, the carafe does not drip!
