review/summary: Carbon in the waterreview/text: Even after following all the instructions there were small black carbon pieces in my water. I was informed if I continue to drink the water from the filter it would seriously harm my health. It is appalling that a defective product like this can be sold on Amazon.com and something that can cause critical health concerns.I suppose that one piece was faulty but I would never buy this product again.
