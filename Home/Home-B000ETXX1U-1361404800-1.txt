review/summary: Comfortable, pump inside is great, but it is not perfectreview/text: This air mattress it TALL. If you are used to the standard air mattresses, this will be quite a surprise. The height is about the same as the seating height of a couch. It makes it harder to move around full than a regular air mattress, but it also makes it more comfortable.The built in pump is awesome, EXCEPT that is has a tendency to overheat... This means that about 1/3 of the time we pump up the bed, we have to let it sit mostly filled for 30 minutes while the pump cools off before we can finish inflating it. This is the reason that I cannot give this mattress a five star rating. It is annoying, but you can work around it.You cannot go wrong with this bed. It is not perfect, but it is very comfortable.
