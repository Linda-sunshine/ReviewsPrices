review/summary: Don't buy it! Name doesn't mean anything!review/text: This is the first review I've ever written on Amazon, if that tells you anything. This product is terrible! Bought for a camping trip, used about twice a year for 2 years. The doneness selector broke off!! There is not an adjustable back hinge, so if the waffle gets too big, the front opens and the steam pours out. Even if it isn't too big, the steam pours out the front, warming the handle to open the iron...not a good design! Also, if you overfill, the batter pours out the front into the slot wheree the (now broken) doneness slector is. The Cuisinart name isn't what it used to be. Don't buy it!!!!!
