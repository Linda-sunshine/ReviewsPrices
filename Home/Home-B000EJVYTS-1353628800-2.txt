review/summary: Like the productreview/text: I wanted a trash can that I don't need to touch, and this is perfect. I have been using it for a few months now and have no problems with the touchless aspect. I added batterires and it works perfectly. Of course its so sensitive that anytime someone walks by it opens, and you have to have your hand in some specific positions for it to open. But overall I am satisfied so far. The odor thing doesn't work, the trash still smells bad. My recent concern is that now that I am having kids they will play with it, kids of friends always come over and play with the can, and it will totally ruin the product. So in hindsight I am wondering if non-touch would work better with young kids. Will have to wait and watch.Also, I received a defective product and it is such a big pain sending it back to Amazon. Batteries would not start the first can, I called customer service to send it back and they don't provide a UPS label. They provide a USPS label. I live in NYC and its tough carrying such a big box, not having a car, to drop off at USPS. I asked for a UPS label which they said they would send, never arrived since UPS picks up in my building. FInally after several calls they asked me to keep the defective product. I told them I don't want this to take space in my small NYC apartment, to no avail. I still have the product and now my husband is using it near his desk. What a waste. Amazon needs to improve returns process.
