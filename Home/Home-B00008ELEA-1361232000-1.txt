review/summary: Works very well and fastreview/text: Since I was used to a french press instead of the percolator, the coffee tasted weaker (no fault of percolator). I used the unit for about 6 months, before I got hooked on home-made latt&eacute;s. So it`s sitting in my cupboard until my preference changes back to percolated coffee.It heated very fast and worked very well. A definite buy.
