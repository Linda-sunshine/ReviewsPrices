review/summary: Love the color, needs multiple washes before usereview/text: The color on this is perfect--exactly what I was looking for. However, it took multiple washes to get the dye smell out, even when I tried vinegar. Same problem with the green set I bought from the same company. I highly recommend washing these alone like I did the first couple of times--I suspect you'd take out more purple items than you put in otherwise. I haven't had any problems with shrinking and the sheets fit my oversize queen pillowtop with no problem. I would probably give 3.5 stars if I could, but since these are great for the price once the dye settles, I'll lean toward the 4-star rating.
