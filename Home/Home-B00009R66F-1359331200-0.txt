review/summary: AMAZING! Definitely recommend! Better than professional/rental cleanersreview/text: Let me start off by saying I am a mother of 2, including a toddler boy who gets into everything and spills everything. Our carpets were literally covered in juice stains, black dirt spots, etc. I bought this carpet cleaner after reading the reviews and I have to say that my carpets have never been cleaner. It is extremely easy to use and our carpets look brand new. I have already recommended this carpet cleaner to everyone I know. And for the price, it is definitely something that every family should own. It is great because it comes with the Hoover brand carpet cleaner solution, but I also have used 2 other brands and they work just as great. It is the same size as our vaccuum so it is very easy to store. It gets out every sort of stain and I could not be happier with this purchase!
