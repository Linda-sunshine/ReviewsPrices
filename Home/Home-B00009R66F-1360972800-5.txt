review/summary: Carpets almost looked newreview/text: We have lived in our house for 11 years with the same carpet. We have had a small dog for the past 3 years. He has had accidents inside so the carpet does have some set in stains. I had previously used a machine similar to the Hoover Quick n Lite which did an ok job but we knew we needed something stronger. The Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge did the trick. My friend even commented on the house looking brighter and I told her it was because the carpets looked almost new. The machine is easy to use but I will say that since the bottle for the cleaning solution is bigger than what I was used to; and it does rest on the handle of the machine; my shoulder was a bit sore the next day.We did follow the instructions of vacuuming first then pre-treating heavy soils. It has great suction and my carpets where almost dry by the time I was done. We also used the machine on our dining room chairs which had stains and previous watermarks. Only 1 of the chairs still needs a 2nd treatment since the water stain on that one was pretty bad. We are so glad we made the investment!
