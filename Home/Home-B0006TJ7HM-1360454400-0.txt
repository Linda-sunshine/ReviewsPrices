review/summary: Great set of knives for a great pricereview/text: So, the handles are still tight, blades are still sharp, and they've made it through the dishwashser.The block is sharp (no pun) looking and great quality. The plastic feet keep it from sitting flat in puddles or crumbs- easier to clean the counter.
