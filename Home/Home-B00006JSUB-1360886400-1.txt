review/summary: Heavy duty and high qualityreview/text: This is a very good quality cast iron pan. For the price it cannot be beat. I find my self using it quite often. It heats up very evenly and after many uses the surface is still non stick.You need to take care of cleaning a bit more than other pans, but it's well worth the effort.
