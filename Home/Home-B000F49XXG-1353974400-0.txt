review/summary: Not a Good Choicereview/text: I bought one a couple of years ago. It worked well enough for the first year. This past year it's been very erratic. Most of the time, the espresso drips out like water from a slowly melting icicle. There must be a problem with the motor not functioning properly or it just isn't powerful enough. So I bought another one. Why would I buy another when the first was such a disappointment? Price. It seemed to be the best/only choice in the price range. I'm sure the ones costing upward of $1000 work much better... Anyway, I just set up the new one and it works just as poorly as the old one plus it leaked. At least the old one worked well for a little while! I just returned the new one and fished the old one out of the recycle bin. I don't know what the solution to the problem is yet, but this DeLonghi model isn't it.
