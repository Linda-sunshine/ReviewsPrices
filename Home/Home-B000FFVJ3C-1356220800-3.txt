review/summary: Love my new toyreview/text: I used to dry my herbs from the garden on screens or newspaper. This year I was able to use my dehydrator. Love the small screen trays for thyme or oregano. The stacking trays were great to use for my large batches of basal. I even tried some berries and was worried about staining. The blue berries cleaned up super easy and did not leave a mark.
