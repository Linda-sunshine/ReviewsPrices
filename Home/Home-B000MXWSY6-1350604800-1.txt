review/summary: Good Clock Radioreview/text: This is a good clock radio. For the price it cant be beat. As compared to an emerson model it is only missing 1 option. The dual alarms are nice, but. With the ermerson models you can set either alarm to come on just for the week days, or the weekend or both. The sony model you have to turn the alarms on or off. No option for week days or weekend. The screen can be very dim or fairly bright. Radio reception is excellent. For the reviews that complain that the time was set off a few minutes by the factory read your instructions. It is easily set to a different time if you would like it fast, behind, or right on. I havent owned it long enough to see how well it keeps time. My emerson clock is right on with my atomic wrist watch still after 5 years. This sony clock radio came with the time not set. There is a disclaimer in the instructions that says the time may not be set due to some error. But that is not a big deal, time and time zone it easily set.
