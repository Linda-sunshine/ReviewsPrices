review/summary: Better than a sleeper-sofareview/text: For the price, this bed really is fantastic. The built-in pump makes it very easy and fast to inflate and especially deflate (there is no waiting for all the air to escape or trying to squeeze it out manually), and I've been told it is more comfortable than my fold-out sleeper-sofa. I have never left it inflated for more than one night at a time, but after 8-10 hours of nightly use with two adults on top it has not lost pressure. Very convenient and easy to store; I would definitely recommend this.
