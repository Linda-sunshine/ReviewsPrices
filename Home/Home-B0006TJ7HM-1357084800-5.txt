review/summary: Very sharp but rusted just a tiny bitreview/text: These knives are very sharp but some have developed a few tiny rust spots (~1% of the surface of the blade) in the 8 months I've had them. Rust is non-toxic so there's no health concern and it doesn't interfere with function for these knives, just a bit unsightly so I would recommend hand washing and drying them immediately. Nice set of different knives; fulfills my culinary needs. Scissors are very convenient, too.
