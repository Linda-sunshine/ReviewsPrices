review/summary: makes great coffeee just hope it ;holds up.review/text: reading the revues any coffee maker of this type has mixed revues. I just picked one and hoped for the best. I had 3 G E s and they lasted 3 mo and were replaced by the warranty but i am tired of sending them back. This one looks good and makes great coffee and is easy to clean . I am careful to get the stem in place and not get the bottom wet when i clean it. we have had it 60 days and its good so far
