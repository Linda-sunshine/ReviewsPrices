review/summary: Waste of time and moneyreview/text: When setting it up I poured the water in and some of ran onto the hot plate even though I didn't spill any. Brewed a cup of coffee and wound up with coffee grounds in my cup. I looked at the coffee maker and the On light was off. I though somehow it got turned off. I started to brew another cup and when I poured the water in it immediately started to brew. Turns out the On light had burned out. Brewing this cup was taking an awfully long time so I lifted the lid and looked at the coffee filter. It was about half full of water and was not doing anything. I jiggled the filter and then the coffee finished brewing. It seems that the coffee blocked the bottom of the filter so the water could not go through. I returned the coffee maker the same day and requested a refund rather than a replacement for obvious reasons.
