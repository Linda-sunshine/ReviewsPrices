review/summary: Queen for Onereview/text: The bed is supposed to be a Queen size, however with the raised sides you gravitate to the middle, making sleeping for 2 people uncomfortable. You are basically getting a Twin but with a Queen size footprint. The bed is going back and I'll have to spend the money on an Aero bed which actually gives you a full Queen size sleeping area. The reason I give it a 2 star rating was it is actually pretty comfortable for a singe person, but way too large to really use as a single.
