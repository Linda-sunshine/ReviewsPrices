review/summary: Wife Loves This Thingreview/text: She watches a lot of the Food Network / gets new recipe ideas from it, and now when they use one of those fancy choppers, she can follow suit and do what they do to complete the recipe. Sturdily built, and has all the features she needs (I can't speak to them individually, only that she's mentioned numerous times how happy she is with it). No problems at all as far as reliability, electrical, etc.
