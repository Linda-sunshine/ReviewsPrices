review/summary: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!review/text: I cannot say enough good things about this Dutch oven! I LOVE it! While I lived at home during college, I used my mother's very high-end Dutch oven all the time. I fell in love with the concept of the Dutch oven because it's so versatile. When my fianc&eacute; and I moved in together, I couldn't afford the pricey version, so I researched online for something more affordable. Again, I LOVE this Dutch oven! It arrived on time, and while there was a tiny chip in the enamel underneath one of the handles, it wouldn't affect the usage of the Dutch oven. It's so heavy, in a good way. The size is definitely big enough for almost any job. So far I've made bread, meatballs, pasta, sauce, casserole, and roasted chicken in it, and I've only had it a week! You can do almost everything in this one pot, and I highly recommend making it a part of your kitchen arsenal! I love mine so much, and I could not be more pleased with this purchase!
