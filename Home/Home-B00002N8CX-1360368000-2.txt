review/summary: Special needs vacuumreview/text: We have several high-end vacuum cleaners and brooms. We needed something light to vacuum high up and in the cars. Wall sconces, foot wells, etc. The housekeeper uses this Eureka for the hard-surface floors in our home and she thought it was OK for her uses so we bought one too. It seems a little light weight but then it didn't cost $400 and the bags are readily available on line.
