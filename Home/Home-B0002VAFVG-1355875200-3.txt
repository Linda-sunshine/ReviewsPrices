review/summary: Simplereview/text: I love this juicer it's so simple to use easy clean up easy put together the only thing that could be better is stuff like kale or smaller and lighter items I find it slings it up into the pulp part with out juicing so I put the big stuff in first then the kale on top so I can be pressing it so it doesn't just fly up... Anyway it's amazing I'm still in love
