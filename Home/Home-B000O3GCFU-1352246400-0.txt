review/summary: Disappointed with thermosreview/text: I purchased this thermos for my son who likes a hot lunch. Have had it for 1 month and the first three weeks it worked great. I put boiling water into the thermos to heat the inside for a minute and cooked either soup or spaghettio's and added it to the thermos. The lunch was hot everyday for 3 weeks but the last 7-9 days the contents are cold when opened at school. Nothing different was done in the preparation for the food. Any advice?Disappointed mom and son
