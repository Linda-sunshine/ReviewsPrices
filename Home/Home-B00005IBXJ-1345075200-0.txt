review/summary: Would be great if it worked!review/text: I have spent the last 20 minutes carefully placing the tray onto the drive motor, and for 20 minutes it has refused to turn on. The instructions say that once you put the tray on the motor it should start spinning, but it does no such thing.I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. I am following the instructions exactly, but nothing seems to work. I think I just wasted $60.
