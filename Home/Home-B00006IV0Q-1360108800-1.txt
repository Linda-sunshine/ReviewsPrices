review/summary: Best I've Ownedreview/text: Works perfectly and makes the best tasting and hot coffee. Takes just a bit longer than a drip coffee maker but the wait is worth the taste difference. I've owned two Faberware perculators. One Faberware failed to heat in three months and the other never could get the coffee over luke warm. I've had the Presto for a bit over and month and it is performing as it should. I would recommend this product to friends.
