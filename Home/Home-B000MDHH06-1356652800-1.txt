review/summary: I'd only pay $20 for this machine...it sucks!review/text: Had to return this item because1. it gets my kitchen counter so messy. Kale, for example, would get everywhere and you can even see little kale pieces flying inside the tube.2. It's really hard to clean. I used to put a plastic bag around the container but you can't do it with this. as the result, my sink was clogged and ended up hiring a plumber. (cost me $50)3. OH MY GOODNESS! ignore 1 and 2 real quick. Would you like to see chunks of celery and apple? you will with this machine.Personally, I think this machine is a piece of crap. At first I thought my juicer was a defect but after reading all of the other ones here, nope, it is the way it is!I ended up going to bed bath&beyond; and purchased a higher level juicer (Ikon by Breville) and it works great so far. Only got it for $150+ with the 20% coupon for signing up on their mailing list. If you must get this cheaper model, I suggest you to go to bed bath as well. I purchased it last week here on Amazon and it was around $70ish...what the heck, did they really increased the price to $99 in a week? wow amazon. I used to love you but I'm getting a little disappointed with your prices here.
