review/summary: Love it!review/text: Brews quickly and quietly...love the signal when finished. Keeps the coffee piping hot. Also love the signal that indicates it needs cleaning. The pot doesn't drip AT ALL when pouring into the reservoir or into our cups. At 14 1/4 inches high it fits under our cabinets...some other coffee makers were too tall.
