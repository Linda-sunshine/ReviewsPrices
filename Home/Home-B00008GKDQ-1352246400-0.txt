review/summary: Pretty badass..review/text: I really like this thing. I can't compare it to other cast-iron cookware, because this is my first, but it's cool. The main thing about cooking with this, is cleaning and maintaining it. Cleaning this thing is 4/5 of the battle. The other 1/5 is heating it up without smoking the oil. I cook 2 bags of chicken breasts at a time. Works great. Steaks too.
