review/summary: HORRIBLE hissing sound, difficult to pushreview/text: Well, like I expected, this vacuum far surpassed my current, decade old vacuum in terms of cleanliness, but at a DEAFENING price. About half a second after I turned it on, there was a HORRIBLE hissing sound, which persisted the entire time I vacuumed at slightly different pitches or volumes (makes me wonder if something got stuck in there during manufacturing?). I have a small 1 bedroom apartment and I thought the noise wasn't that bad, and I could stand it. But literally 10 minutes with the darn thing on and my ears are ringing! Second, this tiny vacuum is surprisingly difficult to push (on or off). I like how compact it is, and I like that the handle hides away inside. I have an old Dirt Devil, and I thought THAT one was small, this is even tinier (which I love because I have such a small place). Third, there's no lever to release the angle. You just step on the front and bend it back (potential problem over time if the joint loosens up). For the price, I'm not surprised that this vacuum comes with a few horrible attributes that are quite difficult to overlook. I will try to exchange it one time to see if I just got a bad unit with the awful hissing. I could deal with the difficulty to push it since I have such a small place and the price was good, but sadly I cannot overlook the hissing!
