review/summary: Very disappointingreview/text: I ordered this to replace a 25 plus year old Cuisinart and was immediately aware of the difference in quality between the older and newer versions and not in a positive way. One issue involved the bowl of the processor which had a flaw in the bowl. After an initial email correspondence with Amazon, I spoke with an Amazon representative and she made a three way call to Cusinart to discuss the issue. Cusinart's response was they would send me another bowl for $10.00. I explained this processor was just out of the box and why on earth would they charge me to replace a flawed item. Cusinart did not alter their position and at that point the Amazon representative said she would handle the issue. Amazon's representative was terrific and handled the issue with courtesy and amazing speed. Within 16 hours she had UPS pickup the flawed item and within 10 days Amazon had completely refunded my money. Cusinart has lost a customer and Amazon gets very high marks for the way they handled this situation.
