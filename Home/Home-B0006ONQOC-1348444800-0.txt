review/summary: It's just not what I expectedreview/text: I confess my review is predicated mostly on expectations. Here's what I thought this device did: I take my ice cream ingredients, drop it into the ice-cream-o-matic and turn it on and out pops ice cream. I thought this device would stir the ingredients (it doesn't, you need a blender or hand-mixer to blend the ingredients). I thought it took the ingredients from room temperature to frosty cold ice cream (it doesn't, you have to make the freezer bowl cold first by putting it in your freezer for 6 to 22 hours first -- so much for trying it out of the box.) Unfortunately what this toy is, is a glorified ice cream mixer. Much of my expectations were based on the fact that the appliance is called a "maker". Live and learn I guess.
