review/summary: great, i use them for freezing wheatgrassreview/text: i got sick of juicing my wheatgrass every morning so i juiced a butt-load and freeze it in these 10z trays. drop a cube in my water each morning and im good to go. also do this with other juices (beets, carrots) and it's quite nice.
