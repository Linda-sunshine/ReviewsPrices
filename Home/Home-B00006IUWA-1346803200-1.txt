review/summary: Great Popperreview/text: I love this popper. It pops almost all of the popcorn, very few unpopped kernals. The only drawback is that it has to be plugged in and unplugged to start and stop, there is no off/on switch. I always unplug my appliances when not using anyway so it isn't a big deal, just something new to get used to.Did I mention I love this popper?
