review/summary: Perfect for Wood Floorsreview/text: I have a sunroom with a wood floor and a dog that shed a lot. German Shepards shed only once a year, but it lasts for 365 days. The Hoover picks up well, it has enough suction power and capacity to pick up all the dog hairs thoroughly. I'm very happy with it.
