review/summary: Boxed by a blind 2 year oldreview/text: Ordered 4 of these chairs in 3 separate orders. All came looking like they fell out of the UPS truck on the highway. Boxes contain little packing material and all the parts are basically just thrown into the box. Two boxes were delivered ripped open.Despite the poor packing, and minor scuffs, the chairs were a snap to assemble - maybe 10 minutes per chair. They are good looking, adjust well and comfortable. Chairs adjust for height, seat angle and the entire back angle is adjustable. Arm rests also are easily adjusted. Had the chairs for about a month and everyone is happy with the purchase.
