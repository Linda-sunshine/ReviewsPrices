review/summary: Quick and easy!!review/text: This makes juicing easy! It takes me about ten minutes to chop my vegis and fruit, juice them and clean up. You do need to chop your vegis and fruit small enough to fit in the shoot, but not a problem. I have juiced Kale, spinach, carrots, apples and oranges. It gets all the juice out. Clean up is a cinch as there is very minimal parts to clean. Literally takes my two minutes to take apart, rinse and wash. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to juice. i had heard horror stories about the time it takes so I was dreading starting. I don't know about other juicers, but this one makes it so easy.
