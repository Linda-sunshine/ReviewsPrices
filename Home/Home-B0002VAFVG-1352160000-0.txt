review/summary: Review from an ameutuer juicer...review/text: I'm not gonna lie to you, I've only used the darn thing once. With that said, I'm not a veteran pro juicaholic. So this review is gonna be straight to the cricket. I had a jack o lane juicer and it lasted about 6 ,months. Not good enough no was sold it by the tv and I was stupid and bought it. And if that wasn't stupid enough I went and bought another one off ebay. I got tired of these little jack o layers failing. So I launched it out front in the garbage pile one Tuesday morning before the trash pickers came. What a waste of money. With only myself to blame I had to really sit down with myself and have a chat. Was I to buy another 50 dollar juicer and take my chances or drop almost $300 bones on a juicer that is suppose to save the world and make me apple juice. So I decided to spend my whole pay check on a stainless juicer (the one I'm reviewing)I had pretty high expectations for dumping my money into this little chopper. It came in today. I plugged it in and went to town. I loved that it is so much more clean using this one than the jack o lane juicers. This one had so much power. It was a lovely experience to juice. Now I can't wait to drop more money on more veggies and fruits to slice and dice them with this power hog. Well worth the fortune I spent. I'm very happy. Compared to the jack o lane juicers this one is way better and I could have saved money if I bought this one up front. I will keep you updated how this little bugger performs.
