review/summary: Great Humidifierreview/text: I bought the Owl Humidifier for my child's nursery a couple of weeks ago, and I am very happy with it. It is very easy to maintain and very quiet . It is smaller than previous humidifiers that I have had (currently sitting comfortably on a small 13 X 13 inch table) and very attractive. It performs very well keeping the nursery at a comfortable humidity level. I am very happy with this purchasePros:Very quietGreat performanceAttractiveSmall profileGreat priceEasy to maintainCon:Fair amount of condensation when you take off the top
