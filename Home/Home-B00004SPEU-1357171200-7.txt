review/summary: Good bang for your buck!review/text: Grinds coffee in a quick, thorough fashion. Only thing to note, small amount of coffee tends to stick to the sides after grinding so you may want to use some kind of a brush to loosen it up to get 100% out of the grinder. I don't believe this is a product flaw, just something to note. When flushed with water, coffee easily washes out. Great product, great price, would recommend to friends.
