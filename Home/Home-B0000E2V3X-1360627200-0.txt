review/summary: Better than a stonereview/text: This is much better than a stone. I was using a stone for the last several years - or rather STONES because I broke 2. It's disgusting to break a stone so that's why I took a chance on iron. I had made pan pizza in an iron skillet and it worked good, so I thought I'd give it a try.I wish they'd make one that was flat- without a lip. It would be easier getting it on and off a peel if it didn't have the lip.But as far as a crisp crust, and non-stick surface, it's great.It is very heavy though. I'm scared to put it on my glass top stove. Also, I dropped it once washing it. OUCH. It is VERY heavy. I'm lucky I didn't break my foot.
