review/summary: What could be wrong with a kettle?review/text: So, you are probably thinking... It is a kettle. What could be wrong with it.1. The light is so small that I have a hard time knowing if the kettle is on or off. Firs thing in the morning without my coffee is not that time I want to be x2 checking my appliances. If you look at the picture the red light is a tiny spec near the white branding.2. More importantly, it does not always shut off by itself. The last thing you want is a fire in your house--especially in the morning.3. BE WARY - Amazon will only let you return within 30 days.....
