review/summary: Perfectly popped popcornreview/text: It's great! Healthy, organic popcorn There were less than 10 kernels that didn't pop. It pops quickly and perfectly - nothing is burned. Do use a big bowl to catch the popcorn. The kid and I had a great laugh at the popcorn avalanche that resulted from me underestimating the amount of popcorn that it would take to [over] fill our popcorn bowl!
