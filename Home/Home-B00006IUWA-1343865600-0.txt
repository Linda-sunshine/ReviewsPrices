review/summary: Quit working after one usereview/text: I will admit, the batch of popcorn I made the very first time I used this popper was excellent... light and fluffy popcorn, very few unpopped kernels. However, the second time I tried to use it, it only made a strange humming sound, would not blow any air, and started to smell like burning plastic. I quickly unplugged it, let it cool down, and threw it in the trash. I knew it was inexpensive when I bought it, but I didn't think it was CHEAP. Now I know better. Very disappointed.
