review/summary: Great for Damp bedroomsreview/text: I purchased this dehumidifier based on other ratings and found it to be exactly as described. This is very petite which is a nice way of saying small but it really does the job! My son's room (size 11x12) has two windows that get a lot of condensation and it always felt damp. We used the Eva-dry and within a couple of days the room felt better, my son's cough went away and the motor is quiet enough that now he uses it for white noise to help him fall asleep.
