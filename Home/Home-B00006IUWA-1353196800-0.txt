review/summary: Best popper ever!review/text: We tried 4 different hot air poppers, and returned them for various reasons, unpopped kernels, fireworks of popcorn all over our kitchen (our dogs wanted to keep that one) but then ordered this Presto Poplite popper. It works different than the others, no circular fan, this one blows straight up, so the corn doesn't end up in the bowl till its perfect! Buy this one, you won't regret it.
