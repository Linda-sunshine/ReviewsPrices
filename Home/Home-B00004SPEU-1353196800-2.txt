review/summary: Works great!review/text: Put the beans in, put the top on, push the button. It's that simple!The only complaint i'd have is there is no real good way to clean the grinding bowl, as it is attached to the entire unit. I used to have one that had a removable bowl for cleaning and it was quite convenient.
