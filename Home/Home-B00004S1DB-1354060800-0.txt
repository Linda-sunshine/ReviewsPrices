review/summary: Great Value, great coffeereview/text: I have been looking for a french press pot for a while, and was daunted by the glass caraf reviews (being fragile and expensive to replace). I am the only one in my household who drinks coffee so this size is perfect. It is durable and easy to clean, the filter is universal so even if you don't order it directly from Nissan Thermos you can get the filter elsewhere. The coffee is fabulous as it should be in a french press pot and the price was right. Another reviewer complained that it did not really hold the coffee at a decent hot temp for very long due to the top not being thermal. I agree with that reviewer, but also would note that if coffee is held at hot temp for very long it tends to become bitter. I use a large tea cozy to help keep it piping hot for more than 2 hours and I make certain to turn the lid so the spout is not open. So I would not downgrade it for the heat retention issue. The pot actually does make 32 oz. of coffee, which is 3 large mugs for me ... all my body can handle of stout coffee. I would recommend this pot to anyone. Note: If you have access to boiling water where you work, it is a perfect size and beats Kurig and other trendy single cup coffee makers. Load it with fresh ground Starbucks for best results. Make your own brownie points by sharing.
