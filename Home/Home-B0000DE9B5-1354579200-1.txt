review/summary: Better than plasticreview/text: I got this to replace my old plastic pitcher. I am happy I did. The handle is good for my petite hands. The lid seals tight. I have no problem opening it. It is a bit heavy, especially when full. And the pour spout could be more defined. It dribbles a bit down the front when poured. But I like it overall.
