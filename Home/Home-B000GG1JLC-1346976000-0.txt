review/summary: Perfect, compact, exactly what I need!review/text: So. I bought this and a few other products more expensive than this to see what works best to hold all my ties. I have 19 ties, which this holds with ease and compared to the other products I bought, is the best product to have.First off, I will start with the construction of the item. It is plastic, yes, and will break if an enormous amount of pressure is put on it, but needless to say, its only designed for holding ties, which it does very well with. It snaps together quickly and effortlessly, to make a complete product. For 4 bucks, or whatever it is, it's perfect.Second. As far as holding ties, it works and does what it's supposed to do. No, it is not all that easy to get ties on there sometimes. Yes, I do have to pull it off the rack sometimes to put the ties on. Is that really that big of a deal? In my opinion, no. Does it spin and look nice and organized though? YES! Like I've said, it does what it's supposed to do.Side note: Some people have this thing against leaving creases in their ties or whatever because they hang like this for a while over the little plastic piece. Okay, yes, this may be an issue. However, I have ties on there that have no creases when I'm wearing them and they have been on the rack for weeks/months. So either I have super special ties, or I'm missing something, but everything is good to go.Yeah, the item is an add-on item on amazon, but for three bucks, give it a go. I have a metal rack above my hanger rack, and I can move the tie rack around frequently because it does not interfere with the things on top or with things below. So that's a plus too.Hope this helps. Good luck!
