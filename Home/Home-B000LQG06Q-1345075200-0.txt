review/summary: Newlyweds saved!!review/text: I got married 6 weeks ago, and haven't slept well since. Because of our specific situation we opted to start with a queen size double high air mattress. It's been fine, and it's firm. My husband sleeps fine, but I can not relax on it. I sleep mostly on my side and ended up sinking towards him all night, leaving me crunched and in pain. Visited the Chiropractor yesterday and was feeling great, woke up this morning not so great. I ordered this mattress topper Sunday night, and it came today, Thursday. I just barely took it out of the unusually and impressively small box, and made the bed. Not 30 minutes later, I am lying flat on my back, super relaxed, and contemplating a rare afternoon nap. I am so grateful I thought to look on Amazon, and that all the reviews for this specific foam topper, were so great. I highly recommend it, and wish you a great nights sleep!
