review/summary: YOU WON'T REGRET BUYING ITreview/text: This was a replacement for my original Keurig which &#34;died&#34;. I love the smaller size which is great for my small counter. I live alone so being able to brew one cup at a time is less wasteful than brewing a whole pot. The Keurig lets me indulge in different flavors of coffee. It is not noisy. I would recommend it to everyone who loves coffee and convenience in brewing it.
