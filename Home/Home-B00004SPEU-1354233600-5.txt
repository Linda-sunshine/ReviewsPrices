review/summary: It works, It's cheap, It looks goodreview/text: If you're looking for a simple grinder that is no-hassle, simple, elegant, durable, and easy to clean, get this one. I use it to grind flax seed, which it does flawlessly every time. It has produced wonderful ground herbs, coffee, and seasoning salts as well.
