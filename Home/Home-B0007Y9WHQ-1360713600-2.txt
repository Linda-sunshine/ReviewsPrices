review/summary: Don't buy it if you expect it to work.review/text: Used it four times and it does not make spiral pototos as it is supposed to.The center piece slid out the other day and fell on the floor and the handle that you use to move it forward during the cutting process broke off, now I have to push on it where ever I can to move it forward.
