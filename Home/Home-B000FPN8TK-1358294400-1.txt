review/summary: This is a MUST for loose leaf tea drinkers!!review/text: I have one of these and bought two for friends.This product should win an award. I have had it for over a year now, it still works beautifully.Steeps and drains the tea leaves perfectly every time. It really is ingenious! And so easy to clean and use.I also have the Adagio Teas Utilitea kettle that is also fantastic. It has a color coated dial to heat the water, depending on what kind of tea you are steeping. (Different teas steep at different temperatures and yes it makes a difference!)It's not precise but close enough, and I love it. Heats up amazingly fast.I am very happy with both of these products. A small price to pay for tranquiliTEA!
