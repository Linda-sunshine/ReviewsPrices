review/summary: Good valuereview/text: This self propelled vacuum was a great buy. It doesn't have bells and whistles, but it's easy to use and has good suction for all flooring (from hardwood to high profile carpet). The bags are relatively easy to change (emphasis on relative -- since when are vacuum bags ever easy to change?). We've had two broken belts, not abnormal for our amount and time of use. Replacement was pretty straight forward but requires screwdriver and scissors (to cut away all the long hair that gets wrapped around the axel/brush). It's not pleasant, but that's because of my long locks that shed like crazy, not due to the vacuum's operation.In general, I would recommend this product for its ease of use, functionality and durability. It was definitely worth the price as it cleans better than some of the higher end products.
