review/summary: Still works great after three yearsreview/text: Every time I use this vacuum I congratulate myself on having purchased it. My problem is dog hair and my little yellow Eureka is a power sucker. In fact, its sucking power is better than my upright! It's perfect for stairs and area rugs; I even vacuum my laminate and hardwood floors with it. I can't say enough about this Eureka. After three years it's still as good as new, but if it does break down, I'll buy another.
