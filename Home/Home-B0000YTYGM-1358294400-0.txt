review/summary: Overflowsreview/text: This coffemaker would be the best on the planet, except for as others have written about once every 2-3 weeks it will inexplicably overflow all over the kitchen counters and floor. I grind the beans the same, have the lid lined up, I have no idea why this happens, but it is a mess. It pretty much ruined the grout in our kitchen floor. Do not buy it.
