review/summary: Nice Little Filtersreview/text: We have lived in Edison, NJ, for over 20 years, and the water out of tap tastes horrible! Having moved from the suburbs of NYC, where the tap water is excellent to drink, it was a shock to think we could not drink the tap water. For years I hemmed and hawed over purchasing a water purification device, I thought no way could anything make my tap water drinkable. I finally decided to give Pur a try...surprise, these little baby's, and the large canister system I recently purchased, have the NJ tap water tasting just as good as spring water, no bull! Excellent little filters. Pur Rocks!!!!
