review/summary: So easy, great tea!review/text: Really convenient to use, easy to clean. No fiddling with cutesy, too-small strainer, dunker devices. Just spoon in the dry tea, add hot water, I stir it a bit and watch the color for the strength you prefer. Put the teapot onto your cup and there you are. Easy to make everyone their own flavor of tea in just a few seconds. No need to make everyone a whole pot. I've always hated those filter spoons or fussy little things on chains. This is perfect every time.I just took it on a trip and had hot tea every night. Brought cups from home, my Ingenuitea and some loose tea. Easy. Already given one as a gift.
