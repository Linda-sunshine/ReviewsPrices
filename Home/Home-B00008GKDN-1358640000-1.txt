review/summary: Griddlereview/text: Lodge continues to put out excellent products. This griddle heats evenly without hotspots. Great for sandwiches or pancakes. Bacon has been fixed in mine but grease has to be watched carefully to keep it from overflowing. I would recommend this griddle to anyone who wants to have a great way to fix great food.
