review/summary: It could be betterreview/text: Well, this was the cheapest Brita model available so I can't really complain! It still does the job. I just don't like how there is no lid for the pouring part of the pitcher. I put a wrap over it so I won't feel like there are dusts or other particles in the pitcher. I have the Marella pitcher with the Maxtra cartridge back home- I think the water tastes better with the Maxtra cartridge.
