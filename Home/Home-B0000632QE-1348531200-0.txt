review/summary: AWESOME!!review/text: Couldn't expect anything less from Germany. Right out of the box started using it and it cut so easily (on everything) that I was checking to see if anything was even being cut. The blades are seriously sharp and anyone who complains about that obviously does not know what they are buying (surprised knives do not come with a "warning sharp blade" warning). Did nick myself after barely touching the blade but that was my own fault and I will not blame it on a sharp blade like the trend seems to be for those who were just clumsy with their own thumb like myself. Would recommend it many times over.It really does not look like much and even using it, it does not look that great. Looks can be very deceiving though.
