review/summary: Makes a quick and healthy snackreview/text: Pops the kernels quickly using only hot air. You can melt butter at the same time in the measuring cup that sits on top of the chute but I prefer to melt the butter separately in the microwave. That way it is very easy to clean after use. There are a lot less un-popped kernels than microwave popcorn bags. This popper really pumps out a lot of very hot air so use care when using it. There is no on/off switch so you need to leave it unplugged when not in use.
