review/summary: Great Shower Caddy that Meets My Needsreview/text: I was looking for a "perfect" shower caddy for my tiny (6 square feet) shower floor. I tried the over-the-shower caddy before made a purchase on amazon. But it took too much space and I couldn't grab things easily from it. I decided to try this 3M product, since it will save space. It works perfect so far.- save space- very easy to apply, just wait for 12 hours after applying- holds up a lot, I have 4 big bottles and some little ones- with the strips came with it, you can reuse it in a different location
