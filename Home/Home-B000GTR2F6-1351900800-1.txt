review/summary: Keurig B70's can't be trusted - don't buy!review/text: I have purchase 3 different Keurig machines over the last 2 years. In every case they fail to stop brewing with-in 1 year of purchase. The descaling procedure works but only lasts for 6-8 brews!I then tried to Cuisinart and returned it after 1st use as the flow was so bad that I could have brewed a pot faster. So I have a lot of K-cups and no good way to brew them!Would really like something that works. If you haven't bought a k-cup machine I WOULD NOT. Its a great idea but so far the quality of their machines is more than terrible.
