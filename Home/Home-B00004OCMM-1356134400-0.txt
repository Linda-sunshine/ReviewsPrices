review/summary: Forget the Cheap Openers!review/text: &#34;You get what you pay for&#34; is never more applicable than with can openers. Those cheapo types will give you a great opener for about 5 times of use, then it seems you can do better with a butter knife. This guy--after almost a year of (lots of) use--just takes a licking and keeps on ticking (er, cutting). All sized cans are no match to this ergonomically designed machine. Better than most electric openers as well.
