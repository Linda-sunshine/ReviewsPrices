review/summary: Best purchase I've made in a long time!review/text: My grandma always said that a percolator made the best coffee and wow, was she ever right. I bought this pot after first trying a coffee press. The coffee press made good coffee but when I tasted it, I realized what I was really wanted was the flavor of percolated coffee. I shopped around and was thinking of buying an electric percolator when I came across the Farberware Yosemite Percolator. I liked that it was inexpensive, stainless steel, easy to clean and doesn't require any electricity or counter space.I'm now back buying a second percolator for my parents cottage. Right now I'm taking mine back and forth on the weekends because I can't live without it. Try it, you won't regret it!
