review/summary: Excellent productreview/text: good filters, they last a long time. You will see some of the black sand float at the top the first few fills of the pitcher. This is normal. No sand comes out the bottom, so it is okay. Filter removed copper and lead traces from our water, as well as a film of unknown substance that would appear at the top of the glass if I let water sit out for 30 minutes. Does not change the pH though.
