review/summary: Makes good bread but NOT quiet!review/text: This is the 2nd bread machine I've owned. Have a Black & Decker bought in 1999 that's still going strong. Makes good bread but the crusts are always very uneven. With a second house, I wanted another bread machine so after reading the reviews of this Panasonic, I bought it. Only baked 2 loaves & they turned out perfectly with great consistency & a nice crust so very happy with the final products. I was a little concerned about having only 1 paddle but it's large & with the size of the pan, I can understand why only 1 paddle is used/needed. The loaves come out very easily from the pan without any oil/spray. My only complaint is the NOISE it makes! Others have said it's very quiet but the first time I used it, I put it on delayed start. The sounds of the bread (100% whole wheat) being whacked around & kneaded by the paddle woke us up in the wee morning hours. Our kitchen & main living area are open concept & our bedroom is just off this area so we were kept awake by the noise of the machine. I felt so sorry for my dogs who were crated close to the kitchen & had to endure the noise even more than we did!! For its second use (last nite), we moved the bread machine to another bedroom & shut the door in the hope that we wouldn't be bothered by it; didn't hear it this time. So bottom line (for me) is - makes very good loaves but it's NOISY!
