review/summary: The only way to goreview/text: If you spend $12 to $15 for a 340 gram package of coffee like I do, then it makes a lot of sense to buy a dependable burr grinder like this one.But...grinding really loads up the static electricity in the unit. If you remove the hopper right after grinding, the fine grinds seem to blow out and stick all over the front of the unit. (a small nuisance)Maybe there's no fix for this.??
