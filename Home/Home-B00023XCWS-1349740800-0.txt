review/summary: cute, wee, annoying kettlereview/text: tiny! but great for a single household. It heats up fast and is the quietest kettle I've ever used. After it turns off, the heated water stays warm for a LONG time, too. The cord is removable so you can unplug it from the base of the unit, which makes it easier to fill up at the faucet. The only annoying thing is plugging the cord back into the base... it slips out every time and you must jam the bugger in there out of sheer frustration for a connection to take. You can place the kettle on your table to top up your mug without having to return to the kitchen or have a dangling cord hanging off the back. It also doubles as a weapon: if an intruder should burst into your conservatory while you're studying and drinking coffee, you could DASH hot water in his/her face. lovely.
