review/summary: Cuisinart Multiclad Proreview/text: I had to get rid of a lot o my favorite cookware when I got my new induction cooktop, but this set more than made up the difference. I had a 5 quart saut&eacute;pan I am used to that I may have to order separately as the MCP 12 only comes with a 3.5 quart.
