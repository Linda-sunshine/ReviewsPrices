review/summary: Love this thermos !!review/text: I use this to take to work. I make iced tea in it. I fill it full of ice and pour the cooled tea over it. One day I accidently left it at work - the next day I came in IT STILL HAD ICE inside it ! I love how it keeps the mouthpiece clean and protected ( I'm a bit of a germophobe ). It snaps closed easily and opens easily with a push of a button. I was hoping to buy another one in a fun color, but there are only two colors availble.
