review/summary: Excellent and Effective Product! I Own One of These EDV-1100 Models and Two of Its Larger Sibling, the EDV-2200review/text: I own one of these Eva-Dry EDV-1100 Peltier effect (aka thermoelectric) dehumidifiers, and it is now in its 17 month of full-time service. I have purchased two of its larger siblings, the Eva-Dry EDV-2200 solid state Peltier dehumidifier, over the past 17 months as well, and now, about 17 months after having purchased the first EVD-1100, I can state that I am very satisfied with the performance of each of these devices. I own several portable wall-mounted digital humidity meters, aka hygrometers, and the readings on these humidity meters demonstate how effectively, and often very quickly, these Eva-Dry Peltier effect dehumidifiers drop the humidity levels in the air in a room, often to humidity levels in the 34% to 44% humidity range (this is in damp rainy weather, so this is quite a notable effect), and sometimes even lower than that.Certain rooms in our house get damp at many times of the year, and so I decided, about 18 months ago, to purchase a dehumidifier for each of these spaces. When reviewing available dehumidifiers, I quickly came to the conclusion that I did NOT wish to purchase an old-style mecahnical compressor-style dehumidifier, the type that uses a motor and a compressor, and I decided that rather, I wanted to purchase only a Peltier effect dehumidifier, since there are no moving parts in it other than the small 12VDC muffin fan that moves the air.Being an electronics engineer, I was also aware that Peltier effect devices (the active component that removes the moisture from the air), which are solid-state and contain no moving parts, can easily last for anywhere from 10 to 30 years, or longer, trouble-free.When I reviewed the various brands of Peltier effect dehumidifiers that were available, I realized that many of the brands and models consistently earned very poor online reviews, for both performance and reliability, and this led me rather quickly to the realization that the Eva-Dry brand Peltier effect dehumidifiers, both the small EDV-1100 and the mid-sized EDV-2200, were the ones that I wanted. I first purchased one each of the Eva-Dry EDV-1100 and the EDV-2200 models, and then, in less than 12 months time, I purchased a second EDV-2200 model.I use all three of the Eva-Dry Peltier effect dehumidifiers 24 hours per day, 365 days of the year, and two of them, the two oldest ones, have been in full-time sevice for about 17 months now, and I am very satisfied with their performance.In closing, I want to share with you a very important caveat that it appears that a lot of purchasers of these devices have willfully and blatantly ignored. I have seen complaints in online reviews from some customers who had purchased the EDV-1100 (or its larger sibling, the EDV-2200) to the effect that these dehumidifiers did not pull sufficient moisture out of the air in the room in which the dehumidifier had been installed.A subsequent close and careful reading of many of these somewhat-negative reviews showed me that the vast majority of the people who were complaining about the "slow" rate at which the Eva-Dry EDV-1100 and EDV-2200 Peltier effect dehumidifiers were removing humidity from the air were people who were valiantly, but often vainly (no surprise there!) attempting to use the devices in rooms that were sized far larger than the manufacturer's stated effective treatment area for the Eva-Dry device that they had purchased.Therefore, I want to remind prospective purchasers of these devices that the vendor clearly states in their marketing material that the EDV-1100 is rated to effectively dehumidify a space of up to 1100 cubic feet in volume (that would be, for example, a 10 ft. by 11 ft. room if the room had a 10 foot ceiling height), and that the EDV-2200 is rated to effectively dehumidify a space of up to 2200 cubic feet in volume (that would be, for example, a room measuring about 22 feet by 10 feet, if the room had a 10 foot ceiling height).It seems that a large percentage of purchasers of these devices proceed to install their Eva-Dry dehumidifiers in rooms that were far larger than the rated air volume in cubic feet, and then some of these same purchasers end up complaining, in their reviews of the device, that the device did not pull enough moisture from the air in the room that they were attempting to treat.It is my studied opinion that if you use these Eva-Dry Peltier effect dehumidfiers in spaces/rooms that are consonant with the manufacturer's declared effective treatment area (that is, 1100 cu. ft. for the EDV-1100 and 2200 cu. ft. for the EDV-2200) they will perform quite satisfactorily in a wide variety of settings.
