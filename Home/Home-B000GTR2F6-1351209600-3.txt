review/summary: Suggestions for dealing with a cranky brewerreview/text: I own two Keurig Platinum brewers as I live in two homes, each for six months a year. Both machines became cranky after only several months of use, but after the one-year warranty was up. They would say "brewing" but nothing happened. Here's how I solved the problem: I unplug the Keurig after using. When I want more coffee, I plug it in and start it and it almost always works. Occasionally I've had to repeat the process. Also, when it is idle for several months, it refuses to work until I repeat the unplugging many times. Downside of this workaround is that you can't use the "auto on" or clock. But at least you don't have to throw the machine out!
