review/summary: So far, so good.review/text: Have had this product for about a week or so now and am enjoying cleaner & better tasting water than can be bought in a store. I have moderately odorous well water & this product has cleaned it up nicely.I almost didn't buy this because of the reviews about the lid not staying on. Here is the "Lid problem" in a nutshell. This unit has an upper level reservoir which holds the water until it can filter down through the included filter. However, if you try to pour out a glass of water before it has had a chance to fully filter the water in the reservoir down into the bottom chamber, the lid tends to come off because there is still water in the upper chamber, thereby forcing the lid off because it has nowhere else to go.The "Lid problem" is not an actual problem at all. What it amounts to is a "lack of common sense" problem on the users part.
