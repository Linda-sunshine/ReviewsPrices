review/summary: Superb masticating juicerreview/text: I used this juicer for a 10-day juice fast, and selected it after quite a lot of research.There are many excellent features to this well designed high quality juicer:* Combination of masticating/centrifugal processing maximizes juice extraction. The pulp output is quite dry: that's your first proof that your juicer is doing its job.* Large feed tube means less prep time* Powerful dual-speed motor adjusts for softer and harder vegetables and fruits. Juicing goes fast!* Very easy to assemble and disassemble* Easy to clean. Tip: always clean immediately after juicing, and use the included brush to clean the screen, so it doesn't get clogged.* Good size foam-separating carafe means you can make a batch of juice and store the remainder in the fridge for your next serving. Tip: don't store fresh juice more than a few hours; the point of juicing is to maximize nutrients.This is a large item, although it has a smaller footprint than many other juicers, so consider your storage requirements. Using a juicer like this can be part of your health regimen.
