review/summary: A little Heavy...but is definitely worth its price.review/text: This pan is a little heavy and it supposedly weighs 5 lbs...but with food added makes it seem like 10 lbs. However it cleans very easily..just rinse and scrub briefly with a metal brush or pad. It seemed to be already seasoned well..but i just added a bit of corn oil before cooking anything 1st time and wiped it over inside and stuck in oven ..and in 1 hour of sitting in oven at 400 degrees..it seems to not have ANY issues with sticking afterwardsThe food is great after cooking inside it and it is so easy to cook with. Just add the ingrediants and put a lid over it and set in oven and come back 1 hour later and it tastes as nice as a dinner at a high priced restaurant.Btw would recommend getting the lid that goes with this by Lodge too...but problem is it weighs as much as the pan..so look at another 5 lbs added to already 8-10 lbs of pan and food to lift out of oven. There is an extra handle on front to make it easier to lift with two hands also.
