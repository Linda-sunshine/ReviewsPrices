review/summary: You knead to buy this thing....review/text: I found out about this bread maker from an awesome granny who's had it for a few years more than I have. Her unit is still functional to this day. Mine has 4 years of weekly use. Despite the steel lining on the inside getting horribly tarnished and the ceramic support tab for the heating coil having cracked (and quick-fixed in ghetto fashion), this unit still pumps out loaf after loaf like it's no one's business. If your family hasn't given in to the gluten scare yet, you'll save a lot of dough with this thing. (bun...err... pun intended.)Pros:- Dump ingredients in. Press 3 buttons. Bread in 4 hours.- Lotta bread making options programmed into it.- Each loaf will run you circa 50 cents in ingredients, compared to the $2.50 or more that a lousy store bought loaf costs.- Delay timing lets you dump the ingredients in at night and wake up the next day with the loaf freshly done.Cons:- The heating coil support tab is liable to breaking, albeit still works with no fix, and the fix is as easy as wrapping a metal wire around the coil and broken tab.
