review/summary: Great little rice cookerreview/text: It cooks rice perfectly. One tip they don't point out in the directions: You measure the rice with the included cup, put the rice in the cooking bowl, THEN add the water to the line marked in the cooking bowl. It'll make mushy rice if you put the water in first!
