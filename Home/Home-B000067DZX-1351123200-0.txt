review/summary: Filters go bad in about a month everytime!review/text: Apparently the company changed the replacement filter as recently the filters stop working 2 weeks to a month now.Im not blowing money on this again!Seriously just get a aquasana countertop filter off amazon $100 you buy replacement filter every 6 monthes.ALso go to aquasana.com and they are currently having a 20% off sale. if you buy the counter filter and get the water for life its less than $90 but with shipping about $94
