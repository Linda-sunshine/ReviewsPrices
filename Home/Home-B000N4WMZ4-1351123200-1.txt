review/summary: WHITE INTERIOR STAINED FROM TOMATO SAUCEreview/text: I should start by saying that I love this cookware, I had a cast iron version before but replaced it with this because I didn't like the fact that there was always this residue from the oil always left in the pot even after it was cleaned with soap and hot water. (yes the oil from seasoning the cast iron).The issue I am having now is after browning some chicken and now cooking some pork in a marinara sauce for an hour at 350 the sauce and the browning of the chicken both left discoloration or staining as it were inside the cookware. If anyone has a solution to this that wont harm the cookware I would love to hear it. Is bleach the answer? Otherwise I love this cookware.
