review/summary: Love, love, love itreview/text: I make bread almost everyday. It's SO simple in this machine. It's practically fool proof. I do use the scale for measuring, but my friend got one as well and she has used the measuring cup method with good results. I used the rapid bake option most of the time and it's great to have fresh bread in 2 hours!
