review/summary: Doesn't perform as expectedreview/text: Thought it was maybe that I was just storing the container in my too cold trunk but this container didn't keep my food warm for even an hour when I had it in a pack up against my body. I did as they suggest and preheated the container but it still didn't perform. Oh, well! Keeps food sorta cold, I guess!
