review/summary: Love Ireview/text: My 20 year old grandson wanted one for Christmas, I knew nothing about them. Studied up and the only available at that time was the 40. He LOVES it!! Bragged so much I bought one and got the Special edition 60 and it is GREAT! Fresh brewed coffee, tea and hot chocolate on these chilly days in just the blink of an eye. So if you are looking to get one, both of these are great.
