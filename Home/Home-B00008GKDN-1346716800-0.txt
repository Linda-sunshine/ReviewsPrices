review/summary: WHAT THEY SELL AS CAST IRON NOW IS CRAPreview/text: I learned to cook on cast iron 50 years ago. What they sell now as cast iron is crap. Good cast iron cookware is surfaced on the inside bottom then seasoned so you have a flat surface. This junk they pass off now has all the grit of the sand mold left on the inside. You would need a heavy grinder to make this stuff useable.IT'S TOTALLY WORTHLESS JUNK.
