review/summary: Best Sheets I have owned so far.review/text: I have been looking for some decent sheets at a good price point for awhile. I can truthfully say that I have found these sheets to be the most comfortable and soft from all the other sheets I have used over the years. I didn't notice any issues with the stitching and the sheets fitted well. The sheets are slightly thicker than my previous sheets, and I havent had any issues with sweating during sleep. The pockets were deep enough for our bed, which did help the sheets from not forming lumps during the night. I would definitely buy another set for future use. if your on the fence about wether to get these or not, I would say that you should try them out.
