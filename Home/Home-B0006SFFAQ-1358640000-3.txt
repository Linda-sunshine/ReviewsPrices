review/summary: Very practicalreview/text: Excellent coffee machine. Has everything you need. auto on/off, 4 cup option, water purifier etc. What I like the most is that maintenance is very easy to keep up with. permanent gold tone filter makes life easy, but you can also put a regular paper filter in too. Plus a auto clean button. The overall appearance is very fancy too. I chose the black chrome which turned out very nice for my room giving a masculine feel.
