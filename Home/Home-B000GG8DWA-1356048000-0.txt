review/summary: Cold feet cure for surereview/text: Even in the summer time my feet are cold so this heater was an excellent choice to put under my computer desk. The top quartz bar comes on at the 400-watt setting and both bars come on at the 800-watt setting. Since it is my feet not my shins which are always cold I took the heater apart, reversed, and re-soldered some wires so now the lower bar closer to my feet comes on when the 400-watt setting is selected. I wish it had a built in timer incase it is left on unintentionally but it still gets five stars because it performs well for what it is designed to do. I would recommend the heater for the price and would recommend not modifying the device for your safety.
