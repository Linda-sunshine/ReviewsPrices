review/summary: Love it finally, after a few issues...review/text: I had been waiting for a good price on a pot like this and when I saw the price drop I finally went for it. When I recieved this 7.5qt dutch oven I fell in love, it was big and a beautiful dark ruby red. Unfortunately the inside lid was cracked and I feared it would continue to crack with time so I contacted amazon and they were great, shipped me a replacement right away. To my dissapointed when I recieved it the color was way off (a very bright light red) and also the inside enamel was not thick and you could see where some sections were sprayed?? So contacted them again and yet again the red was not right, it was an ugly bright red, ugh!! So I decided to give it another shot and I believe they shipped it directly from the manufacturer this time and finally I got the perfect color! I have used it a few times and just love it. It's so well made, easy to clean and honestly I don't see a good reason to purchase one for tripple the amount for a name brand, it's just silly. Lodge is a trusted name, they make quality items, I don't know what happened the first few times but I finally got the perfect dutch oven for a steal of a price, can't beat 60 bucks for this huge pot.
