review/summary: Perfect for a single cupreview/text: I've had my aeropress for over a year and its great. To start off with this unit you will be experimenting to find out what works best for you. For me I've been using Papa Nichols coffee a great quality coffee for the price, usually found in my local grocery store for well under the cost of the SB brand. My ratio is usually 2 scoops of beans (pre ground) with 2.5 on the water for the stir, after the press I'll top it off with 3-4 on the water. For the longest I was using the 1 to 1 ration of beans and water and that just seemed to be a little strong and I've noticed a little extra water helps the flavors come out more.
