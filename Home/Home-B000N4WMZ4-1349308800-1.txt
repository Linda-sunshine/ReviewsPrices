review/summary: Defective coatingreview/text: Ordered the 6 quart in red. The first one I received has chipped coating on the lid and scratches on the underside. Inside the pot there are several ball point pen size black spots. The black spots felt raised and looks like unsmoothed cast iron without enamel. I returned the first one without ever using it, and the replacement pot has the same problem, but slightly less spots. I return the second one and was willing to try my luck with a third pot. Amazon decided to not ship another replacement, because they can't be sure it won't have the same problem.Besides the defects I saw, the Dutch oven is nice and come with stainless steel nob.
