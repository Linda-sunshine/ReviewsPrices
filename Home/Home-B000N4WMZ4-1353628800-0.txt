review/summary: It's greatreview/text: It's great. It's heavy. My only complaint is that the interior scratches easily. However, it's probably my fault. I think I scraped it with a metal spatula. I still love this dutch oven. It beats paying double the price for Le Cruset. Plus, lodge is supposedly an american brand so why not support our own?
