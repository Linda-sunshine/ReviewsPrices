review/summary: excellent!review/text: i love that Lodge is USA company so thats why when i saw they had a cast iron Lodge on sale i jumped. i've made quite a few dishes in this pan stovetop only so far, and they've all turned out very well, the cleanup was SO much easier than other pots. very little sticking on the bottom even with risotto. 6 quart is the perfect size for a larger meal recipe- yet not so much for single cooks like me. the pot is heavy and very well made i got the blue one and i love it. no problems with my lid. i highly recommend this pot. i just dont have it in me to spend so much on a cooking pot from the Le people when i can support a USA company. i will be adding more Lodge cast iron to my collection when funds permit.
