review/summary: Small amounts of oil where you need themreview/text: Tired of dumping olive oil into a pan and coming out with slightly greasier results than I needed, I was convinced to buy one of these oil misters by my partner. We were tired of spending money on the sprayers you can purchase in the grocery store. The Misto delivers on all accounts, and I'm finding myself using it often to lightly oil pans for saut&eacute;ing vegetables and the like. Well worth it.
