review/summary: Very nice handheldreview/text: Easy to use, not too heavy, quiet, blends milkshakes well. Reasonable price, looks nice as well. I bought this for my husband because he likes to make milkshakes for our kids. The blender wasn't doing a great job and was also difficult to clean up. This is easy to use and clean up. It comes with a small measuring cup in which it fits but we purchased a separate (larger) one that mixes enough for the whole family at the same time.
