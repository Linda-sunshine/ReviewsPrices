review/summary: Coffee luxuryreview/text: We've had this for one year and have enjoyed using it. It's fast and brews the coffee to a perfect temperature. We use the refillable K-Cups to save money, and by purchasing 2 refillable K-Cups we always have a clean cup ready to use. I bought the same model for my daughter and she had issues with coffee grounds in her coffee. By using the internet she found an easy fix, a fix I hope the company has made in their factory. I would recommend this item with the stipulation that it's purchased with discretionary funds only... it's very expensive. I'm not a coffee purist and I can brew a pot of coffee and enjoy it the next day if I've refrigerated the carafe and then gently nuke the coffee cup. Once this item breaks I doubt I'll replace it.
