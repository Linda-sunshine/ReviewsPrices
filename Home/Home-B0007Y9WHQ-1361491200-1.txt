review/summary: Call me 'chef'review/text: Right out of the box, it works. What fun! Carrot curls were so long that I had to cut them so we could eat them.Restaurant cooks, take note, the standard of comparison to home cooking/presentation has just gone up a notch.Ok A few practicalities.-The curls are not as thin as the ones at the restaurants. Maybe I could vary the pressure to get thicker (push hard) or thinner (light pressure) curls, but the width is fixed by the blade. A restaurant grade device, however, would cost 3 to 8 times as much as this one.-I got a lot of single curls in addition to the long ones. Possibly with practice, e.g. better alignment of the carrot center and smoother more continuous cranking, I'd get more long curls and fewer singles.-If I forget to slide the carrot forward as soon as I put it in the spikes; it falls off. Shorter fatter veggies might stay on better.-I needed to reset the suction feet between carrots. Maybe I'll get better at this.-The unit tends to pick up color stains from the veggies.-I should have removed the spare blades, because I ended up having to wash them too.On balance though, for a reasonable price, this device produces plenty of long uniform curls. The core, bottom and &#34;mistakes&#34; are entirely edible, often in the same dish -- I just make sure to put a few of the fancy curls on top. And yes, everyone noticed.
