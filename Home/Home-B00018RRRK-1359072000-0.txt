review/summary: Good value for pricereview/text: A burr grinder is a must for consistently accurately ground coffee that isn't bitter or blah. I make drip coffee most of the time but also wanted to be able to vary the grind for French press or espresso. The easy-to-use dials for amount and grind on this machine are accurate. Machine is only a bit bigger on the counter than a &#34;spice-grinder&#34; type machine but not as overwhelming as a more elaborate burr grinder would be. Probably the only quibble would be the static dust in the cannister that needs to be brushed out frequently. Obviously, the burrs need to be brushed as well.
