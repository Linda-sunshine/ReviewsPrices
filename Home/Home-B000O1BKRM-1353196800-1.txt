review/summary: different, but betterreview/text: As has been repeatedly noted, these trays are different than old style trays. they are flexible, they are much more compact and produce larger cubes. Also, they can potentially pick up the nasty smells from your freezer, and the cubes must be individually pressed out from the bottom.For me the the space savings and larger cubes are the big selling points. Rather than having two plastic trays taking up lots of extra freezer space, along with an even larger ice cube bucket, i can keep these very compact trays stacked one on the other. I don't need the ice cube bucket as i push cubes out only as i need them, and since the cubes are larger, i often need only one, and it doesn't dilute my drink as much. (they sell a larger cube version too, if you really don't want to dilute your drink)I've taken care of the smell issue in two ways. one, i reduce the freezer smell with a box of baking soda, which works very well and probably keeps everything else from stinking up too, and two, i generally keep some saran wrap loosely draped on the top tray. i just pull it back or off when i need a couple of cubes, and then replace it. No trouble at all.So, yes, you need to deal with these differently, but personally, with the small adjustments i've made, I'd never go back to the old style of plastic tray.
