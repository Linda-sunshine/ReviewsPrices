review/summary: Not What We Thoughtreview/text: My wife and I bought this item because we thought we would have access to a toaster that toasted bread better than a toaster oven and also have access to an oven for other cooking needs. A single appliance that did the work of two and saved space. However we soon learned that the &#34;toaster&#34; does not toast as well as the oven, and more importantly, the &#34;oven&#34; is very small. There is vey little depth to the appliance. The literature indicates the oven can fit 2 slices of pizza on the rack. In my opinion, the slices would have to be very narrow, and even then you might have to place the slices on top of each other. But even that might not work if the end crusts were thick because there isn't much height from the rack to the bottom of the toaster section.Hamilton Beach offers a 4-slice toaster oven that probably offers greater depth but we will most likely purchase a traditional toaster oven soon.
