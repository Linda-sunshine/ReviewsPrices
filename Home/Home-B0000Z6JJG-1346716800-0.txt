review/summary: Great support in the Kitchen but squeaky and noisy!review/text: I bought this in early July and was very excited. But it's not that impressive once you start to use. It's been giving very irritating squeaky noise. Initially I thought it may go away once I use it for some time. It hasn't yet. Probably it's a defective one.Second complaint is that the vegetable stains don't go away like the other cheap plastic graters, especially carrot stain.It's not easy to get the grated veges from the cone where it's collected.Have to give a lot of pressure to great baby carrots or potatoes. I am not even sure whether you can actually shred cabbage.Since I waited for more than a month I am unable to return for a full refund in Amazon. When I contacted Presto, they mentioned as they can do a replacement or repair as it has 1 year warranty but I have to pay for the shipping which costs $20.Macy's had the similar Presto with two blades which is more than enough for a kitchen for just $25, and very easy 90 days return policy. I'll never buy electrical goods or electronics from Amazon again!
