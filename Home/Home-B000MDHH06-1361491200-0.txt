review/summary: Recommend to the Special Ed department at my job. Today's kids are overly medicated and drink the wrong kinds of beverage.review/text: In the recent years that i have worked with children with special needs i have witnessed that their cravings are to eat and drink &#34;junk&#34;. I accidently ordered the Breville juicer not knowing that i would receive it as a gift. My plans are to take my juicer to school/work and share by example that a fruit juice is way healthier than any soda,powerade,or gatorade out there. Throught time i should influence someone if not more to drink a healthier beverage.
