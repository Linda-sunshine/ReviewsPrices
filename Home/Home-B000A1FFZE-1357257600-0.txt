review/summary: Great small appliancereview/text: We were looking for a combo toaster oven and regular toaster when we found this online. It is inexpensive but sturdy and easy to clean. We do use the highest settings when using both the toaster and the oven but that has not been a problem. The oven is pretty small but we just cut things in half. Really happy with this applicance.
