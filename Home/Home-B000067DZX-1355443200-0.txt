review/summary: 60 days of clear...great tasting water...review/text: Ordering these in a 3 pack saves a bit of money and it really isn't that expensive. This is my first filter replacement. I have the 18cup pitcher for my fridge which allows me to get a drink of clear and great tasting water anytime. I noticed after about 2 months(60 days), the water didn't filter very fast and didn't taste as good. Ordered these, replaced the filter and it was like new again(I noticed when I shook the old filter after I took it out the rocks on the inside wouldn't move and it looked dirty on the inside). I drink alot of water and these 3 filters should last me about 6 months(180 days) which is a GREAT value.
