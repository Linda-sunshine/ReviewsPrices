review/summary: Used 3 times, now in the garbagereview/text: I bought this at Costco to replace my old coffee grinder which was several years old. The grind is far from consistent ranging from dust to course on the fine setting. The plastic hopper to collect the ground coffee also collects static. The results are coffee grounds falling off creating a mess when the hopper is removed. The sound is terrible. My german shepard presses himself into the floor and shakes when this is running. The food processor, and old coffee maker never bothered him.Garbage.
