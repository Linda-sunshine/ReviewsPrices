review/summary: Hate the shipping time but love the product!review/text: I really liked the product but HATED AMAZON SHIPPING, the reason for four stars. It took 7 days to travel 100 miles after Amazon said it was shipped. Another product, toner, took 3 days to travel the same 100 miles even after 2-day shipping was paid. This is only my second purchase with Amazon but when they email you the delivery date shouldn't it arrive on time? Amazon needs to crack the whip on their shipping department. I'm sure they have lost more sales then just me because of it. As to the coffee maker, I am going to buy spares because it brews the coffee any way I want it. B&D is not a good make because of moving to China but they got lucky with this item
