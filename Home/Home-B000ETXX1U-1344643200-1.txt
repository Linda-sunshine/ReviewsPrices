review/summary: Don't do itreview/text: I read the reviews and bought this one. It's horrible. There are two air intake pump knobs leading me to think there are two air air chambers independent of one another. I am only 5 foot tall and light. It sags something horrible inthe middle and loses air way too fast. Skip it. Look for something else. I'm sad. I really thought this as going to be the one after reading the great reviews seen here. :o(
