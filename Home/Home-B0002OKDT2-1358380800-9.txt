review/summary: Disappointment!review/text: I don't really hate it. The person for whom it was bought as a Xmas present was prepared to love it. But since it was sent to an Australian address with only a US plug, it will cost almost the price of the juicer to buy a local transformer before it can be used. Info re this small detail would have been helpful! Much disappointment at this poor sales practice.
