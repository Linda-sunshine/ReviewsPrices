review/summary: This really works!review/text: I love this thing--so simple but so effective. All my eggs have turned out perfect. Now I can make a hard boiled egg last minute, such as for a salad, when I need it. I set the microwave for 8 minutes, then the regular oven timer for 10, so I know when to actually take them out of the microwave. Sure beats waiting for water to boil, then stopping it at the right time. Why didn't someone think of this before?
