review/summary: Great productreview/text: We put this on our bed and it really helped. We need a new mattress and it was just enough to keep from needing to purchase one right now. My regular sheets fit it fine. I only have one set that really does not fit but all of my other sheet sets have been fine. My matress cover is a little small now with the topper but with the sheets fitting over it go it stays in place.
