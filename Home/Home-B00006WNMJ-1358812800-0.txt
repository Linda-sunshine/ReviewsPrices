review/summary: Short Lifetime of Filterreview/text: I used to swear by these filters, as they are well-rated on Consumer Reports and take the major chemicals out of our water. However, the past four or so filters I've most recently used have lasted anywhere from 3 days to a couple of weeks, before the water flow turns into a mere dribble.In calling Culligan tech support, they said it's not defective if water passed through originally. And that the average lifetime of two months varies with consumption and locale. Really Culligan, is this the best you can do?
