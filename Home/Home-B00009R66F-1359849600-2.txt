review/summary: Easy to Usereview/text: This is a pretty basic cleaner, but works well. Two cautions: Need to follow the directions for assembly carefully. Need to make one pass with soap, then make sure you go over the carpet using plain water. If you do it twice, then you'll make sure all the soap residue is out. Does a great job.
