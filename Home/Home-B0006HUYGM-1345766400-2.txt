review/summary: Inadequatereview/text: We got this primarily for use in our cars. Electrical access is close, so we did not need a battery or 12V unit, and we thought this would have more power. However, it does not draw as good as our cheap (and old) tiny wet/dry vacuum from Harbor Freight. It's a little clunky, and it takes me twice as long to effectively vacuum the cars as it did before.
