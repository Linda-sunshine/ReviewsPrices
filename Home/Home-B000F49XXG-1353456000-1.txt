review/summary: Not a good everyday machinereview/text: We bought this machine for the first time two years ago just before the holidays to replace my old, leaky Krups machine. It worked fine, provided you ground the coffee correctly, for about a year. I clean it according to the manual and still after a little less than a year there was a sudden death of the pump. We called customer support and they were VERY quick about sending us a replacement. We have now used that for about a year and the same thing happened. Sudden death of the pump. Now it just dribbles like the last one did. Besides that there has always been problems with both machines dribbling from the steamer. Also the height IS very low. If you want to do a double shot in a low cup you have to tip the cups in/out or remove the grate. It fits single shot cups okay, but I make double shot lattes and don't want to mess around with that much cleanup. I can recommend this machine for people who want it only for occasional use, but as a previous reviewer pointed out, it does take a long time to warm up and is not ideal for making coffee for multiple guests because of the long warm-up time. We're ready to break down and buy a pricey tank since we make espresso twice every morning and need a machine that can be used daily.
