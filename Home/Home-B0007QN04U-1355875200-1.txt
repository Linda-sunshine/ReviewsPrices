review/summary: Awesome!review/text: I don't know what to say. Everyone wants one, no one really needs it.We agreed to not put it on the wedding registry, then I received it for my birthday!I use it maybe 5 times a year (gluten-free, low-sugar, whole foods since right after the bday), but when I do I have a big $***-eating grin on my face.It is great for whipping a boatload of egg whites, not so great on just 3 or so as this machine is not meant for tiny jobs.I have the meat grinder attachement which works great for grinding boneless meat cut into thumb-sized chunks (such as for pet food or meatballs).I could totally live without this, but am so glad that I'm not.
