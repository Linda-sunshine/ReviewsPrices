review/summary: Small and powerfulreview/text: I like Eureka vacuums, mine are usually small and powerful. This one is a very good example of it.It is perfect for targeted clearning like your car or a small area where taking the big one would be a chore.It has a transparent tank so you can see quickly when it is full, there is no bag to replace and it does a great job.I do recommend it.
