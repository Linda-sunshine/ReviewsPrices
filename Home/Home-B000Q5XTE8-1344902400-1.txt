review/summary: WORST CHAIR EVER!!!!review/text: DO NOT BUY THIS CHAIR!!! During the 3rd month of use, the chair started sinking/dropping little by little, every couple of seconds until the chair was at it's lowest point. I'd reset it back to a higher position and it would be ok for a little while, then it would start to drop again ... I'm 150 lbs.
