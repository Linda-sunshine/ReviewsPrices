review/summary: Works well, little noisyreview/text: Boils water quickly and sits in the base very well. The only issues are that it is pretty loud at first and has developed some weird residue at the bottom. It's from the internal mechanism that boils the water, but looks a bit like mold. It freaked me out at first and I tried to clean it but couldn't.
