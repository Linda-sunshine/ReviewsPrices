review/summary: Great productreview/text: Ordered this item with the intention of using the noodles as a grain pasta alternative. I am so glad that I did. The children are still getting used to it, but I'm keeping with it. I've used this item about 4 times already. I typically use it for my zucchini and also have done sweet potatoes. It's simple...cut the ends off your veg (or fruit), center on the spike and corer, and twirl. The suction is very strong to the surface. It's easy to clean (I actually stick mine in the dishwasher) and the blades are extremely sharp. Great purchase.
