review/summary: nothing specialreview/text: it is a good pitcher to have around the house for water and drinksthe lid does the job but I found it annoying when I am pouring water out of this I have to remove the whole thing or it will be a mess.. I can not just loosen it a bit.I expected a bit better mechanism for the lid.. don't expect too much.. think of it as a lid that you have to remove before pouring.--------------------If you find my reviews helpful please mark it as so.. Thank you.
