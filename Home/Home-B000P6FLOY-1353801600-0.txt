review/summary: Great for homebrew mash tunsreview/text: I bought this thermometer primarily to be used to measure the temp inside my cooler used as a mash tun when making beer. It avoids having to lift the lid and losing heat while I check the mash temperature. The Polder has met my expectations well. The probe and cord are just long enough for my purposes without being too long or short. The temperature reading was accurate at freezing and boiling water check points. It also read accurately with the probe in my mouth at 98*F. I'm pretty happy with the purchase so far, as long as the probe holds up long term.
