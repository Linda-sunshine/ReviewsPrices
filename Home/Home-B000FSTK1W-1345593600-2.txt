review/summary: Actually stays where you put itreview/text: In my book, 3M is definitely keeping its good reputation for actually sticking to walls. Just moved into a new apartment and whether it's hooks, hangers or in this case a shelf, nothing has fallen off the wall during use.Installation is very easy and I like that they give you lots of extra sticky strips in case you screw it up. In my case, I used the extra sticky strips to fix the always-falling-off magnets stuck to the baack of my dry-erase board.I'm using this to hold 1 bottle of conditioner, a shower puff and some face cleanser with no problems.
