review/summary: We love our PopLitereview/text: I love popcorn, but, not the fake taste of microwaved popcorn. I've been popping our own in a brown paper bag for a long time, but, always either had a lot of unpopped kernels or I burnt it (actually I'm known for my burnt popcorn, usually with a kind of moan from my kids). I've been looking for an air popper for a long time, but, they're hard to come by in stores. This popper had so many great reviews, I finally decided to get this one. Since it has arrived, we have had many delicious bowls of popcorn, and my 9 and 13 yr old are eager to make it by themselves it's so easy. Never burnt and only a very few unpopped kernels.
