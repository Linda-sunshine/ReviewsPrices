review/summary: A Perfect Societyreview/text: I read this book in my reading class my 8th grade year and fell in love with it. I am always questioning why things are and how they work. This book starts by explaining the community and how everything is the same, in black and white, no emotions or feelings, and nothing to ever question. Jonas an 11 year old about to turn 12 is about to get his assignment of being the receiver. The Giver the most important character in the story is an older man with knowledge of the past. A past before the community and before everything was the same. When Jonas started to find out about all of these freedoms and choices people use to have he could no longer be happy in his community. He could not continue with the shallow lives that the people in the community were living. He made a decision to leave the community and with him he took a baby boy named Gabriel. Together they fled the community in hot pursuit. They traveled for a long period of time until he reached a house with bright lights all around it and music playing. It was winter when he made his escape and the only thing to keep him warm was the thought of a very hot day and the sun, and laughter. The book ended before telling us if he reached the house, or if he knocked on the door and humans came out to greet him. This was an excellent read, there was a lot of detail that painted a perfect picture in my mind and the way the author left the ending open for us the reader to interpret what actually happened to Jonas and the baby Gabriel.
