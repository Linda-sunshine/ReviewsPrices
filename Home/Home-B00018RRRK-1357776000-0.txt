review/summary: Whirrrrrrrrrrr (silence)review/text: Worked great for one week, then quit. Cuisinart very disappointing when it comes to coffee products. Also have had terrible luck with their grind and brew coffee pot. The bright spot in this is that when I contacted the company, they were quite willing to send me a new one. I'll let you know if the new one performs any better.
