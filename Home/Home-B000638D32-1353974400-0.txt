review/summary: Love this Knifereview/text: I feel like I should be on an infomercial with this knife for the sole fact that I feel like there is nothing I cant cut wiht this knife. Its the best knife I've ever owned. I have used this knife for chopping onions to cubing up frozen stew meat, even used it to slice bread once. Knife is very steardy, light, comfortable to hold and chop with.
