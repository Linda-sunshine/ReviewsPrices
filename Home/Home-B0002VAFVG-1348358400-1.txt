review/summary: Great juicer!review/text: I initially bought the Breville Variable Speed Juice Fountain and broke it the second day. While it was mostly my fault, I was shocked that you cant reset the juicer after the circuit breaker trips. The manual instructed me to let the motor cool, let the E disappear, and simply plug it in and it should be good to go, but it would never turn back on. So, I decided to splurge a little and upgrade to the big boy. It has been 7 days and I haven't broke it yet! The Elite shreds through anything and the pulp seems relatively dry (I have nothing to compare it to). With 3 average sized apples I get about 12 oz of juice which I was really surprised about. I don't know the typical yield of leafy greens but 3 leaves of Kale only gives you about an ounce of juice. I know an auger juicer works better for greens so this was to be expected. Clean-up is a little taxing but nothing to strenuous. The stainless steel is nice as I can just use the sink sprayer to navigate and all the gunk sprays right off. The hit to the wallet was a little hard to swallow but it seems to be worth it so far.
