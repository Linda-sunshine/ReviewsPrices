review/summary: It worked great!review/text: it is lightweight and pretty efficient. I had a sick dog to clean up after, and it performed well. I also used it on area rugs. Not too bad but they may have required pre treatment.the $$ spent was equal to a professional job, and now I have the machine to do it myself.
