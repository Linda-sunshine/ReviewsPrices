review/summary: Best juicer everreview/text: I read all the reviews and narrowed down choices to two machines. I bought this one at my local Macy's and then returned it two days later when I found this one online for $70 less! Easy to assemble and disassemble. Easy to use. Easy to clean. I had an older model Juiceman and this Breville is like driving a Lexus compared to that old machine. Some people have said that you can't do leafy greens in this juicer, but I have had no trouble at all. I always use kale or chard in my juices without any issue. Love it!
