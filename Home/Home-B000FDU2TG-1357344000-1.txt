review/summary: My First KitchenAid Product Disappointmentreview/text: This is the first time I've had to write a bad review of a KitchenAid product. When I got this back in 2006 I was disappointed to see that it was plastic, not glass and that the blade didn't separate from the container. But I used it and it was fine until this year when I noticed the plastic container had a crack in it at the base. So disappointed! So evidently the plastic can't hold up to the forces of blending. I've never misused it. I won't be buying another one of these. KitchenAid really needs to keep their focus on making quality products and not go down this road to save money.
