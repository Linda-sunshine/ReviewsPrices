review/summary: Le Creuset...you're paying for the fancy-schmancy namereview/text: This is a wonderful red enameled cast iron dutch oven! First off let me say this is my go to pot for pasta sauce, soups, oven braised lamb shanks, and to die for succulent-tender pot roast. My wife purchased this for me at a Myrtle Beach Lodge store on sale for 29.95 about 6 years ago. Mine seems heavier then the new ones that I picked up in the store and even better made. The lid is smooth with no circular ridges or blackish color along the rim. The knob is screwed on the top and is also made of red enameled cast iron so I have no oven temperature issues although I rarely need to go over 400 degrees. The inside of the lid is dimpled and allows the steam to drip back into the pot. At the time I could buy about 10 of these compared to what the current Le Creuset would cost. My lid has a couple of chips on the knob. I don't know how that happened because I never dropped it. If I had there would be a severe gash in my floor or worse yet my foot. I know one day my great-great-grandchildren will be cooking with this dutch oven. For the money, and the quality, this dutch oven is unbeatable.
