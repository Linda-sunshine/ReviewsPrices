review/summary: Great Productreview/text: We have a black lab that spends a good portion of the day inside. Our carpets get heavy use, mud, snow, hair, chews, etc. This carpet cleaner is great. It cleans very well with just HOT water and leaves the carpets virtually dry. It is amazing. The cord is a little short but I find that to be a very minor disadvantage.
