review/summary: Great coffee makerreview/text: I think this make the best cup of coffee I've ever made at home!! I'm not sure why. It may be the filter for the water, the way the water is sprinkled over the coffee grounds, the permanent coffee filter or just a combination of them all. Whatever it is, I am completely satisfied. It is very easy to program and I am happy with the provided features.Because I have broken 3 pots over the last year or so, I had originally intended to go with a coffee maker that had a stainless steel pot. However, after reading the reviews (thanks fellow Amazon customers!) I decided against that. It seems that the stainless pots are really just a carafe and need to be preheated before making the coffee if you want your coffee to stay warm. Too much work for me in the mornings. With the traditional glass pot and burner, the coffee gets hot and stays hot as long as you like. This machine does a great job of heating the coffee! I think this pot has a couple of features that will help me keep from breaking it: 1. The spout is plastic and not plain glass like my other ones. 2. The pot has a more elongated shape, verses the rounder shape of my old pots. They each broke after coming into contact with other dishes either at the spout area or the rounded "shoulder" area.
