review/summary: The lid won't stay onreview/text: After using this Brita for a few months - my biggest complaint is that the lid will NOT stay attached to the pitcher. And to add insult to injury sometimes the flap over the pour spout does not flip up, causing the water to go everywhere but in the glass.My recommendation - try a different model of Brita pitcher.
