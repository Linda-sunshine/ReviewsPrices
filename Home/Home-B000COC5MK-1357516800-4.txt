review/summary: Worked great for 3 years!review/text: This wine bottle opener has worked nearly flawlessly for about three years. We have had only one or two mishaps and those were usually because we tried to uncork when the battery was low. We typically open one bottle of wine/day so we are talking over 1000 successful uncorkings. So, what happened? My wife uncorked a bottle when the battery was low; the cork was extracted but the battery died before it could be removed from the unit. In my infinite wisdom, I removed the six screws holding the unit together and pulled out the cork. After struggling to put the unit together again (not an easy task), now the up/down toggle button only works when pressing up. I might be able to fix it by taking it apart again and seeing what I fouled up but since the battery was getting weak anyway, we'll just by another.
