review/summary: Little demon of a vacuumreview/text: I bought this to replace a small Dirt Devil that broke. The Dirt Devil was okay, but serviceable because I used it only on the carpeted stairs.The price and reviews on this vacuum led me to purchase it. And I'm really impressed with its ability to pick up dog hair and dust. I've gone beyond the stairs, to places that I can't reach with my conventional vacuum cleaner.Great product for a great price.
