review/summary: Good machinereview/text: I was used to renting the Rug Doctor from a supermarket. Every time I rented one of these machines I had to clean the wheels before using it because you know how people drag these machines across the parking lot to their cars. It's nasty and tedious having to clean the grease off the wheels or to remove gums. I finally decided it was time for me to own a carpet cleaner. I can't say for sure that this machine is better than the Rug Doctor but I'm not disappointed and the price is right. I've lived in my brand new house for over 2 years and my carpet was like new. I didn't think I needed to clean my carpet but I wanted to do it anyway. When it was time for me to empty the reservoir tank, I was surprised to see how dirty the water was so it's a pretty good indicator that the machine was doing its job. What's even better is the hand tool that I can use to clean my stairs. The powerful hand tool has a very rigid rotary brush. The Rug Doctor doesn't have any hand tools and it's clunky to move around.
