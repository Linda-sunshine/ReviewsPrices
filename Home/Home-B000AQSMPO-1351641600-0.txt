review/summary: KeurigB60review/text: Purchased Keurig B60 coffee maker from one of Amazon's suggested links. Price was great. Coffee maker arrived on time.The coffee maker is just great for the two of us. We're retired elderly couple that enjoy an early morning cup of coffee. The unique thing about this coffee maker are the K-Cups. Brews one cup of freshly brewed coffee in seconds and you can purchase the K-Cups in various flavors. My wife likes one flavor, I enjoy a different flavor. No fuss no waste, no cleanup. Such a deal! Might be somewhat more expensive, hoever, zero waste. In the final results, it is more conveinient and suits our needs. Would recommend the Keurig to any coffee lover!!!Forgot to mention teas, there are many types of teas available in K-Cups. Great for evening.Rudy
