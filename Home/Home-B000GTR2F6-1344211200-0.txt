review/summary: Excellent Brewer - Almostreview/text: My wife and I love this machine. We purchased ours after visiting a cousin that had one and brewed us some coffee one morning. We were hooked!! We enjoyed our Keurig B-70 Platinum for about 8 months at which time it started having some problems and finally failed completely two weeks past the warranty period. I called Keurig's Customer Support expecting a hassle but was very pleasantly surprised when Mitch walked me through some brief troubleshooting steps. Mitch said that the machine would be replace at no cost to me within 3 - 7 days. We will be without our machine for about a week but we are still happy customers. Hopefully the replacement will last as long as one of the other reviewers posted his replacement unit has lasted (more than 3.5 years and counting). I will update this review if the replace fails.I love coffee and tea and this machine makes both wonderfully. The kids like hot chocolate so this machine was heavily used and well liked. I would and have recommended this to others as well as giving them as gifts.
