review/summary: Good productreview/text: I bought this for the in-laws for Christmas. They are always having dinner parties, and my father-in-law is always opening up numerous bottles of wine with a regular old opener. They had a dinner party recently, and this opener worked awesome! You just stick it on and press the button and boom! Bottle is open. Great product!
