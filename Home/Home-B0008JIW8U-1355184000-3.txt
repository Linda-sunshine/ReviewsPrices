review/summary: It's Littlereview/text: ... So don't order it if you really want to brew more than one to two, 10oz. to 12oz. cups of coffee. You can't overfill it, there's no room. If you do, it will float the coffee grounds into the water container area (ask me how I know) as the little guy tries to manage the excess water. This might sound like a negative review, but it isn't. The coffeemaker does exactly as it advertises, and if you are looking to brew a little, this pot is for you. You can program it, delay the brewing cycle, even tell the time of day; but you will still get one to two, 10oz. to 12oz. cups of coffee per brew. One note: the brewing cycle is 4 to 5 minutes long so don't stand there, find something else to do for a few minutes. Another note: we purchased the gold permanent filter to replace all those throw-away paper filters. It does a good job of separating water from grounds, and saves on the 'use once and toss variety'.
