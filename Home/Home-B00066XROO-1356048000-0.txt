review/summary: This is a pancake lover's dream!review/text: Makes them all t one, no waiting. Great nonstick, but it is huge. If you have a standard sink like me (not the high profile faucet) it can be hard to wash and rinse due to size. I haven't put it in the dishwasher as I wonder how long the nonstick will hold up and it would take up a lotta real estate. Makes perfect pancakes though! I think it is worth it.
