review/summary: Excellent Espresso Makerreview/text: Got this espresso maker as a replacement to the Primula one, that was finally returned (see my other review on it).Pros:1) Very solid build2) Steam outlet valve is on a side not underneath of the handle, so you never risk in melting the handle with the hot steam (happen to my very first primula maker)3) Rubber gasket seals the interface and no leakage as those happens with the cheap plastic gasket4) Handle is very convenient5) Thick walls keep coffee hot6) Last but the most important: espresso is very good and fresh smell in the kitchen makes beginning of the day betterOther thoughts:1) It is bigger than other 6 cups makers as it holds 12 ounces of water (versus 9 ounces in Primula maker)2) As someone mentioned, it's better to use filtered water (pretty obvious) and boil with moderate temperature (it takes more time to boil but better result will be achieved)3) I would appreciate a 4-cup model as 6 cup is a bit to large and 3 cup is way to small for me.Bottom line:Highly recommended quality product
