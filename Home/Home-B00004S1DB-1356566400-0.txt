review/summary: Usablereview/text: The press works just fine, but it doesn't seem to keep the coffee warm long enough. I follow the instructions, by allowing hot water to sit in the thermos for 5 minutes before adding the near boiling water to make the coffee. It still won't keep the coffee warm enough for more than an hour.
