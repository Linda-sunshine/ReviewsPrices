review/summary: Trust the reviews, this is a perfect hand held vacuum!review/text: We purchased this item as we own a &#34;cyclone technology&#34; vacuum but cleaning a flight of stairs proved to be too much of a hassle and there were times when our 2 yr. old would make a small mess and the large vacuum was on a separate floor. This Eureka Hand-held is exactly what we were looking for:1) It is lightweight enough that going up and down the stairs with it or pulling it out for a quick job doesn't feel like a chore.2) The beater brush and suction is powerful enough to clean high traffic areas3) The hose is detachable so that you can focus the suction into nooks and crannies or work on stubborn spots4) The cord is long enough that you can do an entire flight of stairs without doing the dreaded &#34;midway shuffle&#34; (working up half the staircase, go downstairs, unplug, go to the top of the stairs, plug it in, and back down halfway to keep vacuuming)We are very pleased with this item we like it as much as you can like a tool!
