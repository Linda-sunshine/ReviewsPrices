review/summary: Great for carpets! Better than the MaxExtractreview/text: Got this one for my neighbor who is constantly using mine. This unit is great on carpets, better than the newer and more expensiveHoover MaxExtract All-Terrain Carpet Cleaner, F7452900I also have, which is better on tile floors and for any hand held unit stuff.With 4 kids and 2 dogs. Can't live without one of these. I ended up getting a 2nd one when the other was in the shop getting repaired.Cord is shorter on this unit and the hand attachments aren't as good as than the newer one.
