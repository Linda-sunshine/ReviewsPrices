review/summary: Gave this as a giftreview/text: Gave this as a gift to my friend who likes to cook but doesn't have space for a big countertop blender, and he loves it. No issues yet with defective parts or things breaking, but he knows about the warranty just in case, since other reviewers have reported problems. Overall, seems like a good buy.
