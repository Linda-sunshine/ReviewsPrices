review/summary: Crappy food chopperreview/text: I bought this 2 weeks ago and it worked ok, nothing special, it got thrown in the trash today cause when i was soaking the plastic bowl i tossed in the blade well it got stuck and with no luck i couldn't remove it, so i tried one more time and my hand slipped and i cut my finger. crappy food chopper. it didn't chop my veggies up good at all even tho i cut them up so it would fit in the bowl.
