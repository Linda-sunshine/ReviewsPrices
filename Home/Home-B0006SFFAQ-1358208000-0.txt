review/summary: lasted less than two monthsreview/text: Worked fine for about six weeks. I had noticed it created a lot of steam that rose up around the reservoir lid, but thought nothing of it. Then one morning it made four very strong cups, even though the wife swore she had used our normal 10 cup batch. So I tried it again, and the same strong 4 cups brewed, with the remaining water going up in steam. Took about 20 minutes to steam off. The self-clean light was blinking, so I followed the procedure, but again it wouldn't brew properly. At that point, I was concerned about safety, so arranged for a refund. Luckily, Amazon took it back. I'm a little peeved that Amazon is deducting from my refund the free shipping discount I originally got. In other words, I'm now paying the original $8 shipping. Weird.
