review/summary: Great for more than just pizzareview/text: This pizza pan is probably our most useful kitchen "gadget" (I'm not sure what else to call it).It makes absolutely amazing pizza, the key is to preheat the pan, and then just cook the crust for a few minutes prior to adding the sauce and cheese, to keep it from getting soggy. Besides "real" pizza, it's also great for french bread, English muffin, and other types of pizza.It's also good for making breakfast (toast, bacon, eggs, etc.), homemade potato or vegetable chips, french fries, or really anything that you would want to be crispy, or using the oven in lieu of a frying pan.Clean up is incredibly easy -- We tend to make bacon once about every two weeks and that seems to be enough to keep it well seasoned. Nothing sticks to it, so clean up entails removing crumbs, wiping with a paper towel, and wiping it down with oil.We've gotten a lot of use out of ours and this has turned into our standard gift for people who are hard to shop for.
