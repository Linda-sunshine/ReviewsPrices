review/summary: Amazingreview/text: A very powerful juicer that is easy to clean! There are many much more detailed reviews than what I am writing. Let me just say that my wife hates....hates to clean anything in the kitchen! She uses this on a daily basis...because I see the creations she pours into the glass bottles kept in the refrigerator; the juicer is always clean and put together awaiting her next delicious concoction! So if someone who loathes cleaning anything in the kitchen has no problem keeping this juicer clean and back on the ready line....you just gotta know it's ez cheeze! I actually witnessed her performing the cleaning operation the first time and there is just nothing to it!This is our first juicer and I am happy we waited! It is so easy to use and clean and the juices she creates are amazing! Apples, carrots and oranges.... I'm gonna live to be 100 at this rate.
