review/summary: This product is saving my relationshipreview/text: I literally ruined a microwave by not watching a bag of microwave popcorn closely enough. It burned through the bag and neither I, nor our cleaning lady, could get rid of the smell in the microwave. We bought a new one.So recently I've been watching bags of popcorn like a hawk, but I still end up with burnt popcorn smell OR lots of old maids. After numerous complaints from my partner about the smell, I finally bought the Presto.I get very few old maids with this product. The kernels do jump out of the bowl sometimes, but despite that I'm still getting much more popped popcorn than I EVER have using a bag of microwave popcorn, and they are never burnt.
