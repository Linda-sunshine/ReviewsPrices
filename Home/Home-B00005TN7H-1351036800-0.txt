review/summary: Wonderful!review/text: I wish I had known about this product sooner- it has the potential to save me a lot of money! I now store most of my dry goods in either half gallon or quart jars- chocolate chips, oats, all of my various flours, sugars infused with vanilla beans or lavender, etc. I buy fewer bags, because I use the jars to freeze things like shredded cheeses (takes a little more room, but no more smooshed cheese!!), nuts, sauces, etc. I also now use jars instead of bags to store containers of the sugar-free gummy bears I buy that for some reason only come in 5 lb bags.The downside of this product- it doesn't seem to work as well using very fine flours. If even a bit of flour gets sucked up past the lid, you're done for and have a huge mess to clean up. Also, as stated in the product description: "While vacuum packaging is not a substitute for traditional canning methods, it does keep food fresh three to five times longer than keeping it in a plastic food storage container in the refrigerator." So, no using this for canning jellies, pickles, etc.
