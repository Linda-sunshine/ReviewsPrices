review/summary: Presto 01362 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker Awesome!!!review/text: I have had this brand of Pressure Cooker before and it was good. Now I have a new one and it is the best as far as I am concerned.You can even extra buy pieces to get more use out of your pressure cooker. I sent for the glass cover to make it into a large sauce pan,also. Presto has a wonderful reputation and it still works hard at making the &#34;best&#34;!!!!!!!!
