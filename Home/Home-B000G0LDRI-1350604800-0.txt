review/summary: Great humidifierreview/text: This humidifier is working great for us. I live in a very dry, desert area and this definitely gives us a more comfortable sleep. I do see what other reviewers are saying about not being able to set the tank down while filling it but its not that big of a tank so its not hard to hold it up while its filling. And I'm a small girl. Other reviews are right that its not really a 9-gallon tank. I have it on medium-low running all night in my 10' x 20' bedroom and it takes almost all of one of the 2 tanks of water in that time. And I like the white noise it makes while running. Its like a quiet air-conditioner. The nice hum helps me sleep. It works out great for us, especially for the price.
