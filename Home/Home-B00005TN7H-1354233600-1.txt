review/summary: Hooray for jarred salads!review/text: This jar sealer has already gotten a ton of use in my house, just in the couple of weeks we've had it. One of my favorite uses of my Ball jars has been for keeping salad and salad fixings fresher, longer. I typically put my salad (spinach, baby greens, romaine, etc.) in a large quart jar, and then the fixings (cucumber, mushrooms, carrot) in a small jar. Then I have fresh prepared salads for several days.I am slowly learning other uses for these as well... and I can't believe how easy this jar sealer makes things!It did take me a few minutes to figure out - mine didn't have any instructions in the box. The difficulty for me wasn't with how to hook it up (very intuitive), or how to seat it on the jar (also very intuitive)... no, mine was realizing that I had to unlatch the lock on my FoodSaver in order to release the vacuum enough that the sealer could be removed from the jar. I was obviously having a ditz moment!The value of this item, just in food saved, should not be underestimated. It will pay for itself in the first couple of uses. We've got a few weddings coming up this year and had already planned to give the brides & grooms FoodSavers and bags for wedding gifts. We'll also be including jar sealers in our gifts because they're so very useful to have!
