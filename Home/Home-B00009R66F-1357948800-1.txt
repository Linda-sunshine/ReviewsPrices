review/summary: leaking tankreview/text: I loved our first Hoover Sucker-upper (Steamvac). We had a couple of puppies and it saved our rugs. We used it for about 5 years before it died. After a couple of years we replaced it with the newer version. I was delighted with the clear water/soap dispenser system and it did a wonderful job of cleaning our carpets. I haven't used it for a year (most of our floors are now hardwood), but now the tank drains without even squeezing the trigger. I'm so disappointed. Now what!?
