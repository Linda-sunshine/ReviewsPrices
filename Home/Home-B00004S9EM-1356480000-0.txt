review/summary: User's manualreview/text: I replaced an old processor that came with a two page instruction book. It did just what the new one does. HOWEVER this one requires a huge book of instructions that are ambiguous or missing PLUS a DVD to use it. Too many safety features that are a big nuisance. If you don't know enough to keep your fingers out of the way, stay out of the kitchen.
