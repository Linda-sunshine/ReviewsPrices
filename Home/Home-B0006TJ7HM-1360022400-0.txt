review/summary: Great starter knife setreview/text: I bought these for my girlfriend for Christmas. She really likes them and has replaced her old knife set completely using these for everything just about. They cut through everything great so far, bread, cake, veggies, steaks, and opened various packages from time to time.Bottom line: This set is great and doesn't break the bank. I wouldn't want to open packages and would be afraid to really use a $400 set of knives. These we use daily, and they feel great in the hand and have a very sharp edge right out of the box.
