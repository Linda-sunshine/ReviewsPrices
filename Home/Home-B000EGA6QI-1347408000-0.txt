review/summary: Great customer service, pieces won't stay latched, thoughreview/text: I'm on my third SmartStick, having returned it twice since purchasing it 6 months ago. It is truly guaranteed for a year, and Cuisinart makes it easy to return--even sending UPS to the house to pick up the broken item. You do have to come up with packing material, though, so save the boxes. The same thing broke twice: the latch stopped working so the two pieces wouldn't latch together after two or three uses. My third SmartStick (second replacement) was just delivered today, and I'm going to try something different this time. Even though the instructions say the blending shaft (not the motor housing) can be put into the diswasher, I'm not going to do that. Will wash the blending shaft by hand. Suspect that the dishwasher might have driven water into the shaft latch and that caused the issue. Fingers crossed this doesn't break again. I like the product when it works.
