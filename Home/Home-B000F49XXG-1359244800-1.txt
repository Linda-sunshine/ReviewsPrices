review/summary: Overall nice machinereview/text: I have used this machine for 2 month now and overall I'm impressed with its ease of use and consistency. The only issues I have with it are:1. Only very small expresso cups will fit under the filter basket2. The drip tray and cup rattle and move when the pump is on.3. The tear down and cleaning is tedious (but expected)
