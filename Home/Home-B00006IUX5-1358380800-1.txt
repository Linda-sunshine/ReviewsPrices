review/summary: Pretty good but...review/text: Pretty good but the part that you push to start the grinder falls off a lot. It is easy to put back in place, but there is a danger of another family members loosing it. Mine is currently lost for about 2 weeks now. Don&#8217;t know if I will find it again or not. The fix is to break a round toothpick in half and use the flat end to start the grinder every time you use it. It will fit in the hole perfectly. A small nail may do the trick too. That saves you form having to buy another grinder.
