review/summary: Great Product!review/text: Stop complaining, people. Yes, It's plastic. It is slightly flimsy but holds up very well. It dies exactly what it's supposed to do with great results. It works great for making making zucchini noodles! If using zucchini, I would suggest using a large, plump one. I've also Used Apples, Carrots and onions with no trouble at all. It is SUPER EASY to clean as well. I use this thing about 3-4 times a week and love it.
