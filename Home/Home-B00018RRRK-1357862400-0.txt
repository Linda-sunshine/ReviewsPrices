review/summary: "Daily Grind"review/text: This grinder is the best one we've ever owned. There are many levels of grinding available. It is sturdy, durable and is worked to death. Fortunately it has lasted quite a while. We use it everyday at least twice. When we have company we use it more often. It's like the energizer bunny. I would buy another one exactly like it if I need another.
