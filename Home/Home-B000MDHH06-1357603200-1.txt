review/summary: I am going to be so healthy....review/text: This juicer is amazing! It is highly efficient and very quiet for such a powerful machine. We have been juicing everything in sight (well not everything). My husband and I have been creating our own juice blends and making fabulous sauces, as well. In addition, I have been saving the fibrous vegetable pulp to make homemade paper. It is definitely worth the buy. You must be meticulous about keeping it clean, so if you're lazy or in too much of a hurry to take care of your tools, they you should just buy your juice from the store. It is the perfect first step to a healthier lifestyle.
