review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I recently moved from a two-bedroom apartment that I shared with a roommate to a one-bedroom apartment by myself. During the move, my older vacuum cleaner broke, and I decided to try something slightly smaller this time. There's not a ton of storage space in my new apartment.I wish I could just have my old vacuum back.It reminds me of a prop that you'd see in a showroom acting as a placeholder for your appliances and such: a fake that just needs to remind you of the real thing. The design of this feels like they never actually tested someone using it. The handle is a separate piece from the main body, and it often doesn't lock in properly. The hose is far too short; if you try to reach at all with it, the vacuum body comes along for the ride. I have to drag the body along with the hose or have it fall on me. There isn't a really nice way to unlock it from an upright position. It also is really noisy.While you might save space if you need something not quite as tall as a full vacuum, this takes up almost the same footprint. I felt like I gained very little and lost a lot with this vacuum. I wouldn't buy it again. It cleans okay enough, but you lose a lot of the functionality. Just get a bigger one.
