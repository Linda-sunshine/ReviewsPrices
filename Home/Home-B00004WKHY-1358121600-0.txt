review/summary: I would give it 5 stars but you can't use blades without all pieces locked inreview/text: This is a great food processor. Easy to clean. The bowl could be bigger. The only draw back is you have to cut the food small enough to lock the feeding insert in or it won't work. It will work if you use the small streaming hole. I got the extra blades because the 1/4 slicer blade is too thin for things like pineapple and the shredder is very fine so I got the julienne blade for cheese. It is easy to use and makes quick work of cooking chores.
