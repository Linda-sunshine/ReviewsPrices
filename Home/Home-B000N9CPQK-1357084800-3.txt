review/summary: Honeywell HHT-011 Compact Air Purifier with Permanent HEPA Filterreview/text: Good filter. Purchased it initially to help with our ferret's &#34;natural&#34; odor. It didn't help that much. We now use it in our bedroom, which helps with the stagnant air (since we have baseboard heating and won't open the windows in the winter). Not really that loud when set at the low level.
