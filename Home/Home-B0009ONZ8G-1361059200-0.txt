review/summary: Nice suction, otherwise more hassle than it's worthreview/text: I loved it at first, zipped around sucking so nicely. Then I tried to use the hose. Nightmare. The hose is too short and inflexible, so you have no reach, and you are constantly trying to pull and maneuver it into position, causing the vacuum to smack against your head and back, or walls and furniture. That might not be so bad, except the hose connection to the vacuum is also a JOKE; it's USELESS; it WILL NOT STAY CONNECTED!If you are not going to use the hose much, this vacuum is great!If you rely on the hose like I do, prepare for FRUSTRATION CENTRAL. Sure they sell a longer one, like an inch longer; don't spoil us Hoover! But it connects the same way, and is therefore as useless as the shorter one. I considered melting it so it wouldn't come apart anymore. Oh, but there's also no flap over the hole when you use the hose, so dust flies everywhere!I just dragged it back the store and exchanged it for a Dirt Devil Breeze Stretch, which happened to be twenty dollars cheaper (with a hose that stretches 10 ft). So far it is far more convenient and comfortable to use. The Tempo is low quality I would have expected from a dollar store, NOT HOOVER!!
