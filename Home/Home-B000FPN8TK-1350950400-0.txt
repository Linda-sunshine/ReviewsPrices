review/summary: It works well.review/text: It's a tea pot (with a rubber valve). You put tea leaves and hot water into it and tea and spent tea leaves come out. Then you give it a rinse, or on occasion, run some dish washing liquid through it. Don't bother with the dishwasher and don't try to microwave it. Mine's had at least five gallons of tea through it and it looks brand new.
