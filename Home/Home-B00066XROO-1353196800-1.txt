review/summary: Decent griddlereview/text: Love the size of this griddle four our family especially when making &#34;dad's specialty pancakes&#34; as my daughters say. There is plenty of area for 6 medium- sized pancakes. The only downfall for this product is the lack of an even temperature across the griddle lending to uneven cooking, though, this only a slight negative. Overall, this is a wonderful product so far and I would not hesitate to purchase again.
