review/summary: Good for very light usereview/text: It's a great looking teapot, but only if you're going to use it sparingly.I'm a semi-heavy tea drinker so I was turning the pot on about 8x/day and six months into owning the pot it melted. The handle would get very hot, then the blue button popped off, and finally the handle began melting.Too bad - good looking tea kettle, but very poor materials manufacturing.
