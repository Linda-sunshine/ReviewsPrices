review/summary: It is what it is!review/text: These are not professional quality knives and should not be rated as such. I've used everything from Shun Classics to Global to Fujiwara to Mac knives and these Ginsu are not them. What they are are fantastic knives for the everyday user. Someone who enjoys cooking every once and a while and really isn't concerned with upkeep of their knives and would prefer to just throw them in the wash and then the drawer when dry. These knives cut well enough to be usable and the set comes with all the basic knives for most preparations.If you are wondering if they are worth it I would say yes. If you are a more cooking oriented individual who loves to cook and spends a lot of time in the kitchen I would opt for a higher end product (any of the makers listed above). These are perfect for what they are. Affordable knives for the everyday individual who doe occasional cooking at home!
