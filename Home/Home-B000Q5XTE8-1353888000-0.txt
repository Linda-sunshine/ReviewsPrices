review/summary: Hole in the chairreview/text: Well, there was a hole in the chair when I got it, its on the bottom so it isn't noticable just a bummer that its new and there is a hole there :(. I didnt return it because i would then have to take it apart and put it back in the box and we all know how fitting things back in the box goes. I've had this chair for a while now and it isn't bad. Had it not have a hole in it i would have given it a five since its pretty sturdy and affordable. I expect it to still be lasting for a few more years!
