review/summary: Great sharpenerreview/text: Pros - Simple to use, sharpens very wellCons - can't sharpen serrated blades (bread knife), one set of slots has a slightly awkward angle.Sharpened all our steak and kitchen knives to very sharp point in about 10 minutes. After my wife sharpened her cleaver (basically the only knife she uses for both fine and tough cutting) she got two more for her Mom and sister.
