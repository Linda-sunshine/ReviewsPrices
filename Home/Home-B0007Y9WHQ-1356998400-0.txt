review/summary: A fun new way to encourage raw vegetablesreview/text: I have enjoyed how easy it is to cut vegetables in a unique way to make them more appealing to my kids. We have also enjoyed baked curly fries too. The spiral cutting of the carrot did not go as smooth as it looked on the box but the rest of the vegetables have turned out well.
