review/summary: Cooking Strongreview/text: This big bad pressure cooker is still working strong after the few years I've had it. Never had any issues with it and have cooked quite a few meals in it at this point. Nothing beats cooking a great big meal of tender, slow-cooked pork in under 2 hours. What comes out tastes like it's been slow-cooked for 12 hours!
