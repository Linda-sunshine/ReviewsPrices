review/summary: Works great!review/text: Myparents make a lot of tea when they visit but don't like the taste of boiled water on the stove or the microwave... I don't get it but its my parents I have to try to make them happy after putting up with me all these years.They were using a coffee maker, without coffee, to produce warm water. This replaced it. works great. Has an auto shut off.
