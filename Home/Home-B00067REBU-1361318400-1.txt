review/summary: Great bread makerreview/text: Picked this up after looking at what seemed to be every bread machine and review out there. Decided that this would be a great place to start for our first machine, low cost and great reviews swayed me towards this unit. First loaf the wife tried the set it and forget it method, well that did not work at all. After reading a little more on bread making some tending through the 2nd kneading cycle is necessary to either add a touch more water or flower depending on the weather not to mention several other things like water temperature and mixing salt with water vs dry mix. Well our second loaf came out perfect with a little baby sitting. I'm very happy with our purchase. As far as longevity well that remains to be seen.
