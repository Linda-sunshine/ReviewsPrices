review/summary: Perfectreview/text: This was perfect for what I needed it to do. I was using it for juicing and it took anything we put in it. Sometimes the motor seemed not powerful enough but it still got the job done. Used as a daily juicer and it only consist of 5 peices that needed to be washed.
