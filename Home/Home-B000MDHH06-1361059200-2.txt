review/summary: Owned this for 2+ yearsreview/text: I just purchased the Kuvings NS-950 Silent Upright Masticating Juicer, I previously owned the &#34;Breville BJE200XL Compact Juice Fountain 700-Watt Juice Extractor&#34;Here is my comparisonThe Breville:As a beginner juicer I was very happy with this juicer at first. As I started to get into more complicated juicing involving ginger root, kale, parsley etc ...Once I started using these vegetables I was getting very little yield from the kale, ginger and parsley. I read up on how to get a better yield I was convinced that I would need a masticating juicer instead of the Breville centrifuge juicer.If you want to do fruit juices and vegetables that have high water content then the Breville is a good choice but if you want to get a better yield and less pulp then you want a masticating juicer.The Kuvings Masticating juicer:I love love love this juicer. I feel that it is worth the extra money to get this juicer, it will end up paying for itself because you use less vegetables to get the same amount of juice that you would get from a centrifuge juicer.Another plus is the easy cleanup. It comes with a handy dandy cleaning tool to clean those stubborn screens.The pulp is MUCH LESS from this juicer but I feel that the foam is about the same as the Breville.If you are familiar with masticating juicers then you know that the juice is much healthier, less oxidation.If there was any downside I would say that the pulp chute sometimes gets partially plugged but I throw a radish in and it pushes the pulp right out, I haven't had to stop and unplug the chute yet. (Celery seems to plug it partially, cut your pieces small)All in all if you want a good quality centrifuge juicer then this Breville is a good choice. If you want to take it to the next level then buy the Kuvings NS-950 Silent Upright Masticating Juicer
