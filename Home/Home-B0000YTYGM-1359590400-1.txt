review/summary: Wish I hadn'treview/text: We were forced to replace our old coffee maker - also a Cuisinart - because our son broke it. The search began and this unit had the best overall reviews. Here are my gripes:You have to screw the lid on "just so" and one would think that wouldn't be something that you would have to double check. It will screw on incorrectly more often than not and that's simply ridiculous for a $100 product. BTW, when not on correctly the stop brew feature will not work.It pours at a snail's pace. Seriously. I have the carafe almost upside down to get the darn coffee out and regardless of what angle I pour, or how well the lid is screwed on it pours so SLOWLY.It's tall - will not fit underneath my upper cabinets. Hate that. Our old Cuisinart beeped when the brew cycle was finished but the volume of the beeps wouldn't wake up people who are still sleeping in another room. This one does! It beeps five times (3 is plenty!) and IT'S LOUD.While I initially liked the idea of not having a hot plate heat the coffee I find that the thermal carafe makes it all but impossible to know who much coffee you have left and if you should make more for the dinner company. Don't like having to unscrew that temperamental lid to get a visual on how much is left.Does it make coffee? Yes. But there has to be a less tedious way to accomplish this task and therefore I would not suggest anyone buy this model.
