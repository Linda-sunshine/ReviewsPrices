review/summary: great can openerreview/text: I'm thrilled with it. It's strong, it opens even dented cans, It is attractive, and its slightly taller appearance is helpful when opening larger cans, like big cans of tomato sauce. Cleans easily, too. A wonderful purchase. I like the white, it is nice and clean looking.
