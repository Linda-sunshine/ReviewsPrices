review/summary: On my 2nd Cuisinart Hand Blender and both no longer workreview/text: I too am on my 2nd Cuisinart SmartStick Immersion Hand Blender. The blender was wonderful when I first bought it and then, poof, it stop working (2x). I too thought it operated so well at first that I bought another one thinking that the first was just a lemon. As another reviewer wrote the drive shaft stopped working on both. The motor turns, just as powerfully as before, but something is broken in the stick and it doesn't turn the blades, which makes it useless. I have always thought quite highly of Cuisinart, but after purchasing two Cuisinart SmartStick Hand Blenders, I do not hold Cuisinart in high esteem any longer. I also purchased one of their coffee makers for Christmas - grind and brew all in one pot and had to bring it back because it was defective (the basket kept popping open during brewing). So, I will no longer be purchasing Cuisinart products, especially this one.
