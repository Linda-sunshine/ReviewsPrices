review/summary: noisy and quality cheaper than hopedreview/text: I purchased this as a gift after receiving one (different company) for myself that I love. This product was noisy and cheaply made. I was a bit embarrassed to hear it and see it on the counter of the person I had it shipped to as a gift. Wishing I had spent a little more and gotten a better made product.
