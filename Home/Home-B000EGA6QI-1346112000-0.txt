review/summary: Great smoothie maker!review/text: This smart stick/immersion blender is exactly what we needed. It's used daily to blend a high calorie, high protein drink for my husband for lunch. it's easy to clean, sits out on the counter, rather than having to drag out the old Waring blender with the resultant bigger cleaning job, etc. We'll try using it for soups and such later in the year.
