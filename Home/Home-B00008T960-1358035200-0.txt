review/summary: Bought this for a countertop convection ovenreview/text: This is small and fits in my Oster convection oven. Not large enough to knead bread on, thinking of getting the larger size for that. Was looking for something to bake bread on over my pizza stone since bread seems to stick all the time despite corn meal. Never had that problem in a stove before. Keeps things from sticking, even using it in a small baking sheet when making cookies and the like. Works great!
