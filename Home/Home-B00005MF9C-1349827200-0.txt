review/summary: Good Coffee - Bad Designreview/text: This unit makes a decent cup of coffee - good brew time. However, be warned that a standard travel mug does NOT fit in the unit. You basically are forced to use the mug that comes with it or a regular ceramic cup. The supplied travel mug is ok, but not exactly insulated. The outside of the cup was very warm too the touch - which indicates you are losing significant heat. Yes, you can easily transfer the coffee from the supplied mug to another of your choosing, but the heat loss is still pretty big. Not impressed. Returning this one.
