review/summary: Easy to usereview/text: I'm a complete coffee novice. I've only recently developed a taste for it and decided I needed something to make coffee at home, rather than pay high coffee house prices. I didn't want anything that would clog up my limited kitchen space and something easy to use. I had read a lot and asked a bunch of my coffee drinking friends for ideas. In the end I decided on the AeroPress. I'm super glad I did.The AeroPress doesn't take up any counter space, when I'm finished I can put it in a drawer out of sight. It is easy to use, although it did take me some time to perfect the use of it. The thing to remember is that this makes shots of coffee/espresso that need to be added to either more hot water or milk before drinking. I started out making my coffee much too week. The directions included explain this better than I can, but once you get it figured out, it is fantastic.Clean up is super easy. Rinse everything off, wipe off the plunger and let it air dry.
