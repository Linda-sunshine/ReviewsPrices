review/summary: Evaluating the machine is asking the wrong questionreview/text: While evaluated on its own merits I suppose this is a great product for what it is (just like a McDonalds burger is - an impressive achievement of efficient industrial food production), I am disheartened by the quick proliferation of these machines. I received one as a present and it is going to the thrift store: the coffee is so-so at best, but more importantly, I simply cannot get over the inherent wastefulness of what amounts to a whole new industry to simultaneously complicate and de-skill something as simple and basic as making a cup of coffee. The Keuring is only 'simple' if you ignore the long supply chain and resource extraction that preceded its appearance on your kitchen counter and the whole new layer of complexity and waste inherent in producing the disposable k-cups. Is there not enough plastic in our landfils and oceans already?
