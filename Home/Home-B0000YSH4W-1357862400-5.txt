review/summary: It was good...review/text: It was a good story, I chose it because I was looking for something along the lines of the Hunger Games & this was recommended... It was a little too far fetched for me & a little too predictable, but it was written well. I haven't downloaded the other books in the series because this just didn't give me that, &#34;I MUST read the next story to see what happens&#34;, kind of feeling...
