review/summary: wish it wasn't as tallreview/text: I like this machine a lot but wish it wasn't as tall so that it would fit on counter between upper and lower cabinets when not in use. Had to purchase additional cart to place it on, since it is also too tall to fit into my cabinet shelves as well.
