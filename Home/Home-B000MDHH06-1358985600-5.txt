review/summary: Easy to clean? If you're just talking about the juicer, maybe.review/text: I put this juicer on my wish list for Christmas based off the plentitude of reviews and the high rating. I read a lot and the ease of cleaning sold me. I find this juicer to be incredibly messy! The pulp is dry, but when I juice, I don't expect to have to clean my whole kitchen free of flying vegetable pulp. The juicer tends to build up air inside and when I lift the food pusher to add more vegetables to it, pulp flys out of the top and all over the place. I also find that I have to empty the juicer of the pulp in the middle of making my juice and it would be nice to be able to fill the juice container without having to empty and clean everything half way through. One juice recipe takes about 30 mins to complete including cleaning everything up. I want to follow a juicing plan where you make juice 5 times a day and it certainly wouldn't be with this particular juicer. I'm ready to buy one that is more sophisticated in its design. Anyone want to buy a slightly used juicer?
