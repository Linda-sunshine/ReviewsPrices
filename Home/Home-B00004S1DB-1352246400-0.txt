review/summary: Best French Press If you Enjoy Drinking Grindsreview/text: It's well constructed but after a couple months of regular use, the screen will lose it's shape and allow grinds to pass thru, and I'm not talking the small dust size grinds. I'm talking big grinds. So unless you like drinking grinds or want to replace the screen (not sure if one is even available), pass this by.This is my second french press. The first was a "Bodum 1-Liter 34-Ounce French Press Coffeemaker" of which the glass carafe will break in a few months, but with a well designed screen and inerds. So I've got a great carafe of one brand, and a great inerds of a different brand - which don't fit each other....and the search continues.
