review/summary: Works great, water tastes greatreview/text: I purchased this to filter water before putting it in my keurig in an effort to help with scaling, etc. So far so good. My daughter now refuses to drink water directly from the tap. She wants it from the Brita pitcher. I like that it is narrow and doesn't take up too much space.
