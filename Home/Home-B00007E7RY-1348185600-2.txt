review/summary: It actually works!review/text: Wow, this thing actually works! My office has had this weird, moldy smell for a while. But we haven't been able to find any mold, or track the smell to its source. It might be coming from outside somewhere. But as soon as I put this purifier inside my office and turned it on, within a few hours...voila! I can barely smell it anymore! One of my co-workers next door was so impressed she's thinking about ordering one now too :).I can definitely hear the noise it makes. But it's more like a calm, white-noise sort of thing. It doesn't disturb me at all. In fact, I forget it's even there.The only thing is that it might be a bit on the large size for a small office...I'd say it takes up almost as much floor area as a small chair (though it's shorter than a chair at least).
