review/summary: I love this thing!review/text: I eat a LOT of produce.I don't think I can emphasize that enough. I have so many gadgets to chop up produce with it doesn't even make sense. This is one of my essentials.First off, for salads, you can make ribbons of things like summer squash, and you can make raw "noodles," of cucumbers or zucchini, and it adds such a unique texture to your salads. I love that.You can make zucchini "noodles," and steam them and top them with sauce, and it actually tastes like pasta! I haven't eaten real pasta in a couple of years due to celiac disease, so maybe I'm not the best source in the world for this, but I think it tastes the same.This is a very cost-effective product, and I don't really feel as though it is cheaply made, but I'm sure you could pay more money and get one that's not made of plastic.I find it to be pretty easy to clean as you can clean the blade separately from the rest of the device.Overall fantastic product.
