review/summary: Terrible product!!!review/text: Worst electric can opener I've ever used! Completely malfunctioned within three days. Weak motor, bad design. Shame on the manufacturer. I had a far better one in my house forty years ago. They can't equal that with today's improvements in technology and design?! Terrible.
