review/summary: Made in the USA - Yeah!!!review/text: I love this pan - it is very heavy. It was hard to see from the pictures, but I thought the handles were welded to the pan. The handles are not welded, but rather molded to the pan as one solid piece of metal. I like this much better!I have never made a pizza, ever. I made two homemade pizzas on this pan and both came out perfect. I wiped the pan with hot water before using it and sprayed it with vegetable oil before each pizza. The crust was nice and crunchy, all the way to the center. The crust was not overly crunchy or burnt, it was perfect. Each pizza slid right off the pan, no burning or sticking!I made the first pizza on a cold pan and then put it in the oven. I made the second pizza on the hot pan and then put it in the oven. I had to poke holes in the dough of the second pizza because the dough started to cook and rise on the hot metal. The second pizza dough rose a little more during cooking, but that could have been because the dough had more time to relax prior to putting it in the oven or because I made it on a hot pan. Either way, both pizzas were excellent!I almost lost the included recipe insert because it was folded in a small square, about 5&#8221; x 6&#8221;, and looks like a brown cutout. It matches the inside of the box and it fell out when I tipped the box upside down.Before storing the pan, I wiped it under running hot water, dried it and sprayed it with vegetable oil. All the dough, sauce and cheese wiped right off the pan with ease. I will keep the box to store the pan in the pantry because it is coated with oil. It will be ready for the next time!I have other plans for this pan too. I have a baked chicken, potato and broccoli recipe that I look forward to making in the oven. I will try to make pizza on the gas grill and open campfire this summer. I will try summertime steaks and potatoes too &#8211; yummy!So, this pan is not just for pizza and it is a keeper!
