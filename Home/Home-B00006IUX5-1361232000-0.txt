review/summary: Daveyeti's review influenced mereview/text: I was looking for an inexpensive grinder for my flax seed. When I read D.G. McAuley's (daveyeti) review I decided to give this one a go. He ought to work in advertising, lol. I'm very happy with the purchase. I have another grinder for coffee beans, but didn't want to have to bother cleaning it each time to grind flax seeds. Since I didn't want to spend much and this was only $!0.99 with prime, I went for it. Glad I did. It's a great little grinder (so far) and some thought was put into the design as the cover has a flat spot which allows you to set it down so it's stable, rather than wobbly. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive grinder.
