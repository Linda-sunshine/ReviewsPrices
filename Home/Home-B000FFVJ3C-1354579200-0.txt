review/summary: Totally. Obsessed. With dehydrating food. Thanks to Nesco. :-)review/text: This is really a great dehydrator - and so easy to use. I make homemade trail mix using strawberries, bananas, and apples. I sprinkle the apples with cinnamon sugar, and boy are those tasty. If you're into it, you can dehydrate vegetables to store and re-hydrate later on to use for soup.This model also makes beef jerky, so when I get around to doing that, I'll update this review! Seriously though, Nesco is a really well-known company and they make several different models of dehydrators. Depending on how heavy your usage, you really can't go wrong with this brand, no matter which model you decide on. I know a few people who also have Nesco dehydrators and have nothing but positive things to say about the company. My ONLY complaint is that I have no good place to store it because it's so large, but that's a personal problem, and doesn't reflect poorly on the function of the dehydrator. :-)
