review/summary: 6 1/2 inch Lodge Logic cast iron skilletreview/text: I seasoned it with bacon fat once. Since then it has been used almost everyday for months, mainly for cooking scrambled eggs. It never sticks and the eggs turned out delicious. It also does a good job toasting hamburger buns. This is my fourth Lodge Logic cookware.
