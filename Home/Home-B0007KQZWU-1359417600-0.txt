review/summary: MCP-12 Cuisinart cookwarereview/text: I purchased this cookware set for the cabin. I should buy another set for home. It's nice looking and cooks very well. If they get a little scuffed I use barkeepers friend to shine them up again. I've had them just over a year and used them many times. I'm very happy with them.
