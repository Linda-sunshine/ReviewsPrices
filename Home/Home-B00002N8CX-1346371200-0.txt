review/summary: Inexpensive vacuumreview/text: I bought this vacuum because of the price and ratings. The good news is it does work efficiently. However, it is best for wood and ceramic floors. For a tiny vacuum; the cord is long, the bag is big enough for multiple vacuum events. However, for carpet, you need to apply extra effort to really get the carpet clean. Not disappointed, but not amazed either.
