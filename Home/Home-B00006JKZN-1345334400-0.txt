review/summary: Didn't buy from Amazon, but owned same Modelreview/text: I used mine three times and each time I used it my waffles tasted like the smell of a brand new heating appliance. I even wiped it clean before use. Made "test" waffles to see if those would absorb the nasty taste. No luck so I returned it and got a Waring Pro Belgian Waffle iron. Used that today and the waffles tasted normal! Yay!
