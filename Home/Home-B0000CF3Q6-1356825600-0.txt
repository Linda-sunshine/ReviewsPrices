review/summary: Bialetti lives up to its reputationi!review/text: I love my little Bialettis! My little qualm is that the steam will sometimes escape if the top is not screwed on just right. This results in skimpy output. Should you try to tighten it using the handle (like when it's too hot to touch the top), it can easily break the handle, so don't try it!That's what I don't quite get--such a sturdy pot with such a puny handle. The materials are quite mismatched. I actually bought this one to replace the one I ruined when I mispositioned it on the stove and found the handle had melted, drooping over so sad. And such a shame the whole pot had to be discarded for such a minor incident! This is why is gets one star off from absolutely fabulous.
