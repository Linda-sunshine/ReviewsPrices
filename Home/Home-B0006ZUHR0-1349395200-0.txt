review/summary: Heats fast and has all the steam I needreview/text: This iron is great. It heats within a couple minutes to the cotton setting, and the steam gets pumped out at high levels when I need it. The controls are intuitive and the screen is easy to read. It's a good weight in my hand too. I'd definitely recommend this iron.
