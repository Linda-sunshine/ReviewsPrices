review/summary: Works fast, but can't get rid of the plastic smellreview/text: This product works very fast to warm the water you want heated I will say that. My one and only concern though, is the fact that my water once heated tastes like plastic and smells like plastic, if you drink tea...you will notice this!!I'm going to end up just giving this away to a friend because I can't stand the change in my tea.This does heat very fast, and will turn off automatically, so I'd recommend it if you need your water hot and don't care about leaching of the plastic no matter how many times you run water through the unit.
