review/summary: My most used kitchen appliance - love it!review/text: I bought this without the wisk and chopper attachments 2-3 years ago. It is used almost daily, for pureeing veggies and cooked liver for my homemade dog foods, making creamy vegetable soups and hummus, blending smoothies with nuts fruits and ice, and lots of other miscellaneous jobs. It never fails me, and I really love having it in my kitchen. I've had to replace the plastic cup, which got cracked and leaky after about 18 months of regular use. It would never get a break if I had the attachments! After all this time, it's still my go-to workhorse.
