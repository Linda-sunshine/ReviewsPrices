review/summary: It's a Monster...review/text: This thing is a beast of a mixer. I've been able to knead a ridiculous amount of bread dough in this and it doesn't even slow down. It's all metal gearing, powerful motor and attachments really handle the toughest tasks. The dough hook is awesome. I just made a wheat bread that called for nearly 3lbs of flour and it powered right through it. Can't wait to use this thing more around the holidays. Don't listen to any nay sayers about this. It will not disappont you.
