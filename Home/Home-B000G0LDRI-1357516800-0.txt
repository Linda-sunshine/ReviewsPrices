review/summary: Yay! 44% humidity all the time!review/text: Bought this for our place a few days ago... The relative humidity in our apartment was down to 16%, our skin was dry and cracking, and breathing was horrible. Our place is 1200 sqft, this humidifier is easily taking care of the whole apartment! We are now enjoying a nice 44% humidity rate! I highly recommend buying one if your place is super dry!!!Changing the tanks is easy. Flipping the filter over every other water change does keep it from gathering gunk. The fan is a little loud but not bad. The medium and low fan settings are pretty quiet. Great humidifier, would definitely recommend!!
