review/summary: Wonderful way to make coffeereview/text: Okay, so here's the deal: there's no universal standard on what makes a good cup of coffee. No matter what way you do it, you always have to start somewhere and adjust to your taste. You have your standard (recommended) ratio of 60 grams of coffee to 1 liter of water, and I find--to my taste--that works for me. That ratio works out to be 15 grams of coffee to 250 ml of water, which makes a very tasty 8 oz cup of coffee.You can brew a stronger cup (more grounds) with the intention of diluting with hot water, but I find I don't care for this. To each their own. The AeroPress itself is great: easy to use, easy to clean and whether you're using the paper filters or one of the steel mesh filters, I'm pretty sure you're going to get some great coffee out of it.
