review/summary: Love this machine!review/text: I had never cooked in a pressure cooker before (do some pressure canning, but never prepared a meal in one). We got this unit as a wedding gift and I LOVE it!!!! It cooks so fast and easy, and the food is delicious. The only thing I don't like much is that the surface area on the bottom of the cooker is so small that if you brown stuff in it you have to do it in several batches. For things that would take a lot of browning, I just do it in a large skillet on the stove, deglaze to get that wonderful fond, and then put it in the cooker. One more pan to clean, but saves doing multiple batches of browning.Edit after 1 month:This is the most incredible cooking appliance I have ever had. (and I have almost everything for the kitchen there is). It is the perfect appliance for the working person. I can get home at 6 pm and have a tasty meal on the table by 7, that usually would take hours to cook. Beef stew, chicken and rice, corned beef, pulled pork, everything is wonderful and cooks so fast. I don't know how I did it before this cooker. Money WELL WELL spent (I got it as a gift, but would have happily spent the money had I realized how wonderful it is!
