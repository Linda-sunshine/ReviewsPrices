review/summary: Keurig B60 Special Editionreview/text: We absolutely love the Keurig. The k cups are pricey and I continue to shop for the best prices on the cups. It gives everyone their choice of coffee, cocoa or tea. Just wish the k cups were not so expensive.....25-50 cents per k cup would be more reasonable.
