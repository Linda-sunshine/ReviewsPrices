review/summary: Luxuryreview/text: These sheets are like a little slice of heaven. I haven't had flannel sheets in a very long time and never for my king-sized bed. I was fairly leery of paying so much for sheets, as I've had bad experiences with sheets that caught this much before. But I bought them based on the very high reviews, and I have been MORE than pleased. They are incredibly soft, they haven't pilled, and even after the first wash, they barely lost any lint/fluff.I put a sheet set on my bed that was 5 years old and had cost more than these sheets. The "old ones" were nearly threadbare and terribly pilled. I decided immediately that I needed new sheets. For the two nights I was awaiting these flannel beauties, I woke up sweating in the night, so I was really afraid the flannel would be too warm. As soon as they arrived in the mail, I felt how soft they were, I washed them and KNEW I had to put them on the bed immediately. It turns out they are perfect. They are incredibly warm and heavy, but they breathe, so I don't wake up sweating. They keep me warm when it's cold, and they breathe and keep me cool when the furnace makes the room warmer. If my hand even brushes the sheet when I walk by, I immediately want to fall into bed to luxuriate in the softness and comfort of these sheets.This fitted sheet's also the only one I've found found that fits our ridiculously thick mattressI highly recommend these to anyone. You will not be disappointed!
