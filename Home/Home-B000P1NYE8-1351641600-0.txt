review/summary: Nice little scale for brewing applicationsreview/text: This is a sensitive pocket scale that I bought to weigh hops and other additives for homebrewing. I particularly like that it has a full tare function, has a high max for its size, was cheap, and has many modes so that I don't have to try to convert units from nonstandard brew recipes. It's accurate enough and gets the job done, though it can be annoying to calibrate because it requires a 500g weight and not many people just keep those on hand. Also, its automatic shutoff is on a VERY short timer, so you may find that if you don't use it for 30 seconds or so, it's turned off and you've lost your tare calibration. Keep an eye out for that.
