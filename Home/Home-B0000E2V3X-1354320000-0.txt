review/summary: Cast Iron Pizza Panreview/text: We are tent campers and have refined the perfect pizza for when we arrive on Friday nights. Cooking pizza's for a large group can be challenging at a campground. We purchased this pan so that we could make two pizzas at a time. I like this one better than the other one we have because of the easy grip handles.
