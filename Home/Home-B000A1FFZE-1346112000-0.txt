review/summary: No timer? Really?review/text: I expect a toaster oven to be able to heat a toaster - strudel. The manual says you have to toast them in the "oven" mode to keep a fire from starting, fine. But the heat is only on the top in oven mode, so you have to flip them 1/2 way through - and there is no built in timer on the oven mode - so you can't drop them in and walk away like you would on a real toaster oven.I just want a new version of my old B&D; - but they don't sell it anymore. It toasted things.
