review/summary: Geat price for this pro quality setreview/text: We have been waiting to switch away from the mixed bag of aluminum pots and pans we have collected over the years. This set is awsome. Heavy, Durable, Solid. These are going to outlast me. Watchout, because they heat up in seconds. I can't tell you how much gas we used over the years trying to boil in aluminum. Cleans up easily in the dishwasher. Looks fantasic. You almost want to leave it out.
