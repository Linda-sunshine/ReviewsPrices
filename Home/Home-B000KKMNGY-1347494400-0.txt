review/summary: Don't be fooled by the picture - you won't get one like itreview/text: The pictured rack looks quite sturdy, and holds four rolls of wrap without sagging away from the shelf. The rack I received was made of flimsy wire, and it drooped significantly when I put a roll of aluminum foil in the rack to test it out. The whole point of the rack is to keep the wrap above items on the shelf below it - this fails that test. It's not worth the hassle to return, but I may have to use it to hold light weight items, and not the wrap it's supposedly designed to contain.
