review/summary: Powerful for its size. Overheat easily.review/text: I was looking for a convenient vacuum to clean bare wood floor of a 2 story house plus a few rugs. It did a good job on both bare wood and rug. But it overheat easily, usually before I can finish the 1200 square feet first floor. It will recover and reset itself after cooling down which takes hours. It may be ideal for apartment dwellers, but not so good for house owner. After a year, I gave it to my young daughter who lives in an apartment. I am looking for another light weight stick vacuum for bare floor that would not overheat.
