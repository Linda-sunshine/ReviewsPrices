review/summary: Bad experiencereview/text: I used it twice and it worked perfectly, was really fast,produced a high yield of juice from the fruits, easy to set up and simple to clean and also a quite loud. Followed the instructions washed it after each use then when I went to use it again it broke down. Just wouldn't start.
