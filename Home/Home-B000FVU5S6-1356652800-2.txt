review/summary: Doesn't feel like 400 thread countreview/text: This doesn't feel like a 400 thread count sheet , unless you iron it. It comes out the dryer extremely wrinkled, like a piece of crumbled up tissue. I ironed the pillow cases in o. rder to use them. The sheets went to the thrift store. I washed 3 times trying to get them to soften=no luck and I am not about to iron sheets!!! NOTE: these are not returnable according to instructions in shipping package. Sorry Amazon, not a good product
