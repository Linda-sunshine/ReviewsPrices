review/summary: It works..review/text: When I was in juice diet kick last year, I've ordered this one and Omega 8006 Masticating juicer. They both juice very well. Omega model squeeze out more juice when it comes to leafy items but it takes longer because you have to chop the items to small size in order to feed into its small chute. On this Breville model, that's not a problem. Its huge feed chute swallows whole apple without cutting to small size. Real time saver. Some people talked about juice from this type of centrifugal machine is inferior to one from masticating juicer because of heat generated by its high speed motor kills nutrients, but I couldn't tell. My juice was ice cold so I don't think that is a issue. In my opinion, convenience trumps hypothesized nutrient value because you will juice more frequently with this machine than the other one.
