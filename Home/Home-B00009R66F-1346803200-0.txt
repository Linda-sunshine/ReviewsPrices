review/summary: Great purchase!review/text: I am so glad I decided to purchase the Hoover SteamVac with Clean Surge. It works great. I have already used it twice. Plus used it to clean up a spill from my toddler. Cleaned my carpets really well, even the tough spots. And great suction, my floors were dry in only a couple hours. With the Bissell I used to have. the floors stayed wet until the following day.Very easy to use. Tools are very accessible. Wand with spinning brush cleans great for small jobs.The dirty water tank does fill up before the cleaner is all gone. But if you fill the cleaner tank about 1.5 inches from line, then both tanks empty about the same time.Would recommend to anyone. Great value for the money too.
