review/summary: Just perfect, will keep your weight down!review/text: There is a saying in practical computing - RTFM. This is very important regarding misto, not reading the instructions, and not care about half fill only - you can just as well toss your money in the bin, your misto will soon break apart.First - the smell. Oh yes, when you open the shipment for the very first time, it smells bad poison!You always wash your new kitchen gadgets dont you?? When you wash your misto in proper lukewarm soapwater - and the smell is gone. It is a plastic bottle, not metal/aluminum as many believes, and must be washed properly as such!Next the handling, maybe best done by women, strong and large hands of man is not compatible with such a delicate product :-)There are several reviews here that describes this, in short fill it halfways, pump it 5 times and the misto is ready for use.Very very happy with this product, a must have for my kitchen!
