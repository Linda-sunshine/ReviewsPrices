review/summary: So comfortable they are a hindrance to early morningsreview/text: Many of my friends and family despise flannel sheets because they are stiff and stick together. That's because they have bought poor-quality sheets, not because flannel sheets themselves are a bad idea. Know the difference! These Pinzon flannel sheets are soft and fluffy and make it hard to get out of bed on a cold winter morning. I washed them when they first arrived and the lint trap was full, but nothing unexpected for sheets and towels. One test down. Then I laid down on them in black cotton yoga pants and T-shirt, just to see if they would leave fibers or pills on my clothes. They did not. Two tests down. But the real test was the next morning, when I hit my snooze alarm about a million times because I did not want to leave the comfort of my cozy bed. These sheets passed with flying colors! I purchased the sage sheets and the color is a soft, attractive green. Highly recommended! All these five-star reviews won't disappoint.
