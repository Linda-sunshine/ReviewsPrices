review/summary: So impressed with this SteamVac!review/text: Now I admit this is the first SteamVac or carpet shampooer I have ever used, so I don't have anything to compare it to... But I can say that I am VERY pleased with the initial results I have gotten from this SteamVac! It was relatively easy to put together out of the box and it came with a small starter bottle of cleaner, which I didn't realize. However, with a toddler in the house I do not want to use any cleaners with toxic chemicals, so I used BioKleen Carpet and Rug Shampoo and got fantastic results on all of our area rugs and doormats! I knew that a couple of my rugs saw a lot of foot traffic and looked a little dingy, but I couldn't believe just how gross the dirty water was after I emptied the tank! The rugs look almost like brand new! One other note, like some other reviewers have suggested, I did add boiling hot water to the hot tap water and was impressed with how hot the water stayed while I cleaned the rugs.Here are the points I like:- easy to use from the beginning for someone who has never used a carpet shampooer- easy to fill the clean water tank and empty the dirty water tank- it is visibly obvious that the machine is working -- you can see the dirty water and any residual water getting sucked up so you know when you've made enough dry passes to get the rug as dry as possible before letting it finish air drying- it has attachments to use on upholstery- there are two brush speeds so you can use a gentle setting if needed- it can be used to suck up spillsThe only thing I dislike about this SteamVac is that the dirty water tank has a lot of crevices that need extra rinsing out -- it seems unnecessary to the design of the tank in my opinion, but obviously I wouldn't know for sure about that!Overall I am quite thrilled with this purchase, especially having gotten it as a Black Friday deal!
