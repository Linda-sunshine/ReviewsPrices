review/summary: Excellent Electric Skilletreview/text: If you need a large electric skillet, you can't go wrong with the Presto 16 inch Electric Skillet. It is not expensive and it is the best electric skillet I have ever owned. It cook great and has all of the heat you need to cook with. The adjustable heat dial is easy to use appears to be fairly accurate.
