review/summary: Frustratingly unreliablereview/text: I bought my Keurig about 20 months ago. It worked fine for the first 10 months and then the problems started happening. Basically it won't work. I descaled it and left it unplugged and it worked fine for 3 more months. Then the problem reappeared and they are reoccurring with increased frequency. Today I think I have to read it its last rites. It's a pity, because I like the coffee and the convenience even though they come with a rather steep price. Now I am stuck with several boxes of K-cups and wondering whether to buy a new machine or not. I gave this product two stars for the quality of coffee and the convenience. The price and the frustrating unreliability of this pricey machine prevent me from awarding more stars. My advise: stay away from this machine.
