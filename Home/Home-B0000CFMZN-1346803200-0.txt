review/summary: Kitchen use of Measuring CUPSreview/text: I just ordered a 1 cup Pyrex Measuring cup after I read jeffnick's one star review. It gave me a chuckle: cooking is not a precise science and there are many variables involved. This is the reason why they use exactly calibrated measuring equipment in scientific laboratories, not Pyrex cups.
