review/summary: Cool Mist over the landfill...review/text: I think most of these "Adorable" misters end up on landfills quicker than they add moisture to the air in your room. Mine made it to three weeks. Cleaned it per the instructions, but the parts are pure Chinese junk.For every one thats returned, I'm sure most people just throw it away and try something else. There are many negative reviews for this product, but more within the last year. Originally years ago, it might have been made better. But even the Chinese now, are making their products without the slightest idea of pride or craftsmanship.Shame on CRANE for not making a very simple, uncomplicated product, right in the first place!
