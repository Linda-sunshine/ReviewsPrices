review/summary: LOVE THIS!review/text: This thing has AWESOME suction!! I can't believe how inexpensive such a powerful little machine is. I use it for vacuuming the car, cleaning up cat litter, edge cleaning around the house, sucking up spiders lurking near the ceiling...It fits all of my regular vacuum extensions. Also, the beater brush works great, too. I use it on stairs and the seats of my car for sucking up dog hair.Great little vacuum!
