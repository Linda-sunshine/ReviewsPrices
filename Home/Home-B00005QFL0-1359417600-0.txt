review/summary: Panasonic SD YD250 Automatic Bread Maker with Yeast Dispenserreview/text: There is no doubt about this product...I LOVE MY BREAD MACHINE ! This is the best machine you will find. It is so cute. It rests for about 45, first, then slaps around the mixture, sounds like it is getting slapped around a bit. I have to laugh everytime I hear it. At first It scared me into thinking there might be something wrong with the machine, but there is no need to worry, there isn't. It only happens at the first interval, but it is so comical. I can live with it. It does like to walk a bit, so don't have it too close to the edge of a counter, just incase your counter isn't quite level. The Bread comes out perfect everytime and the smell will wake you up easilly when no one else can. The bread takes 4 hours to make and can be time delayed to come out fresh and hot with your coffee in the morning. Just absolutely WONDERFUL ! I thank you PANASONIC for this AMAZING BREAD MACHINE. A WINNER ! I say look no further "The Best Bread Machine Ever" !
