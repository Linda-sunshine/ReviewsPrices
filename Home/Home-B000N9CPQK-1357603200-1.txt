review/summary: Way too noisy, and functions poorly.review/text: This air purifier is not worth the money spent. I should have listened to the other reviews. It is noisy, it intermittently rattles. After taking it apart and inspecting the root-cause, it seems the design in concept is good, but is missing one very important thing: a bushing on the drive shaft from the motor. If there was a bushing, it wouldn't rattle around and be so annoying. Besides the noise, it doesn't filter the air very well at all. Honestly, you would be better off buying a square box fan, a HVAC filter(one you would put in duct work) and wire tie it to the back. Which is what I did, and it works better than that cheap little air purifier. Oh, and don't be fooled by the ionizer, it is crap too(and no, that's not why it makes that noise).All in all, if you are only looking to purify air inside something small like a bathroom, you don't mind the very loud rattling, and are only looking to get about one month's worth of life out of the filter....than this is for you. Otherwise, just spend the money and get a nice one or go with my redneck box fan idea.
