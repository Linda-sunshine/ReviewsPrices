review/summary: excellent vacuum!review/text: I bought this to remove pet hair from my couch and it works SO well!! My only complaint is that it is quite heavy -- but a workout isn't necessarily a bad thing! I also love that you can switch the front nozzle to make it easier to vacuum vertically on stairs and what not. i love this thing!
