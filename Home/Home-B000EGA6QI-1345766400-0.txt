review/summary: Love it!review/text: I have never used an immersion blender prior to this one, but decided to purchase this one to make my son's baby food. It is much easier to clean versus a traditional blender and works pretty well. I do have to admit that it does take a bit more work to blend food than a traditional blender probably would, and I do have minor issues with small quantities, but the easier clean up is SO worth it.
