review/summary: Beautifulreview/text: I love this nativity set. It is both beautiful and simple. The pieces are fairly lightweight for their sizes, and are sturdy (sometimes our dog bumps into the shelf they are on, and we haven't had any issues). We will most likely expand our collection to some of the other pieces made by Willow Tree.
