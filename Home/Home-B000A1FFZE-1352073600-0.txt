review/summary: Toaster Worked Well Until It Didn'treview/text: I was excited to get this toaster and loved the fact that it could work as a toaster over or a toaster. This toaster worked extremely well for a month or two, then tonight it quit working for no apparent reason. While it worked well while it worked, I do not believe that the toaster was worth the money for only being able to use it for about two months.
