review/summary: I like it - 18 Month updatereview/text: I have been using this coffeemaker for about a year and a half now since purchasing it on Amazon. Overall I like it.Pros:- I like the simple retro toggle switch for turning on and off- It doesn't leak if used properly (it is important to make sure that the filter basket is pushed down firmly)- warming temperature control can be adjustedCons:- The display for setting time, etc is hard to read in dim light. I rarely use the extra features, so this is not a big con for me.Neutral:-Water filter. This adds extra cost to replace the filter every 3 months. I'm not sure if the filters are really needed unless you your water is very chlorinated. You can always just decide not to use the filters if you want though.
