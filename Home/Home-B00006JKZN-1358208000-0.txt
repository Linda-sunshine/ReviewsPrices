review/summary: Perfect waffles every time!review/text: I bought this to replace our old waffle maker that used to make mediocre waffles at best. This one from Cuisanart (and BB&B; with 20% coupon, sry Amazon) makes the perfect waffle every time. It's a stylish little machine that easily fits into a cupboard while not in use that had 5 different waffle settings. The higher the number the crispier it will be. Even on setting 5 the waffle will never burn but will come to a golden crisp neatly and evenly every single time.It's a non-stick surface but just to be sure, we use a quick burst of PAM oil on it first as I'm not too trusting of non-stick hard to clean products. Other waffle makers have been a nightmare to clean and because of that we just didn't have waffles as often. No problem now, I highly recommend this product, it's quite affordable and believe it comes with free super saver shipping. We give it 5 stars and 2x thumbs up!
