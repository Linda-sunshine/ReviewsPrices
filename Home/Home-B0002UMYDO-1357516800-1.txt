review/summary: Great Can Openerreview/text: I bought this for my wife as a Christmas gift and she loves it. I have to say it looks good in my kitchen with the rest of all my other stainless products. I actually really like the knife sharpener on the back and found it to be quite useful on some of my older knives.
