review/summary: Suitable for very small roomsreview/text: I purchased this along with the Lasko 5572 Oscillating Ceramic Tower Heater to provide localized heating rather than turning on whole house heater which doubles every winter. Instructions were easy and the unit plugged in and worked beautifully. Small rooms (10'x10' or smaller like a bathroom) will find this unit perfect, whereas larger areas are not likely to have the same effect.While I marked 5-stars, the main issue I have with both the units is the warning about the cord that it was only to go directly into wall outlet and not use extension cords or power-strips. The reason is that the cord heats up after an hour's use. Instructions even indicate to unplug from wall outlet when shut off. This leads me to think that the wire gauge is insufficient and likely to wear over time. Nevertheless, I follow the instructions and unplug from the wall more for safety sake than anyone reason. But really if the design were better this would not be necessary. Still I like the functionality and the ease of use.
