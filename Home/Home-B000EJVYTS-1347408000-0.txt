review/summary: I wouldn't have any other trashcan!review/text: I bought this back in January of 2010 and I am in love with this trashcan. Whenever I go to friends houses they always catching me waving in front of their trashcan's expecting them to open like mine does. in the past 2.5 years I have only had to change the batteries one time so far.Its so nice not to have to mess with opening/closing a trashcan lid. I actually find it a bit gross now to touch other people's trashcan lids lol.The 13 gallon bags I buy in boxes of 144 for $12 at walmart fit it perfectly as well.I am getting this trashcan for a few friends and family for christmas this year, I just hope it goes on sale soon! :) But its totally worth $60 to me.
