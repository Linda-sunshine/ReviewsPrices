review/summary: Nice System, Prime Issuesreview/text: This Keurig is great! When it is working... After about three months of no issues I now get the priming light once every three times I make coffee. Not a big issue, it's just annoying to have to do the toothpick and toothbrush trick when I'm in a rush to get to work. I am on a town water system, so I don't think it is the quality of the water. Other than that one minor issue, I like that you can set the Keurig to turn on at a certain time, adjust the water temperature, and even just run hot water out of it for making bag tea or hot chocolate (let's be honest, k-cup hot cocoa is so watered down it is essentially just brown water, even when you use the smallest cup setting ;) ) The cup size setting is crucial too! So convenient. A great little coffee system when it is functioning at 100%. I would definitely recommend this system to anyone looking to buy their first Keurig.
