review/summary: It is all about optionsreview/text: We were both a little hesitant, but we just love this little machine. It warms up fast from off, looks nice on the counter and most important we can each have what we want - robust French roast for him flavored coffee, tea or cider for me! Each time is a new choice. A second cup no problem. We waste less coffee and each cup is fresh. We drink lots of hot beverages at home, I estimate 40 K Cups per week, so my only hesitation is the waste generated from the containers. But the convenience makes up for that.
