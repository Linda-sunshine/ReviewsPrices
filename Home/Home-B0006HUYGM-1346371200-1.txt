review/summary: Almost perfect...review/text: Suction is great! Cleans the stairs, sofa, high hair really well! It's compact so it encourages me to clean. The only 2 problems I found: it could have a retractable handle for the stairs ( It feels a little heavy after vacuuming a few steps of the stairs, so an extra handle would provide me with a better standing position), and the filter, which I found to be a little annoying to clean because the dust gets really stuck to the filter material, so you either have to use a brush to clean (horrible because you breath in the dust) or you throw most of the dust in the trash and rinse the filter ( the option I chose). I ended up buying another filter to have it always ready in case the other one is wet or get damaged. I wish they came up with another filter! Like with anything it has pro and cons. I still think it's a good buy!
