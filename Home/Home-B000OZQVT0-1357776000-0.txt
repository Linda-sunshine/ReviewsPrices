review/summary: Real Flamesreview/text: These cans are neat, and though they say there is no smell, after 2 hours of burning three cans at once I noticed a smell.I have a very well defined sense of smell anyway, but I can't really say if it was good or bad. I just could smell them.They do put out the heat (3000 btu's per can). They crackle too, which is really nice.I will continue to buy them.
