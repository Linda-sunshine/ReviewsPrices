review/summary: Renewed my love of coffeereview/text: I've used a drip coffeemaker all my life. Since I've gotten this percolator, I'm seriously considering giving my drip coffee maker away to a good home. A percolator is not the quickest, easiest way to make coffee. However, there is nothing more wonderful than the smell of hot coffee in the air. And your coffee stays hot for at least 20 min after you pour it in your cup.This percolator is easy to assemble and the clear knob at the top makes it easy to see when the water is boiling. It's easy to clean and the basket holes are small enough that very little grounds gets into the coffee. If you like coffee and think that your drip coffee maker gives your coffee a weird taste, I would recommend a percolator.
