review/summary: very goodreview/text: I like this stainless steel kettle because it is detached from the base. When the water boils it turns itself off. the water stays hot for a long while. It is easy to clean inside and out. The lid pivots for filling and pouring water. The minor item I dont like is that it is not easy to fill it with the lid closed . I keep the lid open for filling and pouring.
