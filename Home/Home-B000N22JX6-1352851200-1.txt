review/summary: Warm and toastyreview/text: I love it! it is cute and doesn't look like a heater.In my bedroom and works great.Love the fact that it rotates and has a remote.Didn't even know that such a heater existed until I started looking.I used to have an old oil filled radiator type.This is so much better. Would recommend it to anyone.
