review/summary: Great product for the pricereview/text: This is my second Mill. I burned out the first one because I tried to grind too much coffee at one time and didn't let it cool down sufficiently between grindings. I have learned my lesson and only grind 18 cups at a time. I use a single cup coffee maker. The 18 cup setting on the Mill provides enough grounds for two 14oz. cups for 4 people.I highly recommend this product.
