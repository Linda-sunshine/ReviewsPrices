review/summary: bummerreview/text: The teeth inside of the motor section - where the attachment meets the motor - disintegrated on my 4th time using the thing. Warranty department will send me a new motor attachment but I pay the shipping on both the new part and the old broken one. $20. The whole thing brand new is $35 with free shipping on amazon. WTF!
