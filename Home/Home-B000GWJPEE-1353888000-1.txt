review/summary: Good but...review/text: I have owned two of these. The higher humidity is great but as we used it we started to notice that glossy things in the house got a white film over them. TV screens, DVDs, CDs, and books with glossy dust jackets all got a film on them that was easily removed but kind of a pain.
