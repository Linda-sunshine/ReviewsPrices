review/summary: inferior qualityreview/text: My 1st 12-cup Farberware peculator was a gift from my brother to convince me that perked is better than drip. He convinced me with just 1 cup. He purchased the peculator for less than $30 in upstate NY and it lasted for more than 8 years. My 2nd Farberware peculator was less than $40 (bought at K-Mart) and lasted around 3 or 4 years. My 3rd Farberware peculator cost around $50 (bought at JCP) and lasted less than 2 years. My determination to buy a peculator that lasted as long as my first has just died along with my 4th and LAST Farberware peculator that cost me more than $60 (also bought at JCP). In between the 12-cup Farberware peculators I purchased over the year, I tried several other brands but kept coming back to Farberware. I love the sleek, classy sturdy structure of the 12-cup stainless steel design, but the heating element in this peculator keeps burning out way to quickly. I wish Farberware would make their peculators the way they used to 20 years ago because THEY WERE THE BEST and that's unfortunate.
