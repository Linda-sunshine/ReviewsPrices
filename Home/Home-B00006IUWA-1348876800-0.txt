review/summary: awesome popperreview/text: I used to use a pot to cook my popcorn, but got tired of cleaning the buildup from the oils. This machine is really easy to use. You plug it in, pour in the popcorn and that's it. You don't need any oil, but you will need a big bowl to catch all the popcorn because sometimes they can shoot out of the spout.
