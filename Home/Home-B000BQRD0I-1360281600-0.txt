review/summary: Works OK when it works - lasts about one year averagereview/text: We've bought two of these steamers. For the price, it works pretty well, but it doesn't have a long life. We've had to buy replacements twice after a little over one year of use. Our last model that came was leaking out of the hose, but we called the manufacturer and they sent us a replacement part. The warranty is for one year, but unfortunately its been just over a year (1 year four months) and now it shorted out. We like the product OK but are getting tired of having to buy new ones!
