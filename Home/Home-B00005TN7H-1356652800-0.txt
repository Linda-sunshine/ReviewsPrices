review/summary: Great item!review/text: I use this with a laboratory vacuum pump, so it's a little inconvenient because I have to fetch the pump from the closet when I want to use this, but it does the job great! On vacuuming jars of flour, I just wish I could figure out how to add a filter or something to avoid getting flour in the vacuum line (I tried paper towel on top of the jar, but it doesn't work great).
