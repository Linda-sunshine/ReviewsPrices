review/summary: Unhappy customerreview/text: We purchased this coffee maker because of the reviews. I will be more cautious in the future. We had a Delonghi coffee maker and were very happy with it until the carafe broke. Did some research and purchased this one. The cap to the coffee maker holds water that you can't even get out without shaking it vigorously. I contacted the company and they kept sending me replacement caps. They all did the same thing. I even drilled holes in it for more drainage but it didn't help. Will buy something else the next time.
