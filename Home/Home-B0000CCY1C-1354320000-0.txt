review/summary: Nicereview/text: I like to do a lot of baking so thought that this would be a little nicer than the spoons I use...old fashion. I received this and the first thing that I noticed was the handles, push and release. It was a very nice handle. The glide back and forth was excellent. Was surprised at how excited I was to use them. Worth the money.
