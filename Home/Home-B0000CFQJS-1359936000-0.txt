review/summary: This filter is not 100% effectivereview/text: Having purchased this permanent filter with a new coffee maker only three days ago, we were immediately disappointed with it because of an oily film-residue appearing with every cup of coffee. It wasn't until less than an hour ago we discovered that this film-residue problem was directly related to this filter. One writer put it this way: "The metal filters don't trap the fine residue found in ground coffee as well as paper filters." We tested this by pouring 4 cups of recently brewed coffee directly into and through a paper filter. Voila! No oily residue in the cup, but the paper filter was black with the oily debris.
