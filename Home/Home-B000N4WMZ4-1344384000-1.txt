review/summary: Chipped inside and out.review/text: I got the Lodge Dutch oven for Christmas last year and was so excited! Sadly, after the first use the bottom splintered into tiny cracks and by the next use the enamel was starting to flake. By now there is a spot about the size of a half dollar where the enamel has flaked off on the bottom and another spot on the outside where the enamel has flaked as well. I won`t use it anymore.
