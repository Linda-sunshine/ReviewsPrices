review/summary: incredibly easy to usereview/text: Sunbeam 5891 2-Pound Programmable Breadmaker, WhiteMy wife and I purchased this machine in early August 2012. Already, we've made 2 dozen loaves of bread. Not all of them turned out how we expected, but only because we're still learning how to use the machine. It's incredibly simple to use. The machine does most of the work, but you still have too keep an eye on the process because of various factors such as room temperature,humidity, etc. Most of the loaves turned out as good or better than the breads I've made by hand! Purchase price was very affordable. We also like being able to select the size of the loaf.Overall, well worth the money spent.
