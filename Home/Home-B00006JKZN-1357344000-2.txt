review/summary: Bought a used one and it is like newreview/text: We have recently moved to a &#34;paleo&#34; diet and have been making non-flour containing pancakes. We bought a waffle iron to allow for freezing of Paleo waffles for eating during the week. Our old one was 22 years old, and the technology and uniformity of this cuisinart is amazing compared to the ancient one. The waffles came out perfectly, though they had no flour in them. They did stick a little and required some coconut spray. Cleanup was simple, with a wet cloth, and we are ready to go again next weekend. We used the iron on a &#34;2&#34; setting, though it goes to &#34;5&#34;, &#34;2&#34; was perfect for our Paleo waffles and they were crisp on the outside and moist on the inside.Only problem was the awful smell with the initial use. It got better over time though, and a little ventilation solved the problem.
