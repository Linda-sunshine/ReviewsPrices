review/summary: plenty of power! but bulkyreview/text: there is a reason this item has so many reviews that give it 5 stars. it's impressive.2 motors, one for the vacuum and the other to run the rotary brushes, so you can run just the suctionwhen using the hose. well planned design for storage of cord and the cleaning wand.the vacuum is a bit large and bulky, but it is need to house the motors which are very adequate.this vacuum has plenty of power.when I got it, I thought I would &#34;test it&#34; on the couch.I was so impressed that I ended up cleaning the couch, loveseat and chair that where in the room!buy it, you will have no regrets
