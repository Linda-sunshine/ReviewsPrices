review/summary: Smelly, moldy filters instantly!review/text: I hate this humidifier. I was hoping for something that humidifies and filtered the air - but this makes it worse. Leave the unit off for 12 hours and there is a blast of musty, moldy air that rushes out. Filters last but a week before they smell like this. I wish I still had the box so I could return this to the manufacturer!
