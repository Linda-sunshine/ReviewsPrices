review/summary: Excellent toolreview/text: As a novice canner, I am not familiar with all the equipment that makes canning easier and safer. So when I saw this tool I knew I had to get it. How in the world do you get the lids out of hot water without it? Carefully! This less than $4 device did exactly what it was supposed to do. It has good grip and it's long just in case your pot is deep. I used the other end to remove air bubbles from my jar. If you need one of these I highly recommend this one.
