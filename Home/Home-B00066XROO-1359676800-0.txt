review/summary: Works very wellreview/text: I had the smaller version of this product, and decided to move to this one. I love the size of it - now making pancakes on a Saturday morning is much faster than using one small pan. It heats fairly evenly. I've noticed one or two somewhat cooler spots, but nothing too bad. It heats up quickly, and maintains a nice, steady temperature. It's much easier than a pan that is constantly going up and down in temperature. I'd recommend this to people, and the only real problem is that since it's so big, it can be a little hard to find a place to store it.
