review/summary: This is the iron.review/text: You know, you pick up the iron and you iron your clothes and you don't really think about it. You have an iron, you have clothes, you plug it in, you smear the iron around on the clothes and hopefully they come out looking less wrinkled than before. This was my system until I was a houseguest of someone who had a Rowenta iron, which I used and was shocked and amazed that there could be such differences in irons. It was as though I had been using a rock before. At home I had a $25 Sunbeam iron that I never thought twice about, it worked pretty well. Then I used the Rowenta and learned that it was possible to get a drycleaners-level press on clothes at home. I became determined to upgrade my iron. Kind of a weird thing to be determined to do, but whatever. I have to dress nicely for my job so it's important that I not look wrinkled. I started shopping around for a Rowenta and Rowenta irons are really expensive, you know, for an IRON. It was a slow day at work so I did the research on iron comparisons and discovered this little beauty at $40-some dollars. I have only used it once but it worked as well as the Rowenta I had previously used. Its face is not as large so it doesn't cover as much surface area at a time, and it has fewer steam holes, but functionally it is on par with those $150 irons. I will take the $110 I saved and buy 3 new shirts to iron.
