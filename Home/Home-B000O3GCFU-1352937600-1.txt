review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I purchased two of these for my daughters. Both leaked in their lunch bags. My oldest daughter had lunch 5 hours after filling the thermos and on both occasions the food was cold. My youngest child had lunch 4 hours after filling the thermos and she complained the food was barely warm. Very disappointed with this product. Will only be using these for Mac n cheese or similar foods that taste okay at room temp.
