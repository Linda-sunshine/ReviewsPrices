review/summary: Good Choicereview/text: This cool mist humidifier works great. We were having too much static electricity in game/computer room. This instantly helped. Some reviews said this does not have an automatic setting...not true. You can set it to various fan speeds and the unit will turn on/off as needed based on humidity. The two tank idea is good and they are easy to fill and replace.The only drawback of this was the color. We thought this would be more of an ivory or tan unit based on the photo. However, it is plain white.
