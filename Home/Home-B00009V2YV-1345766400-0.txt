review/summary: Thumbs up for Midalnd WR300 Weather Radio.review/text: Great weather alert radio. Thumbs up for Amazon carrying what Radio Shack dropped. I've had one for years and love it's program capabilities. We initially programmed it for our county and all counties that share a boundary. Our thought was that any bad weather in these counties could come our way. Plus we had relatives in some of those contiguous counties and we knew they didn't all have weather radios. We eventually found that programing it for just our county worked best. Now we get all Advisories, Watches, and Warnings for our county.The radio worked great for years until something - best guess a surge - knocked out the radio and other electronic devices on the same circuit. That's why I bought another. However, before the new radio arrived, the existing devices returned to working condition. (Don't ask me why. I'm not a scientist. God? It wouldn't surprise me.) Now I've got a great spare that I look upon as insurance.For the price and features it can't be beat!
