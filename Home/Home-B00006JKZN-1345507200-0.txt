review/summary: Great waffle maker for people who DON'T want Belgian wafflesreview/text: This is a great waffle maker, period. But it is great because it does NOT make the large-holed belgian waffles. For those who are looking for an appliances that does not make waffles with the huge holes, this is it! (They are hard to find!)PROS:- light tells you when the waffle is ready, so you don't have to guess and open the applicance in the middle of cooking and ruin the waffle- you can set how light or dark you want the waffle cooked- small, does not take up all your counter space- durable, we have had to it for 2 years now and it still works- makes waffles with SMALL holes!!!- fast Amazon shipping, which is always greatCONS:- none so far, this 5 star rating
