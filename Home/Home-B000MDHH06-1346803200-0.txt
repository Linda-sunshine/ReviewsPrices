review/summary: quality at an affordable pricereview/text: Alot of value fof the money. Very impressed with this juicer. Well made and i believe it will last. It does take a good 5 minutes to clean properly, screen. Appears to extract alot of juice from fruits and vegetables. This is one powerful little puppy. Highly recommend.
