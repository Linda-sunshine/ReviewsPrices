review/summary: Wonderful tool to help with healthy eatingreview/text: I bought this spiral vegetable slicer after searching for it in about 4 kitchen stores, this was the only place I could find it, and for a great price. I LOVE this slicer. I mostly use it to make zucchini pasta so that I can eat healthy , low-carb, and wheat free. It took me about a minute or two to figure out, and was able to make perfect pasta with my first zucchini. Easy to clean. The only negative is that it's a bit bulky, and therefore a bit hard to store. But all spiral vegetable slicers are bulky, so it's not a negative with this particular product.
