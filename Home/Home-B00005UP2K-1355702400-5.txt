review/summary: Woohoo!review/text: Maybe it is unfair to rate it a 5 because I've never owned another to compare it to, but I got this for my girlfriend for her birthday to make 30 dozen cookies to send to troops in Afghanistan and it worked great! We had 5 ladies all baking cookies and at the center of it all was her new majestic yellow mixer. It didn't miss a beat, pardon the pun. Since then I've used it to bake bread about every night this last week (I work from home half the time) and I truly like it better than our bread machine. You have to roll out the loaf, but then your left with real loafs instead of bread machine loafs. It is big enough to mix dough for two loaves of bread and batter for multiple dozen cookies, yet small enough to make a packet of instant muffins. Very very pleased. It is more expensive than the other brands but there are reasons for that. It is made out of metal, it is heavy duty, it is made in the USA. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to a friend.
