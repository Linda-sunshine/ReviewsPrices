review/summary: Choppin Broccolli...review/text: Well, I got this as a replacement for a Cuisinart and there are some positives and negatives. It chops well and the motor is pretty strong. However, when you put anything in, there's a tendancy for food to get in the hole that fits into the motor top. This and the underside of the blade can get food in them and are a little tough to clean. Also, if you make something like egg salad, it can be a little difficult to clean the underside of the motor. With that popped off for rinsing. There are apparently problems with the bowl breaking, but I haven't used it nearly enough for that to happen. I'm pretty happy with it and got it for a good price and it is serving it's purpose. If you need one, you could do worse.
