review/summary: Works great and saves time.review/text: I Love the Hot Shot Water Dispenser - I have had one at work for over a year and now have added one to our house and sent one to our son at college. It is quick and very convenient. For my son who is living in a college dorm - he says it has saved him a lot of time. No longer does he have to go down the hall and heat water in a kettle - he now has hot water for tea, coffee, soup or oatmeal in about 30 seconds.
