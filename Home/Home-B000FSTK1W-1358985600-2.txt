review/summary: I was really excited about it but it does not stick!review/text: I followed the directions which ask you to clean surface with alcohol swab, let completely dry, then after some middle steps, you place sticky tabs on wall and hold down for 30 seconds firmly. Then leave for 24 hours if it is on a tile surface. I did this then attached the plastic crate and all of my stuff came toppling down in the shower a few hours later. They provided extra strips so I did this process again. I made sure to hold them down even longer with firm pressure. I let it sit without attaching plastic crate for over 48 hours this time to make sure it would work the next time. Again everything came toppling down. The sticky things obviously will no longer attach so now i am stuck with this plastic piece of crap that will do nothing for me.Some notes about the placement. In my shower on tile. It's a bath/shower combo so i placed the rack across from the shower head so it is far away from where the water sprays (about 6 feet). The tile wall stays dry and far from any splashing.Really disappointed in this product. Was hoping that it would have worked as it said.
