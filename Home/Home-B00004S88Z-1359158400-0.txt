review/summary: Most valuable item in my kitchen!review/text: I researched this pressure canner for almost two years before I took the plunge and parted with a large sum of cash. This is now the most valuable piece of equipment in the kitchen, and I'm in pressure canner love! I've water bathed a lot of jams, jellies, and tomatoes, but was always chicken to move into the pressure canners. All those cartoons of the cooker exploding just didn't do much to instill confidence in my ability to can something and remain in one piece after the fact. I knew if I really wanted to save the garden produce this coming summer, I figured I'd better learn how to do it once and for all. Over the past two years, I've frozen a lot of fresh grown veggies that I ended up throwing out because freezer burn or wilt destroyed them.I've canned two large batches of bean soup and beef stew, and it was so easy and nearly foolproof that I thought, "why didn't I do this sooner?!?" This canner is built like a sherman tank, and I often joke I could wear this on my head into battle because it's indestructible. I don't think I'll ever end up buying another canner in my life, and that thought alone makes the investment in this worth every single penny. Plus not having to worry about whether or not a rubber gasket is in good working order, or if it's broken and needing replacement and unable to find one is other big reason I never bought sooner. You never can find parts these days - instead, you have to plunk down another large chunk of cash on a new canner. You'll never have that issue with this beast!
