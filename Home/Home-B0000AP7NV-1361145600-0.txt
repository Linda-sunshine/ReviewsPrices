review/summary: good slim filtered water pitcherreview/text: was looking for a filtered water pitcher that wouldn't take up too much space but was big enough to be worth the purchase- this product nailed it. I don't put it in the door but it would fit, just much easier in a shared living space to fit this into the mix of stuff than the full size pitchers. easy setup, order came quick, and has the handy little static sticker to tell you when to replace the filter. it only holds about 2 regular size cups but it takes seconds to fill it back up, good choice if you're looking to save space and get filtered water.
