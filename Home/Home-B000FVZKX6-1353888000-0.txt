review/summary: OMG!! These are some very nice flannel sheets.review/text: OMG! I can't believe how thick and soft and comfy these flannel sheets are. I washed them before putting them on the bed the first time, and almost no lint in the lint trap. They are generous in size, so there will be no slipping off the mattress. I am so in love with these sheets, that I went to work and raved about them and am purchasing a set for each one of my grown children. I would highly recommend these flannel sheets. Well worth the price!!
