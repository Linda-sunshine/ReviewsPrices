review/summary: The Breville &#34;Pulp Volcano&#34; - It Juices but decorates my ceiling too.review/text: Like many of you, I watched the documentary about the two fellows who lost a bunch of weight by juicing. Having juiced off and on for several years, I decided to take the plunge and get this juicer. Certainly, it does juice the vegetables and fruit - they go in and juice comes out. The problem lies in that a respectable amount of pulp shoots out the top of the juicer and decorates my counter tops and ceiling. At first my &#34;monster truck mentality&#34; was greatly amused and I even issued several &#34;yee-haws&#34; but after being assigned clean up duty by my even less-amused wife, I too quickly tired of the mess made while juicing. My correspondence with Breville has been less-than-satisfactory, and I await further response on how to reduce the pulp volcano. If any other owners of this unit have suggestions on pulp control let me know in the comments!!!!
