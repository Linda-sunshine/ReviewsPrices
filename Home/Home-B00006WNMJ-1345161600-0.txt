review/summary: Great Filter!review/text: Our water is so disgusting, I had to find a filter or accept that all the nasty stuff in our tap water was going to end up inside of me, YUK! I did my research, and I purchased the Culligan filter. I remember as a child, my father, who was a chemical research scientist, installed the whole house Culligan system. As an adult, I always had water delivered to my home in those big bottles. I had 5 children, and no way was I going to allow them to drink the tap water. I even used it for the dog and cat as well! I lived in GA for a few years and we had our own well, which was wonderful water, but I still used a Culligan whole house filter. Now that I'm a senior and living in an apartment, I still want filtered water, so the sink mounted filter is a must. I love it! I think it's very effective, water tates great, and the unit is attractive and user friendly. It simply moves out of the way when not using it. The little "pin" that automatically pops back in to revert back to tap water works well for me. After about a month it didn't works as quickly, but if you keep your unit clean, it does work well! I pour a little white vinegar over it occasionally to remove any calcium deposits that may have gathered around the pin mechanism. It's been a couple of months and I see no sign of the water flow slowing down yet, but ordered a new filter to have on hand when it does. I think the replacement filter is too expensive, but compared to buying bottled water, it seems the better choice. I still buy the convenient 16oz water bottles to have for travel or just because I like them, but now I usually refill them from my faucet filter. All in all, I am completely satisfied with the Culligan Faucet Filter!
