review/summary: Good N Sharpreview/text: I needed a good chef's knife for a dozen reasons, this fits all of them, although I still prefer a cheap food processor for making salsa, etc. It's sharp and wide enough to safely slice anything and it doesn't rust like the made in who knows when vanadium knife I had been using, which rusted after I sharpened it when left in water. the handle seems overrated, basically plastic that seems slightly more grippy when your hand is wet? OK, whatevs, I still like it, and it beats the more expensive knives for the purposes of home chefifications.
