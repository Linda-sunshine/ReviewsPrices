review/summary: Great for a tea drinker like me!review/text: I had one of those cheap USB powered drink warmers and that just wasn't cutting it for me. I got this one and it works almost perfectly! The reason I only gave it four stars was because of two reasons. First this will only keep a drink that's already hot nice and warm, if you have a drink that's cooled off it won't warm it back up. This isn't a big issue for me most of the time, but I have been known to take my mug off the warmer to take a sip, and then just put it on the table, not the warmer, and it just cools down. The second part is it doesn't have any sort of automatic shut-off timer. I do a lot of work at my desk so I'll have a cup of tea with me most of the day. I've often gotten up to do other things and forgotten a half drank mug of tea on it. It gets annoying since, depending on how much liquid is left in it, it'll kind of dry up on the sides, and if it's a coffee and milk/cream drink it'll kind of thicken and congeal and be generally gross. It'd be nice it it had a couple different options on the switch for different hour increments, like &#34;2hr&#34;, &#34;4hr&#34;, &#34;8hr&#34;, and &#34;always on&#34;. But that's not a deal breaker and otherwise this product works very well.
