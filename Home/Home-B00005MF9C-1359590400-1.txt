review/summary: Good for a quick daily cupreview/text: I bought this for a quick brew of a cup every morning. It takes 10min to brew and clean up. Very convenient. The coffee actually tastes amazingly good. I've had this for a 3 months, and the coffee quality is still great, considering the coffee maker is made of plastic.
