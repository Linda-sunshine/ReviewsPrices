review/summary: Clean the hepa filter with air compressorreview/text: The power on this Dirt Devil is awesome when you first put a new filter in. After just cleaning 1 room, the canister filled up quickly, which makes it clear that the previous 10 years of vacuuming didn't do very much except kick dust around. If you are using a vacuum with a bag, the vacuum's suction power will decrease as the bag gets more filled with each successive cleaning.So the caveats for this Dirt Devil is that the suction stays strong as long as you have a clean filter, which is pretty much clogged after the canister gets filled. If you have an air compressor, you need to blow clean the HEPA filter outdoors to blow off all the dust.You also will need to empty the canister into a garbage bag outdoors, since you are going to have to shake the canister which kicks up a lot of dust and you can use the air compressor to blow out the rest. The clear canister is beneficial to see how fast it fills up (it fills up fast).Pros:powerful vacuum, bag-lessCons:HEPA filter clogs fast, and emptying canister is messy** With an air compressor to clean it, and you don't mind going outside to dump the canister, it is 10x better than any previous vacuum cleaners we've had.
