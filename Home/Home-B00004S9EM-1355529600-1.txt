review/summary: Love this processorreview/text: I really have to highly recommend the Cuisinart Pro Classic food processor. Compared to others that I have used, this thing is night and day more powerful. It's easy to set up, easy to use, works very well and cleans up easily. The sound of the motor in this thing is intense, and it had made short work of anything I have chopped in it so far.
