review/summary: So Comfortable!review/text: I received my Sleep Joy 2" mattress topper yesterday and unfolded it and placed it on my mattress right away. It was pretty tightly packed and full of creases and dents but I came back a couple of hours later to see that it was completely unfolded/undented and fit perfectly on my queen size mattress!I put the mattress pad on top of it and made the bed as usual. Wow, what a difference! My mattress is old and not very forgiving on my back and sides so this extra 2" of memory foam make all the difference. The feeling of laying down for the first time on my old bed with this new topper on there was wonderful! Mine has a very light green tea scent which actually is very soothing.All in all I'm very, very happy with this purchase. Especially at the price ($63). I'm not sure I would buy one of these for the SRP of $249, though.
