review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: There are a lot of positive reviews about this grinder so I thought after my old DeLonghi white coffee grinder failed (after 10 years) this model would be perfect. The price wasn't too dear, either.Not happy with my purchase, though. The coffee beans are ground but not as finely as my old DeLonghi used to grind them. The motor is powerful enough but when I run it for ten seconds I can definitely smell something getting hot in there, like a lubricant or some wire overheating (the smell has diminished over the last two weeks). The worst part is the end result: The coffee grinds are caked along the metal bottom of the grinder. They're packed in there so well you need to scrape them out - I'm not talking about gently tapping them out, you have to scrape them out with a stiff baking brush. The smaller ground particles tend to stick to the plastic surfaces, too, so that when you up-end the unit to dump the coffee small particles fly all over your countertop. Some coffee did statically stick to my DeLonghi but not like what I get now.This is a significant departure from my old DeLonghi (which I bought at BJ's wholesale store a long, long time ago). I definitely have buyer's remorse over this one. I think its oval shape and gap from the inner wall to the blade ends makes it easy for the coffee grinds to be thrown against and compacted into the bottom bowl. It does grind coffee and it's large button is slightly easier than the small button on the DeLonghi, which is why I gave it two stars. I can't wind up the cord either like I could with the DeLonghi. I miss that grinder.I believe I'm going to use this for large nuts and spices instead of coffee, and look for an improved grinder instead. I am very disappointed with the Krups Coffee Grinder.
