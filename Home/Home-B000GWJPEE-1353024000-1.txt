review/summary: This is a wonderful product!review/text: This is the best humidifier I've ever used....SO much better than the ones I used for my kids when they were small. It's quiet, easy to use, and affordable. After reading Consumer Reports (this placed #2 in the "best buy" category) I bought this one for myself for sleeping as my home gets VERY dry in the winter. I have a temp/humidity thermostat in my 12'x 16' bedroom and it's easy to adjust the Crane vapor output to correlate to the humidity reading. The only problems mentioned in other reviews that I've encountered are:1. It does "burble" a bit when turned up high. This doesn't bother me but if it drives you crazy, dial it down.2. The light was a bit bright for my taste so I covered it with 2 small strips of silver duct tape. This still leaves enough light so the unit can be seen.Here are some other suggestions:1. As another reviewer suggested, read and follow the directions!2. As directed, I use filtered water (have a "Pur" on my kitchen faucet) and find that one night's usage only requires about 1/3 of a fill.3. To reduce the need for extra cleaning, I discard leftover water from both the body and base and dry-cloth wipe both (this only takes a couple of minutes and I do it immediately after turning the unit off first thing in the a.m.) so there's no standing water anywhere.4. Personally, I leave all components set up on a vinyl covered TV tray near an outlet located about 2 ft. from the bed and out of the way. I can see how placement could be tricky with small kids so just be sure to place it on a FLAT surface, perhaps also on a vinyl placemat in case of spills.
