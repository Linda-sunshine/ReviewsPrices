review/summary: works finereview/text: Have been very happy with the coffee pot so far. I have been using it only about a month. I believe that the coffee taste better than all the drip pots I have owned. It keeps the coffee quite hot, which was my beef with the drip pots. Amazingly, it will keep the coffee still tasting good even 3 hours later. I do use a a paper filter. The sample pack that came with it works best, as you will have no grounds at all in the coffee. But, if you are only putting in 4 TB. of grounds the flat ones work fine. I am so far quite pleased with my purchase. I did see some one saying they only last 1 year. I would hope to get more than that amount of time from it. We will see. I do wash it out everyday with soap and water.
