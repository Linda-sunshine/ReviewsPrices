review/summary: Great valuereview/text: Love this juicer as it is so easy to use and clean. It takes so little time to take apart, clean and put back together. I use a bottle brush for a few seconds on the one part. I use it several times a week. I've never had a problem but do a small amount of prep with the fruits and vegetables, cutting the bigger pieces before turning it on. Greens go through nicely. It's gorgeous, too, reminding me of an Airstream trailer! I had one of the cheaper juicers but it had to be cleaned in the middle of juicing and was hard to get clean. It also balked at juicing some veggies. Not this one!
