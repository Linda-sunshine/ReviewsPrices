review/summary: 7 yearsreview/text: I bought my Cuisinart thermal coffee maker in 2005 (from Amazon) and it's still going strong. It gets used every day, some days more than once. I never thought it would last this long. It's a great coffee pot and when it finally does die, I plan to buy the same one again.
