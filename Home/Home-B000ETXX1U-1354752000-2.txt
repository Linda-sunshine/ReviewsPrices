review/summary: Easy to use and very comfortablereview/text: We bought this mattress when we were getting ready to move from one state to another. We slept on it for three days straight in one house and another two days in the new house. It's very comfy, doesn't have the &#34;center roll&#34; issue that most inflatable mattresses have, and the auto-fill pump sits at your head so that even if you're half asleep and need to add a little air, you just reach over your pillow, flip a switch, and wait a few seconds. Done. From flat to full? Maybe 3 minutes, tops. Even though this is a queen size mattress, you will need a king size fitted sheet. Queen size is fine for all other linens. Great buy for our immediate use, and we'll use when people come to visit, too.
