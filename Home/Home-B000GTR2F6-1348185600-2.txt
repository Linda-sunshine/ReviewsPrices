review/summary: Convenience comes at a cost to qualityreview/text: I've tried many of the different coffee blends available for the Keurig. It certainly is convenient, however nothing that comes out of it can hold a candle to even the cheapest of drip machines. Granted, I know a lot of people out there aren't huge coffee connoisseurs so if all you need in the morning is something to supply your daily caffeine dose, then the Keurig is great for you.For me however, it's just not worth it. If you're a true coffee lover like me, then set aside 5 extra minutes in the morning and get a single serve french press and electric kettle. Hell you can even heat the water in the microwave if you don't want the kettle.Even if this thing made good coffee, it's still not worth it to me. For one, when all is said and done, you wind up paying a hell of a lot more per pound of coffee when you buy K-Cups than you do buying whole beans or preground. And good lord, the trash it generates; of course you could alleviate this by getting a reusable refillable k-cup, but then whats the point of even having the machine then if you're gonna fill your own k-cups? You may as well just get a single serve french press.So in conclusion, if you can deal with the downsides, drink coffee only for the caffeine and not the flavor, then go for it if you need the convenience. Otherwise, stay far away from this thing. It's an expensive device that produces expensive mediocre coffee.
