review/summary: no zippered nylon bag??review/text: I'm a HUGE fan of my Aeropress! I make myself a coffee with it almost every day and make coffee for friends with it all the time. Just bought one as a gift for a friend and when it arrived...I was disappointed to see that it didn't come with a zippered bag like mine has. Unfortunately it's a gift and it has to be ready to give before I could get another one shipped to me.The zippered bag is inexpensive but mine has held up well enough. I use it when I take my press with me. I don't travel with the funnel or the stirrer... If I didn't have a zippered bag I would be shopping for a bag to go with it.It looks like some of the Aeropresses on Amazon DO come with a zippered bag and some do not. I assumed they all would. If you think you'll take your Aeropress with you, to work, to school, or camping, you'll probably appreciate having a bag to go with it.
