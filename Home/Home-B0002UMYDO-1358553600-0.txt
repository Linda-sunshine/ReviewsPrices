review/summary: It works ! It's Red !!review/text: This looks really good in my kitchen.The cans are easy to fit into the blades and &#34;round it goes&#34; to make a good cut! The lid stays in place until I remove the can.It has a bottle opener on the back .It is heavy and stays in place while being used.For a counter top can opener , this is the one for you.
