review/summary: Love my Pro 600review/text: I bought this when I happened to find it on an amazing deal ($260) and I am very happy with it. I wanted a kitchenaid mixer for a long time and I was about to buy one of the smaller ones since I found it on sale for $190 but then I came across this one and couldn't pass up the deal. I was worried about the reviews saying they broke because of the gear box, so the first thing I did was took off the top and sure enough it was the metal gear box. All the new ones have the metal or else they probably would keep braking, but I have made everything in this and never had a problem. I've made cookie dough, bread, cake, whipped cream, and a variety of other stuff, and never even thought this couldn't handle it. I'll admit I don't use it every day, maybe a few times a week, usually to shred meat in it with the flat blade (which works great to do that by the way) and it works great for me.
