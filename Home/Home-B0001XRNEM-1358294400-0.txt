review/summary: This is a great espresso tamper.review/text: This is a great espresso tamper. I have a large Espressione espresso machine and a smaller IMUSA espresso machine with different size portafilters/filter baskets, this tamper is perfect to be used with both machines. It has a good solid feel and is a good weight for tamping down my espresso. It so good my daughter took it with her to college, so just ordered another one.
