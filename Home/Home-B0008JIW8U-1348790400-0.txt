review/summary: Exceptional!review/text: I recently returned to Target to get a new DRX5 coffee maker. I've had one for at least 5 years and I finally dropped the carafe and decided, for the price, to just buy a new coffeemaker. Much to my surprise Target didn't seem to stock them anymore. So I looked on Amazon and there they were. This is the best small coffee maker ever! The best feature for me is the taste of my coffee and the speed. If friends are over and I want to make more, this baby brews a second pot in about 3 minutes and every pot is sensational (I do use good coffee). The programmable feature is super easy and works perfectly. Hard to believe they can charge this little for such a great coffee maker.
