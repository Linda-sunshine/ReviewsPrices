review/summary: Love this griddlereview/text: This was just what I was looking for! After struggling for years to clean the electric griddle that I own, this works perfectly and is very easy to clean. Having a grill side and a griddle side make it perfect and it's easy to store. It is heavy, but then, it's cast-iron.
