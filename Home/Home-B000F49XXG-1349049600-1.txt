review/summary: Serviceable espresso makerreview/text: We bought this machine 6 weeks ago to replace a comparably priced machine (by Mr. Coffee). The price was right around $90. For an "afforable" espresso maker, this is fine. It has a small countertop footprint and makes okay espresso. We haven't tried making foam with the jet frother, so I can't say yea or nay about it. Truth be told, the Mr. Coffee made a richer tasting espresso with thick crema on top. Not so with this Delonghi machine. Several days after receiving the Delonghi machine, Mr. Coffee sent a replacement machine (the original was still under warranty), and we've put away the Delonghi machine for the time being. What does it say that the Mr. Coffee machine went bad after only 8 months? I guess that buying an espresso maker in the "affordable" category means you run the risk of seeing it conk out before a year is up.
