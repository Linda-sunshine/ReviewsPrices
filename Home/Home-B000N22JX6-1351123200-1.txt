review/summary: Lasko 6435 Oscillating Heater w/Remotereview/text: I agree with others that this heats a small room well, looks good (smaller than you think though), and the oscillation and timer functions are a plus.With that said...I had to return first one because on the 2nd day it started to lightly buzz and wouldn't stop.Tried repositioning it, etc. to no avail. Overall the unit is relatively quiet, but this buzz was a deal breaker. (Didn't buzz while beginning to oscillate, but it did several seconds later when it seemed heater element started)Replacement must have been an older model (or the 1st one was) because the remote is COMPLETELY different & unreadable ....at least compared to the first one which was great. I was going to return it again because it's an annoyance, but then I noticed the current listing has this terrible remote in the picture. They must have cut corners on the "new remote" which has no face plate and a soft, dust attracting, rubber. The button icons are just the black rubber slightly raised....impossible to read. I will use white appliance paint or grey sharpie and mark the buttons even though I'm not sure I'll use it much because the timer is great. Just set it to 1 or two hours (upto 4) when going to bed and it shuts itself off.Recommended for the price and performance, with some issues.
