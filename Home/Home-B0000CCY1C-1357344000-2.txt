review/summary: comfortable to usereview/text: These cookie scoops are comfortable to use and the cookie dough is cleanly swept out by the blade. I bought a different brand at meijer for the small scoop...which I didn't order...after seeing how easy to use these scoops are. I took the one I bought at Meijer back.
