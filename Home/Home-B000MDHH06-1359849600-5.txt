review/summary: Impressed!review/text: This is my first juicer and I am so pleased with how easy this was to use the minute I got it out of the box. It's quiet, super efficient and if you follow the directions, it's a snap to clean. I recommend washing it the minute you finish juicing. The first day I used it I realized I needed to use a lot more of the fruits and veggies I had available, but the second day, I prepped everything first and then started popping them in the machine. Excellent! I would more than recommend this product and the price was just right! Enjoy, I know I will.
