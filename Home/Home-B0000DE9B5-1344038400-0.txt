review/summary: Versatile sealed pitcher -- remember to shop around for best pricereview/text: It is nice to see high quality, modestly-priced goods still being manufactured in Europe. Oringally, I purchase to this jug to make Limoncello. In order to make Limoncello, lemon zest must soak in highly volatile grain alcohol for several weeks. The Bormioli Rocco Frigoverre jug is perfect for such a concoction as its hermetic seal traps both liquids and potentially flammable vapors. Yet, it is far from merely being a storage bottle. This jug is highly functional with a sturdy handle and a highly space efficient square footprint that provides a 2.25 liter capacity. Hence, it is good for both preparing and serving beverages.With 1.75 liters of 192 proof grain alcohol (Polmos Rectified Spirits) and about 150 grams of lemon rind, I have aggressively shaken the jug upside down multiple times over a weeklong period without any leaks. This is impressive because pure ethanol is a solvent. Despite having potentially corrosive contents, the hermetic seal held up quite well.The one minor issue with the design of this jug is that is that the user needs to hold the lid as the inner handle is rotated to engage the seal. This could potentially lead the unsuspecting user to overlook the lack of a complete seal, which may cause a spill. Yet, this is a minor flaw that can easily be managed.Note: the price for this product various quite significantly. The Container Store price was less than half of the Amazon price - for the exact same sized 77 ounce jug.
