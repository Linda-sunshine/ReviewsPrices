review/summary: pizza stone might have been a better optionreview/text: I like this pan for cooking pizza lot, the main problem I have with it is that I usually use a pizza stone to help my oven hold heat as well and just left it in the oven full time. You can't do that with a cast iron pan, the seasoning flakes off and you have to re-season it before using it then. Keeping that in mind, it has still been really useful both on the stove and in the oven, it is much more versatile than a stone would be.
