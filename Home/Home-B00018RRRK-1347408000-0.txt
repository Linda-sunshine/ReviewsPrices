review/summary: Acceptable performance, with a couple of caveatsreview/text: My main complaint about this unit, which I've been using for more than a year now, is that it is very difficult to replace the bin into the unit unless you hit the alignment exactly right. Many times I have had to give up and walk away rather than slam the thing to the floor. Other than that, yeah the static problem and lack of rounded corners makes it hard to empty out completely and clean up.
