review/summary: Wonderful addition to my cookwarereview/text: A very nice heavy weight pan. I have used it almost daily since Christmas. I hadn't bought a non-stick pan in years, but this was nothing like I remember those flaky (literally) pans I had tried in the past. Things cook evenly, and clean up is a breeze.
