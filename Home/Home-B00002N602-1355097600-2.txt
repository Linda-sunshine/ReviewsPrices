review/summary: Great for the pricereview/text: Pros:Sturdy. No issues with the handles.Has good safety features.Its steel so that food doesnt stick to the container unlike aluminium ones. Also steel might last longer.Easily cook rice for 4 people at a time.Cons:You need to wait and watch when it cooks so that food wont overcook/burn or keep timers.Unlike Indian pressure cookers which give whistles! You only need to count the whistles in them and you can switch off!
