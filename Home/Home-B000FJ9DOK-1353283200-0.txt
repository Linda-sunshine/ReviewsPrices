review/summary: I like this thermos!review/text: I bought this bottle on September 3, 2011, and for today it has been used for a little more than 1 year, so I feel confident that this review can help to anybody who is thinking about to buy this product.I have been using it to carry just cold water, and for me fulfill its mission everyday, below the things that I like the most:1) Keeps cold water cold, even for more than one day.2) Does not leaks ever.3) Even that is lightweight, was build to last.4) The cup design is clever, is very easy to open and clean.5) The external wall never produce condensation, so it doesn't matter how cold is the liquid inside, it remains dry outside.6) The plastic parts do not produce bad odors.The only flaw that I have found after one year, is that even that the bottle fits in any cup holder, it's to thin, and normally get bounced (without falling) when I'm driving, in other hand if you fill it with your fridge water dispenser, the bottle opening does not get aligned with the water output, so you need to press the lever with your hand, instead that what you do to fill a regular glass of water, that it is to press the lever with the own glass, is a minor inconvenient, but I thought that could be useful to know.I really like this product and I will recommend it to friends and family.Regards,
