review/summary: Thermos Nissanreview/text: I needed a thermos that would keep hot beverages hot for at least 10 hours. I was skeptical when I purchased this product, but it exceeded my expectations.I do not always have time to pre-heat the bottle before use but I assure you that it works even better if the thermos is pre-heated as suggested. This bottle is well insulated and is beautifully designed for easy and safe pouring when filled with hot beverages.I purchased the smoke coloured bottle and there is no stripping or kinks on the surface so far; it has a hard durable finish that stands up to reasonably rough conditions. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a hot/cold container. It is esthetically pleasing and reasonably priced.
