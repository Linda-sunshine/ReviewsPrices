review/summary: Died after 2.5 yearsreview/text: We purchased this mixer new back in mid 2005. It worked well for about 2 years then the pin in the middle started to migrate out all the time making the top half unbalanced. This happened quickly, not over time. As this occurred I think the gears inside went on it too. So when it was used it was unbalanced, made a horrible grinding noise, and would not keep the top supported. Called customer service and was given the run around about my warranty being expired. You would think with an almost $400 mixer, and their reputation they would have done more then given us lip service. The machine prior to the issues was also on the loud side too. Would not buy another Artisan again. I write this later in time as I'm researching other brands of mixers.
