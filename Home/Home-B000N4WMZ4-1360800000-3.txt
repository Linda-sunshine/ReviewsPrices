review/summary: Well made and reasonable pricereview/text: I checked this product out in a local store to see what I was getting and to see if the price was comparable. I like to support local businesses when possible, but this item was $7 more in the store. Tax was not a consideration in the price comparison. So I ordered through Amazon for $53.There were no flaws that I could see; the lid fits well and there were no chips in the enamel.Keep in mind that cast iron is heavy so it's easy to accidentally bump the lid into the pot and chip the enamel; extra care must be taken. I'm not saying that some people did not receive faulty merchandise, but that is something that can be rectified through returning the product to Amazon (at no cost), so it should not affect the rating of the item. Enamel is tough stuff, but it is a form of glass, and as such requires gentle handling; banging around like you can with stainless steel is simply not advised.I rated it down a star because there are no condensation drip lines or bumps on the underside of the lid. Consequently, condensation doesn't drip evenly over the top of the food (like in my non-enamelled camp oven), but instead runs down the sides and pools up around the edge of the food. Not a big deal, but still not as good a cooking vessel as it could be with that slight change. Also, it is made in China, which makes the long-term quality suspect. I'm not really sure why a cast iron vessel can't be made in the US for a reasonable price.
