review/summary: Guess I'm stuck with it nowreview/text: I have been trying to 20 minutes to spiral some zucchini. It has gone all over my kitchen except in the bowl. Missed my window to return to Amazon. Ebay here it comes. I should have purchased the vertical type. They make the videos of usage look so simple.
