review/summary: Only get 2 cups from it, but the price is right!review/text: Makes hot, tasty coffee for a hot, tasty low price. Only complaint is the small size. While the unit states that it is a 4 cup coffee maker, I can only fill two standard size coffee mugs with it. This is great for the most part because my wife and I usually only take one cup each; however, occasionally a person would like another serving and with such a small batch, you need to make more. Then again, the thing cost $18 and has pretty much paid for itself in a month. Soooooo I'm torn. Best I can do is 4 stars. Buy it.
