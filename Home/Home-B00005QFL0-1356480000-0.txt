review/summary: Hard to find in storesreview/text: I didn't realize that no one is really selling bread machines any more, may have gone out of style. Did some research but really did not want to spend alot but get something dependable.Made my first batch and will probably need to play with it some but essentially everything worked and came out fine. I like the settings and basic operation is what I was used to and the price was right!.
