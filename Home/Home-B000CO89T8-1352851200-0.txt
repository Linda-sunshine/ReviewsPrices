review/summary: Multipurposereview/text: I've used this for heating therapeutic massage oils, keeping my tea warm, and keeping a warm washcloth warm (in a jar to protect both rag and heater) for joint pain relief and this little guy has performed equally well in all capacities. Even a little too well--I suggest alternating between turning it on for 15 minutes, then off for ten, if you're like me and don't use an oven-mitt when picking up your tea mug! it can get a little warm. Works well with ceramics and glass, but I would not recommend plastics.
