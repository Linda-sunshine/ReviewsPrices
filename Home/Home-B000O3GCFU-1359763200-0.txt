review/summary: Great for school lunches!review/text: My daughter is in kindergarten and sometimes gets sick of sandwiches, so I was looking for something to keep spaghetti, chicken nuggets, or other foods warm for her.It works great for what we use it for, although I don't have any experience with it keeping food warm for more than 4-5 hours.She also really liked that it came in pink, but other colors are available. I'm thinking of buying a second (more masculine!) one for my hubby to take to work.
