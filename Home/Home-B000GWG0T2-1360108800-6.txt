review/summary: Best non-stick skillet ever!review/text: I am so glad I got this non-stick skillet. There were other T-Fal skillets in Target that were obviously not the same quality as this one. I am so glad I read the reviews and did not settle for anything less. I am completely satisfied. One morning my husband made scrambled eggs and we forgot to clean the skillet until the next morning. I put it under water and it just wiped clean. Awesome--no sticking at all even overnight! I haven't used it in the oven yet so I can't comment on it's performance there. I use it nearly every day and it is the best non-stick skillet I have ever had.
