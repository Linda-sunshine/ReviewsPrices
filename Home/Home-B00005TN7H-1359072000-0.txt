review/summary: A Great Inventionreview/text: Once I learned that you couldn't use a can lid that had already been through the canner I found that is worked great. I'm going to get the small one. It is great for freezing meals in a jar. I use the hand held Food Saver for this rather than my big bag dispenser one. I think it draws a better vaccuum.
