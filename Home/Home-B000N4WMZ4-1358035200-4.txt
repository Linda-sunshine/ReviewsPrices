review/summary: skip the french brandreview/text: no need to break the bank on the french version of this dutch oven. this vessel is beautiful, well crafted and highly functional. I am most impressed with the interior, which is rounded and makes for easy clean up. I am using it in the oven, to bake no-knead bread and it works perfectly.
