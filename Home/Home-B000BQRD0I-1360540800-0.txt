review/summary: Great Productreview/text: What I liked best was they included a simple piece of foam covered by a heat resistant cover. On the back there is a place to insert your hand so that you can use this wedge to control creases, steam your total short sleeve leaving no top crease. The steam level is full force throughout the water cycle. The unit is easy to empty as there is a side drain you unscrew. I would buy this again. The attachment with brushes does not stay on the steamhead very well...I don't bother using it.
