review/summary: Got this as a gift and love itreview/text: I'm a huge coffee drinker and I love the fact that this baby can be programmed the night before and has a steaming hot cup of Jo waiting for me when I stager down in the morning. I'm not going to write a novel like some of the other reviewers. I have a life and can't sit on the computer all day. This is a great coffee pot.
