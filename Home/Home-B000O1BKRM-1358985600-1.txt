review/summary: deep cubes of goodnessreview/text: I have been looking for trays like this for years. They produced beautiful cubes of ice that are super easy to extract, and satisfying to have in a glass. The silicon is just the right mix of sturdy and maleable, and I think they'll last a long time.
