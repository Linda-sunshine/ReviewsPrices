review/summary: Must have for every Foodsaver owner. Will save you money!review/text: This product will save any Foodsaver owner money!I have been using a Foodsaver since the first model was introduced many years ago. Some people call me a kitchen gadget snob because I own pretty much every kitchen appliance there is. The Foodsaver has to be one of my all time favorites as I use it daily. Even though I have been using a Foodsaver for years, I have just now started using the Jar Sealer. I don't know how I have gone so long without it, it is AMAZING!I have always used the Foodsaver canisters for dry goods such as baking ingredients, pastas, cereals, nuts and other things that did not work well in the bags. While the canisters are nice, they crack after just a few uses. I have spent hundreds of dollars purchasing new canisters over the years. I was looking at purchasing more canisters when I found the jar sealer. I had seen the jar sealer on the infomercials, but never really donned on me to purchase one since I had the canisters. After finding the jar sealer, I will never again have to purchase canisters that I know will just break.I purchased a 12 pack of large canning jars for about $14 at a local store and have already filled them all with dried fruit, baking ingredients, and other dried food that I don't use daily. The jar sealer was very easy to use. Just put the lid on the jar, push on the Jar Sealer, turn on the vacuum saver, and VOLA! A perfectly sealed jar! The jar can be opened and resealed several times before the jar lid would need to be replaced. Canning jar lids are so cheap that it is a non-issue.If you have a Foodsaver, you have to get the jar sealer to get full use of this machine. You will not regret it!
