review/summary: Bargainreview/text: Our Hamilton Beach pooped out after a year or so. This appears to be a better deal. We've had it a couple weeks.PROS:It quickly boils about a quart of water!I can see the water level thru the window (not so the Hamilton Beach).It looks nice.It won't melt down - oops, my bad, left the lid open causing the pot to boil dry. But it still seems to work perfectly.Cons:We had to purposely boiled several full pots of water to eliminated the plastic taste and smell (although boiled water always tastes different than fresh water). However, my wife's ever sensitive nose and palate confirms ours is taste and odor free.It has a cord rather than the quick connect base of our former pot (we easily got used to the cord).
