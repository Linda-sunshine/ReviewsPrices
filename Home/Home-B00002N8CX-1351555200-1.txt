review/summary: Great Little Vacuumreview/text: Great little vacuum. It's lightweight, well designed in the way it stores tools and the cord. It has super suction power when used with the brush bristles retracted. With the brush bristles extended it works great for getting up crumbs and dirt from kitchen mats. The adjustable air hole in the hose handle is great for reducing suction when needed. I love the long hose for getting cobwebs off ceiling corners and cat hair from stair corners. It has the right attachments also. The two tools I must have, a crevice tool and a brush tool, are stored out of the way and yet are easily accessed. Windup for the cord is convenient also. Affordable, light, and efficient. I only wish it was bagless.
