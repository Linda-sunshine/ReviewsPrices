review/summary: Pretty good but annoying to cleanreview/text: I think the most annoying thing to clean is the mesh thing, even with the nylon brush. I don't have a washer machine but I usually end up soaking it for about ten minutes and even then I still have to scrub for longer than I want to. The rest of it cleans out very easily.I feel like there's some waste created and some things don't get juiced at all. The leftover is usually still pretty mushy and wet. Juicing is time consuming when you factor in washing, cutting, and especially clean-up.But all in all I do like my juicer a lot and fresh juice is nice to have.
