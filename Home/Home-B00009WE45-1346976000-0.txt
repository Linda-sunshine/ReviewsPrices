review/summary: Don't Believe It - It is Not "Waterproof"!review/text: When I first received this thermometer it seemed to be fast and accurate. It was correctly calibrated when received and seemed to hold true.Now 1 month later. The thermometer got wet and now it does not work. The digital screen is completely dead. The return policy states that I will only receive a partial refund and I will have to pay the return postage.It is advertised as a "Waterproof Digital Thermometer", which it is definitely not. If you purchase this thermometer, you will have to treat it with extreme care. If it gets wet - it won't work!
