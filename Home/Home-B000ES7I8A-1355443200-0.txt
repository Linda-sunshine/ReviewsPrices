review/summary: Really well designedreview/text: I was looking for an electric kettle for a long time. I wanted something stainless steel, no plastic where the water was; and something easy to clean. This kettle fits the bill. I've had it for over a year now and have no complaints. When the inside needs cleaning the lid comes off with the push of a button, I pour in a little vinegar to soak, and then wash it clean in a snap. The kettle also boils water really fast, faster than any kettle I've had before, and it's a good roiling boil so it's easy to hear, no whistle needed. Top marks!
