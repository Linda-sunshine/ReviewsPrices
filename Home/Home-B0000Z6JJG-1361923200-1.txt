review/summary: Used it twice and it was junk both times.review/text: I used it on cheese it was soft cheese (cheddar). The block was less then have the thickness of the entry hole and this one may be defective but it locks up and screams with almost no pressure on it trying to get it to grate. If you don't go very slowly it will lock up entirely and you have to turn it off. It is extremely loud and makes the most awful shrieks.
