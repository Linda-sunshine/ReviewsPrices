review/summary: love my Bunn!review/text: We have had our Bunn for approx 1 year now and love it! We have never had any problems with it that other commenters have experienced. We even use generic coffee filters and dont have any problems with overflow or grounds getting in the coffee. Perhaps if you like your coffee strong you may need to use the taller filters but we only use 4 heaping spoons for ours which is to our taste. We get an excellent cup of coffee using a store brand and get comments from company as to how good it is. The only down side for me is now I'm spoiled and can't drink coffee anywhere else! We do find that if the taste starts to waiver, just run white vinegar through the machine and voila!
