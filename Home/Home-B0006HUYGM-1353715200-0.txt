review/summary: It SUCKS!! and that's a good thing!review/text: I bought this vacuum for my stairs, and it works very very well...my only 'complaint' is that the canister fills up with lint, dog hair and dust too fast....because it works SO well. I am very impressed and would highly recommend this product.
