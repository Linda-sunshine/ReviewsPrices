review/summary: Fantastic, especially for the pricereview/text: The price made me wary, but the value for this knife is fantastic, especially since I don't do a lot of cutting and I didn't want to pay $200 for one. The blade is very sharp. The handle is not the most comfortable and is a bit big for me, but I have very small hands. However, the blade and handle both seem to be very durable; I've had this knife for one year and have had no problems with sharpening it, putting it in the dishwasher, rusting, etc. It doesn't look or feel cheap to me. I'd buy it again and again, but I'm not sure I'll need to!
