review/summary: Just what I wanted!review/text: My Kohler Villager tub is very shallow - great for bathing kids but not suitable for adults. This product allows me to add several inches of water to my bath. I have experienced no problems with the product adhering to the tub. I am a bath person and while I wish I had a deeper tub, at least now my baths are much more enjoyable.
