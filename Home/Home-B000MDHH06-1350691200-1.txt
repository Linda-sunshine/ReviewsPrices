review/summary: Decent juicer that made me sickreview/text: While this makes for a pretty good low end juicer, this product (with only 3 months of use) started to make me sick. The plastic under the bottom of the blade was chipping off, though I did not realize until I found large black pieces of plastic in my juice.At first I thought this was a fluke. It's gotten worse and I finally had to stop using it because I grew nauseous after juicing (a reaction from the plastic, of which I was finally able to make the connection).It was a decent juicer while it worked but it made me sick. Just be careful and check the black plastic under the blade. If it starts to fall apart, send it back.
