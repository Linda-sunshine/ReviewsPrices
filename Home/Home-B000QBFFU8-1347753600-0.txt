review/summary: Love my Breville BJE510XL Ikon Juicerreview/text: Great juicer! Juicers take time to use and clean up, so be realistic and put a plastic bag with no holes in in the pulp catching area. This will make your clean up much easier, plus it makes is easy to transfer the pulp to a pan for making soup. The feeding chute size and the pulp to juice separation works well. The variable speed is a helpful feature, that I really appreciate, and I have not had any problem with power to break up the fruits and veggies. Use Breville's speed guide it is very useful and a "go to", so you might want to laminate it, so you can just wipe it off, since juicing can be a little messy.Breville makes well designed products and can be a bit pricey, but you don't want to buy twice. So, if your into fresh, yummy and healthy juice and willing to put in the effort to reap the benefits, I highly recommend this product.
