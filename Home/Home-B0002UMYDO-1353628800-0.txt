review/summary: Great electric can opener!review/text: I was having trouble with my hand crank can opener. I went through 2 of them! So I decided to go electric. I checked with Consumer Reports ratings and reviews and found this one to be one of the best. It opens large cans without even holding the can opener so it won't fall over. I like that I also don't need to hold the button down. Once the lid is punctured it does the rest by itself....hands free! It's slim design fits on my small kitchen counters. I would recommend this opener to a friend.
