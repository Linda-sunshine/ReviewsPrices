review/summary: Great for Thanksgivingreview/text: Only had this appliance a short time but for Thanksgiving, it did the trick with chopping celery and onions for dressing plus was wonderful for making bread crumbs Had some problem getting the base opened after chopping deal but hope I'll get the hang of that soon. It blends beautifully and can't wait to make up some tomato basil creamy soup with it.So far, so good.
