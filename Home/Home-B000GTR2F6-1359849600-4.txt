review/summary: Occasional Flashing lightreview/text: This is my 3rd Keurig machine. The others lasted 2-3 years each. I've had thisone a month. This one works fine except that about every 15 - 20 cups, the light for the water flashes as if it were empty and it may be full or half full. I then have to lift the water reservior out and put it back in to stop the light. Apparently something gets out of sync with the water pump.
