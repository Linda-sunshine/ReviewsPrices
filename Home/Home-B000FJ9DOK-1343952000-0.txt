review/summary: Very nice.review/text: I bought this hydration bottle because it is getting hot and hotter in Florida. I would usually buy bottled water at school but eventually I became tired of spending money day by day just on water when I could just get some from the house.I've owned this product for about three weeks and so far I have no complaints. I take this to the campus everyday and it is very useful and handy. The bottle definitely feels like its made of high quality stainless-steel. The grip in the middle is very firm and easily grabbable. It has a little and simple locking mechanism near the button that opens the top. This product is worth every single penny. I highly recommend this product anyone who like to hydrate during the day or any athletes who trains during the day. I'm not 100% sure if you can store products such as gatorades and powerades but it's worth it.
