review/summary: Great inexpensive popperreview/text: The Presto 04820 is a great inexpensive popcorn popper. It is very easy to use--simply pour in 1/2 cup of popcorn and turn it on. A minute or so later, the popcorn gets hot enough to pop and begins to flow (sometimes shoot) out the front of the unit. Have a nice big bowl in front of it! There is a butter cup on top of the unit. The idea is to use the popper's heat to melt the butter. It doesn't quite work out that way, because the butter doesn't have adequate time to melt. Fortunately, the butter cup is microwave (and dishwasher) safe, so you can just pop it in the microwave for a few seconds to finish the melting. Popcorn comes out very well popped, no burned kernels, and very few unpopped kernels (perhaps 5-10 total).After popping, be sure to pour out the few kernels that might remain in the cooker. If you don't they might burn during the next batch. I found this out the hard way, when I smelled smoke and the unit immediately shut off. As long as you pour out the few unpopped kernels, all is well. Very low maintenance unit, just a quick wipe down, and washing of the butter cup.Definitely, I can give a thumbs up to this popcorn popper.[...]
