review/summary: Excellent Thingreview/text: The shipping is not so well-organized cuz this package didn't get here till I call OnTRAC to ask what was going on. They told me it's been shipped to wrong place. I'm like REALLY???However, this thing turned out to be my favirote.I am living with my boyfriend we need a fruit water container because I've always like to make watermelon, pineapple or banana water. So this is like the best for us. The quality is absolutely no doubt. It is very thick with a very interesting lid, which is very practical. It is just perfect for families to put homemade beverages. Recommend to buy it.
