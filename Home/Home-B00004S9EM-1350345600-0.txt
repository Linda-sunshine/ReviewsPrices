review/summary: Cuisinart DLB-10S Pro Classicreview/text: I have only used this once but it did exactly what I got it for, to chop up meat. The only thing that I did not think was explained very good was how to get the smaller tube out. After doing a search on google, I found a place that showed how to get it out. Once you know, it is very easy. I think this needs a better explanation in the booklet. I will be using this again in about a week to chop up more meat. I use it to chop up meat for my dogs and then I freeze what I am not using. Works perfect, better than a meat grinder that seems to stop up too often for me.
