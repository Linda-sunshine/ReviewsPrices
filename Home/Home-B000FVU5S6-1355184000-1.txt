review/summary: Great for the pricereview/text: I bought 600 TC 100% cotton sheets and these 400 TC Egyptian Cotton at the same time. Both arrived the same day and both were washed. I can't even use the 600 TC sheets -even after 24 hours in fabric softener and repeated washings. However, these 400 TC sheets are nice. Not as soft as I'd like but I can tell after only one washing that they will indeed reach the desired softness in very little time. I stand behind Egyptian Cotton 100% of the time. You can't go wrong. I would buy these again.
