review/summary: Best humidifier I have ownedreview/text: I've gone through a few humidifiers, hot, cold, with wick, filter free, ultrasonic etc, etc. This one is great! It's pretty easy to clean, very silent and effective. I find that the fact that it has a small base helps in that there is not a big area to disinfect. I've had this humidifier 1+ years and I have gone through many prior to this one. In the end I always through them out because they would get so yuck looking, I thought it was safer to buy a new one.
