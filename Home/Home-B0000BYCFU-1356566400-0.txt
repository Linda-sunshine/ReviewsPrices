review/summary: Great Cannerreview/text: This is my first Canner, but I have used a pressure cooker in the past. I was a little nervous at first, but felt much better after the practice run as described in the instruction manual.I have canned two batches of venison using the recipe in the manual and it was delicious. I also followed the recipe and successfully canned sweet potatoes.I'm very happy with the capacity and the ease of use with this canner.
