review/summary: best baby food/hot water jarreview/text: I had avent thermo bag, which never keep water in the bottle hot for more than 1 hour.bought this one, the water is HOT even after I attend mother group and came home - which would be at least 3 hours. I can also close the lead tightly immediately after filling a full jar of hot water. It's great.It keeps things cool even more efficiently. Had Laughing Cow soft cheese and some frozen vegies for my daughter, food is still frozen after 4 hours when I open it.over all very happy. would buy another one again.
