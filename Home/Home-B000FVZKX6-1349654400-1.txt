review/summary: so soft, good qualityreview/text: I'm just giving four stars until I wash them but these sheets appear to be very good quality and the fitted sheet has room at the corners to allow for shrinkage. And I have a 3" memory foam topper on my queen mattress. The reviews that say they washed the sheets before using them have also indicated there is little to no shrinkage after washing & drying.I got the chamois color which another review describes as being close to the color of Gulden's mustard. I would say it's more like a chamois but emphasis on the brown tone and less on the gold. I rather like it and since black is my accent color in my bedroom (I have masculine tastes, no frilly stuff for me), the color looks very nice. Very nice neutral color.The price is fair for a quality flannel sheet set and I did find what appears to be the same thing on Vermont Country Store site for at least $20 more than Amazon's price. If these wash as well as everyone says they do, I will be back for more.
