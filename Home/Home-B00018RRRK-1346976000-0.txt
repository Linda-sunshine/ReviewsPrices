review/summary: Piece of junkreview/text: I purchased one of these mills at Fry's, and it died after only a couple of uses. The motor just quit. Cuisinart must be having quality problems with their motors, because I had purchased a "Grind Central" model to replace one I had worn out, and the motor also died right away. I will try another brand (fool me twice, shame on me...)
