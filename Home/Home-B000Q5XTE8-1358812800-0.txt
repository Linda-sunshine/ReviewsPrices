review/summary: Excellent value chairreview/text: I'm 6'2" and 205, and this fits me well. I have more than a decade of experience as a technical consultant, so I've experienced a lot of office chairs. My favorite is still the Steelcase Leap, closely followed by the Aaron, but this chair is not entirely out of league with those industry stalwarts. Given the price, this is an excellent chair for when I work from home. Hoping that the quality holds up, but I've seen a few 5 star reviews after a year of use, so I think it will. I will update if there are any quality problems.
