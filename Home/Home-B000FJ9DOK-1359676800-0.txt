review/summary: Thermos Vacuum Insulated Hydration Bottlereview/text: Both my husband and I love these bottles. Living in Arizona--especially during the summer--we carry them constantly. We often find ice still in the bottle 24 hours after we filled them. I always keep an extra or two on hand incase we accidently leave it someplace! Even with our name label on it, this is one item that never is returned. Wonderful product.
