review/summary: great until it stops working (cheap plastic gear)review/text: I have owned 2 of these blenders. The first one lasted almost 2 years and I was very happy with its performance until the the plastic gear where the blender shaft and the motor connect worn out. I wish I could buy the spare part because otherwise the machine was in perfect condition. What a shame, but as with many other reviewers I decided to buy another one since I though it was only my bad luck. Unfortunately the second one lasted only 3 months under the same type of use. There are many reviewers having this problem. They all love their blender at first until it breaks due to the same reason. What a waste. I would love to buy the spare piece and try to fix it myself. Now I need to pay $10 fee to cuisinart to get mine replaced under warranty.
