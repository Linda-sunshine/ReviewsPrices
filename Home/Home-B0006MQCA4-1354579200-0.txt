review/summary: Just what we were looking forreview/text: We have had this for several months, and we love it. I read reviews for many other styles and brands before choosing this one. My only compaint is that it is heavy to get into the fridge after filling, but I don't want it sitting on the counter and I don't want to be refilling a pitcher all day, so that's just me. I'm happy with it.
