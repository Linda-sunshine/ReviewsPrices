review/summary: Daily Grindreview/text: My coffee of choice is French Pressed, so I grind fresh beans daily. This is the third Cuisinart Burr Mill I have purchased in about 6 yrs. They last me an average of 2 to 3 yrs. In my opinion, that's a great life expectancy for a smaller non-commercial Burr Mill that I use every day, sometimes more than once. I love this product!
