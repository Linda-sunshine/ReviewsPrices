review/summary: Good heater, nice looking, not too loud.review/text: I live in a space with two 10'x10' ~ish rooms connected by a small hallway with a smallish bathroom and a couple of closets - this heater works great. I love that I can choose the heat level by temperature or just put it on high or low 'max'. This heater can be set to keep a specific temperature (from 60 - 85 in 5 degree increments) or you can set a timer from 1 hour to 8 hours.The case is cool to the touch and the stand is very sturdy. The heater is nice and compact as well. So far I have used this heater for about a week and a half for 24 hours straight and I am super happy with it.
