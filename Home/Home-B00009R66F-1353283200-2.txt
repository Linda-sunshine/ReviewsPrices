review/summary: Better then we expected, great customer service.review/text: We were very happy with the carpet cleaning ability of this thing.However, when we hooked up the hose, it spouted water all over the place.I took it apart and found a small gasket was set wrong/defective.I called hoover and asked for a new one, but they just sent me a whole new hose. I called Thursday, and I received it on Monday. Pretty quick for a replacement part. They didn't charge shipping or anything.Very happy
