review/summary: Great little heater with little to low noise.review/text: I bought this for my office at home and I'm very satisfied with the heat, sound, size and functionality of remote and thermostat controls. My wife and I moved it into our bedroom and the sound of it going on and off with thermostat control doesn't wake us during night.
