review/summary: Love this Dehydratorreview/text: The unit was ordered days before Christmas and was delivered on time. We used the seasoning provided to make our first batch of jerky and was amazed how fast it was ready! The unit is quiet while dehydrating and clean up of the unit is easy. I would recommend this food dehydrator to anyone looking for an easy way to dehydrate food at a cost you can afford.
