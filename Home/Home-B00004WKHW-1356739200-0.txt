review/summary: For the price, does what I need it to do.review/text: We've had one of these for over a year and got this as a secondary for another location. We have a larger unit for main processing, but this one gets used every few days with the two of us. Had some initial manufacturing oil smell the first few uses until it burned off the motors coils. I usually rinse off the lid, cup and knife and throw them in the top shelf of the dishwasher and never had an issue. With the unit that is over a year old there is some rust forming on the drive shaft, most likely because the knife is put back on while the drive hole still has water in it. I deal with the issue, but I probably could have prevented it from occurring if we made it a habit to keep the knife loose, or if the company made the shaft out of stainless.
