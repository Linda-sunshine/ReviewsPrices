review/summary: Solid Build, A Staple of My Kitchenreview/text: This Skillet makes my dinner three nights a week! It is heavy as anything (almost 25 lbs) but this thing is PERFECT for everything from stir-fry to chicken to baking Irish Soda Bread. It is no problem from the stovetop to the oven and it heats more evenly than my All-Clad set!Make sure you clean it with some salt and oil it regularly and you will be happy for years to come!!!
