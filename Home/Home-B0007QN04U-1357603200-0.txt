review/summary: I couldn't manage without it!review/text: I only ask myself how I cooked and baked without this piece of equipment. Aside from being noisy, I have no complaints. It makes tasks like preparing cookie dough, which used to be time consuming and be murder on my arms, into a simple task. Anyone who wants to bake from scratch for its health benefits over convenience foods will benefit enormously from a kitchen aid. I opted for one of the heavy duty ones so that I could be sure it would hold up to frequent use.
