review/summary: Hey for a 60 year design is it still worth it? YESreview/text: Say the Word &#34;Percolator&#34; only the mature person will know what it means.Still the best tasting coffee (if ground correctly course)Its a replacement for a 30 year old one that finally died.The only reason for the 4 rating is that the model I received didNOT have a red light to let you know when the unit was on.It was also not made in NY any longer.In order to be able to say Percolator you need to own one.
