review/summary: Opener works greatreview/text: The opener for this works great. I haven't had a cork that it wasn't able to open yer (even synthetic once). The foil cutter that has a storage place on the charging base of the opener is also nice. One annoyance about the opener is that the light indicator on the device is always on when its in the charging base. The light is rather large and red. As for the chiller, well I don't see much use in it. Honestly I didn't read the instructions for it, so I am not even sure how it is supposed to chill the wine. It is simply a tin bucket with no cooling device or even insulation to it. With most bottles of wine, there wouldn't even be any room to add ice to it. My best guess is that you could chill the thing in the freezer before putting the wine bottle in it. Perhaps just the nature of the metal absorbing the cold from a chilled bottle is supposed to help keep the bottle from warming up so quickly. I really didnt care about the chiller -- I never intended to use it.
