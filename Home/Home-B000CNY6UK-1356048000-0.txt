review/summary: No need for fancy machinery!review/text: There's no need to spend hundred of dollars on an espresso maker. This one does the trick. You do have to pay attention - you can't just set it up and walk away for a long period of time. The flame on the stove should just cover the bottom and not lap up the sides or the handle will get too hot and possibly melt (not my experience). And once the coffee is made you have to turn off the flame so the now empty base doesn't overheat. You should also follow the directions and brew a batch to throw away the very first time you use it so you in effect cure the inside of the pot. But it's not rocket science. It makes great espresso coffee without breaking the bank. The one thing to consider is that when they say 6-cups they mean espresso size cups not filled to the top and even then it's a bit of an exaggeration. I'd say 4 espresso cups is more like it. But I've read that this is the perfect size - for some reason there is a problem going larger. I'm a very satisfied customer.
