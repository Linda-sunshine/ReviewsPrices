review/summary: Very Happy With the Bedreview/text: We purchased this bed to use at my daughter's house while visiting. The bed worked great. There are some things to consider when sleeping on it: inflate it ahead of time (as the instruction says) so it can stretch out as if you do not, it will be soft before first night's end; place a blanket under you as your body heat will be transferred into the mattress void making you cold (we got cold). If you inflate it properly (somewhat firm), it works great, you do not roll toward the center and you do not fall off. We enjoyed the mattress and it is worth the price.
