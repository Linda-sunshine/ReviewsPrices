review/summary: Inexpensive Espresso Makerreview/text: For the money, this makes good espresso. I have a gas range and it takes about 15 minutes. I like the size and style of this espresso maker. It does not take up much space. I do not like that it is not electric. I set a timer but worry that the espresso will burn. It is not very difficult to clean once you get used to all the pieces. I do not like that I have to worry about water sitting in the product for too long and causing rust. Overall, I am happy to have this for making an occasional cup of espresso.
