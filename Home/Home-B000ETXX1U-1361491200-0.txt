review/summary: Great, durable bedreview/text: I've had this bed for about 6 weeks now, and it's holding up great. It's my only bed, and also the only piece of comfortable furniture in my house (something of an experiment in austere living), so I spend a lot of time on it. A couple of weeks ago, I let it get too close to a radiator, so now it has about 6 vertical lines and a bulge on one side. Despite that, and cats who like to knead on my bed, it's still holding air well. Since the radiator incident, I probably add air to it once or twice a week, but that seems reasonable to me. The pump works well, and pretty quickly. My only criticism is that I worry about over-inflating it, and I wish there was some indicator of how full it is, or whether it's getting too inflated (other than just by testing how firm it is with my hands). Especially now with the weakness from the radiator, I don't want to stress it by over-inflating.I had a companion stay over one night, and there was a roll-towards-the-middle effect with both of us in the bed, but it wasn't awful. She woke up with a sore back, but she has recurrent back problems. She commented that it was more comfortable than other mattresses she's slept on. I haven't noticed any soreness (but I don't have recurrent back problems).Also, I'm not a small woman -- I weigh about 235 pounds. I mention that because when I was looking for a mattress, I wanted to be sure I found one that could handle my weight. This one has. My companion is much smaller than I am -- I'd say together we probably weigh about 360 - 400 pounds (I am bad about guessing wieights).
