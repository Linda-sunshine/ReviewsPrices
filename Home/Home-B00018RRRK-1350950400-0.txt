review/summary: It works..review/text: This is the second unit that I've had. The first lasted about three years. When it died I immediately bought another one. Basically, it's just a coffee grinder. It holds a decent amount of coffee.It seems to measure the amount, more or less, accurately. The price is right. It is a little noisy, but that is to be expected. It has no problem with static. I drink strong, black coffee. Sometimes, I do make espresso and it seems to grind the coffee well.It will not change your life but it will grind your coffee.
