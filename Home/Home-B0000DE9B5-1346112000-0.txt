review/summary: Lid works fine. See: User Error. See also: The Truth Hurts.review/text: I got the 39oz. I use it to store milk and have no issues so far, lid or otherwise. To operate the lid, you read the instructions. Fairly intuitive, but then again, I can only guess as to how a full sheet of instructions and directions on the lid would be difficult to comprehend.The only thing that would make me knock a star off on this product is that the glass isn't tempered. Still, it's fairly thick and strong--I've knocked it into my marble counter, and it's fine. To keep my milk in a safe temperature zone, I stick the jug into the fridge after washing and drying, and then fill it with milk when it gets cold.
