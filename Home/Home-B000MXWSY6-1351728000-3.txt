review/summary: So far, so goodreview/text: All functions are working so far. I'll see what the end of Daylight Savings reveals on Sunday morning. It is supposed to automatically reset. I have another one of these radios purchased in 2008. After two years in storage during a recent move, everything worked except the time and alarm time functions, so it resides in the kitchen as "radio only."
