review/summary: Great basic but true Espresso Makerreview/text: This machine makes great tasting espresso with lovely crema on top.Did not try the milk steamer part since I bought a separate machine to froth the milk.The only problems:1-It makes a small amount of espresso at a time since the coffee holder is small2-The clearance below the coffee dripper is low ... so you can only use small espresso cups to collect the coffee3-The water temperature is just a bit below what I consider hot enough for espressoIt is definitely good quality and it is worth the price :-)Enjoy...
