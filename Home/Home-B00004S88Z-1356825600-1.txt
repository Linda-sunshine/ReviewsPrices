review/summary: American made!review/text: We bought this a few months ago. So far all I have canned is Tuna and a lot of it. The canner is so easy to operate. It is easy to get to the exact temperature and pressure and keep there. We love this canner and as I'm retiring this June it will get used a lot from now on.
