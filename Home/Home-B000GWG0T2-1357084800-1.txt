review/summary: Best non-stick pan I've ever usedreview/text: I love this pan. I bought it for use mostly in making crepes and omelettes, and it works better than I'd hoped at doing both. On med-high heat, 30 seconds after pouring the batter, crepes will start sliding after a quick shake. Awesome. I almost don't need a spatula anymore. I am very careful to use only silicone utensils and soft sponges for cleaning. You barely need a sponge, though, as a quick spray with the sink hose will get almost anything off as it is. It's built well, but it's also a tad heavy. No problem for me, but the girlfriend has issues sometimes.
