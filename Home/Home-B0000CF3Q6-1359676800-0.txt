review/summary: Get the larger size!review/text: I hesitated giving this a 3-star review because really, isn't it my fault that I didn't really think about the TINY volume this produced?Then I thought, Well maybe it is my fault. But! This little machine, as well as it works, produces only enough coffee to make one cappuccino at the most. And is there an actual market for a coffee machine that only makes about 3 oz of coffee at a time? I don't think so. I think most people actually want at *least* one full 8-oz cup of coffee, or even more. And it's a pain to empty and clean the coffee maker and do it all over again just to get that.Do yourself a favor: get the larger size!
