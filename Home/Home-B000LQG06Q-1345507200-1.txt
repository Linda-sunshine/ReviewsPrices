review/summary: NOT memory foam!review/text: This is not memory foam. If you press down on it, no impression remains. I purchased a different memory foam topper from Amazon back in May and it was wonderful...it took 2 days to fully "puff up" and it is VERY heavy. I would have bought this same item, but it doubled in price! I guess the secret was out. I then saw this foam topper and it had very good reviews. I unwrapped it and it "puffed up" immediately and it is no where near the 15 pound weight that it claims. It does have a nice chocolate-mint smell, however. I will be returning it.
