review/summary: CAUTION: May not be safe for your stovetopreview/text: I bought this griddle to do pancakes for the grandkids when they are here. The logic being that I can cook more at one time than with a frying pan. However, the inset handles limit the effective length of the griddle by about three inches. I expected the cast iron nature of the item would spread the heat evenly but that does not seem to be the case. Pancakes cooked unevenly, one edge quite brown, the other edge barely cooked. I limited the number on the griddle and moved them around to attempt to get them to cook evenly but in the end, I decided that it was more work than using the frying pan. SAFETY: I don't think I will use it again. When I removed the griddle my entire stovetop was as hot as the griddle. The stainless steel finish was actually stained brown by the heat. Remember, it radiates nearly as much heat downward onto your stovetop as it radiates upward. If you make the mistake of turning this thing on high, it could seriously damage your appliance.
