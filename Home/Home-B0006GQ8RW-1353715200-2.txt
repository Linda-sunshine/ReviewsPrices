review/summary: These have me made me a water snobreview/text: Can't stand tap water anymore. At least where I live. This an affordable (and more eco-friendly) solution to having poor tap water. It don't think it lists it, but it removes the faint sulfur smell from our water.I also, uses these for pre-filtering my water when I brew beer. It has a much cleaner profile compared to straight from the tap. I've used distilled water as well, but that is more expensive and requires minerals to be added in for the flavor profile. But that's a discussion for another time. These filters work great at a decent price and are recommended!
