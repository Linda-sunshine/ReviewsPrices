review/summary: Works greatreview/text: I bought this to re-sharpen all my kitchen knives that I could no longer sharpen by hand (don't have that much time.) This sharpener works great! Knives are now sharp like new! Because my knives were so worn, I had to run them through several times, not the 3 or 4 times like the directions say. Works exactly as I expected - and much cheaper than buying new sets of knives.Note - the device is supposes to catch the dust (metal, stone) from the grinding so that you can pull out the plug on the bottom and dump it. I noticed some gets on the countertop near the sharpener too. Just FYI - move food away and wipe up when you are done.
