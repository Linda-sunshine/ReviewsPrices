review/summary: Kitchen favoritereview/text: The Lodge cast iron skillet is my favorite cooking appliance. I previously used it primarily for steaks and vegetables, but I recently cooked the best salmon and breaded chicken recipes. This one is my favorite size, but if you frequently cook for two or if you cook large bone-in ribeyes where the bone sticks out beyond the edges of the steak, you may want to get the larger size. I have the 10-1/4, 13-1/4, and the square grill pan. The grill pan makes cooking healthier but I like it the least because cleaning is a pain.
