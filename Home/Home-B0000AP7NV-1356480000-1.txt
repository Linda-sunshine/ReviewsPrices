review/summary: Does the job well, especially for the pricereview/text: The pitcher filters water in a reasonable time and does a good job. Just what I needed for home use. I also use it to filter water and refil water bottles to keep in my office. The water tastes much better than tap water, though I don't know whether it is any healthier. Those that complain about the time to filter water, are going to the extream in lacking patience. I takes just several minutes to filter the top of the pitcher into the bottom. I keep mine in the fridge and wash it twice a month. Have been using the dishwasher but turning off the heat dry function. I think hear drying would warp the pitcher and possibly cause it to leak.
