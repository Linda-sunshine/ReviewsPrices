review/summary: Great!review/text: I cant say how this will hold up long-term but I got this as a gift for my mom for Christmas and we used it right away to cook our Christmas roast. It was fantastic to know how far along our roast was, the alarm goes off when the internal temperature reaches the desired level, and we were able to keep an eye on the carryover cooking that happens after you remove the roast from the oven. Everyone had fun keeping tabs on the temperature and I loved knowing that we had constant updates on the meat's progress. I am definitely going to pick one of these up for myself!
