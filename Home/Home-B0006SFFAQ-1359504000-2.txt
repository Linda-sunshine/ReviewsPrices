review/summary: Minor Issuesreview/text: I ordered this coffee maker in the dark red color. Unfortunately, the small, black labels for the controls are difficult to see against this color. Also, the display should either be lighted or larger. I rated it five stars despite these irritants because it performs it's primary function of making coffee superbly. The design is elegant, the quality surprisingly good in this age of thrown-together junk and I highly recommend it.
