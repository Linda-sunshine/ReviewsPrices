review/summary: Love, Love, Love this popper!!!review/text: I've had mine for a while now and tend to eat a good bit of popcorn.I've found that it works much better with white corn than it does with yellow corn...at least the brands I've tried....and am sticking with the white from Bob's Red Mill. I find perhaps five unpopped kernels with the BRM.
