review/summary: Only adequate as a personal heaterreview/text: If you can't afford a fancier heater, go with this one. It's very basic with only 3 settings: 800 watts, 400 watts, and Off. This heater absolutely cannot heat an entire room. It is only good enough for personal use. You need to be within 3 feet of the heater to get the full benefits. If you have company over, you would need multiple units to keep everyone warm. You're better off buying an oscillating or rotating heater if you need to heat a whole room.I place this heater right next to my feet while I'm at the computer. It keeps me toasty! I didn't realize this when I purchased it, but it DOES have an auto-shut off safety feature for tipping over. If I move the heater it automatically turns off. Overall, it's adequate for minimal heating needs.
