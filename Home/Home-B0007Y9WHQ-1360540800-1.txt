review/summary: Spiralizer-My new favorite kitchen appliancereview/text: I saw this on Dr Oz's show by a guest who listed this as the reason she eats more veggies now. I have never been a real veggie fan until I realized I really need to be a veggie fan. This spiralizer really makes it fun. I make zucccini noodles instead of Pasta. I make all sorts of fun and decorative veggies with this. This spiralizer, couples with &#34;My Fitness Pal&#34; , app that's absolutley free (will show you exactly the calories/carbs/fat/protein you intake and burn off. Easiest way to properly gauge what this food or that food will do to you. Even calculates restaurant food) You will love this fun, easy to use spiralizer. Made well.
