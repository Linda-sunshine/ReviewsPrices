review/summary: Perfect for &#34;normal&#34; size cookiesreview/text: I bought this after trying the Wilton plastic scoop and finding it wanting. This one will work on chilled Chocolate Chip cookie dough and never seems to hang up. I've used it on at least 6-7 batches and am totally happy with the purchase. I'm considering buying other sizes, though I find this perfect to make cookies that bake up about 2&#34; diameter.
