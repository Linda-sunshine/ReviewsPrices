review/summary: Absolutely Fantastic Productreview/text: I wasn't sure this was going to work, but I hated the idea of constantly buying and throwing out the plastic bags, so I thought I would give it a try. It is fabulous. It works like a charm and I can reuse the glass jars over and over. Plus I don't have to worry about bacterial contamination because the jars can be put in the dishwasher and cleaned thoroughly. I was so happy I bought the regular jar sealer also. It works just as well as the wide mouth jar sealer. I couldn't be happier. I am using the jars for everything from biscuit mix to cut onions to cheese. And the glass jars are so cheap, especially compared to the rolls of material or bags that you have to use with the vacuum sealer machines.This product really extends the versatility of my Seal-A-Meal machine. And, yes, both work perfectly with the Seal-A-Meal machine, even though it says it is for the FoodSaver. My Seal-a-Meal came with the little tube to use with accessories, and the end fits right into the little hole in the top of the jar sealer. Works like a charm. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has a vacuum sealer machine. You will not regret the purchase and you will find so many additional ways to use your machine.
