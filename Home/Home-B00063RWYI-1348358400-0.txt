review/summary: My new lovereview/text: I have been wanting one of these for so long. I was shocked at how expensive the ceramic Dutch ovens were wherever I looked and am so glad i bought this instead. Because my original cast iron skillet is probably my all time favorite cooking tool I realized I need a cast iron Dutch oven. I was surprised at how cheep this one was and bought it as soon as I saw it. I initially wanted a Dutch oven so I could seer meats such as short ribs on the stove then braise it in the oven for some awesome one pot meals with little actual prep time, and just as I thought this works perfectly for the job. I have made stews as well and the pot gives a perfect reduction and thickening with little flour or corn starch. I cook all the time and am pursuing a culinary career and I can not believe I went so long without this product. The best thing is that I know it can last me a life time with proper care.
