review/summary: Sunbeam 5891 2-Pound Programmable Breadmakerreview/text: We did a lot of research prior to purchasing this breadmaker and we are very happy with it. We have used to make everything from whole wheat bread, white bread, pizza dough, french bread, butter rolls...etc. It is always successful and priced better than most. It's not noisy like some models and clean up is easy and bread comes out clean with not tears or cracks.
