review/summary: Renovating Kitchen, needed real foodreview/text: I haven't had a kitchen for about 6 months...long story. Got tired of pizza,mexican and chinese take out. Had a cheap microwave, hated the frozen dinners, then it blew up kind off. Got this and have been eating well since. Fries, sautees, roasts, boils and apparently bakes. Wipes clean with a paper towel, handy when you have no kitchen sink. If you have a family, this is perfect;I probably should have gotten the smaller one. Sent one to a friend in Hawaii inadvertently, her 2 sons and husband were extatic, allowed them to cook fish outside, no smell in the house.
