review/summary: Why did I wait so long?review/text: I hesitated buying any mandolin because I thought that buying a cheap one couldn't be the same as the expensive versions that I saw at major brick and mortar stores. Let me put your mind at rest - this isn't an artsy piece that you're going to want to leave on the counter, but it works well at a great price.Pluses:Everything stores together, safely, although not entirely compact it fits in a drawer.Scary sharp. Makes great work of tomatoes and pretty much every logical thing to cut.Outstanding price.Minuses:It's made out of white plastic which doesn't feel like a quality product, BUT it seems durable enough.Manual is a bit lacking, even though it's easy to figure out.Definitely worth the money and something that I can recommend easily.
