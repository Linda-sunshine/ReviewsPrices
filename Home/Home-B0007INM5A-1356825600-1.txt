review/summary: Wish I could use it!!!!review/text: I Have given it a four simply because the idea sounds wonderful. I am so tired of not being able to find the coffee pods for my now five year old Sensao machine, which I still love by the way. I found out that you need the two cup insert to be able to use the ecopad refillable coffee filter and after all this time I cannot locate my two cup insert so as yet have been unable to try it out. I want to know if anyone else has had this problem and if so where can I purchase the other insert? Cannot wait to try out the new Ecopad.
