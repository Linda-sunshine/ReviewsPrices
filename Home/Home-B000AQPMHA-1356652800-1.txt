review/summary: So far so good.review/text: My husband LOVES this thing. Getting up in the morning is so much easier knowing my cup of coffee is a mere seconds away. The flavor is just as good as you would get at a coffee shop. Very pleased with my purchase so far, I just hope it doesn't break soon, I've heard other people say they stop working and de-scaling doesn't help.
