review/summary: Great Value!review/text: What a great buy! Was able to get this on Prime and it showed up in two days! Opened the box and the only thing I had to do was put in about 8 bolts and we were gliding away! The back pad and seat pad are very comfortable. The pockets on the arms are going to be a great place to store a go-to book, store an empty bottle, or just keep a soft toys while gliding the baby to sleep. We are very happy with this and how it looks in our nursery.The Cherry is quite dark compared to other Cherries that we've seen and even have, but this sits between a couple Espresso shelves we have so for us it works out great.
