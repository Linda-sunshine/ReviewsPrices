review/summary: Better than expected!review/text: I purchased this as a birthday present for my sister and was concerned that some of the views mentioned exhaust being blown out of the front and causing dirt to fly all over. I am happy to report that we haven't experienced that problem at all. I asked my sister if she was having trouble with it and she looked at me like I was crazy. I used it myself, and cannot figure out what people are talking about. The vacuum has great suction, is lightweight, and it is easy to empty the canister. Considering that I paid less that $50 for it, I couldn't be happier!
