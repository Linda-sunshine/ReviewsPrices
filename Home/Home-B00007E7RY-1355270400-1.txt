review/summary: Works very well, but the fan noise is more than I expected.review/text: The device does an excellent job of filtering the air, however, the fan noise is more than I expected. The low setting is not bad, but on high, the nose is pretty loud.I still would buy the device again because it helps my family with pet allergy issues.
