review/summary: Worst product I have ever purchased on Amazon - Eureka 71Breview/text: Buying the Eureka hand-held 71-B was a huge-tiny mistake. Usually I trust the crowd on Amazon, and I tend to go with the best rated and most reviewed product. However, for this vacuum, the wisdom of the crowd is dead wrong, the market has failed us, look elsewhere for your vacuum needs. Seriously people, believe the bad reviews, this vacuum is terrible.I had it for less than two days, and had vacuumed a total of three minutes before it simply stopped working, and refused to start again. I contacted customer service and they said it can overheat, and to let it sit. I did, but the vacuum never started again.However, even if the vacuum hadn't died within 3 minutes of use, I still would have returned it. The brilliant designers at Eureka put the exhaust for the vacuum on the back with no filter, angled down toward the floor. So, as you vacuum on one end, you blow around dust and dirt on the other end. I literally spend two out of the three minutes of vacuuming time simply chasing down dirt that the vacuum had blown around the room.When it died, I seriously debated chucking this thing out the 20th floor and into the East River, but I guess I'll get my $40 back and try for a different vacuum.
