review/summary: Excellent productreview/text: I read a positive review about this bread machine on the Dr. McDougall website and ordered it based on that review. I have not been disappointed. It makes wonderful bread with great texture. We usually make whole grain breads without added oils or dairy; even with these recipe alterations, the bread is wonderful. Best of all, I no longer have an aching shoulder from hand-kneading the bread.
