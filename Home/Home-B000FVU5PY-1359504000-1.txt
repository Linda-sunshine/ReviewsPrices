review/summary: Disappointingreview/text: Disappointed. Not as soft as you would think for the thread count. Followed directions for washing. Sheets were horribly wrinkled just out of dryer cycle. Washed again cold water and rinse and stood at dryer to removed before too dry and still horribly wrinkled
