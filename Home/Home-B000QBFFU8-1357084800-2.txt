review/summary: Breville BJE510XL Juicerreview/text: We have recently started juising big time and have gone through 2 cheap juicers. One was given to us and the other was originally for occasional use. I did my home work and narrowed the selection to the Omeg vrt350hd and the Breville BJE510XL.I won't go into the technical of each except the the Omeg runs slower and gets more juice and the Breville runs faster. You can check out heads up comparison videos. I was set to order the Omega even though it costs over $150 more, I was convinced it was the best. Except on thing, my wife did not like the Omega. I can't expaline it, but she just didn't like it. I reluctantly ordered the Breville.The Breville works great!!! It has variable speeds and is quiet. It is easy to clean and the juices it makes are great. My wife is happy, I am happy. Happy wife, happy life.
