review/summary: Made in Chinareview/text: Just set it up today, so don't know a lot yet. But, I tried reading all the Amazon info about it, and no where did it say where it was made. If there is an air purifier made in the US, I cannot locate it (yet) and if Amazon's return policy wasn't so weird, I would be returning it.I lost this one, but I continue the battle. I try to avoid buying items made out of the USA, because I feel that the quality control is not there, and because we need to be able to have the jobs to buy the items.Thanks for reading.
