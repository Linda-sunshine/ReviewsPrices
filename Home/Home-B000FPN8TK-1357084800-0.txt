review/summary: This is not for making a good cup of tea.review/text: Putting aside the fact that this is a plastic which right out of the gate is bad news for a healthy cup of green tea. The plastic changes the flavor of the tea because it is breaking down, into your tea, meaning that each time you brew you are drinking little pieces of plastic. I recommend sticking with glass, cast iron, steel, or ceramic.
