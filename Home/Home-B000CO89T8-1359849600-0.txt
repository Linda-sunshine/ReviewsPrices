review/summary: Works greatreview/text: It keeps my coffee warm but of course if you put cream or milk in your coffee be aware it will build up &#34;scum&#34; on the top. That's my only complaint but it's not a fault of the warming function just a fault of the user...who likes 1 cup of milk with her 1 cup of coffee :-)
