review/summary: Bad Design - Should Be Pulled Off Marketreview/text: We purchased a Cuisinart DCC-1200 in June 2010. It made great coffee and had good design features like adjustable warming plate temperature and time to auto-shut-off. The water reservoir fill process was cumbersome but manageable. However, in August 2012 the unit failed spectacularly. I had made a pot of coffee which was on the warming plate. Suddenly, I heard sizzling noises and smelled and saw fumes coming from the unit. By the time I got the unit unplugged the smell of burning electrical components had filled the kitchen. I started checking out prices of a like replacement unit from Amazon and noticed a few other reviewers had similar experiences (check all the reviews). Then I checked the Consumer Product Safety Commission website at SaferProducts.gov - specifically this URL:[...]Check the reports on that website. The manufacturer, Conair, claims that there is no cause for concern and that the noise and fumes come from the safety device on the unit that triggers when the unit fails and overheats.I definitely recommend that buyers steer clear of this coffeemaker.Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew Central 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Black/Brushed Metal
