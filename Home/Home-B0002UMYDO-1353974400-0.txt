review/summary: excellent can openerreview/text: We bought this to replace an Oster that failed fairly quickly. This one is worlds better. Works well, good design, looks good, easy to take the top off and clean, has a compartment in the back that you can stuff the extra cord wire in pretty easily. Very satisfied.
