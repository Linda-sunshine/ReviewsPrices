review/summary: Good filter for moderate water drinkersreview/text: I like this filter because it's fairly easy to install (some simple tools are required) and the cartridges are easy to change. The water tastes great too. My only complaint is that the cartridges need to be changed once a month because the flow of the water slows down after a while. Other than that, I would definitely recommend the Culligan system.
