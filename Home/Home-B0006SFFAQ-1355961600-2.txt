review/summary: Good coffeemakerreview/text: This is my third one. The last about 2-3 years which isn't bad as I use it daily. Has the most options and makes great coffee for the price. Uses the &#34;european style&#34; filter which uses less coffee for the same brew than the &#34;mr coffee style&#34; that the less expensive models use.
