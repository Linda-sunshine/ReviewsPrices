review/summary: Nice Unitreview/text: Purchased this before purchasing the PlasmaWave 5300. This thing works as advertised but is very loud even on its lowest setting. That is the only fault with this unit. The PlasmaWave has it beat though with its auto air quality sensor and quietness of operation. A shame this is so loud on its quietest setting because it does move a ton of air.
