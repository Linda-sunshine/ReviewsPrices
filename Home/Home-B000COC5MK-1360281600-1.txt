review/summary: Three Years Opening ... and still a favorite at gatherings!review/text: I didn't review this item at first, becuase I wanted to see how long it would last and figured by some reviews that it might not make it long. We've used this product at least once or twice a week, and on good weeks much more, including wine parties where it's been a champ. I've never had it go dead, and have never gotten a cork stuck. It's ripped some brittle ones apart before, but I blame it on 10 yr old cork. This has been one of my best purchases as far as kitchen appliances and I've even given it as gifts for others. I'm on three years of use and know it'll continue to be a wine champ opener for us.
