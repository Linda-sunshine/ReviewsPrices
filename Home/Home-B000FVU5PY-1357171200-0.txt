review/summary: Not soft at all!review/text: This is the first time writing a review, but i felt that i wanted to warn others before buying these sheets. This was my first purchase of "high quality" sheets, and i couldn't be more disappointed. I followed the directions and washed them before using, but couldn't believe how scratchy and tough they felt, i was surprised i actually slept that night. So i then followed another reviewer's advice and soaked them in fabric softener and that softened them a bit, but nothing to actual softness. I then read online to use baking soda and vinegar to soften clothes, so i soaked them in 1cup of each in hot water for over an hour and they are still rough and not soft. Also, they tend to have this chemical odor that won't go away. I would definitely return them if i could and next time will be sure to buy organic or bamboo sheets. Not sure why so many others had no issue with the softness, but if i were you, i wouldn't take the chance.
