review/summary: Sealing the lid is easy if you know this little secret...review/text: This is a great, 5-star, spill-proof pitcher.Before I get into my review, I would like to quickly address the reviews that said that the lid was difficult to use. It is really easy. Simply hold the edge of the lid to keep it from turning. With the other hand, rotate the plastic handle clockwise until the lid seals. The secret: There is a point of resistance where you need a little extra force to get past the raised, instructional arrows on the lid. That may be what stumped some of the users.This is a thick, glass pitcher, shaped to take up minimal refrigerator space. I bought four of them.I do get a few dribbles from the spout, after pouring, but not enough to downgrade my rating. I simply am prepared to wipe the lip of the spout.A few useful accessories for this product are theLibman Glass/Dish Spongefor cleaning this and other pitchers and glasses, and theFinum Tea Strainerif you like to make tea from loose, cut or powdered herbs. The strainer fits perfectly in the neck of this pitcher, so you can prepare the tea in a separate glass measuring pitcher, and then pour it through the strainer into this Bormioli Rocco Frigoverre pitcher. (I purchased the 39-oz size pitcher).
