review/summary: Insulated and durablereview/text: I like this a lot. I also use it to make tea since it keeps things hot for a long time. And it is strong and durable. No worries about camping or sailing with it. I can make two huge mugs of coffee in it which means the second mug (or 3rd or 4th cup) is still hot.I was also worried that the coffee would get bitter even with the plunger down. It doesn't seem to happen though. It really is just a no-brainer to get a french press that isn't glass.
