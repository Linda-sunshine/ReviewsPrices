review/summary: Pleasantly surprisedreview/text: I looked at all the heaters and decided on this product. It is amazing the heat it give off. I actually, have to turn it off occasionally because it gets too warm in the room. I have it in a small room adjacent to my kitchen and if I open the kitchen door, it starts to warm the kitchen as well, which is a large room. I would recommend this to anyone. The only feature it doesn't have is the switch that turns it off if it is tipped over, but the base is stable and I don't have children in the home, so wasn't worried about that.
