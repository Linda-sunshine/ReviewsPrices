review/summary: Zzzzzzzzzzzreview/text: Been using the pillow about a month now. Sleeping better than ever. The pillow gives you the option of firmer or softer with a simple shift of your arm to move the beads around. As stated in other reviews I read, the accompanying pillow case does make the pillow very firm. I prefer mine a bit softer so I go with a normal pillow case and it is awesome. Will be buying another if this one wears out, which I'm sure it will as hard as I'm sleeping on it.
