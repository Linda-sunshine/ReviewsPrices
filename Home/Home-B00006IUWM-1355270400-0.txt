review/summary: Great Product, Why send me a broken beat up box?review/text: I bought this product for my husband for Christmas. I know that the product already works well so I knew it was a good deal. It finally came in the mail today, a day late and when I opened up the Amazon box everything was in great condition but the box to this product. And when I mean dented it looked like someone threw it around and stomped on it. I am so disappointed in the quality I received for a present.
