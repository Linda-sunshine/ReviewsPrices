review/summary: Swissmar Borner V-1001 V Slicer plus madoline 6 piece setreview/text: I had my previous Swissmar Slicer (orange in colour) for 20 years and it has just broken. I have always used this item on a regular item, and wouldn't consider buying anything else. More compact design, easy storage and the same quality product. I love it. Just wish it had a container to catch the food.
