review/summary: Very impressed!review/text: I am a first time grinder and I was a bit apprehensive after shopping the heavy duty electric extremes, but the reviews made me give this one a try. It locks down to a smooth surface like nothing I would have expected and doesn't let go until you unlock it. It comes with a catch tray which is nice since most do not that I have seen. It is very compact yet sturdy, comes apart easy which makes cleaning nice, and ground 6 pounds of chicken breast without a hitch. I honestly thought this was an experiment which would end up being returned, but not so. This is a definite keeper and I would highly recommend.
