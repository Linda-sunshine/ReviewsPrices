review/summary: Excellent!review/text: This is very well made, heavy and sturdy. I think this is something which will last forever because there is nothing to break! No plastic handles, no coating, it's just a basic cast iron skillet. It's pre-seasoned, but it isn't as non-stick as a new teflon pan. Your eggs will stick if you don't maintain the seasoning of the pan. But apart from that, it sautes and cooks very well. It heats evenly, but a little slowly. And don't use soap to wash it, just like the instructions say, just a stiff brush and hot water. The only complaint I have is that the pan comes with a large piece of card that is stuck to the surface with some kind of stickum. When you peel that card off, the stickum peels the pre-seasoning off as well.
