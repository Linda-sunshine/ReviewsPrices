review/summary: Perfect little grinder!review/text: This is the best grinder I've seen in a long time. I actually purchased this to grind fish food but it works great. The size is nice and compact so it's not another huge gadget to store. It has a cord that can be pulled out from the back and pushed back in for easy storage. Everything comes apart easily and without difficulty. I was able to grind up the fish food in seconds.Definitely reccomend this for pet food care and coffee use.
