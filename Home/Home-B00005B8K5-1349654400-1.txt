review/summary: Finally, storage containers worth owningreview/text: These are very thick, heavy pieces with silicone lids. No more science projects in the fridge because you can't see what's inside. Well-made, well-thought out sizing, and the lids seal very well. Stackable with the lids on. All the tupperware and and the siggs are going to Goodwill--These should last a lifetime--
