review/summary: Absolutely the best!!!review/text: The flames are nice and high, there's happy crackling, they burn for a long time, and I don't smell an odor (and I'm very sensitive to odors).Just be aware that these things will raise the temperature in your room, depending on its size, so turn down your thermostat when lighting!Couldn't be happier with this product. I'm buying another 24-pack after posting this review.
