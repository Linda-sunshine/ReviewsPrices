review/summary: Exceeds expectationsreview/text: I wanted a kettle for heating tea and/or hot chocolate water but saw the electric kettles while browsing and chose this one mostly based on brand and price. We are so pleased with the performance! We use mostly on the weekends and couldn't be happier. The size is perfect for a couple, however, the kettle heats water so fast, I think even a family would benefit from this size and not have to worry about where to put a larger size pot. One minor thing is the tiny screen that comes with the kettle but had absolutely no directions for where to put it. I finally figured it out - just inside the front there are little grooves to slide it in but I can't imagine needing it as you aren't supposed to use it for anything except water because using for actual tea or food will invalidate warranty. Again, very pleased and happily recommend.
