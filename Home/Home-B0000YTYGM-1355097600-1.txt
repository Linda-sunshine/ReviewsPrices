review/summary: Has it's quirks but I like itreview/text: Because I hate burnt tasting coffee I was left with me with few thermal choices. It was between the Cuisinart and the Zojirushi. The dealbreaker for the Cuisinart is that it has a loud alarm when coffee is done...not good when I have 2 sleeping kids. So after 3 months of the Zojirushi here's what I've found:It seems to make weaker coffee than my old cheap maker.To mitigate this, I found that if I add warm water instead of cold, it tastes better/stronger.The carafe keeps coffee hot for a couple hours...after 8 hours, it's warm/cold.I had one flow-over because I ground the coffee too fine and it clogged the filter...my fault.It makes exactly 6 Measuring Cups, which is enough for me and my wife in the morning.I think if Cuisinart were smart, they'd disable that alarm. I probably would have purchased it.
