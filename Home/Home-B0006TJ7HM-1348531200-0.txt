review/summary: No good!!review/text: First of all I only recieved the knives...it was missing the block. Then...although the knives are sharp and do cut well...the first knife I used rusted after one use!! If you dont wash and dry these knives off directly after using them you probably wont have them long. Overall I would not recommend buying these.
