review/summary: Great trash canreview/text: I have two of these one in the kitchen and one in the laundry room.Both cans have worked flawlessly for over a year.I did try a power adapter on one (must remove batteries if you do this) but actually found i works better on the batteries. Batteries last a very long time, in fact one is still on the orginal set.The only thing that is not really worth using is the carbon filter, I see no difference with or without it.This a a great hand free closed lid trash can.Worst thing about this can is that if you walk too close it opens, it can startle guests ;)
