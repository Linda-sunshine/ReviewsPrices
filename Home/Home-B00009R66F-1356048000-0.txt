review/summary: Great machine1review/text: I absolutely love this vacuum cleaner! It is lightweight and has a bag so there isn't dust accumulating everywhere like with a bagless vacuum cleaner. The price is definitely right, especially since I got it on sale. Vacuums perfectly! the only downside is that the cord is too short, but an extension cord does the trick!
