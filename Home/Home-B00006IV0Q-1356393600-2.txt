review/summary: decent flavor, but I expected more.review/text: Comming from a regular coffee pot, I expected it to have richer flavor. Its fine (better than my old coffee pot) but even with Tim Hortons coffee, it still doesnt taste like Tim Hortons (you upstate NY and Canadians know what Im talking about lol)..Takes a long time to brew (I have it on a timer so its not a big deal). Easy to clean, seems well made, just wish it had a richer flavor.
