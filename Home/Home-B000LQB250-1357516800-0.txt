review/summary: SO comfortablereview/text: I got this because my 5-year-old cheap spring mattress was starting to feel its age. This is SO comfortable. I've been using it for about a week and it feels amazing to just fall into bed. It's surprisingly thick: about 2-3 inches. It makes the bed feel noticeably taller. I have a full sized bed and the foam overlaps on the side edges about 3 inches. I can still get my full sized fitted sheet on it, but only just barely. I'm going to get a queen sized fitted sheet. It does retain my body heat and get a little warm, which may be a problem during the summer. Flipping my pillow to the cool side isn't as cool anymore. The smell is intense, and is still pretty strong even after a week. It's a kind of minty/vapo-rub smell. I don't find it unpleasant, so it doesn't bother me at all. Overall, I am very happy with this product and glad that I purchased it.
