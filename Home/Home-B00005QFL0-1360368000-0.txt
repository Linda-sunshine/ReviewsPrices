review/summary: 5 years and runningreview/text: I've been making bread at least once a week and I can't complain! Once I started using vital wheat gluten and bread machine yeast, even my medium loaves rises to the very top, and the results are perfect every time. My loaves are always evenly baked and never lopsided. This is a great machine, but I wish it had jam and quick bread cycles for non-yeast breads (such as gingerbread and banana bread).
