review/summary: Product survived the shipping!review/text: I rated this high for the Product itself, fabulous gadget to have in the kitchen!! Rated high for the factory packaging, it survived being shipped without being packaged inside a shipper box...NOW rating for the vendor who shipped the product, not even a star, zero!... was not placed inside the Amazon shipper box, the shipping tags were slapped on the product box and shipped. A corner of the box was smashed. This was a gift, no time to return, couldn't pull off the shipper tags & a corner smashed. Good thing this item is not currently popular or it would have been taken from my door step!!! Hope the vendor doesn't make a habit of shipping items this way!!The Salad Shooter is a fabulous item to have in the Kitchen!! The factory packaging saved the item from damage...
