review/summary: poor toastingreview/text: The small size fits on my small countertop and the oven works fine. BUT, if I try to toast anything heavier than a small piece of bread it falls right through - waffles, bagels, 2 slices of bread, etc. So I end up trying to toast everything in the oven portion and it just doesn't cook the same. If I had to do it again, I would not choose a model tries to combine oven with pop-up toaster and just go for the good old-fashioned toaster oven.
