review/summary: My first memory foam purchasereview/text: My wife has been wanting a new bed so not only did we get one, but I purchased this topper. The bed was an improvement and the topper is still making a noticeable difference on top of it. I tried the memory foam mattress at the bed store and spending $1,500 less but still having some memory foam comfort (memory foam bed was really nice) is a worthwhile compromise.
