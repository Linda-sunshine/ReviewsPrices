review/summary: Smooth, steady and solidreview/text: The initial clamping down requires a firm clamp -- but then it's all smooth, effortless sailing from there. The grip may feel a bit large for smaller hands, but it's not heavy -- notwithstanding the solid feel to the entire construction. The big, wide "turn" handle is very nice.
