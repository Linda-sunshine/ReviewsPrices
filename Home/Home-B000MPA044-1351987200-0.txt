review/summary: great productreview/text: I like this pressure cooker. ez use with delicious output.However, i accidentally drop a piece of ginger into the base and cant get it out...So I am expecting improvement on prevent small food drop into the base or ez clean when something stalk in the base.Overall, it's great. Just be carefull.
