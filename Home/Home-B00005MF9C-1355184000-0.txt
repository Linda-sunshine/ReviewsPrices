review/summary: SUCKY TRAVEL MUG - otherwise nice coffee makerreview/text: I needed an easy 1 cup coffee maker since I'm the only one who drinks coffee and I was sick of cleaning a big coffee maker for just myself everyday.For the price, it can't be beat. But, they could just spare the expense of the mug since the lid just sucks. It leaks after 2 sips - every time. I've tried putting on the lid in multiple ways (facing the handle, not facing the handle, 90 degrees, etc. etc.) it just doesn't seal well and I can't use it. Luckily you can slip a regular coffee cup (or even a tall mug) under it. If only they made it taller then it would fit an actual insulated mug.Right now I have to make my coffee in a regular glass mug (shorter) and poor it into my thermos to bring with me.
