review/summary: Very Effective, Yet Affordable Air Purifierreview/text: The Honeywell 50250-S is a very effective air purifier that moves a lot of air. It is quite noisy however. To avoid the noisy operation of the machine, I primarily run it during the day when I am at work. It seems to help my 12 year old downs syndrome child with her allergies. It is one third to one half the cost of other more quiet purifiers; but just as effective as the more expensive units in my opinion. I would recommend this unit for the average family if noise is not an issue.
