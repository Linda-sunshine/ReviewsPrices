review/summary: Great addition to kitchenreview/text: Purchasing a cast iron skillet can be a little stressful. To season or not to season? For a novice chef, just finding her way around the kitchen, I will say that the lodge logic is perfect. It already comes &#34;pre seasoned&#34; which is great and its not as heavy as the others making a transfer from stove to oven manageable. I gave it 4 stars because cleaning it can be challenging. I recommend soaking it first and not using anything abrasive in terms of the sponge.
