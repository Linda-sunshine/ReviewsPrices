review/summary: Great chair!review/text: I spend so much time sitting in this chair and it's the greatest. It's so comfortable and doesn't give me numb spots on the bottoms of my thighs like other chairs do. The best part is it's so much cheaper than other top drawer office chairs. Kudos for whoever designed this thing. It's great.
