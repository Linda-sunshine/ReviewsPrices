review/summary: Great freezing power but NOISY motorreview/text: We have used a cheaper Villaware for years; we estimate we have made 2000 liters of ice cream with it. We really used it all the time to the delight of our guests.We wanted to buy a second freezing bucket to be able to make more ice cream when we have guests or different flavors in the same day, but the cost is very similar to buy a whole machine (for a reason, as the bowl is probably by far the most expensive part, the machine is little more than some plastic and a low-speed motor).So we bought this because of the bigger size and good reviews. We are extremely satisfied by the performance: in fact, the bowl has so much freezing power that we can make two batches back to back.The negative point, this machine is extremely noisy. I do not have an instrument to measure, it's not as loud as a blender but close. You won't be able to have a normal conversation in the same room, so we normally have to put the machine outside on the deck and set an alarm to remember to check it in a while.After all, an extremely good buy, but I would so much like they improved the motor to be quieter.
