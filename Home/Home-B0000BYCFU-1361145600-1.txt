review/summary: Excellent Sturdy Pressure Cookerreview/text: I bought this large-capacity pressure cooker to prepare 4 gallons of award-winning chili for my company's chili cook-off this month. In the past, I used a regular-size pressure cooker, but I had to make 3 separate small batches and then combine them together in a conventional large deep turkey fryer pot to finish the chili. This year with the large pressure cooker, I was able to pressure-cook the spices into the meat in one step, and then let the chili simmer as I added additional spices. Three hours later, the chili was ready for serving and judging. The instructions that came with the pressure cooker state that it should *not* be used on open-flame propane burners. However, if you have a smaller capacity, low-BTU output burner, you'll be just fine. I've already made two 4-gallon batches of chili in the pressure cooker on my propane burner and it works great. If you use your pressure-cooker over an open flame, make sure to coat the outside bottom with a nice smearing of Dawn or Joy liquid dishwashing detergent. It keeps the soot from sticking and makes clean-up a breeze!
