review/summary: Great for my Daughter's Lunches!review/text: This has been used 2 - 3 times a week since we got it a couple of months ago. Great for pasta, soups, etc. We were a little concerned our daughter wouldn't be able to open it (1st grade) but after a little practice she got it down just fine. Her food is at the perfect temperature come lunchtime.We're probably going to get another just so we've always got one ready to go. Highly recommended!
