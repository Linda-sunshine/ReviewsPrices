review/summary: I love mine!review/text: I've been using mine everyday since I received it in the mail (Jan 23). It's quick, easy to clean & makes a good cup of coffee. Only thing I don't really like as much is the travel mug. It keeps the drink nice & warm, I just don't like the design & the handle is awkward for me. I prefer to use one of my own mugs.
