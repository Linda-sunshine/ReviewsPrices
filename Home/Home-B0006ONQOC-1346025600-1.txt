review/summary: A wonderful, easy-to-use appliancereview/text: I was using a little Hamilton Beach ice cream maker that looked like a toy. It made about 1/2 pint of ice cream, which meant that it only made enough for one (hungry) person. It just wasn't cutting it, so we sprung for this Cuisinart model that makes about 2 quarts of ice cream at one time.The appliance is about the size of an average-sized coffeemaker and is very simple to operate: put the large interior container into the freezer for 6-24 hours until it is ice cold, insert it into the exterior container, add ingredients, and hit the "On" switch. That's it. Go off and find something to do for about 1/2 hour and when you come back, voila! You have perfect ice cream, made with your own ingredients. It is very easy to clean after use.The only negatives to this appliance are that the freezer bowl is quite large and takes up a bit of space in the freezer. I have a very large freezer, so it isn't a problem for me, but you should consider this if your freezer isn't large enough to hold a rigid 2-quart container. The other negative is that the machine is quite loud --- not as loud as your garbage disposal or vacuum cleaner, but it does make some noise.We've made chocolate chip mint, vanilla, and peanut butter ice cream already, and we've had no problems at all. I've used heavy cream, a mix of heavy cream and half and half, and only half and half, and each time the ice cream turned out fine. There is a recipe book that comes with the machine, for all sorts of ice creams and sorbets, but it's fun to just try a mixture of favorite ingredients and see how it tastes. I love knowing that the ice cream we make has all-natural ingredients --- some kind of milk, sugar, and vanilla, plus add-in ingredients like peanut butter or mint extracts.This is a well-made appliance that is easy to use and makes delicious ice cream. I highly recommend it.
