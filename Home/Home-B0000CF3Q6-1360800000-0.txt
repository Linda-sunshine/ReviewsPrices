review/summary: Not sure what else needs to be saidreview/text: If you follow the most helpful review on Amazon, you will know how to use this product correctly. I have been using it for few months now and I have not used my Keurig once this whole time. I enjoy making my lattes and I don't mind the little extra work that goes into it becaus the end result is a cup of delicious latte. Knowing that I didn't shell out $4 for it either, makes me even happier. The key to your success is to foooolllooow instruuuuctions closely. Experiment with different grinds, different coffee brands or if you are bold enough, grind your own. I buy an italian brand in my local ethnic grocery store. It tastes just fine when I compare it to the chain latte that I used to pay for.
