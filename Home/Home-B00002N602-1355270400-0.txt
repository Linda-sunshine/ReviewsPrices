review/summary: Not as good as it used to bereview/text: Presto 01362 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure CookerThis cooker is my 3rd Presto (Made in China) of this style cooker, the others lasted for 20 years each! (Made in USA) The first time I used this one, it was hard to adjust the lid to shut, I should have returned it, instead for almost 4 years I have constantly & each time used a screwdriver to tighten the handle of the cooker so that the lid will seat itself, also - I have to stand nearby & jiggle the lid until it seats once pressure is up, then play with the valves. I know it is past time for a return - but it is a faulty item from the first time I used it, & Presto should know that their new design is shoddy & old time user is very unhappy & will not be buying or recommending this style anymore to younger cooks. I am a cooking teacher & influence hundreds of new cooks. Presto should be ashamed for producing this item in China- they can do better!My next one is going to be either the other Presto style (deluxe) or a Kuhn Rikon Duromatic, made in Switzerland.
