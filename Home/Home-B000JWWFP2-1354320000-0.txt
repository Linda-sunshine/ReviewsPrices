review/summary: Good but a bit priceyreview/text: Good thick quality. Plenty soft. 4 stars because the top sheet to me is too small, no tuck in on a deep mattress which the fitted sheet is sized for! Bit pricey as Costco has the same for about $40! BTW, Made In India. Don't we make sheets in the US anymore?
