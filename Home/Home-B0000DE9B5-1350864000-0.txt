review/summary: Perfect pitcherreview/text: At first I thought that the company had sent the wrong pitcher since it seemed to be so small. When measured, however, it held the advertised volume of liquid.There are two particularly noteworthy features:1) the locking lid, which enables one to shake the pitcher vigorously without spilling. Great for instant drink mixes.2) the compact size can fit on lower clearance shelves in the refrigeratorThe glass is easy to clean and doesn't retain odors. The handle might fit too closely to the body of the pitcher for those with larger fingers, but it works well for me.The only temporary issue I had was in understanding the directions to tighten the lid. Simply hold the lid stationary by grasping it around the circumference. Twist the inset knob clockwise to expand the gasket and seal the lid to the pitcher. Ingenious and drip-free!I use four pitchers on a daily basis and will replace them with this model when needed.12/29/12 Update: I've also found that the pitcher fits into the external water and ice port on my refrigerator for easy filling. Bonus!!
