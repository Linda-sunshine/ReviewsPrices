review/summary: Excellent choice for a classic waffle makerreview/text: We were glad to find this 'classic' waffle maker as it seemed the stores carry only the Belgian waffle size. We prefer the thinner type waffle and this one is perfect. I especially like the storage feature on this Cuisinart product-- it stands up on end and takes up only a few inches of shelf space. The non-stick surface is exactly that; I did season the grids prior to the first use, but haven't needed to use any spray or oil since.
