review/summary: Great for fresh milkreview/text: These are high quality glass. The box it was shipped in was beat and torn and I was concerned about the glass being broken when I saw the beat up box but the small amount of bubble wrap was enough to keep these intact. The handles are sturdy and I have no issues using them (i have average sized hands). The lid seals easily and securily. When opening the lid you can hear the lid unseal which tells me it is truly saving my milk from going bad or absorbing odors. The containers pour well and I have not had any issues with leaking or dribbling. You do have to remove the lid to pour but I don't mind since I know they seal so well. I miscalculated the size of the containers when converting from liters to gallons so they are slightly smaller than i expected but that's not a fault of the product. The 2L container is roughly a half gallon and the 1L containers are roughly 1/4 gal. Would purchase again.
