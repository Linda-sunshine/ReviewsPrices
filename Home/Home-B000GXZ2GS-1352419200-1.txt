review/summary: AeropressFWreview/text: Aeropress makes very smooth coffee - so smooth I don't use any sweeteners. It's easy to adjust strength for different family members. Once the water reaches temperature it takes about a minute to make a cup. Last point: the paper filters are supposedly more healthy than other types of filters, e.g.gold filters.
