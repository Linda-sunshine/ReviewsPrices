review/summary: Easy to Use; OK Comfortreview/text: The built-in pump makes inflation and deflation very easy. Had it up for our 200 pound son's three day visit. Needed daily reinflation as the material continued to stretch, but our son said that he was able to get a good rest. The height makes getting on and off far more convenient than the flatter air beds.
