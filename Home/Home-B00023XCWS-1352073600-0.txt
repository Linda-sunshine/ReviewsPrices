review/summary: Perfect for on or two people.review/text: Heats up very fast ( about 4 minutes) has on and off switch near top of handle. Warms up with hot coil inside device. Hold about 6-8 cups. (holds about enough to make two cups of tea and a bowl of ramen) pull removes and can be stored inside, where the water warms up, great for if you have cramped quarters, takes up space of about an one liter Gaterade bottle, maybe a little bigger.
