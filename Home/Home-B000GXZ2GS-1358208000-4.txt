review/summary: Perfect Small Coffee Pressreview/text: I was looking for a coffee solution for my husband - the only coffee drinker in the house. We have a small kitchen and don't need more appliances taking up space. He absolutely loves this. He loves that he can control the coffee strength and use whatever coffee he wants. We have an electric tea kettle, so the water is already hot - it's a matter of moments, and he has coffee at home now. He is thrilled!
