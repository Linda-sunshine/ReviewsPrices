review/summary: Light and good on both carpet and hard wood floorreview/text: The vacuum cleaner is light and goo don both carpet and hard wood floor. It is very nice for daily use.The only thing I dislike is the length of the suction tube for corners and hard to reach places. It is very long and is really difficult to reach any place more than 2-3 ft out of reach
