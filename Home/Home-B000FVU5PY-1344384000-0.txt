review/summary: Deliciously wonderful sheetsreview/text: I was very reluctant to buy sheets without feeling them (I dislike sleeping on sandpaper) but these sheets did not disappoint. The sheets are supple and soft to the touch. Thay are a good weight and thickness and didn't lose their softness after multiple washings. The hemstitch detailing is a nice touch. The white is a soft winter white. Would definitely buy again.....just wished the manufacturer made duvet covers!!!
