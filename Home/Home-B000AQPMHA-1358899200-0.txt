review/summary: Too weak!review/text: Sure, when I bought this sucker, everything was hunky dory. Well, except for whenever I would refill the container it would start leaking all over the counter. After about a year of owning it, it tastes like ALL water with a hint of coffee. I've checked all over the Internet to find a way to prevent this, but everyone says the same thing! I've even tried different k-cups in hopes of making a stronger coffee, but it's just not working anymore.
