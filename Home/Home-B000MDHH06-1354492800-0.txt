review/summary: Great juicer!!!review/text: Awesome juicer! This thing takes a beating! We only had it a week and my dumb dog pulled it off the counter and it still works! It chews threw any veggie or fruit so far, extracts a ton of juice. Way more than I expected for the price. Very fast shipping, came earlier than expected. I don't see why people complain it spits, just use the top it came with silly people.
