review/summary: Annoying to fill upreview/text: We have used this humidifier in our baby's room for a couple of months now, and while it works well, it is the biggest pain to refill. When you remove the head from the base, water leaks everywhere. It doesn't matter if you keep it upright or turn it upside down, I end up getting water all over the place. We are currently looking at other humidifiers to replace this one.
