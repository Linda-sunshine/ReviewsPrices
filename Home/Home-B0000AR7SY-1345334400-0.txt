review/summary: Not recommended -- UPDATE: My mistake, now Recommendedreview/text: This grinder creates a mess every morning. No matter how I try to secure the cup, ground coffee spills out all over the counter. I would definitely not purchase this brand again. In fact, while my unit is less than a year old and grinds OK, I'm looking to replace it. I'm tired of cleaning up ground coffee. It seems to go everywhere!Update: After getting another comment about having a "tray" under the grinder, it occurred to me that I put my tray in place when I bought the grinder. I removed the tray and the grinder now sits on granite. NO MORE SPRAY! Apparently the vibration of the tray was causing static electricity and the spray. My mistake! The grinder is just fine.
