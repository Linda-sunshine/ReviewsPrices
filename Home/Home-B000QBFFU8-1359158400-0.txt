review/summary: Great centrifugal juicer... A chore to keep cleanreview/text: I've owned several juicers. This one works as well as any centrifugal juicer you can buy. It is very powerful (best described as a wood chipper for you countertop) and one of the nicest looking models you'll find to boot. The one flaw is the clear plastic housing. There is a lip that runs along the inside of the housing and several crevices that make cleaning it a real chore. If you are looking for a deal, skip this one and buy the Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Juice Extractor. If you plan on juicing almost daily and want to be able to make up a lot juice hours or even a day or two ahead of time, skip the centrifugal juicers and buy a vertical masticating juicer by Omega, Kuvings or Breville.
