review/summary: Great, fast wafflesreview/text: After looking at all the local stores we couldn't find a wafflemaker that wasn't for Belgian waffles. Finally, I checked Amazon. There it was and I ordered it, it was shipped very quickly. Just tested it today (xmas - it was a gift to my husband) and it worked perfectly. The waffles are done quickly -- much better than the old one that finally broke. Yum!
