review/summary: No stinky!review/text: Best can I ever bought.PROS:- Don&#8217;t have to touch the lid to open it.- I only use batteries and so far 8 months of use and still have not changed the batteries.- The lid closes automatically.- I notice no stink..until I open it! If I though rare unused meat in the trash I don&#8217;t smell it, even days later. Amazing! So far in the 8 months I have not changed the filter so it still works strong.CONS (that are livable):- The lid does close automatically but feels like it closes to fast. Often I&#8217;ll be scraping food off a plate and it will close on me.- A longer than normal to change the trash bag. You put a plastic bag around the bag first to hid the outside of the bag and keep it from falling down. Then put the lid on. Not a big deal for me but my boyfriend no longer deals with putting a new bag on.
