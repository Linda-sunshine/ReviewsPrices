review/summary: great value for the pricereview/text: I can understand some of the reviewers saying it doesn't feel sateen enough. I've slept on sheets that are softer and silkier, but for the price I paid, these are nice quality sheets! They are thick, and more importantly, they wash really well. No shrinking. Our last set of sheets ripped in the wash (the silky one ;) and I can tell you now this set will last us quite a well. I understand it's not the utmost luxury but for the price paid this is an awesome deal.
