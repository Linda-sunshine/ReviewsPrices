review/summary: Limited Lifespanreview/text: I had my steamer for about a year, only using it a few times during the year and the most recent time I discovered that it was leaking. There are little plastic feet on the bottom and somehow water was able to get out of the steamer through one of these plastic feet. I don't feel safe using a steamer that is plugged into the wall while leading water all over my counter. Worked fine until it didn't.
