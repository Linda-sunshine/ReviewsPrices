review/summary: ownerreview/text: This chair was so easy to put together and I have a very bad back. Sitting on most chairs I loose the use of my legs. I can sit on this chair longer than any other chair I have sat in. The tilt of seat and back relief the preasure on my spine. I recommend this product highly
