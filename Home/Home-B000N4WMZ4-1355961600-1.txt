review/summary: Wonderfulreview/text: Few times I have been this happy with a product. It is quality quality without the huge price of the French products. I love that is is made in the good ole USA. The color is true to the photo, it is beautiful. It cleans well, is true to its cast iron heritage in heat distribution and cooking times. Over all it has become a treasured addition to my kitchen.
