review/summary: Great bread maker for the pricereview/text: We love this breadmaker. We have made several of the bread recipes that came with the machine and they are all good. Great machine for the price. The only knock I have on this machine (and all bread machines for that matter) is the size. It takes up a lot of counter space, but that's ok b/c the bread is fantastic!
