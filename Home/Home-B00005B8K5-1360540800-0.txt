review/summary: Very reseanably pricedreview/text: Overall, I am happy with this purchase. The sizes are just right for leftovers and to take from fridge to oven to table. The only complaint I have is that the lids of the two small round dishes are very hard to use on the dishes and don't close it well. I have only had these for a couple of days but I am having trouble closing them. The larger dishes are fine. Hence the 4 stars.
