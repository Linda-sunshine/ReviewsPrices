review/summary: Excellent immersion blenderreview/text: I have several soup recipes that need to be pur&eacute;ed as a final step. This blender does a fine job. My husband also uses it to whip his after workout recovery drink together, and it works well for that, too. I didn't realize when I ordered that the &#34;blade end&#34; of the mixer can be removed for cleaning -- huge improvement over my last immersion blender! I'm also enjoying the fun color (apricot).
