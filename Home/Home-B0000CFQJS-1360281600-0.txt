review/summary: Should be called "Coffee Screens" not "Coffee Filters"review/text: Apparently there are two models of these filters, the one shown in photos above (solid plastic bottom) and the other I received from other seller of this model (cravingsavings). I received a screened bottom (not solid plastic) version similar to this Cuisinart model:http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-GTF-B-Gold-Coffee-Filter/dp/B0001IRRLQMaybe the screened bottom is old design, maybe hard plastic bottom is new design or visa-versa...who knows.Though the GTF2-1 was designed for a Mr. Coffee the filter seals perfectly in my 10 cup West Bend coffee maker.In a paper filter (besides absorbing coffee bean oils), micro ground coffee particles clog pores of paper fibers and the hot water rises within the paper filter to find open pores to exit from. This &#8220;hot water pool&#8221; that occurs within the paper filter gives the coffee grounds time to saturate, sink, soak and bloom to release all its flavor before the coffee flavored water exits out the bottom hole in the filter holder.This does not occur with these types of filters. Openings don&#8217;t clog with micro coffee particles so readily, thus the hot water practically runs right through not giving the ground coffee a chance to soak and bloom. Depending on the size of the exit hole in the filter holder and the coffee makers water dispensing spray head pattern (also clogged by minerals or not), water runs through this filter so fast that one can actually have the missed dry coffee grounds leftover after the brewing process. The water doesn't have a chance to &#8220;pool&#8221;. This is a waste of coffee and probably a weak cup of coffee too. Forget about &#8220;Good to the Last Drop&#8221;, you wouldn't want to drink what&#8217;s left at the bottom&#8230;ah&#8230;micro coffee sediment particles found!So I feel, (if one had a choice in the matter) I would probably would have preferred the solid plastic bottom. Anything to slow down the water flow. For those who have large overzealous holes in their filter holders (like myself) stick with paper As for the small amount of &#8220;commercially ground&#8221; coffee bean oils getting through, it doesn't bother me, but for those who grind their own dark roast beans, concerns may be over watching their LDL cholesterol levels, definitely paper.In conclusion, unless they can manufacture these with a finer pored screen, these so-called filter (more like &#8220;coffee screens&#8221;) are handy to have in case one runs out of paper filters. They save you a trip to the store.
