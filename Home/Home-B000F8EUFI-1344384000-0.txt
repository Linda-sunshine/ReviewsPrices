review/summary: magical vacuum works picking up pet hair!review/text: Many other pet owners probably understand too how pets shed fur and having a vacuum is a must. I use to have a more expensive one Hoover designed for pets and that vacuum simply stopped working within a year. I settled on this one because I read other reviews that it picks up pet hair and its beautiful because of how small it is and easy to store away. I gave it 4 stars for one reason only, when it comes to emptying the container, dog hair gets stuck and I have to pull it out, shaking it or hitting the bottom just doesn't do. If someone has a suggestion for what has worked, that would be nice, but otherwiseit picks up great on flooring and carpets,its small enough to store almost anywherethe courd is pretty long so you can cover a lot of space,and for such a reasonable price, it's magical!
