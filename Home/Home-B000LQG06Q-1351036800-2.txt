review/summary: Great Deal!review/text: I purchased this Memory foam topper without having tested any in the past. Overall I have been very surprised with it's durability and comfort level. It makes my bed so much more comfortable and conforms to my body. I would highly recommend this product because it is a great price compared to other foam toppers, yet doesn't suffice any quality. It came tightly rolled up, yet I was able to use it by the time I went to bed. Other reviews talk about it having a weird scent, but that quickly disappears.
