review/summary: Great teapotreview/text: My husband and I went to a restaurant that served tea in this ,I drink lots of hot and cold tea,it works great. The only downside is you still have to heat the water in something else and then pour it in the teapot ,there Is no mess,people say it is hard to clean I just run some water though it to clean it that seems to work.
