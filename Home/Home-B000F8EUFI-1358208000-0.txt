review/summary: This vacuum is a baller!review/text: This little beast is great. high suction power, easy to wheel around, and light enough to pick up and carry around comfortably. The hose and extension are quite short, so you may have to pick up the whole thing to get to you target. It is also narrow, but i live in a tiny apartment, so it is perfect for me.
