review/summary: Great Valuereview/text: This is about the fourth Belgian Waffle maker that I've purchased and probably the cheapest. But It works as well or better than the others, including the one that you you flip over (like the ones used in hotels). I like the solid feel of the heavy metal grill plate. You have to judge when to take out the waffle by the amount of steam coming out but you just have to keep an eye on it.In my opinion, the true quality of the waffle depends more on the mix than on the waffle maker. For a real Belgian waffle like you would get in Belgium,, you'll need a mix from scratch using a yeast recipe.
