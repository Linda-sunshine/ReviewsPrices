review/summary: SandyChefreview/text: I did not purchase this from Amazon but from a local kitchen store. I used it only a couple of times and put it in a top cabinet of my kitchen. I recently got it out to use it and the container bowl, under the blades was rusted. I emailed Proctor Silex and was told that unless I had the receipt they could not do anything for me. I can't figure out how they can sell things like this that will come in contact with food that becomes rusty. Don't waste your money.
