review/summary: 5 years of 2-5 times a month usereview/text: no troubles. Makes great bread. the top often falls though. I'm not sure how to solve this dispite trying many different suggestions. still, the bread tastes great. hard to get loaf out of bowl because it bakes around the stirring paddle on the bottom.
