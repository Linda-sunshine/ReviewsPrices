review/summary: Perfect Travel Bottlereview/text: I am so glad that I researched the offerings for a simple thermos water bottle. Little did I know there were so many choices. My first interest was triggered by our upcoming cruise thru the Panama canal. Bottled water onboard ship runs $2.50 plus 15% tip. Wow, thought I could maybe bring along a small tub of leamonade mix and make my own beverage - for practically free. Then came the onshore excursions. Maybe it would be nice for the refreshment to stay cold? Research then turned to thermos bottles. Well, I found the perfect solution, on the first try. THIS Thermos Nissan 18-oz bottle is the perfect size for me and it does really keep the drink cold. I do golf most every day and have been using it for my golf travel drink container. I chill it in the refrig overnight; put a couple tbl spoons of leamonade powder along with an icecube and water in the morning and down it for thirst quench halfway thru the round. I then refill it along the way with cold water and all is covered. It is sturdy stainless steel. Great rubber grip and the pop up fully covered drinking spout is perfect. The bottle is horizontal for much of its travels and nary a leak. WHAT A GREAT PRODUCT!
