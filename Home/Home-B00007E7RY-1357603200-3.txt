review/summary: Great HEPA Filterreview/text: I own several HEPA filters (multiple Honeywell/Enviracaire) including one other 50250 which I have now owened and used daily for more than 5 years. This is a very reasonably priced HEPA filter that provides excellant service. The complaints about noise are relative. When placed on the lowest setting it is very quiet (however it is not going to filter as much air either). I find that for sleeping purposes this noise can be classified as a &#34;white noise&#34; that is very comfortable when the filter is placed on the medium setting. Of course this noise will vary significantly based on where the filter is in conjunction to your specific location. In my bedroom, this filter is kept on the other side of the room from where my head is when sleeping.To achieve best filtration, the key is to limit the amount of space you are attempting to filter. For example, I keep our bedroom door shut to limit the amount of space that this device needs to filter which provides excellant protection from airborne allergens while sleeping.Additionally, you can extend the life of the charcoal pre-filter by simply opening removing the bottom filter access cover (a single palm sized screw designed to opened by hand) and vacuuming the filter every couple of weeks to remove dust and dog hair (we have 3 dogs) from this pre-filter.By vacuuming the charcoal pre-filter I have only replaced the actual HEPA filter (concealed within the charcoal pre-filter) once in the last five years on my other Honeywell 50250. Prior to my wife's smoking cessation, I replaced them regularly as the stale smoke smell will build up in these over the course of a year.
