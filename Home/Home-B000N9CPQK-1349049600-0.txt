review/summary: Not bad, not amazing.review/text: About the size of three textbooks, this little guy does the job. It's light weight, easy to move from room to room. My little helper. My apartment is about 500 sq ft and it doesn't smell anymore. It is loud when set on high, but nothing compared to an air conditioning unit. On low, it's white noise and very manageable. I use low because my apartment is small and it's on most of the day. I'm okay with it being "HEPA-like" for the cost, if it was HEPA I wouldn't be able to afford it. I'm just waiting now to see how durable it is. It's not perfect, hence the 4 stars. But it does what I want and what I need at a pretty great price. I would recommend it to others who live in apartments, or for a large bedroom.
