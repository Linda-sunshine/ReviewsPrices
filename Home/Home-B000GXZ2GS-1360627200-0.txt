review/summary: Maybe a bit more effort, but well worth itreview/text: If you're making several cups of coffee at a time, you are probably better off with a french press or regular coffee maker. I find the process kinda fun, like a light chemistry experiment!Tip:After plunging my first cup, I pull the plunger up and add water again to the used grounds. Both cups taste nearly equivalent/strong.Tip:Since the resulting brew is so clean and pure, you can make up a batch the night before and it will store in the fridge (in air-tight container) for several days with minimal flavor loss. This is perfect for an Americano since all you have to do is add hot water (from electric kettle) to the concentrate you have just pulled out of the fridge.Tip:I always thought the funnel thing was for use between the AeroPress and your mug (to hold it more steady). Then I realized it is also quite useful for pouring the ground coffee into the AeroPress. So now I use the funnel to pour the grinds in, give it a quick rinse, then use it as the base for the press (on top of my mug).Tip:If you want to a longer exposure of the water to the grounds... Barely insert the plunger and turn upside-down without the filter/holder attached. Add grounds and water from the bottom. Now you can stir it and let it steep a bit longer (like 30 seconds). Attach the filter, flip, and plunge like normal!Pros:You don't need an expensive grinder (although you might want one if you're really serious).The paper filters work really and the brew is free from the particulates.Super easy to clean.Great tasting double expresso or Americanos without expensive equipment.Cons:It takes a few minutes to do the process.It takes even longer if you're making several cups.Sometimes the filter slips when I try to remove the plunger to add more water and re-use the grounds.
