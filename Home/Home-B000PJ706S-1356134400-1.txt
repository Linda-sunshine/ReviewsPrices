review/summary: If you use a french press to make coffe you need an electric kettle.review/text: I have had one for over 2 years and it still works fine. Need to boil water at least 5 times to get over the taste of a new pot. Prior to this, we used to boil water on the stove. This thing boils a full kettle really fast. Got en extra one for our vacation home eight months ago and it is also holding up. Bought one as a gift for a friend and her daughter broke it. If you are clumsy or careless, you might want to look into a plastic or stainless steel model. We prefer glass because we can see the water boil and we have been told that glass is healthier than steel or plastic. Don't know if it is true but it makes us feel better. The auto shut off is great. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I am not crazy about the lid. You can keep it open to pour the water and it actually shields the heat. I don't know how long it will last before it won't stay open but it is not a big deal in fact I keep it closed most of the time that I pour.
