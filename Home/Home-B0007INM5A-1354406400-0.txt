review/summary: senseo ecopodreview/text: I have owned a senseo coffee maker for 5 years. I was very frustrated when the local grocery stores no longer carried the pods. I ordered the eco pod and it works great. Just make sure that the coffee is ground very fine. I can buy my favorite coffee now and just grind it myself.
