review/summary: Not a quality build or Quality testedreview/text: We received our unit on Wednesday, and used it yesterday... first time bread machine owner.Overall bread making with a machine turned out to be far easier than I could have ever imagined, and actually me and my 4 and 8 yr olds made it all by ourselves and treated my wife with fresh bread. But the bread didn't come outt that fluffy or risen as shown in pictures. It was barely half sized in the pan.This morning I looked and see a large gap in the lid. Basically lid does not close completely on the back side... Arrgggg. Isn't that the most basic quality symbol or quality critera that the lid should close 100% to not let the heat escape ???No idea if I should try to replace this one or return and buy another model.Sunbeam (or Jardin company really) have no nada support available at 6 PM EST... wow :( I called the number in the manual and was told offices are closed and I should try calling them again or search web for a solution. All I wanted to ask was if the lid should closed completely or is it by design :( ?
