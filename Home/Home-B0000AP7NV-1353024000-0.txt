review/summary: This item is not good at allreview/text: For starters being plastic sucks to begin with, but that's what Brita offers.This item has a massive problem with the LID. It does not stay on. This is a design flaw.Here's another weird design idea..The Handle is HOLLOW allowing water to pass right through it,so if you accidentally get water in the handle, and then set it down on the counter, it will leakall over the place.It has too many small crack and crevices where it's hard to clean and the plastic wears outover time.It doesn't hold much water and you have to constantly fill it up.
