review/summary: Extremely pleased with new Food Processorreview/text: I had an old Cuisinart Food Processor and was very pleased with it. When I decided to purchase a new one I wanted another Cuisinart because of the quality. My old Food Processor was over 20 years old. The new Food Processor, of course, has some new features that I am very happy to see and will use. I like making bread and there is a dough button. I have used my new Food Processor and am extremely pleased with the results
