review/summary: JMRreview/text: Researched this item before I purchased it. Item was shipped promtly and I received it for a Christmas present. The waffles were great the first time I used it. Cooked to a golden brown, easy to remove from cooking service, and the taste was great. Clean up was very easy. The unit stands on the end whick makes it easy to store on the counter top. I recommend this waffle maker to anyone who wants to make their own waffles.
