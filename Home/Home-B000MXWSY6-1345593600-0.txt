review/summary: Nice clock radio for the pricereview/text: This clock radio works fine for its intended purpose. Easy to read with no glasses on, even in the low setting. Radio clarity is fine, considering it's not meant to be a home entertainment center. It has battery backup- an absolute necessity in my book. I'm a very light sleeper, and the brightness has not been a problem, although if I'm in one of those "insomnia nights" it probably could be- but so can the nightlight in our attached bathroom and the moon, for that matter. Whoever posted that the radio alarm only functions with alarm 1 but only the buzzer for 2 was wrong- the radio works for both alarms; that review almost kept me from purchasing this unit (until I verified in a store). Bottom line: This is a perfectly acceptable clock radio, especially for its price.
