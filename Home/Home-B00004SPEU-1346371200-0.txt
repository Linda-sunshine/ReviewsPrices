review/summary: Elegant Simplicityreview/text: I own 2 of these. The first one purchased 20+ years ago. One for spices one for coffee.For drip coffee using a paper filter, this hardworking tool will fill the bill when grinding coffee.I have never had a problem with this grinder "overheating" the beans.Easy to use and effective grinder for spices.Highest recommendation.
