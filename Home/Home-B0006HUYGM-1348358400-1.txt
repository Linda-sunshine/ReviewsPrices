review/summary: Brush motor lasted for only 27 monthsreview/text: I purchased this vacuum in late June 2010. Today the brush stopped spinning due to brush motor failure. I confirmed that the belt was not the issue after I took the vac apart. The belt lasted longer than the motor; how do you like that? I used the vac once per week in a small (960+/- sq ft) carpeted condo. Each weekly use was for no longer than 15 minutes. I will contact Eureka tomorrow and complain. What a disappointment, not to mention this 7 pound yellow plastic brick entering the waste stream.
