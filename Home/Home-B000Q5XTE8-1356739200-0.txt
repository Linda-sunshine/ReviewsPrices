review/summary: Not for me; narrow and just couldn't get comfortablereview/text: Ok; this chair was just not cut for me. I'm 6&#34;1, 220lbs. It appeared very narrow and does not rock once you set the angles. That was a big negative for me. For a high back there really was not high enough to lean my head back on. I really just couldn't get the seat comfortable and then the lift started malfunctioning. So I returned it, another headache, I'm a seasoned engineer, but once the lift is locked in it is near impossible to remove to pack back up. I actually had to leave it in and ship. what a packing headache. I ended up going to Office Dept and bought a Thomasville big and tall office chair w leather, memory foam seat, adjustable arms, adjustable rocker, good up to 350Lbs (better support structure) and certified by the American Chiropractors Association. It was a little more at $219 but this seat was the one for me and still is as I set in it and type this.
