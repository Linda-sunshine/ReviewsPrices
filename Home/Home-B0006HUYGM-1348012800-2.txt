review/summary: Review of Eureka 71Breview/text: I was looking for a small vacuum that I could use mainly for cleaning the interior of my car. This vacuum was perfect for me. Small in size, and easy to work with . I like the long cord (20 ft.) and the powerful motor. Exactly what I was looking for.
