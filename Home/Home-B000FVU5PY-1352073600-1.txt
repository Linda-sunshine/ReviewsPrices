review/summary: Pleased with these sheetsreview/text: I spent hours on Amazon looking for a set of Queen-sized sheets, under $50, that were quality. I studied the reviews inside and out! I have had the sheets on my bed for two nights now, and I am pleased with my purchase. They are not as soft as I would have expected, but the color is stark white (exactly what I wanted!) and the stitch is a lovely detail. Although they are not as soft as I hoped, they are extermely comfortable, none the less. They are a little loud when tossing and turning, due to the lack of softness, but defintely do the trick. I will most likely change the sheets to a warmer material (jersey or flannel) when the weather gets colder (I live in Los Angeles, still a bit warm) but look forward to these cool sheets (perfect for warm nights) next spring and summer!I have also had my eye on the matching duvet set, I am hesitant. Any insight on the look and feel of the duvet set would be welcomed!
