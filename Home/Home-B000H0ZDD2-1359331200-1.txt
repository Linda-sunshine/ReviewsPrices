review/summary: Probably should've gotten a bigger one...review/text: I'm using this in my bathroom because my fan no longer works and it does an ok job but for the money it probably would've been worth it to buy the next size up. It does work but I have to leave it on too long to totally dry the room out after a shower - maybe more suited for a half bath...
