review/summary: Dog nose knows...review/text: UPDATE: Since my original review (below), we've been using this everyday (nearly two months now). I, too, am amazed at the negative reviews since this is such a basic item. Since my initial vinegar wash solution to the 'new' smell we've never experienced any odor at all. It works flawlessly. Still highly recommended.Original review:Finding equal number of satisfied as unsatisfied reviewers made me a bit unsure about this item, especially when I read about the 'chemical smell' issue. Part of my job is inspecting factories which more often than not involves production lines using any number of solvents, glues and paints. Having the nose of a dog, I'm really, really sensitive to odors. The last thing I want first thing in the morning is the smell of one of those factories.Being a sucker for style, I took the plunge anyway and purchased this item along with a bag of the Bamboo Charcoal thinking it may be needed to cure the smell problem.Well, I got the item a week ago and, yes, it did have an odor to it, but to me it was just a 'new' item smell, like a 'new car' kinda thing. It wasn't overpowering or anything, but it was noticeable. The charcoal I ordered had not arrived yet, so I did the vinegar and water solution. Did this one time and then washed (by hand) with Dawn dish soap, rinsed 2-3 times with water and amazingly... NO SMELL. Amazing what some sour grapes and dish soap can do.The thing performs flawlessly (fun watching water go from room temp to boiling in seconds) and has become a great morning standard for my wife who drinks tea and for me on the days I don't have time (or don't want) to brew a whole pot of coffee (l'instant cafe days).I would recommend this to anyone in need of fast, hot water.
