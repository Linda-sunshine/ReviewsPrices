review/summary: Great product!review/text: Bought for our son in college and he loves it. Says it makes his bed so much more comfortable. We bought him one from Kohls which was a memory foam egg-crate on sale for $40. Totally not worth it! But this Sleep Studio Sleep Joy 3&#34; was awesome! Not too big to put on your sheets and thick enough to really feel the difference when sleeping.
