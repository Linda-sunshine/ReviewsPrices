review/summary: Great once cleanedreview/text: After I received it and I made my very first cup of coffee I immediately noticed a weird plasticy taste to that cup and every cup I made after that. I ran a couple of reservoirs of just water thinking maybe it needed to be washed out a little but I didn't notice a change. So I looked it up online and sure enough this doesn't seem to be an uncommon issue. I did what others recommended (wash the reservoir thoroughly, add a couple of tablespoons of vinegar to the water and run it through, etc). And eventually this worked. The first time I ran the vinegar it tasted somewhat better but not completely free of that plastic/fake taste. So I ran about 3 more reservoirs of water just to be sure and then added more vinegar and did it all over again. Once I ran a couple more reservoirs of just water to make sure I had all the vinegar out I tasted the water that came out and sure enough it tasted nice and clean, like plain water should! So I put in a K-cup of coffee and it tasted great! I don't know if my case was special or not but other than needing to 'break-in' the machine it has worked wonderfully! I've had no further problems and love every coffee/hot chocolate/tea that it makes!
