review/summary: honeywell air purifierreview/text: I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY NEW HONEYWELL 50250 AIR PURIFIER. I HAD MY OLD ONE FOR MANY YEARS AND I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH I NEEDED A NEW ONE UNTIL I PLUGGED THIS ONE IN! THIS AIR PURIFIER IS SO MUCH QUIETER THAN MY OLD ONE AND IT REALLY WORKS GREAT! I HAVE ASTHMA AND ALLERGIES AND THIS MACHINE HAS HELPED ME TO GET A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP AND THE HOUSE IS SO MUCH FRESHER ALL DAY LONG.
