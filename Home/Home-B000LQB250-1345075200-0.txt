review/summary: 3 inch Visc02 ventilated memory foam mattress topperreview/text: I have tried different foam pads and I spent the night away from home where I slept on a bed that was so soft and dreamy, so comfy that I have been trying to duplicate. I finally found that in the 3 in. Visc02, I have hip and back pain and I have slept all night long every night since I put it on my bed. I love it so much that I am telling everyone to try it. Thank you Amazon, please never stop selling this wonderful product.
