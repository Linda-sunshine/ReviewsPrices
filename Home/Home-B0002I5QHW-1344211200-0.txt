review/summary: Cheaply priced - Cheaply madereview/text: I wanted to grind my own hamburger (so I know exactly what's in it!). The additional ability to do pasta appealed to me. Alas, there is a reason this product is so cheap. With a tremendous amount of work, I got one batch through. It was exhausting. It simply won't feed the meat through, and about the only thing you can do is push it by hand and try not to get "fingers" in your meat mix.I tried a second batch thinking my experience might make the job easier. To the contrary, it was even harder this go around. The blade is too small and too dull. Furthermore, the drive shaft is too loose within the housing, and allows the blade to pop off. When this happens, it immediately stops feeding anything through. At this point, the only option is to stop, take off the threaded collar, unclog the entire mechanism, then reassemble it. About three cranks and it comes off again! Very frustrating!Worst of all, even though it won't grind hot butter, it will grind itself. Apparently after hundreds of revoluions on the crank handle, the friction of the plastic parts rubbing on one another starts to wear them down. I had spent an infuriating 45 minutes grinding, unclogging, reassembling, repeating. I started to notice tiny white flakes in the meat. It was little bits of plastic rubbing from the inside and mixing in with the meat! I had to throw the whole batch away. I believe I'll throw this grinder out with it!!P.S. I never got a chance to do pasta with it, but doesn't sound like anyone has had any better luck there either.
