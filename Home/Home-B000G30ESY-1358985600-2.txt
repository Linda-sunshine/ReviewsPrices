review/summary: Rice 'n shinereview/text: Very convenient rice cooker with timer for delayed cooking, it makes a small quantity of rice without scorching or sticking. It cleans up easily. I've tried it with jasmine, basmati and brown rice, and all came out perfectly. Rolled oatmeal cooked too slowly and came out mucilagenous, but steel cut oats produced a better result. The cooking cycle is much longer than stovetop preparation, so it's best to set the timer for when you want to serve. The display only shows time remaining for the last several minutes of cooking, so it's hard to judge when it will be done. Settings are maintained while the unit is unplugged, and the handle is convenient so it's easy to store when not in use. Capacity is adequate for two or three servings, but not for a large family.
