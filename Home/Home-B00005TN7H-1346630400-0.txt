review/summary: Great for use with the handheld freshsaver.review/text: I use this with the handheld freshsaver, no need for the attachment tube it just goes straight on the top of this. I use it to seal Mason jars for almost everything, grains, sauces, choc chips - things for the freezer, fridge or pantry. It is especially good for 'salad in a jar' where if done correctly cut salad will stay fresh for over a week!
