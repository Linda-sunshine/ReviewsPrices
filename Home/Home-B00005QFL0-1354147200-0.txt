review/summary: Counterfeit Breadmaker?review/text: We purchased this Panasonic SD-YD250 from Amazon.com LLC in October 2012 and were happy with the low price of $109.98 with free shipping. So far we have only used it to make bread dough for pizza a couple time. We were surprised how loudly it squeaked. This unit replaced our previous breadmaker that we'd had for about 15 years. Squeaking from that old model was minimal. The Panasonic SD-YD250 squeaking is very obtrusive and would suggest to me to be a defect.Recently I went to register the product at the Panasonic site and found that the manufacturer's label on the back of the breadmaker has NO SERIAL NUMBER. This seems very suspicious and makes me wonder whether it is a genuine Panasonic product.
