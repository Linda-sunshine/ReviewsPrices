review/summary: Better than othersreview/text: I mistakenly bought another slicer when I bought the V 100, so I had a great opportunity to compare the two. The other, I've forgotten the brand, was very-very similar in appearance to the Swissmar (most likely intentional) but that was where the likeness stopped. The Swissmar cut so much smoother, easier and with greater control & precision. There really was no comparison. It was like the saying goes: you are more likely to cut yourself on a dull knife rather than a sharp one... and the Swissmar is razor sharp.
