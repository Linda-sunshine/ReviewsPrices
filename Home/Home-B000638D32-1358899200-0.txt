review/summary: I love this knifereview/text: I love this knife. It is the only knife I used. I read a review in Americas Test Kitchen magazine and decided to purchase it. I have since bought an additional one for me, one for my mom and one for my brother. The knife has a good weight to it and is very easy to use. For the price point, it is totally worth it!
