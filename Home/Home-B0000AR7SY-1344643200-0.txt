review/summary: happy with itreview/text: I have had this for almost a year and I'm happy with it. It is not too loud when grinding and the coffee grounds don't fly around. It is easy to clean up. Plenty of choices for different grinds, from extra fine to coarse. One thing that happens almost everytime I use it....ONE bean ends up getting lodged in the center of the grinder, where there is a screw. That darn bean just sits there and refuses to fall into the grinder. I have taken to wacking the side of the grinder, thus making the bean jump out to its ultimate end. A little drama in the morning.
