review/summary: Love our salad shooterreview/text: We got this salad shooter to replace an older, smaller model. This one is great. Works just as good as the older one, but can hold larger vegetables/chunks of cheese. It also has more shredding wheels so we have more options for cuts. We are extremely happy with the purchase, and would definitely buy another.
