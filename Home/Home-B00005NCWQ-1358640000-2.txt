review/summary: Great stove-top percolatorreview/text: I really love this pot. It's easy to use and keep clean, and it makes a great cup of coffee. I think perked coffee is so much better than dripped coffee. You get all the flavor of the coffee because boiling water goes through the coffee grounds over and over, so you get all the coffee flavor. I've had electric percolators in the past, but they don't hold up long. keep in mind, that you can't just set it and forget it though, you have to keep an eye on it and when it first starts perking, turn down the stove very low. Let it perk at least 10 minutes and measure the water and coffee according to the amount wanted, and you will have a great cup of coffee.
