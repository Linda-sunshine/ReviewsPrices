review/summary: Nifty..review/text: Have had no problems with this product.. Set-up was easy, no leaks and the travel mug is perfect.. Do wish it had come with a sample #1 filters.. not that you need any as it has it's own permanent filter but with finer ground coffees it will not prevent loose grounds. This maker uses the #1 filters but some posters have said their not large enough, to purchase #2's and cut off about a half inch.. I say give us a dozen #1's and let us decide for ourselves. Great bargain none the less. Recommended.
