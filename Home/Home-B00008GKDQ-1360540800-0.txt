review/summary: Great Purchase, even though it gave me a toe injury!review/text: I bough this grill two years ago. I am posting so long after because I use it so much. There are so many ways you can use this grill once you learn how to keep it clean (never leave water on it, clean and oil after each use). I use it to make pancakes, french toast, fry eggs and home fries. I also use it grill hamburgers, chicken breast and shrimp. And my latest use for it is to make pizzas. It doubles as an awesome pizza stone. I also make my home made sweet potato and french fries on it (baked). I use this thing almost every time I cook.
