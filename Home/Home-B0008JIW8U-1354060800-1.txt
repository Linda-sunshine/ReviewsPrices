review/summary: sour tasting coffeereview/text: First let me start by saying I like coffee. I have worked in coffee shops, I have had manual espresso machine with expensive grinders, nespresso machines, nescafe machines, and drip coffee makers. I'm not a coffee snob who insists there is only one kind of coffee, I like any coffee that is good whether it be a espresso or a nice cup of drip. I have been more or less happy with most machines that I have had, but not this one.After spending almost 8 years living outside of the use i just moved back, and had to leave my recent favorite (nespresso) machine behind due to the high cost and trouble locating the capsules here. So I figured I would just get a simple drip coffee maker for just my wife and I to use. What could be better than this simple 4-cup mr. coffee. Apparently anything! It makes what I would best call, hot orange juice!So I tried to figure out why. I tried different coffees, different grinds, and all to no avail. Then one day I tried checking closely watching the brew process, ah ha. The machine starts brewing with the water as soon as it's added, or turned on (if water was already in the machine). What does that mean? It means that the brewing process starts even though the water is still cold. If you check the water coming out, it's not even warm! Only half way through the brewing process is the water actually hot. Now we have the reason for the sour coffee.Well being that I had already thrown out the box and receipt I could'nt return the machine. Thankfully I did find a place for the machine, the garbage. Here I feel the machine has finally found a home
