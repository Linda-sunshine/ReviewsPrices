review/summary: Small in size but Big in Actionreview/text: I purchased this small dirt devel because my kirby died (15+year old) and my home has about 35% carpet plus stairs. I wanted something light and easy attachments to motivate me to vaccum the stairs often. This bagless vac did the trick. My children use it easily and can maneuver the stairs as well. It was less than $80 and I've had it a year now and it still works great.
