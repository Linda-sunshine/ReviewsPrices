review/summary: I bought the Small & Meduim OXO Cookie scoops.......review/text: OXO Good Grips Cookie Scoop ~ SmallI was looking for a cookie scoop, believe it or not, I had never heard of one until I read about one in a magazine & it mentioned that with a cookie scoop, you could make uniform size cookies. I was not good at uniform sized, so it was with great interest I came into Amazon to look for one. Since I knew zero about what to choose, I took a look around to see what had the best reviews & mid-range price. OXO looked to be a great choice, people were happy, so I bought the medium size. It worked great but it seemed the cookies might be a bit too big. The Meduim OXO cookie scoop performs like a champion & I am happy with that purchase.I returned to Amazon & bought the OXO small size as the medium does work very well. I ordered this product brand new from Amazon & received it on 11 December 2012. I decided to use it for the first time on 24 December 2012, when I made cookies.I got exactly eight cookies scooped & on a pan before the spring shot out & flew across the room & the scooper fell apart. I have four or so pieces of the scooper.I am shocked the scooper would do eight sugar cookies & fly into pieces. Really. The spring took flight & went to the other side of the kitchen.I paid $12.99 for the scooper, to last for eight cookies means each use of the scoop cost $1.62 + .Pretty expensive scoops.I did *not* contact Amazon about the problem. I went to OXO & sent the an email informing them of the problem. On the OXO website, it states there is a &#34;Satisfaction Guarantee&#34;This states:&#34;We guarantee everything we make! If for any reason you are not satisfied with an OXO product, return it for replacement or refund. Please contact OXO's customer service department and we will be happy to assist you.&#34;So I did contact them. It took longer to receive a reply than I liked, but I do have to factor in that Christmas & New Years were in motion too. I stated the problem, and a received a nice reply from OXO. I sent them a copy of the Amazon receipt & a picture of all the pieces of the scooper. All of the emails have been returned with kindness & generosity..Today (09 January 2013) I received a package from OXO. Inside is the new scooper. I tested it with squeezing, but no cookies yet. I hope my problem with the small OXO scooper that I got first is just a one time thing, a fluke. After the fantastic customer service of the OXO company & the fact they do stand behind their merchandise, I have to recommend their products & I will buy OXO if I have the choice of their merchandise when buying something I want or need.
