review/summary: A little plastic with your coffee?review/text: This is my third Keurig and I've always been a big fan. But there seems to be a problem with these new ones. The water that comes through this machine smells and tastes like burnt plastic, therefore the coffee is AWFUL and undrinkable.Search the web and you'll see all of the discussions on how to get rid of the plastic taste. But in the end, why should I have to de-scale a new the machine, and where is the smell/taste coming from? My other concern is that even if I run enough water through this thing to get rid of the taste, will there be residual plastic coming through in every cup, and is this healthy?I think this thing is going back.
