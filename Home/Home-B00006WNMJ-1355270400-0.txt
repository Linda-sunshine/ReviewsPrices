review/summary: Keep 'Em Coming! Great replacement filter!review/text: Item shipped promptly and, within a week, I had a new replacement cartridge for our Culligan faucet mount water filter. Of course, the filter performs as expected and we love the taste of our drinking water. No chlorine taste, or any other taste! Just clear, clean drinking water as we expect from a Culligan product. We purchased Culligan faucet mount because of it's high buyer satisfaction rating as reported by a leading consumer product testing organization.Keep sending me those Culligan replacement filters on your auto-ship program that I set up with you. It makes things simple!Thank you.
