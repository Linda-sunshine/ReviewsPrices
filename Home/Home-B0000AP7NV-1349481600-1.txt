review/summary: Great value for purified waterreview/text: I bought this pitcher to give me a way to drink purified water, and that is exactly what it has done. I normally drink 2-3 glasses of roomtempature water when I wake up, so this was perfect for me. No messing with the tempature on the faucet and the water was purified. Great value!
