review/summary: Better than dripreview/text: Moved from drip maker to percolator. A little more effort with the percolator - filters tend to rip when installed. Flavor of coffee is less bitter and lesser quality coffee is now acceptable. Be careful the coffee comes out HOT. Overall a good value for the money and attractive in a retro sort of way.
