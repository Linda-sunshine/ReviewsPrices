review/summary: &#34;on&#34; switch has to be held downreview/text: I had the smaller &#34;baby cuis&#34; before and used it primarily for small chores and for making homemade mayonnaise. This machine does a fine job due to the same drip through top for the oil, however, it is much less convenient because the activator is a deadman switch, thus tying up one (often a little greasy) hand holding down the &#34;on&#34; switch while the other pours the oil. If there is any oil on the counter the machine will gradually move away from you, too. Wish I'd bought the older smaller model.
