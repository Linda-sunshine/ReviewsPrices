review/summary: Bormioli Rocco Frigoverre Jug with Hermetic Lid, 2-Litersreview/text: When I unpacked this pitcher I was pleased with the look of it. That all changed when I filled it with tea. It is quite heavy and the handle is on the small side. The lid fits and seals as advertised. The thing I detest most about this pitcher is that while pouring and after you stop pouring, it runs down the outside of the pitcher. The only defense is to hold a paper towel under the pouring lip to catch the leaking fluid.I would not recommend this pitcher.
