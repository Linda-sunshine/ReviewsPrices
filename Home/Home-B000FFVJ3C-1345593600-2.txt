review/summary: not to shabby nescoreview/text: So far so good. I'd give five but the machine is so new, and we haven't had a chance to try it out with beef, veggies or the like. We dried mango, which took longer than I thought it would (14 hours), plus all time it took to cut and arrange the mango on the trays ++ the cost of the mango in the beginning. Oi. Not sure that buying dried mango isn't cheaper.The mango itself is amazing. No coloration. No sulpher. Super sweet. But, again, maybe buying the non-sulphered trader joes stuff is cheaper. Certainly easier.
