review/summary: Not what I expectedreview/text: I think I'm being too critical and I may change my rating to more stars in the future, however this is an average espresso machine in my opinion. It replaces my old Cusinart espresso machine that was sooo much easier to use. And the coffee was just as good. With this one, just reading the manual is a 4 credit course! Aside from the complexity, I also can't fully tighten the handle. It will only close about 3/4 of the way, so there's not enough space for 2 cups.
