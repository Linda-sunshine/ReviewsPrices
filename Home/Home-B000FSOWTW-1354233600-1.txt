review/summary: Wonderful Giftreview/text: I am always a skeptical shopper when I buy gadget-like products. I was a little nervous that this opener was cheaply made. I watched tons of YouTube videos, and I was sold. The fact of the matter is, this thing works. It was the talk of the family during Thanksgiving. It works! It looks good! The only thing I question is that the unit itself doesn't like to sit tight against the charging terminals, and the light at the top with flicker proving that there isn't good contact being made. I think this is because the inside spring is trying to push the unit of the charging stand. I would appreciate anybody who has witnessed this problem to comment on this because I want to know if it is a reoccurring issue.
