review/summary: Meets all my needsreview/text: I have two cats as well as an African Grey parrot, Harley,whose dander is in the form of a very fine white dust that becomes airborne every time he preens and ruffles his feathers (often). I noticed the white dust settling on my furniture and though I am not the best housekeeper am concerned that the air I am breathing be clean.I researched a lot of air purifiers that are good for birds but also economical. The honeywell 50250 models kept coming up as the most favorable. Their round design meets my needs of pulling in air from all around it. I was concerned about reviews that it is loud, though and this kept me searching. However a friend of mine has one which I borrowed for a week to try out and found the sound level of it to be acceptable so I bought one two months ago and have been very pleased with it since.I have mine plugged into an auto timer to run on low speed during the day and off at night. I have noticed a significant reduction in dust on furniture and feel I am breathing cleaner air.I can here the purifier when it is running but it is more like white noise.I am very happy with my purchase thus far and will repost if that changes.
