review/summary: Very useful.review/text: I have had this for about a month and have used it to blend roasted squash, potatoes, leeks, peppers, tomatoes and carrots in soup. I have also used it to blend beans for spreads. I have had no trouble with the blade jamming or catching in the soup preparations (even with the range of textures/firmness), though with beans (much less liquid) the motor did strain a bit. I have found that being able to blend soups directly in the pot is so much more convenient than using a food processor or blender- it was worth it to buy this &#34;extra&#34; appliance.
