review/summary: air feels betterreview/text: I recently purchased this, and I haven't needed to clean out the external filter yet- so I don't know if that will hold up. Overall the smoke has literally cleared. It's almost a party trick to have someone blow cigarette smoke into the front and see it vanish. That was the purpose of this machine. I was getting breathing issues. In my apt, I installed an air conditioner window unit in the bedroom, so I didn't need to run it for the whole house. Unfortunately, it leaves the window with gaps making it hard to filter the bedroom privately. You have to keep the door shut in the room or else it doesn't do anything for overall air quality, which is annoying. I bumped my nightstand yesterday, and it fell over. My night stand is under 2 feet off the ground. The whole thing disassembled. I'm not sure how it will hold up overall because the external filter is no more than a poorly cut out cheap thing. So far it works great, but i have a feeling it may not keep working that well because the HEPA filter will probably get dirty pretty quick- I could be wrong. 4/5 cuz so far it actually works as described.
