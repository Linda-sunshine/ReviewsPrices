review/summary: Recalled twicereview/text: My capresso was recalled because the handle would break off. When I called capresso to get instructions for the recall, the rep was impatient and rude. But he was efficient because shortly my new water kettle arrived. I have had it for one year and it has stopped working. It won't turn on. When I called capresso, the rep said explained that there was another recall for an electrical problem but because I had a replacement kettle from the last recall, I was not eligible to receive another one. They would sell me one at a discounted price. After two recalls and no working water kettle, I have decided to buy another brand.
