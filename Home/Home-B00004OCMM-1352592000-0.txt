review/summary: VERY PLEASED!!!review/text: I bought one of these can openers, and they are the best ones I have ever used in my 56 years. They feel a bit heavy, but they feel like you have something substantial in your hand. Not like the cheap tin foil feeling ones that bend so easily, like most seem to be these days. They are worth the price, I am very pleased with this can opener!!!Billy Joe :)
