review/summary: Excellent coffeemaker with thoughtful designreview/text: After checking the features and reviews on every coffeemaker I could find, I chose the Zojirushi. We have had it for about a month and find it to be an excellent product. My criteria were to have a thermal carafe that kept the coffee hot and coffee that was made with water hot enough to extract the maximum flavor from the grind. Both are satisfied. The carafe is easy to pour from and the lid can be turned to the pour position by feel; a nice bonus when I'm too sleepy to go find my glasses. The small cap that goes over the lid helps to keep the coffee hot. Also, when pouring water into the machine from the carafe it doesn't dribble or drip.
