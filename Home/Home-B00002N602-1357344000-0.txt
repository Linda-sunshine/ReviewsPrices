review/summary: Great Quality. Great Price.review/text: I've owned a Presto pressure cooker for many years and have been very satisfied with it. I purchased this one for my brother, who loves to cook and loves new gadgetry. Mission accomplished: we're both very happy with our purchase. Just a note, when considering pressure cookers, look for stainless steel. It cooks better, cleans better, feels more secure.
