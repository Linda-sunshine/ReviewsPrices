review/summary: Works Great, Until It Doesn'treview/text: I loved this coffee maker so much, I bought it twice.The first one worked for several years, and it was great: the coffee was very well brewed, and the carafe is awesome. The temperature and speed of brewing seemed great for a full-bodied but not bitter coffee, and the thermal retention of the carafe was off-the-charts. I could finish a pot twelve hours after brewing and it was still passably hot.I recommended it to a neighbor, and they loved until it died. Then, when mine died, I ordered another exactly like it. Then IT died.The problem is clearly that the heating element/tube is sensitive to scale. Despite a semi-regular cycle of vinegar, my last one still gave up the ghost with no warning.If you don't mind replacing your coffee maker every 1-3 years then I can genuinely recommend the Zojirushi. Other than being VERY tall for a coffeemaker, it is perfect. Until it dies.
