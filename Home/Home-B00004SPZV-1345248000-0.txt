review/summary: Works great & reasonable pricereview/text: Works even better than anticipated. Seems to be nicely fabricated for the price. Have only used it thus far for spraying butter - but it handles butter with no problem. Of course, the butter must be warmed into liquid form to be sprayed. The aluminum walls are thin, so handle with care when cleaning, so as not to dent or deform. Ten dollars well spent.
