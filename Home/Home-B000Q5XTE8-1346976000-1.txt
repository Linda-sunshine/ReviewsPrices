review/summary: Great Chair for the Pricereview/text: I just purchased 4 of these chairs for my new offices. While they are not as roomy as Aeron chairs, the price is much easier to manage. It remains to be seen how long they will last, but I figured I could buy at least 3 of these chairs for the price of one Aeron chair. :) The chairs look great, and my employees were very pleased with them. They were very, very easy to assemble requiring 20-30 minutes for 4 chairs. Overall, I am very satisfied.
