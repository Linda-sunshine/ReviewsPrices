review/summary: rather anemic torquereview/text: Speed is just fair and has little oomph...not the necessary pull or torque to do much more that cut through a bit of ice cream and liquid for a milk shake. I kept looking for the upper speed switch, but there is none. Otherwise, fairly well made for the price with a good looking bottom detachable wand made of metal.
