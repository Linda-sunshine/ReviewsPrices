review/summary: Love it since 1993 and still use it!review/text: I had my Borner V-power original since 1993. They were sols by product demonstrators back then, who will explain how to use it and how to wash it etc. Reading some of the reviews I feel disappointing that people do not read instructions and then make their opinions based on wrong use of it...You supposed to use for vegetables only. It's very easy to clean. Since it's a very sharp surgical steel you do not touch it with your hand ever, you just rinse it with cold/hot water and leave to dry on the drying rack. For the last 20 years it was a time-saver and and the best tool in the kitchen. The only thing I had to replace was the safety holder. One inert now has a small crack in plastic, but blades are still sharp! Too bad it is now sold without proper instructions :(
