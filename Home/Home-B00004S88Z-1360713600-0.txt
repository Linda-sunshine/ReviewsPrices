review/summary: Very Nice Productreview/text: This is a top of the line MADE IN USA product. It does what it is made to do very well. There are no seals to replace. It came with a very nice instruction & recipes book. Read the book you won't go wrong. A must have for anyone canning meats and low acid foods.
