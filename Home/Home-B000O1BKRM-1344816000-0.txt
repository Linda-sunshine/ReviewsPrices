review/summary: great product... just need to know the trickreview/text: I entertain a lot and have been looking for the perfect unique ice cube, and finally found these. At first I couldn't get a single cube out, and looked here to find reviews and everyone said the same thing. I figured it out! you have to leave the trays out after they are frozen for about 2-4 minutes and then the silicone softens and you can push them out very easily... if you don't do that, they are impossible to get out so that's the trick!
