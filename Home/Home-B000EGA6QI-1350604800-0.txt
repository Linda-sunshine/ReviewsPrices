review/summary: Perfect . . .review/text: Quick and efficient for smoothing soups and blending a morning smoothy. Think it would be perfect for pureeing small batches, so am ordering another for my son to use when preparing his baby's sweet potatoes, avocados, beets, peaches, and spinach. Simpler than dragging out and cleaning up the blender.sg
