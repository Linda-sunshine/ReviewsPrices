review/summary: Small shower now with spacereview/text: I bought 2 of these, one for me, one for my boyfriend. They work great. Mine fits four bottles of shampoo/conditioner, loofah (I hang it from part of the razor attachment), razor, face wash and soap. It hasn't fallen once, and you can slide it off the hooks to easily clean.
