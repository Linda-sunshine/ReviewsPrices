review/summary: AeroPressreview/text: After a little trial and error and help from all the reviews, we now make the best cup of coffee around. It got quite the workout at Thanksgiving, so much so that our son will be receiving one from his wife for Christmas. We are coffee novices but we immediately got an electric kettle to heat the water to the exact 185 degree temp recommended. What a difference. Much more convenient than the microwave route. And it holds that temp for up to 30 minutes. We recommend the AeroPress to everyone who wants great coffee everytime.
