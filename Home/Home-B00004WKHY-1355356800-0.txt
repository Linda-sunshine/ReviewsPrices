review/summary: Great multi-tasker!review/text: It's taken me a while to figure out all of the settings on this bad boy, but it sure is handy when you do. I use it mostly for food prep like grating carrots, cabbage, apples. It took me a little while to figure out the best way to do that.It is a bit bulky, storage is an issue in my home, so finding the right place where it was easy to access but not taking up too much space was challenging. If I had to do it again I'd probably choose the next size down, I don't really need something this big for my everyday prep-work.
