review/summary: Works Well With MityVac Hand Pump Vacuum!review/text: If you are looking to work out your forearms and vacuum seal mason jars for under $40, purchase this along with a MityVac Hand Pump Vacuum Kit and you will have everything you need! Why waste valuable counterspace and over a hundred dollars on a bulky, foodsaver appliance, when you can create your own DIY version for less than $40?All I do is use the tapered attachment for the MityVac and it fits right in the hole on the Jar Sealer and then pump away until your desired vacuum level is achieved.
