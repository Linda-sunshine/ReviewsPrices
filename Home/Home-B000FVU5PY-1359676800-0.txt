review/summary: Great sheets for the pricereview/text: These sheets are great if you are not looking to spend a ton of money on sheets. They were a bit itchy when I first put them on my bed but after about a week that went away. They have more of a t-shirt cotton feel so if you are looking for silky smooth sheets these are not the sheets for you. I do really like them and would buy another set.
