review/summary: Love this!review/text: My husband and I bought a new mattress last year, and it's always been pretty firm. But lately the firmness of the mattress has been bothering me, so I decided to invest in a mattress topper. Based on a positive reviews, I decided to try out the Sleep Studio topper. It's wonderful!. It unwrapped easily from the packaging, and I absolutely LOVE the minty smell--very much like others have said--it smells like a mint chocolate cookie! It's a very calming and lovely smell, relaxing, and so much better than a yucky foam smell like others I have used in the past. And the topper itself is heavenly! Comfy, soft and like sleeping on a cloud. Very pleased!
