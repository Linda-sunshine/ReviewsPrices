review/summary: It's just as advertisedreview/text: Consumer Reports said it was good. Customers said it was good. And it is great!!! All of the other top rated bread makers were well above 100.00. This thing is fantastic and nearly half as expensive as the other top rated machines. We've used it four times since Christmas and we love it. It makes amazing bread and we're very happy with it. If you are looking to buy a bread maker, this is the one you want.
