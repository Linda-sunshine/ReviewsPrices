review/summary: Great Dutch ovenreview/text: Very nice Dutch oven, no issues with the top fitting. I will never again buy Le Creuset because this performs equally well and I won't pass out if I chip or scratch it, like the expensive brand, due to the affordability of a replacement. In fact, I rarely use the costly ones for fear of damaging them. Pretty ornaments, that's what they are.This one cooks well, great heating all the way through, tight seal on the lid. A+
