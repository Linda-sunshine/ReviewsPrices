review/summary: Lodge Cast Iron Griddlereview/text: Slightly small cook surface, grease trays intrude on the cook surface. When first used, in spite of being pre-greased with veg. oil, the griddle stuck in just browning flour tortillas. I'm worried about the pancakes. A substantial grill that once &#34;cured&#34; will likely work well.
