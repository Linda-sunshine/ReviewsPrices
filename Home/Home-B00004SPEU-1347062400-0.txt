review/summary: Works greatreview/text: As someone who is new to this godlike elixir called coffee I'm not sure what my feed back is worth but I like the grinder. I accidentally bought whole-bean coffee so I needed a grinder. I filled this thing with beans and within seconds it was magical bean dust ready for the coffee maker. It can grind it to a very fine powder so much so that I went back to paper filters. It's not too loud but I do take it to the garage to grind it so as to not wake my wife up. As an added bonus, I feel more pretentious telling people I grind my own beans so that's a plus.
