review/summary: My wife loves this. It is heavy thoughreview/text: My wife wanted a dutch oven she could use on the stove and in the oven. We have a glass electric cooktop and she was concerned it might scratch the surface. She's used it several times and she hasn't had a problem. The 5 qt. is large enough for a family of 4-6 and its holding up well.I like the pre-seasoned aspect and Lodge is good quality.It is heavy though, so you'll get a workout moving it around.Cleans up nicely and after a dozen uses, it still looks new.
