review/summary: Great little vacuumreview/text: It's actually bigger than I expected. It's great for stairs and small spaces. Decent in the car. I like the rotating visor. The filter/dust-catcher is easy to rinse clean (which you need to do often to keep it sucking dirt). Price was good. I'm very happy with it.
