review/summary: Burr ginderreview/text: I have been using an inexpensive blade grinder for a couple of years and found it fine most of the time. But...it was obvious that the "grind" went from coarse to powder and everything in between. I decided to try a burr grinder; I read reviews, and picked the Capresso 550.01 Infinity.It has decent reviews and certainly the price was right. I was not willing to go to the $100-300 level.I have had it for some time now and find that it grinds the beans evenly and I can set it to grind from fine to coarse easily. I get the grind I desire and it is uniform. I like the fact that it is much quieter than the blade grinder. My wife makes coffee every day and I generally start with a latte and then move to coffee, so we need a grinder which can change settings easily. I have no qualms in recommending the Capresso Burr Grinder.
