review/summary: Liked at first / hated after replacement filterreview/text: My room is about 144 sq feet, about double what this is rated for.I smoke a lot. A LOT.This was great for filtering the air until I changed the filter (also bought here from amazon). Now there is virtually no suction from the front intake (i can hold a cigarette right in front of the and it doesn't suck anything in.I'd have rated this 5 stars till I had to replace the filter even for an oversized area. Something just isn't right... and it's the filter. It sucks and blows air fine without it. With it... nothing gets sucked in.So to me, it was great for $45 for a year (probably cheaper than other hepa replacement filters)... perhaps I should just buy a new one. (nicotine gums up a lot of things with the tar buildup). There is no reasonable way to open it up to clean blades or anything. I've bought another cleaner... at 160$....from amazon as well.My main purpose is to clear smoke and tar from building up on my computer.I was just very disappointed that the suction failed on the replacement filter. It might as well be a brick.
