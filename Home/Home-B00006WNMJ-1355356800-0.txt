review/summary: Old Housereview/text: My house was built in 1925, so we needed a filter. I started off with a different one, and I can't even remember what it looked like. It would pop off when the water pressure got too high. This filter was much cheaper, and I bought it not expecting it to last long. Well... it has lasted over a year. I signed up for subscribe and save and I don't even have to think about when it's time to change it. It is so effortless and inexpensive. I love that it gets rid of lead, especially when I'm making baby bottles. It is also very secure on my faucet. The water flow is on the slower side, but who cares... what's another two seconds when you're helping yourself to a worry-free glass of delicious water? :)My family loves it! The price and function are perfect for us!
