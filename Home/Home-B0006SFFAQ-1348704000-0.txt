review/summary: Cuisinart stood behind their broken product and made it right.review/text: This truly was the best coffeemaker I've ever bought. Worked great. A couple of months ago, I noticed that it would occasionally shut itself off either while brewing or shortly thereafter. Annoying. But now the problem has become so frequent that it is virtually unusable.BUT, the big concern is that this appears to be an intermittent electrical problem, which are the worst kinds of electrical problems. Especially for an appliance that generates heat and often runs unattended.Cuisinart, please fix these.****UPDATE**** I contacted customer service, did what they told me, told them it didn't work, and they replaced the coffeemaker. Hopefully the same problem doesn't happen again.Kudos to Cuisinart for standing behind their product.
