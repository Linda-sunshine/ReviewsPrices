review/summary: This humidifier will make you go deaf!review/text: I've gone through two of these humidifiers now and they both ended up with the same problem. The first one I had for about 2 weeks and it worked great, and then all of a sudden the motor started sounding like a car without a muffler. Even my husband who sleeps through everything couldn't sleep with it on. It was extremely loud. It was still under warranty, so I figured I just got a defective one and exchanged it for a new one. The new one I only used for a few nights, and then I didn't need it anymore for a while, so it sat in it's box. 6 months later, I take it out again, and it's suddenly horribly noisy like the old one. Unfortunately, since it laid in the closet for several months, it's warranty is long over, so I'm stuck with an adorable, but completely useless humidifier. The claims of it being "whisper quiet" are simply not true.
