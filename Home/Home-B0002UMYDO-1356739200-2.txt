review/summary: Love itreview/text: Wife complained about spending money on a can opener, but not after she used it a few times. Can replace blade if needed, which makes it a long term purchase and much better deal when prorated over time. Pleasure to use, works perfectly every time, and looks nice and unobtrusive when not in use. Very happy with my purchase.
