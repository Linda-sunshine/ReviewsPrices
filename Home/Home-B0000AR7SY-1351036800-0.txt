review/summary: Best Burr Grinder Availablereview/text: I went through sever grinders before I found this little marvel. It's very quiet for a grinder, no unintentional wake-up factor for others in the house and is actually able to grind fine enough for a great espresso. Trust the pamphlet when it says that "extra fine" is meant for Turkish coffee and not needed for a 15 bar pump machine. I use the 3rd highest on the "fine" setting for my Classico machine. Great results and a great product. Buy it!
