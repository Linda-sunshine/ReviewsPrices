review/summary: Clean, but some issuesreview/text: The quality of the manufacture of this mincer is excellent and it basically works extremely well. I have two problems with it:1. The suction function that is supposed to attach the mincer to the counter top simply doesn't work unless you have the right, perfectly smooth counter top to begin with. We have to reattach the mincer several times per use and it can be down-right dangerous if it's not properly attached. Ideally, but probably impractical, would be to have an additional clamp attachment to keep it in place on any surface.2. The turning handle is the least well designed part of the mincer -- it's flimsy and very close to the actual mincer. If that suction cap does come off, it's easy to smack your knuckles on the counter edge... again and again. Not nice. We use ours mostly for mincing chicken, and the thread on the main screw attachment could also perhaps be better designed (or have an additional option) to make turning and mincing much easier. We have to push the meat into the top of the mincer very hard indeed to get it to catch -- it's hard to do this alone and only works best with a partner.The machine as a whole is excellent quality and works fine, but it's hard work. It's not expensive, but we're already seriously considering going for an electric version instead.
