review/summary: Saved my breakfastsreview/text: I have little time to cook in AM, this makes eggs very easily. Steam is extremely hot & towels or oven mits are needed to get it out of microwave.I set it directly in sink & run cold water over it to open & handle eggs. But the eggs turn out exactly as you want them by using the different suggested cooking times. Nifty little helper.
