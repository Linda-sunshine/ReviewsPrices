review/summary: So Happy!! (recently updated!!)review/text: I love it!! The elephant is sooo cute! I renamed him Kumo, which means cloud in Japanese.The dry winter air doesn't bother me anymore!!I've had it for about a week and the cleaning is simple enough. The daily clean takes 10-12 minutes for me and the weekly takes about 45 minutes altogether, but 25 of those minutes are when it's just sitting in the vinegar solution.If you're concerned about the maintenance, I suggest you look up the product manual online before buying.UPDATE!! (been using it almost non-stop for a month; very dry winter heat in home)I have some answers and advice.If a puddle forms under your humidifier, you have it up too high. You don't need to see a foot tall mist shooting out for it to work. I usually can only see maybe an inch or so. If you can't tell when you need more or less vapor, buy a hygrometer. There are cheap, digital ones on this site.Also, the instructions say to put it on a surface that can't absorb moisture, so no wood, cloth or carpet. I have mine sitting on a metal tray and have no moisture issues.I have major sensitives and allergies to chemicals, and still just use white vinegar for the weekly clean. I use about 4/5 warm water and 1/5 vinegar to thoroughly disinfect everything. Vinegar is very acidic, so it is effective at cleaning mold and bacteria.I clean the small amount of white dust (just minerals from my water) with a vinegar soaked paper towel.Now that I've gotten into the habit of the daily water replacement, it only takes me 5 minutes.Even though I don't personally know why so many others had issues, my guess would be lack of common sense, sketchy seller, or they didn't take care of it.I do think it's worth trying, just make sure you read the instructions and buy from a trusted seller.
