review/summary: Too Much Not To Likereview/text: I received the grinder today and it appears to be very well built and the burrs seem to be quality made. It runs pretty quietly. And, the final grounds were fairly consistent, except for the "dust" (see below).Now, for the downside.1.With the smallest "coarse" grind (i.e., the closest to being a "medium"), there was quite a bit of coffee "dust"....about as much as with my cheap-o Mr. Coffee blade grinder. Didn't care for that.2.Following instructions as closely and carefully as I reasonably could, I still wound up with a mess. Grounds and "dust" seemed to fly and settle everywhere.3.And, as one other reviewer noted, there were beans and/or portions of beans left in the grinding chamber.4.Lastly, this thing was a nightmare to clean if you made an effort to get it really clean after using it. There are more nooks and crannies on this grinder than I care to deal with. A few I couldn't even reach with a wash cloth.As usual, Amazon is great about sending stuff back and I have it packaged to send back tomorrow.
