review/summary: Best thing I've gotten in a whilereview/text: I need to add more fiber and potassium to my diet. I used to make smoothies and have a Vitamix which is the bomb. But it's a pig to lug out when i just want one smoothie for myself. I think that's why I stopped making smoothies. So I started looking into personal/mini blenders and saw this. The amount of positive reviews is impressive and here's another one. This does exactly what I want. It allows me to quickly and easily puree some fruits and spinach with a little milk and some protein powder. It handles everything perfectly, but does trip over the spinach SLIGHTLY. There are usually a few bits of spinach lives left in the holes in the housing around the blades. But just a tiny amount. Other than that, which is nothing, it's exactly what I needed and wanted. This is a nifty addition to my kitchen and will get used for lots of things.
