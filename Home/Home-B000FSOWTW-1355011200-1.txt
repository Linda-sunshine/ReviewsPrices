review/summary: Good product but don't choose "frustration free packaging" if giving as giftreview/text: This is a very good product but it comes packaged in a plain brown box if you select the "frustration free packaging". This is a good deal if it is for personal use, but choose the "retail" option (which is a good bit more expensive) if you want to give as a gift.
