review/summary: Soft and fits mattress wellreview/text: This mattress pad is pretty soft and cushy. It fits around the mattress very well because it has thin fabric with elastic at the edges to hold onto the bottom of the mattress, rather than having cheap elastic bands like other similarly priced mattress pads. I didn't think this would be cushy enough to make the bed softer like other reviewers said, but they were right! It does make the bed more comfortable!
