review/summary: My review after sending two units backreview/text: Two times I had it replaced and spoke with customer service before writing a review. The first unit I purchased worked for about a week. The blue light would come on and off unless you got the position of the kettle just right. After a small while it didn't come on at all. I think it was some connection problem with the heating element. I had to pay the shipping myself to send it back. The second unit I got also broke in the next month because it burned itself out. I did receive free shipping on the second one. Thanks customer service for having the second one replaced, hope it works this time!
