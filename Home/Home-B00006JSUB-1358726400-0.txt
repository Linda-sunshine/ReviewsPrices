review/summary: My favorite panreview/text: I use my Lodge 12" pan nearly every day. It's big enough, and deep enough, for just about anything. It transfers the heat nicely to the food, but (as you'd expect) takes a little longer to heat up than a thinner material. Clean-up is easy with hot water and a brush (no diswashing detergent ever) and (after it's dry) a thin coat of vegetable oil. It's, by far, my favorite pan.
