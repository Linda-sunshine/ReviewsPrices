review/summary: Perfect breadreview/text: We had this unit just over a month. We've made regular white, wheat and walnut grain bread. For thanksgiving we used the dough making feature for dinner rolls. Everyone loved them. Clean up is easy. All recipes have been from the enclosed manual. Highly recommended.
