review/summary: Good while it lastedreview/text: I was so excited when I received my first Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Automatic Burr Mill grinder in the mail. It worked for about 2 months and then just stopped working out of the blue. We got in touch with Cuisinart and they sent us a replacement. However, the second one only lasted for about 1 month and we would really only use it once a day. I have given up on getting yet another replacement and instead bought one of the Breville grinders. Hopefully we will have better luck with this one!
