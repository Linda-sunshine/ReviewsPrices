review/summary: The best inexpensive coffeemakerreview/text: Brews hot coffee fast. Carafe heat control (I turn it off). Temperature is important in brewing coffee and this is the only under $100 coffee maker that is even close. If you're not going to spend over $200 for a Technivorm, this is the one to get.
