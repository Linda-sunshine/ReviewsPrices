review/summary: Electric Knife Sharpenerreview/text: I was tired of walking out to the tool shed to sharpen about 7 or 8 knives every few weeks so I treated myself to a gift and I am so happy to have it sitting on the kitchen cabinet ready to use in an instant.I have arthritis in my hands so my knives have to be very sharp at all times. Highly reccommended Cutting all meats and vegetables are so easy now. You will love this knife sharpener.
