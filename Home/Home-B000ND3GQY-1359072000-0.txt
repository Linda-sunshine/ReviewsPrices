review/summary: Fantastic quality..what a deal!review/text: I just got this and am really impressed. I eat stir fry every day, and my old wok was just too small.This thing is really big, and good quality.It is not flimsy like some you see. I like it being stainless for health reasons.If you are use to teflon, it takes a bit more scrubbing, but worth it, also for health reasons. It has a very long handle which i have to manipulate in my small apartment sized dish washer but that's no problem.The fact that it comes with a glass lid is just unbelievable, since the price is so low. I have used it almost every day since I got it.
