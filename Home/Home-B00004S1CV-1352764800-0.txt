review/summary: Great cupreview/text: I really like this Thermos cup - it never spills and keeps the liquid very hot (so you have to be a little careful if you use boiling water). I drink quite a bit of tea, so the infuser is very handy, both for teabags or loose leaf. It is also quite a suitable size for me, both in terms of carrying it and the amount it holds. It is a little smaller than usual cup, but that was exactly what I needed.
