review/summary: love it!review/text: it smelled amazing (like chocolate mint) and expanded quickly - we slept on it the same night. it is super comfortable, and took our &#34;ok&#34; mattress to amazing comfort. i've had it for about a month now and love it even more. it is about an inch smaller length wise than my queen size mattress, and we periodically (approx weekly) have to shift it back to the top of the bed so our pillows don't get stuck between the mattress and mattress topper - but this is not a big deal. really, the only downfall is it that it's so comfortable i don't want to get out of bed in the morning!
