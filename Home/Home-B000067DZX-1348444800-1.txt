review/summary: PUR 2-Stage Water Pitcher Filtersreview/text: DO NOT BUY!!!!!!I Bought a 3-pack on August 27th and had to order more on September 21st because these filters get clogged up too fast... It's a shame or sham because I love how the water tastes from my PUR pitcher. The only reason why I still use my PUR system is because I have a Frigidaire refrigerator and the inline filter does the same thing these filters do... get clogged way before they should. And Frigidaire does not sell a filter bypass. So I'm stuck ordering these things. I gave a rating of one only because the water tastes good...
