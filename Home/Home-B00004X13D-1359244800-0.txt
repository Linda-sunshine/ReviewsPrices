review/summary: Super Happy!review/text: We bought two of these so we could prepare the waffles for breakfast a little faster. Great decision! The waffles are well browned, light and airy and the baker recovers heat quickly so the next batch can get going right away. No issues with them at all. I could not be happier. At the price they are impossible to beat. I am a BIG KitchenAid fan and I was goign to buy the Pro model that lets you bake two at once. I could buy five of these at the price of the KitchenAid.Thinking of buying a third so we can all eat at the same time......
