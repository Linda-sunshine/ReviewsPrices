review/summary: De'Longhi EC155 - Not built to lastreview/text: I like this espresso maker. I make four double shots every day. I used it for just over a year when it first failed. It was leaking water all over my counter. I'm experienced at small appliance repair so I took it apart. I do NOT recommend repairing it yourself unless you have the required experience. One of the two o-rings in the water pump circuit needed to be replaced. I replaced the o-ring (about $2.50) and got another year of use. Then, it failed again with another leak and also stopped heating. This time I replaced the other o-ring and a thermostat. Repair parts cost me about $20. It's working nicely again and continues to give me decent espresso. I got it for half price as a closeout from a big box store, so it's still a good value to me. However, I'm not impressed with the build quality.
