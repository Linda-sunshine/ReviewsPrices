review/summary: Very happy with this purchasereview/text: I love the design and function of this little clock radio. If it turns out to be durable, it will be by far the best clock radio I have owned. The alarm is set by a dial, whether to radio or beep, so it is easy to find by feel and turn off. The snooze bar is long and narrow, also easy to find by feel. The radio is good and the beep is more like a cricket's chirp, not obnoxious at all. I hate obnoxious noises in the morning. I usually use the radio but had set it to beep accidentally, so I found out. The brightness settings are a plus. I keep mine set to the least bright setting, which means I can barely read the numbers in daylight, but in the dark it's fine. I keep the clock turned away from my direct glance because watching the numbers gives me insomnia worrying why I am still awake, lol. I bought this clock in white. The appearance is okay. I have not tried the battery backup yet. I don't need the dual alarm function, but as the alarm control was the thing that broke on my last clock radio -- a Coby, which I do NOT recommend, it lasted 3 mos, if that -- I thought that at least I would have another set if one broke. I will update this review as far as durability when enough time has gone by.
