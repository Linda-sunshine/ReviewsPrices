review/summary: total waste of moneyreview/text: We have tried this on three wine bottles and will not use it again. It goes into the cork and then when you try to pull the cork out,it just doesn't work. Worse then that, you can't push the cork in;nor can use a regular wine opener; basically just throw those bottles out.I will go back to "the rabbit" or the old fashioned type. This is my first totally negative ad. Save your money!
