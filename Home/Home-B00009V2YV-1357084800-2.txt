review/summary: Think I Will Buy Anotherreview/text: I read most of the reviews on Amazon about this product...it is a great purchase! As most folks said, it could be a little complicated to set up, but not impossible.Also the review stating the reception was poor in Louisville, KY has not been my experience. The only time I had difficulty with the reception was when I unknowingly turned down the volume...I couldn't figure out what happend...it worked at my house, but did not at my Mom's (gift for her)...then the volume was checked and it worked just fine.
