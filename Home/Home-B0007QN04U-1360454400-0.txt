review/summary: Kitchen Aid Professional 600 6-quart stand mixerreview/text: I had a Kitchen Aid mixer for over 30 years and loved it. When it was time to replace it, I knew I wanted another one; only a bigger bowl (even though my previous one was large for its time). I chose empire red as I love that color. I've only had time to use it a couple times...for banana bread and a yeast whole wheat bread. Worked great so far.
