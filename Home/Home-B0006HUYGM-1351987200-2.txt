review/summary: Works on comforters!review/text: I have 2 cats. Cat hair was dominating my condo and I couldn't take it anymore! I needed a cat hair vacuum on a student budget, found this, gave it a shot. I've had it for 1 month and so far it is amazing! I pick up so much hair each time I use it that I have to empty the canister and clean off the filter often. It takes less than a minute, so I don't mind AT ALL. Way more economical than all the sticky sheets I was going through, and more efficient. Even using a ton of sticky sheets, I would sit on the couch and stand up covered in hair. I had places that were designated for no one to sit on! Bottom line, my couches are sittable again.UPDATE: I use this vacuum on my bed comforter every other day or so. I almost uploaded a picture of the cat hair picked up the first time I vacuumed it, but I was too embarrassed (loaded the canister with cat hair). I have even used it on my courderoy pants after I have brushed my cats. I'm thinking of buying another one so I don't have to pack the one I have back and forth from the living room to the bedroom so often. I also think I will get one for my parents for Christmas. Small and so worth it.
