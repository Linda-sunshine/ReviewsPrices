review/summary: Popcorn comes out unpopped and tastes stalereview/text: The first time I used it, a bunch of kernels flew out unpopped so there was no advantage over using microwave popcorn, in that respect. The popcorn used was a good, just purchased, quality brand and yet tasted stale and chewy. The unit is cool to the touch but really puts out some heat on top so you need to beware of that too. I know it is better for you but I was not willing to sacrifice that much in taste, so I returned it.
