review/summary: Arrived Broken.review/text: I had to send this back as it arrived broken and could not be replaced according to the seller. Return was easy. They did not package this correctly. Had no popcorn in it just a little bubble wrap around pitcher and it rolled around loose in box it was shipped in. I really wanted this but wasn't willing to reorder after seeing that they did not package correctly to see that it arrived safely.
