review/summary: Good sheets for the price....review/text: These sheets are good for all intents and purposes. However they are very thick, and make you very hot, like sleeping on a towel. Not to say they are not comfortable, because they are, very. I just think these are much better suited for winter to keep you warm than they would be in the summer....P.S. these sheets also have very deep pockets, as they easily wrap around my 14" mattress...
