review/summary: Good Quality!review/text: My husband and I are large people so I didn't want anything flimsy. I feel the price was great for these. I ordered 2 XL twin toppers for our dual-king adjustable bed. They fit perfectly and are comfortable. They didn't have an odor like some do. They shipped really fast and were well packaged.
