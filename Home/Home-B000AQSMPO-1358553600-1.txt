review/summary: Keurig for Christmas!!!review/text: I bought this keurig for my mom, she lives 8 hrs from me and I wasn't gonna make it to visit this year.. That was decided at the last minute, so a couple days before Christmas I bought the keurig. I was very happy to find that it was received with days to spare... The only kind of crappy part was I wasn't given the option to select that it was a present, gift wrap or add a message in like I was with other gifts I bought on amazon. For that reason I had to ship to my sister instead of to my mom and have her wrap it for me. Other than that my mom was super happy so so was I :)
