review/summary: one of my favorite kitchen itemsreview/text: This replaced my first Cuisinart Smartstick which did rough duty for years before one of the blades broke on some ice (I'm not even sure you're supposed to used it on ice, but I did for years.)I use it VERY regularly. Its primary duty is making breakfast shakes/smoothies/frappachinos for my daughters before school. I love it because I can cook potatoes, carrots, etc and then blend them IN THE POT for various recipes. I have gifted it to others.VERY easy to clean. Most mornings I rinse well under hot water immediately after use and throw in the dish drainer and that's it. Every few days I cycle it through dishwasher on top rack. MUCH easier to clean than my old style hand blender.Con: It REALLY purees things...too creamy sometimes. For example, I don't use it for mashed potatoes anymore because they come out too creamy ... just a weird consistency, But for potato soup it is perfect.
