review/summary: The weather alert is so far DOAreview/text: The radio is compact and easily programmed. The problem so far is the weather alert feature seems to not be working at all. We've had 4 different alerts, advisories, warnings since the product was received, and so far the alarm has not sounded once, nor is any message displayed in the screen. Maybe just a DOA example which needs to be replaced, but who likes to have to do that? I've written directly to the Midland Company to see what they have to say, but if they don't respond I'll have to return it for a replacement. Bottom line, it needs to work for weather alerts; that's what it is for.
