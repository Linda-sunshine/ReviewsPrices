review/summary: Great Little coffee maker!review/text: This great little coffee brewer is wonderful! Reasonably priced; quick brewing, a travel mug and takes up little room on your counter. In a small kitchen it fits wherever you have room and makes a great cup of coffe one at a time. It's fast so if you want another, it takes little extra time for that extra cup. An the cappuccino is great!
