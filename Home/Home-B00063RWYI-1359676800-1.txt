review/summary: Lodge cast iron has always treated me right...review/text: I own many cast iron pots, skillets, griddles, etc from Lodge, and I am rarely disappointed. I have had this Dutch Oven for nearly three years and it has delivered as advertised. I have used it for many different things, and like most cast iron pots - if you know how to take care of them, know how to clean them, and know how to re-season them if needed - then you will get MANY years of use out of them.Cast iron takes a little practice to learn how to cook with if you are new to it, but it is a worthwhile investment for the quality results and longevity you will get out of it.
