review/summary: Love them!review/text: All the knives in this line up are incredible. Kinda strange you can get excited about a knife. Guess its more about the positive experience finally. They are light very sharp and really nice to use. I cant quite explain it they are just awesome. I have purchased all the top expensive brands in the past the german brands, high end japanese brands they just dont compare. The build quality here is simple elegant and bulletproof. I know you might cringe after reading about my etiquette here but I throw these in the dishwasher and they come out perfect every time. No rust no damage no dullness. I know your not supposed to put knives in the dishwasher. The dishwasher has in fact ruined all my other expensive knies mainly due to rust leaching out of the blades. Thats probably why they say dont put them in there. You can change that rule with these knives. Love Love Love them! Like them so much I have been buying them as gifts for people:) Its great when a company puts out a great product!
