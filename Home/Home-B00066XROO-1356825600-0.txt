review/summary: Bacon Makin' Heavenreview/text: While some complain about the large size, I love it. It only means I'm not looking for room to move my bacon around. And that's why I wanted it, specifically to make the best bacon I could.The adjustable Tilt 'n Drain feature is really sweet. It keeps you from getting a bunch of spatter, and moves enough of the juices away without leaving you with a bone-dry cooking surface.And talk about easy clean up, so long as you remove the heating element plug-in (and what thinking person wouldn't?) you can submerge the entire beast! Of course you'd need one heck of a large sink to do so, but that simply means that you can splash and wash it as much as you like without hurting it. Of course don't lose your marbles and use a scouring pad on it, for crying out loud! You won't need it. It's got a Teflon (or something of that nature) coating.My only complaint (and this could simply be my ignorance of griddles), is the existence of "hot spots" on the griddle. Yes, I understand that there's a coiled heating element, and I'm guessing that some sort of device that would eliminate such things would be very costly, but that's just what I think. At the same time, even the hot spots weren't that much difference. I could just tell that it was finishing the bacon strips thereupon a bit quicker than those a little further away. So I've got lots of learnin' to do with this griddle, in making the perfect batch-O-bacon. Meanwhile, my first batch wasn't bad at all. Carpe Bacon!
