review/summary: SORRY I DID NOT PURCHASE ONE 20 YEARS AGOreview/text: I am in love with this gadget and take every opportunity to use it. It is great for slicing oranges and lemons for marmelade and for slicing potatoes and vegetables for casseroles and stir fry. The two thickness options are good features. Next project is baked sweeet potato fries. It fits together compactly and in a manner to protect from the VERY sharp blades I encourage you follow the manufacturers safety suggestion of washing it in the case. I have had mine for about a month and it is quick and fun to use for a lot of slicing and dicing. Can't wait to use it on this summer's garden produce. I would absolutely recommend it to enyone who spends time in the kitchen, but it should be kept out of the reach of children.
