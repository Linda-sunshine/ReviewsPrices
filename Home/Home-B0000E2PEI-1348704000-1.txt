review/summary: Good scalesreview/text: We did our research before ordering this scale. Consumer Reports says this scale is a good one and we agree. I weigh over 250 pounds and my cardiologist asked me to weigh daily due to me starting to develop congestive heart failure. We picked this scale. It reads a little different from my cardiologists scale but this is no problem as each of my four doctor's scales read different from each other. The most important factor is that the scale you use at home is consistant from weight to weight. It is important that you have a scale that will weigh up to approx. twice your weight as scales are most accurate at their mid-range. This one will weight up to 400 pounds so this gets me into the accurate range (you need to try to stay out of the top or bottom 10% of the scales capability). This scale is very beautiful to boot. This is not a requirement for me but it is a nice perk. Given the choice to do over, I would purchase this scale again.
