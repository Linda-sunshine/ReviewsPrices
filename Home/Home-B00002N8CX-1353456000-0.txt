review/summary: Great Little Vacuumreview/text: I love this light weight vacuum, it has better suction then my previous upright vacuum. I have laminate flooring and dogs, and this little vaccum really gets up the sand and dog hair. I haven't used it for the car yet but I'm sure it will do a great job.
