review/summary: YAY!review/text: I got this as a Christmas present for my husband, who recently had open-heart surgery; he loves popcorn, but has to be super-careful about his fat and sodium intake, so air-popping is really the only way for him to go. Before this thing, he had to air-pop in this hideous, scarred, discolored plastic thingy in the microwave - the kernel-to-popcorn ratio was comically bad, and it took forever, and produced little-to-no actual popcorn; if we wanted any actual volume of popcorn, we'd have to go through this charade sixty billion times. So I read the reviews, and I got the Presto; I was kind of skeptical about it possibly being as incredibly life-changing as they said, but figured it was worth a shot. It turns out that this thing is made of magic. Seriously. My husband plugs it in and just stands there watching it in awe as it super-efficiently yields ridiculous quantities of popcorn from a single scoop of kernels, all of which tastes light and fluffy and amazing. Seriously - made of magic. One of the best, most unexpectedly genius purchases I've ever made. WOO!
