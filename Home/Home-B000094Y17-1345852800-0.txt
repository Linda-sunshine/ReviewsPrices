review/summary: Good filterreview/text: Easy to use and water is 100% better than it was, not a trace of the chloriney taste we had previously. It doesn't seem to hold much though, and we are only a 2 person family. If I was buying again I would probably get the dispenser. (This one is handy if you are filling a kettle from it a lot though.)
