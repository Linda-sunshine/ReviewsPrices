review/summary: My new companionreview/text: This is the best thermos I've ever owned, hands down. I do a lot of intracity travel with my job, and I rarely have time to stop for coffee (plus, that gets expensive). Coffee from a coffee shop in a coffee shop cup gets cold quick. This literally keeps my coffee hot all day. In fact, I accidentally left this at my office overnight. Cleaned it out the next morning and the coffee that was still in it was still warm! Not necessarily HOT, but still some heat left to it. The 16 ounce size fits perfectly in my backpack. I'm so glad I bought one of these. I haven't tried it with cold drinks yet, but if you're looking for a good stylish thermos that you can keep your coffee in, and will keep your drink hot all day, go with this. It's fantastic.
