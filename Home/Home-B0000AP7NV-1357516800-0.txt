review/summary: Compact, fast, and makes good waterreview/text: I didn't have strong opinions about home water purifiers until I bought this. I've been drinking well water most of my life so it seemed kind of pointless to have a water purifier when the water was already great. When I did live on city water for a while, I had one of those kind that attaches right to the faucet and you just turn a knob for filtered water. I wasn't impressed because the filtered water always came out so much slower. Well we bought a camper and when we go traveling, that's when we find that some campgrounds don't have great water. We couldn't use one of those faucet filters because it wouldn't fit on the camper's faucet (and I didn't like them anyway).This Brita pitcher is so much better for several reasons. First off, you don't have to wait for the water. You just refill it when it gets low and it just makes more water for the next time you need it (and it seems to work a lot faster than the faucet filters and that's probably because the filter in this pitcher can be bigger). Secondly, most of the time we want cold water. At a campground, the first few gallons you run come out of the hose which can be warm in the summer time. With this we can leave the pitcher in the refrigerator so the water stays cold.This pitcher fits nicely in the refrigerator -- even in the camper fridge which is smaller than a home fridge.The water this pitcher makes tastes good too, even when the tap water is nasty, like city water. We've only had a couple of places where the water tastes kind of funny even after filtration through this filter but I guess that has something to do with hard water.
