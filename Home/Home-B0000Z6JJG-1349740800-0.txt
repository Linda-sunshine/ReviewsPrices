review/summary: Presto Salad Shooterreview/text: I bought the Salad Shooter mainly to flake hard cheeses which if done with a manual shredder puts ones finger tips at risk. It does this job perfectly. It also shreds carrots with ease but I prefer a Mandolin cutter for cucumber slices. The Salad Shooter is easy to take apart and the cutters are dish washer compatible. However, replacing the main food chamber does require a special technique in order to have its interlocking bracket properly fit inside the slot on the motor unit.
