review/summary: Does its jobreview/text: The lid opens when you wave your hand across the top front of the lid. It stays open long enough to scrape or toss small quantities of trash. For longer operations, the lid will close on your hand or plate, but it's light weight and just sits there. It's a minor annoyance. I just flip the power to off and the lid will stay up until you close it manually, then I turn the power on again when I'm done.The lid battery(ies) last a long time. I don't know how many there are because I've yet to replace them in a year.After a while I pulled out the deodorizer bracket that juts down from under the lid, because it seems like a pointless addition. That also gives you slightly more space inside the can.Just for what it's worth, I use Glad ForceFlex 13 Gallon Tall Kitchen bags. They fit perfectly in this can.
