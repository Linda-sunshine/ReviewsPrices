review/summary: great waffle makerreview/text: I love this waffle maker. It works great, makes excellent waffles; cleaning is fairly easy (I have no basis for comparison here). I have been experimenting with a variety of waffle mixes (from Trader Joe's, Walmart, Krusteaz), but the absolute BEST waffles I have made are from the recipe that comes with this waffle maker.
