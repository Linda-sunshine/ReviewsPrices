review/summary: Best Rice Cookerreview/text: This is the best rice cooker i have ever owned. Its easy to use and makes wonderful rice. I make steel cut oats every morning and brown rice every night. I just set it at night and its ready for breakfast and then put brown rice in and set it for when I get home from work. I would highly recommend this rice cooker if your a rice "expert" and appreciate the taste and texture of well cooked rice. BEST KITCHEN APPLIANCE EVER.
