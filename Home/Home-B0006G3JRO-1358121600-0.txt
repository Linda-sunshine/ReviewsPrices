review/summary: A good buy at a reasonable price.review/text: Although there are fancier hand blenders on the market, this Cuisinart CSB-77 Smart Stick Hand Blender has replaced my standard blender and two food processors. It is easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to store. It only has one speed, but pulsing it affords me the same results as a blender with a slower speed.
