review/summary: Works wellreview/text: This little steamer works really well- we have had it for almost a year and my husband steams all of his clothes with it. I remember I was choosing between the more expensive one and this one, chose this one, and haven't regretted it. Only thing to watch out for: make sure to clean the water basin every so often or it gets gunky and nasty.
