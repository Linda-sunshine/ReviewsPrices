review/summary: Poorly Made But Makes Decent Wafflesreview/text: This waffle maker does make pretty good waffles but I can not get over how cheap it is for supposed "Cuisinart quality". The amazingly poorly made, loose hinge that holds the 2 parts together will not make it through the warranty period unless I baby it. I am very disappointed and would recommend looking elsewhere for a better waffle maker.
