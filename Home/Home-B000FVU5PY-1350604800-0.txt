review/summary: Very nice sheetsreview/text: These feel a little stiff until you have washed them a few times, after that they are luxuriously soft. They have a nice weight to them, and while they do wrinkle it's more like a crinkly paper bag than big creases. I don't like no iron blends, so I am willing to put up with a few wrinkles to have sheets this nice.
