review/summary: Affordable & It Works!review/text: I got this on Black Friday week at Amazon for $80, so I thought its worth a try. My husband was skeptical whether this will work as good as the commercial steam vacs or not. We tried it last week, and it worked pretty well! We were impressed! However, putting it together up looks very challenging, but my husband got it figured in 20 minutes.I think it is great to have a steamvac at home that works, especially that we have a crazy dog running around the house with muddy paws all the time.
