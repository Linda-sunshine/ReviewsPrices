review/summary: Hefty, good quality, attractive and utilitarianreview/text: I needed something a little better than the sharpener on my can opener, and this fills the bill. I use my inexpensive knives with the ease characteristic of more expensive ones. For the first time I can cut cherry tomatoes without crushing them. I use this just about every day, and use a chef's steel after using this to maintain a good sharp edge.Kitchen snobs look down on electric sharpeners, but I love mine!
