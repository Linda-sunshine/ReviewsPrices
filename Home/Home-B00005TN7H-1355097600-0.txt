review/summary: Works great!review/text: I have used this numerous times with my &#34;old&#34; FoodSaver for vacuum sealing things in glass jars. It's very simple to use and seals great. I've been able to keep food much longer in the sealed glass jars than I would have been able to otherwise. P.S. My 6 and 10 year old grandsons love sealing things for me...it's that easy.
