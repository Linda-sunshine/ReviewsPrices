review/summary: glad i bought thisreview/text: Good product. I've used it a bunch of time already in the month I've had it. Only &#34;complain&#34; is that i wish it adheard to the counter, it's hard to turn the crank, push down the food and hold the grinder down with just 2 hands. I really like it but If i were to do it again I'd probably just pay the extra $25 and get the kitchenaid attachment.
