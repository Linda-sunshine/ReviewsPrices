review/summary: Very Nice For The Pricereview/text: I bought it to vacuum 150 chairs. Picks up everything very nicely, even hair. There is however one design flaw that prevented me from giving it 5 stars. The handle on the top has squared edges. By the time I got to the last 50 chairs those edges were very uncomfortable on my hand. I was glad we didn't have 200 chairs, as I believe it would have left blisters. Simply rounding the edges would make the grip more comfortable. One more flaw: I wish they would have spent 15 more cents on a decent cord for it. The cord is very stiff. On a positive note: you would not believe how much dust it picked up out of the chairs.
