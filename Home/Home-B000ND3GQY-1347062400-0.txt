review/summary: Bought 3...all are pitting after 4 usesreview/text: I teach cooking classes and I love to use stainless steel pans because they clean up so nicely and are healthier for the environment and my clients. I bought these for a large team building event and have used them 4 times in a 5 month period. Today I saw pitting in all of them after they were cleaned and was shocked because I had read all of the great reviews before investing in these.I could not return them to Amazon because it was over 30 days and I just called Cuisinart to inquire about their "life time warranty". I have will have to pay to ship all three to New Jersey (I am in CA) It will take 6 weeks for them to repair (OH BOY) or replace (OH JOY) the woks. Either way, I am not happy with my choice for purchasing these. I will stick with All-Clad is the future. Saving money up front is not worth it if you have to spend money replacing your investment in less than a year.
