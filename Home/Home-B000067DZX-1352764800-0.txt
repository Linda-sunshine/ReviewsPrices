review/summary: Clogs too soonreview/text: These filters are rated for more than 40 gallons of water; however they start to clog after filtering 10 gallons of water. The original filter that came with the pitcher lasted a bit longer but the replacement filters that I bought from Amazon have been a big disappointment.
