review/summary: Not the same brushed Stainless Steel as my old onereview/text: I just had to replace my coffee maker (same model) after 7 years. I think calcium build-up killed it (no longer pumped water efficiently). Maybe because I did not use the charcoal filter. I just got a new one, in what I thought was the same color/finish. Seems like Cuisinart is cutting costs- the finish is plastic, and used to be real stainless steel. I hope they have not skimped on other internal parts.
