review/summary: Unethical switch in products while keeping the same name and rating. Bad Amazon.... Bad!review/text: These sheets aren't awful but they are not very comfortable. They are not worth the price charged.The best sheets we own are the same brand sheets. However, the older set which are SO much better were made in Portugal. These sheets were made in China. China makes many fine products. They also make a lot of cheap knock-off junk. Guess which these are.Sadly, I guess Amazon wanted a few extra bucks and decided to outsource these sheets and they are no longer worth buying.This is deceptive because Amazon uses a rating system. If you dramatically lower the quality of a product that has earned it's high rating, it is morally wrong and absolutely unethical to sell it under the same name. I'm no lawyer so I'll assume that this is legal (although it is a lot like bait and switch which is not). I guess if something is legal, nothing can be wrong with it... right?P.S. I did try soaking these sheets in fabric softener (as someone here recommended in the comments). I have washed the sheets about 20 times, by themselves, using fabric softener and according to their directions. Far better care than I took with their Portuguese counterparts I might add. No luck.
