review/summary: The Designers of this Product Should be Fired Immediately!!review/text: I've been wanting to write this review for a long time, and it seems lots of people got here first with the same complaints. Every time I use this thing I curse its existence and the pathetic committee that surely designed it. My old Britta was just great, but it somehow got a crack in it. When I went to replace it, this is what was available. The older, smaller pitcher had a more secure lid than this thing - it's maybe 1/4 inch of attachment for a huge, heavy, water-filled body. Needless to say, it pops off every time you try to use it. The flap where you put the water in also is poorly attached and pops off often, and even the little attachment knob spins around lamely. Also, the so-called "filter indicator" never once worked. Not once. Britta, you had a good thing going, please stop playing with colors and go back to the drawing board with your product design. Or just make the old Britta available! Oh, and fire the people responsible for this piece of crap!
