review/summary: Seems to work wellreview/text: We've had a few humidifiers and this one seems to get more humidity into the air faster. It also doesn't seem to leave a musty smell like some, but we haven't had this long. I do wish it had a humidistat and would also be nice if it had the UV technology for killing bacteria/mold like some of the newer units.Overall, this doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles, but seems to be a good, reliable humidifier that moves a lot of air and humidifies large rooms well.-Jaden
