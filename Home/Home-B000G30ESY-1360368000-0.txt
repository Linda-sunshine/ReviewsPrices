review/summary: Great for busy people!review/text: I would never cook brown rice before because I didn't have the time after work to cook it and have it ready by dinnertime. With this rice cooker, I can set the timer and have it ready and waiting for me. I've used it several times so far and it's worked perfectly. One thing that's hard to get used to is that the clock is set in military time. Because of that, I set the timer incorrectly the first time. And the directions say that the timer is automatically set with whatever you set the first time and there doesn't seem to be a way to check the settings without resetting it. If not for the confusing timer, I would give it 5 stars. The rice itself is wonderful! It tastes much better than when I cooked it on the stove.
