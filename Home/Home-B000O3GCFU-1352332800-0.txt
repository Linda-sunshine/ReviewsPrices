review/summary: Great thermosreview/text: I bought this thermos for my daughter in Kindergarten to bring hot lunches to school. It works great. I put boiling hot water in it and close the lid tight..Leave it for 10 to 15 minutes then I empty it and put the hot food in quickly and then closet it up tightly. Her food is hot/warm when it's time for lunch. If I pack chicken nuggets or things that can get soggy from the water that was in it I just wrap it in tin foil then put it in the theros. This is a perfect size for her lunch box and holds just the right amount. We love this product and use it often. We wash it in the top rack of the dishwasher.
