review/summary: Beautiful coffee pot!!review/text: It was time to replace our old Cuisinart Coffee Pot and instead of getting one from a department store, we went online to Amazon as we have been very satisfied with our purchases to date.We found the one we wanted, interestingly, they had this beautiful metallic red coffee pot. Being adventurers, we chose the red one...I mean we would never lose it in the kitchen, lol!!When the package came, had my husband open it. He took a look at it and went, "Wow", due to the beautiful red color. We have always had the stainless steel or black look. My gosh, how daring we have become!!So, not only does it make the best of the best coffee, it is a conversation piece as well.By the way, we don't use the filters that come with it, no need to.Thanks again for carrying another great product, Amazon!!
