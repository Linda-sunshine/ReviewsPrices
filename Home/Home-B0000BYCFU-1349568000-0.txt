review/summary: Love This Cannerreview/text: At first I thought I would need to get an All American and was hesitant to consider anything else . But since I have a glass top stove I opted for the less heavy Presto . I am so thankful I did ! It works wonderfully and the price was fantastic. I have already canned over 60 jars since my purchase . It did an amazing job. You won't be disappointed in this baby .
