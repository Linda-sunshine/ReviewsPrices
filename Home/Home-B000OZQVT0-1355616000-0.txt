review/summary: Too much odorreview/text: I purchased a wall mount gel fireplace and these cans of fuel as gifts for my sister-in-law. Unfortunately, she doesn't use the fireplace because of the odor from the gel. These (the gel fireplaces) are a nice idea; I hope the odor problem can be eliminated, though.
