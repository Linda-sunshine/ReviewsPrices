review/summary: Sturdy, powerful blenderreview/text: Why is it so hard to find a good blender? After going through a couple, I purchased this one. I've had it for over a year now and am still very happy with it. The base is HEAVY and makes the whole thing stand securely on the counter. I've had no trouble with leaks, as another reviewer suggested. And the color makes me smile.
