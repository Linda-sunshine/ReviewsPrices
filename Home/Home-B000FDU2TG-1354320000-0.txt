review/summary: Blending Happilyreview/text: The first KitchenAid blender we purchased blended well but began to leak from the bottom within a month. KitchenAid was extremely responsive to our complaint about the leaking and replaced the glass jar with the Polycarbonate jar at no cost to us. We haven't had a leak since receiving the new jar and we use this blender daily to make smoothies with frozen fruit. It is easy to clean and works as well as the more expensive blenders. We are happy with the performance of this blender and the service by KitchenAid. If you have any problems with leaking, let them know. They will help.KitchenAid KSB560MC 5-Speed Blender with Polycarbonate Jar, Metallic Chrome
