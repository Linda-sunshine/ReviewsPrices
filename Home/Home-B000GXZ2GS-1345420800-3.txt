review/summary: Great coffee maker for a noob to coffeereview/text: Great product. Very simple to use and not overall time consuming. I usually wakeup late so the drip works on weekdays, but weekends I always reach for this. Makes a bit less strong than expresso, but keeps a clean and bold flavor I like. Personally I only would use it for expresso type and latte, as americano just tastes not right. Thats just me personally though. Think overall my favorite thing about this is how very clean the coffee is, there is no residue and very little acidity from the oils, making it my perfect little device when I want something better than drip.
