review/summary: Sounds like a hair dryer and clock face is unreadable!review/text: I purchased this clock about 3 months ago. I'm not sure why I've tolerated it that long. The blue light on the face of the clock is exceedingly bright (even on the lowest setting) but does not illuminate the numbers for the time to be read. I have to tilt the clock (or my head) to read the time. Forget about reading it across the room. The snooze only works for half an hour then it just goes off - I've overslept a few times as a result - what were they thinking!!!??? The sounds are not unique - they all sound like water or static, depending on who is listening. I had a sony dream machine previously and while it wasn't perfect, it was far superior to this. Conair should stick to hair dryers - maybe that's the sound I'm hearing...
