review/summary: Should Have Listened to the Other Reviewers!review/text: I decided to take a chance on this kettle because there were quite a few positive reviews. I figured maybe I'd get one of the good ones. Hah! I got a leaker. It leaked after the first use. I tried it 2 more times just to be sure and it leaked both times. Also, the filter that came with it was not like the one shown in the picture. Mine was silver, not gold, and didn't have the cross pieces. Very flimsy filter. And the spout was different also. There were no tabs for the filter to slip into. You just snap the filter in place and hope it stays. All in all, a waste of time. Thank heaven for Amazon's 30 day return policy.
