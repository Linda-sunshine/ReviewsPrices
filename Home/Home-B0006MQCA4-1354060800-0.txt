review/summary: Water was so foul we spat it outreview/text: This is the first time I have ever given a product one star, but I just thought other people might want to know that there is something really off about these filters. At first, the water was fantastic. Then, about 4 weeks later, it started to taste really off. So I bought another filter. Again, tasted great for a couple of weeks and then seriously foul, kind of like a metal, bitter taste. I thought it might just be me until I saw my husband pour himself a big glass and instantly spit it out. Of course, by this point I had tossed the original packaging and everything so we ended up throwing out the filter and and we just use the nice big container to keep our tap water cold. So if you buy it, hold onto everything and wait a month. Other than the impossibly awful taste, everything else was fine.
