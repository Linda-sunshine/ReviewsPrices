review/summary: Comfort at a Sensible price rangereview/text: The only reason I bought this chair was because it resembles the Herman-Miller Aeron Office Chair, which I currently use at my job. After reading reviews stating that it was visually and, more importantly, functionally similar to the the aforementioned Office Chair I was thrilled to have found such a product....especially at the price range. After using it on multiple occasion for a few hours at a time, as well as one or two 12 hour sessions I will admit that it is not as comfortable as the Aeron, but is 1/5 of the price and that is a great trade off. Although it does not beat the Aeron, it is MUCH more comfortable than most computer chairs I have used and leaves little to be desired as far as adjustments go. My favorite feature, which is not found on most chairs, is a locking mechanism that allows the back of the chair to be tilted as far as you like, opposed to a tension solution which only slows how far back you can you tilt
