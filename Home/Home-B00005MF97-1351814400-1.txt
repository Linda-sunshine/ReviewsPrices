review/summary: Nice for hummusreview/text: I bought this for making hummus and other bean dips. It's powerful enough and doesn't overheat with some extended mixing to get the perfect texture. A little messy to clean out like any blender. The plastic container seems a bit lightweight but hasn't cracked after almost a year of intermittent use. I'd say it's a good little unit for the price.
