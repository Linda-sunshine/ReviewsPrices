review/summary: Cuisinart makes a great coffeemakerreview/text: The Cuisinart coffeemaker is very easy to use and has great features. My first complaint is that the permanent filter lets some coffee grounds through so I use a paper filter that catches the coffee grounds and does not have to be washed. My second complaint is that the rim on the canister prevents my being able to pour every drop of coffee out. These are very minor complaints, so I would recommend this coffeemaker.
