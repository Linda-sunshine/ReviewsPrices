review/summary: Wonderful little food processorreview/text: I've had my Black and Decker food processor for seven years, an earlier model obviously, and have loved it. It is small enough to store easily and simple enough to get out for even small, quick jobs. It comes apart and washes beautifully, either by hand or in the dishwasher. It has enough power to crush ice. Mine is finally on it's last legs so I am buying another. I highly recommend this product.
