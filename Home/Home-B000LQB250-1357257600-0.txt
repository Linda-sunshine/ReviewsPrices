review/summary: Minty Marshmallowreview/text: We bought a new mattress and after a few nights of not adjusting very well to it I ordered this topper. For the first month it smelled like mint toothpaste, which wasn't unpleasant at all, and provided a nice amount of cushioning. After that the smell went away but the foam is still just as soft. In retrospect I should have probably bought this topper and tried it out on my old mattress before I bought a new mattress, I would have been just as happy.
