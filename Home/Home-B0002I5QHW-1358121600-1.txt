review/summary: very diappointedreview/text: I bought this more for the pasta maker than a meat grinder thinking both might be useful. Mistake. The pasta maker clogs up continually and the base won't stay fastened down. Eventually had to take the dough out and do it by hand as I couldn't get it go through. Waste, waste, waste of time and money. Won't buy that brand again.
