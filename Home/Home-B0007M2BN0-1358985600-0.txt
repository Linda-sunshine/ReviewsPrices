review/summary: It fell a part and it's too hot to handle.review/text: it worked the first 4 times I used it (I used it once a week). Then the metal cap on the inside cover came out and it wouldn't go back in flush with the top of the egg - which caused it to spark in the microwave.Even if that hadn't happened the egg is hard to handle out of the microwave as it's really hot. Some sort of handle or at least a pull tab at the top would have been helpful. You can't get the top off until it cools down.
