review/summary: Somewhat disappointedreview/text: I love expresso and I wanted something for my office. Maybe I should have looked or investigated the features before I invest in it.My issue with it are :1. Too much vibration and the cup need to be held down sometimes to avoid bouncing off the platen2. No timer to turn off the brew, I wish it had turns of water when a specified volume had been dispensed.What do I like?The price.
