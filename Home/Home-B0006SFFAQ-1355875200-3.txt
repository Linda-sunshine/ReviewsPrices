review/summary: I drink coffee at home again.review/text: Coffee at home was horrible and I would spend money at fast food or gas stations to get my cup of Joe.After purchasing this Cuisinart I have returned to having a coffee with my wife in the morning.The carbon water filters are great and even tap water makes great coffee.I have been using whole bean coffee and I purchased a grinder at the same time as this purchase.We now try all different kinds of coffee and enjoy the variety.Delivered on time and packaged well.So for the pros and consProsMakes great coffeeLove the delay timer.Comes with gold tone filter. &#34;I still use paper filter it guarantees no grounds get through. &#34;Comes with carbon filter. &#34;I ordered a 2 year supply so no worries for a while. &#34;ConsCan't access flip lid to fill water or filter if you place under a counter.Reservoir fill hole is kind of small.Although I had cons listed I was very happy with this product. And will enjoy my coffee after I'm done writing this feedback.
