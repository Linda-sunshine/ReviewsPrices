review/summary: Pretty, and makes great coffee too!review/text: I'll be honest, I purchased this coffee maker because of the great color choices. However, it makes a great cup of coffee very quickly, and with very little noise. Others have complained about the size and placement of the water reservoir but I have not found this to be a problem at all. It's set up just like almost every other coffee maker I have had, so I'm not sure what others are expecting. I don't find it difficult to pour the water. It's also easy to program and allows you to choose the temperature of the coffee. I like mine really hot so that's a great option. The only small problem is that the clock display is not well lit and is hard to read from a distance. That does not bother me because I don't use it as a clock anyway. The beautiful pop of pink in my kitchen first thing in the morning makes me smile, and it had works well too. I would definitely recommend it.
