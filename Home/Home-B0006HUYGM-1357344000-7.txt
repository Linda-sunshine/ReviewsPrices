review/summary: decent hand held vacuum while it lastsreview/text: The vacuum itslef has good suction power and we used it to clean the cars, steps etc. -- places where it is hard to get a regular sized vacuum. The weak point of this is the rotating brush on the front. Once you get a few hairs inside it, this gets tangled up and stops turning. Cleaning it is a lengthy process involving removing some screws and cutting the hair off with a utility knife. After this happened a couple of times, the plastic drive bit connecting the brush and motor broke rendering the brush useless. Without the brush, this is not as effective. Overall, it lasted for about an year of occasional (couple of times a month) use.
