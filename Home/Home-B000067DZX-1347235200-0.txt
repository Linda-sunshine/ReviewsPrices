review/summary: Happy Waterreview/text: I've been using my PUR water pitcher for about 5 years now, and wouldn't want to do without it. The faucet water does not taste good and the filter pitcher removes every bit of taste plus the lime and other minerals.Thanks for continuing to offer these products - even if they are not available in local stores. Using AMAZON to purchase was amazingly easy and fast with fast delivery.Gretchen Dickinson
