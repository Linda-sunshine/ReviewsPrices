review/summary: Works but has some issues ...review/text: First of all I like the small size of the unit since it takes up little room on my counter. But that comes at a price. There is very little clearance for anything but the smallest espresso cups (don;t think of trying to fit a normal mug or cup).You would also since they only thing that can fit under it is an espresso cup that the unit would dispense the right amount automatically. Nope, you have to manually turn it off when it reaches the right level.Final quirk is that the flow between the two nozzles is seldom even. One side always seems to get the bulk of the flow. Perhaps it is the way I load pods in it. But I only make a cup at a time so that is okay I guess. Which sums up my review. The unit is okay considering the price.
