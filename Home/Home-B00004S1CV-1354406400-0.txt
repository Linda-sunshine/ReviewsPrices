review/summary: Great retention of heatreview/text: I have a 45 minute commute to work and don't like to drink piping hot coffee in stopping and starting traffic. Now I don't have to buy coffee closer to work and can finally enjoy my espresso from home. The lid that screws on over the drinking lid is great for sealing in heat and I've tossed it into my purse with no worries. A really good buy.
