review/summary: I love this thingreview/text: Sorry to see so many negative reviews on this product, certainly hasn't been my experience! I purchased this about 2 years ago and use it all the time, primarily to blend hot soups - it does a great job with this. I didn't expect to use the small chopper that the blender came with, but I find myself using it all the time for salsas, tapenades, sauces, etc. when the quantity doesn't justify dragging out the food processor.I will say that I haven't tried this against any major blending jobs, but I don't think that's its intended use... Overall I'm very happy with the product and would buy it again and recommend it.
