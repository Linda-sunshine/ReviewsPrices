review/summary: The best little vacuum ever!review/text: I am so happy with this vacuum! We just purchased the first house we have had with stairs. I was having such a hard time getting them clean with the regular vacuum cleaner, so I did a little searching for a solution and found this handy dandy item. This thing has suction like I couldn't believe, and it left the stairs and risers looking like they had been professionally cleaned. I would recommend it to anyone that has carpeted stairs in their home.
