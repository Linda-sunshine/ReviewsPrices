review/summary: Where have you been all my life??review/text: Have been using a food processor most of my life to do soups and such, with much mess and multiple bowls, pots, and food processor to clean up afterwards. This does the trick in the same pot I cook in, and cleans so easily! The fact that it comes apart in two pieces makes it so much easier to store than my big, bulky food processor. Will be making far more batches of soups in the coming weeks. Super product!
