review/summary: if you like to buy cute humidifiers you deserve thisreview/text: Sorry, someone SHOULD be at least able to make a cute little niknack for a little kids room that's also functional, but this isn't it. Since it produces a cool mist you might think it's no longer idiotic to have a vaporizer that might catch a young child's attention, but you should reconsider.Mine's a bit more consistant or durable than some other reviewers units, but it never has put out a lot. If it did, you'd hafta refill it's tiny reservoir every couple hours anyhow.- poor output- poor capacity- poor adjustability- clumsy to fill / refill (the reservoir cap design defeats its own purpose too)- can't operate on carpeted floor, the air inlet is very easily obstructed- poor durability /reliability
