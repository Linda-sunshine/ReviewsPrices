review/summary: Heaven for a tea lover!review/text: A friend turned me on to the Ingenuitea, and I'm so glad she did! I am a tea-a-holic, but I've never bought loose leaf tea because making it was messy and I hated the bits of leaf that infiltrated the tea. But this nifty little device solves that problem. It's one of those ideas that is so simple, it's amazing no one thought of it before. I bought a pound of my favorite loose leaf chai tea and am enjoying it every morning thanks to this.And please do buy it from Amazon! It is cheaper here. I was not so smart and did not look to see if it was here before I bought it and paid a bit too much.
