review/summary: Loved it initially, but quality deteriorated quicklyreview/text: First, this is a really soft mattress topper. I absolutely loved it initially - it had a weird peppermint smell that went away quickly and was extremely comfortable. However, it started sagging in a couple of months so I decided to return it and take a hit on the restocking fee.For those who are trying to use this to fix their mattress: beware. It will not work.
