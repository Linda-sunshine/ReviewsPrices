review/summary: Great little coffeemaker for the money!review/text: I really only drink one cup of coffee most days, so wanted something smaller than even my 4-cup pot. This single-serving coffee maker does the job and takes up less space. The water reservoir is in kind of an awkward place, especially if you're right-handed, but I just put the water in a measuring cup with a lip so I don't have to worry about my aim. The mug is fine if you're staying home, but by no stretch of the imagination is this a respectable travel mug. Since only the outside is stainless (the inside is plastic), coffee does not remain hot even during my 10-minute drive to work. Easily solved...I simply transfer the coffee to a higher quality, better insulated travel mug I already had and now I have a hot cup of coffee when I get to work. Overall, it was a great purchase for the money. No regrets!
