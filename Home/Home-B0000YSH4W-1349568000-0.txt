review/summary: Pretty Good Bookreview/text: Pretty good book. Nice plot, excellent description, I totally recommend it. Would have been nice to know a little more about the book before getting it, though through a bit of work on the internet, it's definitely possible to find out more on The Giver. Attached is a link in case anyone is wondering where to learn more:[...]However, the link is extremely informative so for anyone who doesn't want to know to much, don't go to this link.Pretty much, exciting, though sometimes a little bland, but for readers who want a nice bit of reading.
