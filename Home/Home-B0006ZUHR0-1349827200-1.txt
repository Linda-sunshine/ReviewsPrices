review/summary: Cord Storage?review/text: The box says "Added Value, Cord Storage", I sure can't find anywhere on the iron that allows for cord storage.I was impressed with the swivel at the base of the cord to prevent tangles. The steam produced was good and the digital readout is easy to read. If it wasn't for the false labeling, I would have given it five stars.
