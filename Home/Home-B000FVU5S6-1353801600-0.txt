review/summary: Great sheets! Good size and very comfortable!review/text: Purchased queen size. Was very happy with this online purchase. Pockets were plenty deep for a queen size pillow top bed. May even wash them on hot next time to shrink them a little more. Nice feel for new sheet, but will be even better in a couple more washings. Fornew sheets not that wrinkled or stiff. Was pleasantly surprised with the size of the top sheet compared to other top sheets as well. It was long enough so will always stay tucked in on the bottom, and plenty wide enough so no fighting over the top sheet. Ended up ordering another set for backup.
