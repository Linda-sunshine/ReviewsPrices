review/summary: A god-sendreview/text: This canner is amazing. As an avid gardening hobbyist I always have a ton of jars to pressure cook. My jams and jellies and spaghetti sauces and tomato purees have all been through this cooker, and every one has been preserved just fine. You'll find no better value for the size, if you can as much as I do this is a classic tool needed in your kitchen. And as a bonus, you can make brown mashed potatoes in 4 minutes!
