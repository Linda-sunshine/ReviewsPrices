review/summary: Horriblereview/text: I purchased this tumbler specifically for brewing tea on the go. Big fail. The infuser screen is the worst I've seen as the holes are so big the leaves go right through. It also says that it is good for coffee. This is also not true. Even the coursest ground coffee goes through. I only wish it was worth my time to send it back. I never write reviews and I usually love Thermos products. It works fine without the infuser although it's small and holds a small to medium size cup of tea or coffee.
