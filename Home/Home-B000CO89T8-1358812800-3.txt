review/summary: Not a great ideareview/text: I think I paid $8 for this, so I figured for the price that I may as well try it. It's pretty useless, unless you want to make the mug so hot that you burn your hand, it doesn't heat the liquid inside. I used it once and threw it out and went back to my routine of letting my beverage get cold and then microwaving it.
