review/summary: Saved a lot of money over calphalon and all-clad.review/text: I'm not a professional chef. Maybe I would notice a difference between this set, and the others I previously called out if I was one. I think this set of cookware is an excellent value when compared to others costing twice as much. The volume of the largest pot is good; I wish it was shaped a little wider and a little less tall (more like a dutch oven). The pans preheat quickly on electric or gas. Food cooks quickly, and the pans behave like you would expect for stainless. The saute pans deglaze well, and they clean as fast as non stick if you clean them shortly after cooking in them. I came from a set of calphalon basic hard anodized cookware to these, and I don't intend to go back. I cook everything in these that I used to cook in hard anodized (even over easy eggs). As long as you are willing to learn the difference between cooking in non stick and stainless (use a little oil when cooking... preheat the pans... use less heat) I think you will be satisfied with this set.
