review/summary: Good Economical Upright Vacuumreview/text: This simple economical vacuum does exactly what I need, pick up the dirt, dust & pet hair off my floor. The 12 amp motor is powerful enough to quickly clean my 2 dogs hair off the carpet floor. I do not like bagless vacuum cleaners & could only find 1 that held a very small bag at my local Walmart. This one takes what I would call a standard size bag that will take longer to fill up. The only thing I've found that I don't like is the too short hose. When trying to use the attachments on something that is not close to you or higher than a foot or so off the ground, the hose twists and slips out of its notched lock-in collar. Otherwise this is a good economical vacuum that I would recommend.
