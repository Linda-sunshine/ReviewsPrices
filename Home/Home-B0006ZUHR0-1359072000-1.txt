review/summary: Love itreview/text: I had always bought Rowenta irons in the past but read that their quality has gone down hill so I got this iron. I own several other Black & Decker products and this iron stands up to their name for quality and ease of use. I love the digit setting readout. It's a little heavy, not too much, which makes it easy to use. All in all it's a great iron.
