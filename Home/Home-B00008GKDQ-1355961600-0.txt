review/summary: Perfect for indoor grilling.review/text: This product works as advertised. When using the grilling side, it leaves nice grill marks and cooks evenly. The griddle side also works well for breakfast cooking. If there is a downside, it is sometime tough to clean the grill side because of the ridges. However, a stiff brush should do the job.
