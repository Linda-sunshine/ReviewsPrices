review/summary: Not very goodreview/text: I purchased this unit in December for use in a very small office. Only two months and the fan has started squealing and makes an unbearable noise. I no longer have the box it came in, nor the packing slip that is required to return. There is no reimbursement for return shipping and not sure about the exchange. It will probably cost $12-$20 to return plus my time, so it is not worth the hassle, as they probably assumed for most people.
