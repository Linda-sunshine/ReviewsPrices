review/summary: good stuffreview/text: First of all, it doesn't leak. Just don't overfill it or get water in the lid around the blue insulator. Once the lid is on you can shake it like a blender bottle or hold it upside down, not a drip comes out. I put ice in it around 4am, filled it up with cold water 4-5 times through out the day, and went to bed with ice still in the bottle. So far I have had the same ice for close to 24 hours before I had to put a few more cubes in it. Fantastic. Keeps liquids extremely cold. I am not a coffee drinker so I can't say how well it works with heat yet, I can only assume it works well.
