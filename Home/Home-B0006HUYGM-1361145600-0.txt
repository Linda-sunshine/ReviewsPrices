review/summary: Hasn't even been a year, no longer vacuumsreview/text: This vacuum was great for the first few months,Then it gradually began to fail at sucking up particles.Now it makes my floor dirtier by use, even though I've cleaned it with nearly every use.It refuses to pick up a few measly cornflake crumbs, and much else.Instead it decides to just push them around...It pretty much just gets clogged by dust very easily...my room is dusty.Not worth the money if you don't plan on buying another within the next year.
