review/summary: Trashy Design Do not BUYreview/text: Ok this does grind coffee beans fine. But it has a flaw that makes it totally unusable.THE FLAW is the burr grinder is removable to remove excess ground coffee out. That is really nice. It needs to be done after each grinding. However if it is inserted upside down it CAN NOT be removed. It is then totally useless. Even if a warning (none) that this can happen it drops in perfectly. A friend put it in upside down. NOW can not use. $70 wasted. It is a terrible terrible design,. This is likely to happen as fits perfect and in hurry others will put in wrong. Thy provide no way to remove, If one of 3 prongs for alignment were made like diamond this could NOT happened. The cost would stay the same to manufacture. DO NOT BUY as will happen eventually to any user. Truly sad as grinds coffee beans nearly perfectly.I did call their customer support. The technician gave walked me through how to fix. It is easy to do. BUT when not usable because do not know how to fix it is very very frustrating. I moved up to 2 stars as grind is good, design is not well thought out.If you buy be aware that that soft rubber ring on upper burr grinder must go up. But it will go in wrong and does not remove easily.
