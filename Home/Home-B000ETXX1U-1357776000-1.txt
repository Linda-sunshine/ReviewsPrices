review/summary: A Great Bed!review/text: I bought this bed for our guest bedroom and it has been used about 15 times. Two people have slept on it at once, one person alone, another with two dogs - and this bed is still going strong! It's so easy to set up, just plug it in and it inflates with no problem. I have some deep pocket sheets that fit perfect on it and they don't come off. I also love it because it's a breeze to put away, it has a deflate option and you just roll it up and stick it back in it's bag. If you are looking for an inflatable mattress for your home, this is the best choice!
