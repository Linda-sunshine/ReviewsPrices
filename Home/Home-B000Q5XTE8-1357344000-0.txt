review/summary: Chainreview/text: Better that the one being replaced. This one has a fabric seat, so don't have to worry about it getting easily damaged like the bonded leather ones. The cheaper seats with bonded leather will fail sooner than one would expect; what can you expect from cheap leather?The only thing that I would like changed on this chair is a padded arm rest. These plastic ones are harder on the arms, but still better than failed bonded leather after only a few years.Would buy again.
