review/summary: Will soon be your most expensive paperweight! :-( Keep your old coffee maker!review/text: I had purchased this unit for my wife for her birthday awhile back here on Amazon.com. Amazon did a great job shipping the unit safely to my front door in a timely manner. My wife absolutely loved this machine and so did I. We used it every morning for coffee or tea. After a couple months the unit stopped working and just displayed the words Brew temp on the LCD panel. We tired unplugging it and plugging it in again and using different outlets etc. After about a week we plugged it in again and it started working again! We were so relieved! After about another month the unit began to display the Brew Temp message again and has never worked since. Now I have a useless coffee maker that cost over 100 dollars. I'm back to my 12 dollar coffee maker that I have had since the late 90s. It has never let me down.Overall this is a great unit when it works. After that you are left with an expensive paper weight. Don't waste your money with these units until Keurig starts getting better in the department of QA!
