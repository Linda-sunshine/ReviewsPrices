review/summary: Smaller than you might thinkreview/text: I had read a review that these were smaller than expected. That was fine with me since I use mine to keep fresh veggies and fruits in the fridge. The biggest rectangle is 8.5" x 6.5" and the smallest one is an inch smaller. The largest round container is 6" across and perfect for small amounts. I love the clear glass so that I can see my healthy snacks readily when I open the fridge. The colorful lids are much more exciting than sets with all blue lids.
