review/summary: Great coffee and so adaptable!!review/text: This is awesome. I am not sure about everyone else but I am a little bit of a germaphobe. That being said, I have never been comfortable about the cleanliness of coffee machines. There is never enough vinegar to satisfy my concerns about there being black mold growing inside the small tubes that I cant get a soapy sponge or brush into. This product is excellent at putting my concerns to rest. Firstly, I can slap the whole contraption in the dish washer! I love being able to get a sponge or cylindrical brush into all the parts to give it a great clean. I can put the whole coffee pot in the refrigerator and the coffee is still pretty good the next day. The best part is after waiting for it to finally get the water to a rolling boil. You can watch the coffee and monitor how deep of a brew you want. If you want the coffee a little weaker, turn off the burner, BE CAREFUL and pour off your cup. Stick it back on the stove and allow it to return to a boil for people who want stronger cups. It's great!! You can really go for a weak sort of coffee flavored tea to supper strong death tar all in the same pot!! It's perfect! The next day if it's a little strong. Add water before you reheat it. If it's a little too weak. Return the coffee brew filter tin and add another table spoon and boil. So adaptable! Worth the price. There is really only one draw back that is worth mentioning but does not drop the star on this. Sometimes you can get coffee grinds in your coffee. Not a lot but it is noticeable when your coffee is getting low in the pot. I find that this really not a big deal. To remedy most of this just remove the brew kit prior to pouring and just leave the last 1/2 to 1 cup of coffee in the pot.
