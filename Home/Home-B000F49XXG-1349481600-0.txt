review/summary: Great Espresso at a Great Pricereview/text: I've been making espresso with this machine once a day for two months. It's always good and I never have problems. It's important to let the water heat up for 10-15 minutes. In the past, I used the AeroPress and Moka. They're cheap solutions, but they don't make espresso. If you're looking for inexpensive, real espresso, this is your answer.
