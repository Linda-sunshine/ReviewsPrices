review/summary: Fantastic. Exactly what I was looking for.review/text: I've always used Britas, but where I live now has great tap water. I wanted a pitcher that I could keep filled with water in the fridge, and this pitcher is exactly what I was looking for. The top seals on top very easily.It was much smaller than I expected it to be when it first arrived, and I was pretty disappointed, but looks are deceiving. It holds about 5-6 large pint glasses worth of water for those that want a reasonable metric.
