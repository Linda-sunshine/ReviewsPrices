review/summary: Value SteamVacreview/text: Comparing this to our old Bessel proheat which leaked (just leak everyone does) but that model did clean wonderfully this model which is half the price cleans on par of the proheat 1x.While it does not have any heat at all, it is well built for the money spent.This is made out of plastic, and can feel "cheap" as some have said.But it does the job well, and cleans my old carpets up great.Pros-The Multi-Spin brushes that are removable for cleaning-Two tank system, no more bladder yuck.-Comes with a plastic wand device to clean hair out of vac tube area-Holder for brush handle on topCon- You have to disconnect the hole system to connect the hand tool. So you have to plan ahead on doing this such as first or last but I have found that in some ways this could prevent the leaking that I Bessel is known for (I had two models from the hand tool leak so this solves that to a point but I'd rather have a disconnecting slot on the back)-Not very wide, and the tank fills up fast.But this is what you get with a cheaper small model.Also don't get the "pet" version.Hoover SteamVac Pet Complete Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge - F5918900All they did is repackage this model with "pet cleaner" which you could pick up cheaper in a bigger oz bottle. It does not feature any other feature that this model does not. Save the ten dollars and in my opinion they should have these two at the same price.I can recommend this, it will clean your carpets for those who do not want to spend that much money.
