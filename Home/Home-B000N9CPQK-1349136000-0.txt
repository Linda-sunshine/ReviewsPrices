review/summary: Works greatreview/text: I dont write reviews often at all... so here goes.Its a medium sized appliance, about the size of a toaster or a small toaster oven. The biggest thing I noticed is that this appliance is loud ... its white noise but its loud. Its not distracting but thats what stood out to me. With that said, it works, our dust flying around in the living room in the morning is SIGNIFICANTLY decreased, almost to the point of being non-existant. How can I tell? Well, when bright morning sun rises it breaks through a small gap in my curtains, this creates a beam of light that is lit up from the dust caught in the beam. When the purifier is running in this room over night the beam is almost unnoticeable.When we tried it in our bedroom to use to help my us to not be stuffed up while we sleep both my wife and I noticed that we woke up with clearer nasal passages (even with the ceiling fan on). Like I said before, it is loud but for some reason the noise doesnt disturb me or my wife, we both sleep without noticing it. Would I buy another of the same unit for another room? Probably not, I dont want too many of these humming around the house and i have seen quiter ones out there.The big advantage this one has is that the filter is vaccumable ... so you dont need to buy a new one.... Oh, the Ionizer feature... I have not yet been able to confirm how well it eliminates odors but its said to be able to do so...
