review/summary: It's a Bunnreview/text: I've owned several Bunn's over the years and I've been happy with all of them. I chose a little different model this time and so far it seems to work okay. I've always bought Bunn because it was a great American made product. Much to my chagrin, the box that this coffee maker came in sported those three little words I've come to detest, "Made in China".
