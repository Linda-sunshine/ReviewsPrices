review/summary: Best Deal Ever!!review/text: I replaced my five year old (heavily used) Hoover SteamVac that died with this model. I thought the old one was great...but, this one is even better. PLUS...I got a heck of a deal on it (like 109.00) on Amazon. With two dogs in the house, no matter how often I vacuum with my British made vacuum cleaner, a cleaning is necessary every 6 weeks or so. Although I am appalled at the disgustingness of the filthy water....there is some sort of satisfaction in doing this yourself and not paying huge amounts for the professionals to come in and do this job. Set up was easy...this model does have an additional attachment for upholstery that my previous cleaner did not have. As other reviewers have stated, on a couple of areas that were pretty dirty, I did use the shampoo, then went over it again with vinegar in the water. Best money you'll spend on cleaniing supplies!!
