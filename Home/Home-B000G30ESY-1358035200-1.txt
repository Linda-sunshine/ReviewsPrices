review/summary: Worth every pennyreview/text: This is the first time I have bought a rice cooker. I have been very happy with it and I have already recommended this particular cooker to a friend. It is ideal for 1-2 people. It takes up very little space on the counter and cooks rice very nicely! I was initially confused about the size and amount of rice this cooker makes. Once you get used to it, it is very simple to use. The cooker comes with a measuring cup that will measure 6oz of dry rice when you level the rice at the top. The 6oz is what the Zojirshi considers a cup. You will measure the amount of dry rice you plan to cook, rinse it, place it in the bowl in the cooker, then add your liquid to the level marked on the bowl that corresponds to the amount of dry rice you used. I have comfortably cooked both 6oz and 12oz of dry rice (1 and 2 cups). I have not tried 18oz. The Zojirushi has never made a mess nor has it boiled over. The removable bowl is non-stick; it is very easy to clean. I have also made conge and oatmeal in this cooker (porridge setting), both of which have turned out perfectly!
