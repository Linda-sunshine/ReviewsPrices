review/summary: Lovely.review/text: I've never had a cast iron skillet so I can't really tell if I'm using it wrong or anything, but I'm following the instructions on the website and there's a definite taste difference between this cast iron pan and our old, teflon (or whatever) non-stick pan. This is far superior.
