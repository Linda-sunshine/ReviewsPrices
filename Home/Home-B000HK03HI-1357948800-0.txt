review/summary: So far so goodreview/text: I recently purchased another brand of manual can opener at one of our big box stores, paid just a little less and it fell apart within months. I know, I could have taken it back but it had happened before. So, for just about $4.00 more I now have a can opener that not only opens cans very easily but appears to be a very well made product that will be around for awhile
