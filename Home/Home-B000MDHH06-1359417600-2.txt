review/summary: Worked well until it didntreview/text: The juicer does as advertised and worked well until recently. Ive had it for a year and for some reason it wont turn on. It may just be a defective part. Ive contacted Breville and have yet to hear back.My only complaints while it worked are the foam it creates and the plastic gets discolored. I paid $150 and perhaps the cheaper parts are to be expected at that price. The positives are easy to operate and easy to clean, and the blade is powerful enough do I was never concerned about foid getting stuck.
