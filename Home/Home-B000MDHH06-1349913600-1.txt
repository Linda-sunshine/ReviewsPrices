review/summary: Excellentreview/text: I bought this juicer for myself as a Christmas present last year and it has done a fantastic job this year introducing me into the world of juicing! The filter is made of a fine mesh and works great at removing chunks. I enjoy playing around with fruit and vegetable combinations. Cleaning it is similar to cleaning a food processor with the addition of the filter and spout. I find myself paying particular attention to these two spots, as food tends to collect there. Overall, I think it's an excellent juicer and highly recommend it to others.
