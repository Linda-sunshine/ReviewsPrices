review/summary: Large ice cubesreview/text: I like these silicone ice tray and it provides nice large cubes that last. The only problem is getting them out of the tray when frozen. I have to twist and turn and still end up squeezing them out one by one or pulling them out one at a time which is frustrating and time consuming not to mention freezing your fingers.
