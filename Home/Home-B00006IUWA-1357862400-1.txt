review/summary: I really like my popperreview/text: It makes flawless popcorn and it makes it fast, much faster than in the microwave. Who would have thought that hot air would work so well? I read other reviews before I bought it and they mentioned that it spit out a few kernels before they're popped sometimes, but this really is not an issue.I was surprised when I received this how sturdy it's built. I expected something plasticky and flimsy, but the base is made of metal and quite sturdy.I like it! You will too if you like popcorn.
