review/summary: breville juicer kick A$%review/text: after watching "fat, sick, and nearly dead" we wanted to start juicing and get healthy. we had an old juice lady, and another junk old juicer my mom bought from the second hand store. these would struggle, get super loud, and pretty dangerous where it would actually move on my counter top. the breville, compact juicer is a winner, it's also a lot bigger than you would think. it juices so fast, cleanup is pretty easy. however, you have to either run it through twice or get a cheese cloth so you can get the rest of the juice off the pulp. i don't know if there are better juicers out there, but i would assume that this would be the case for most juicers. anyway greatest juicer i've owned, cheap, and not dangerous. this is the first review i wrote, so gotta be good, cause i hate taking the time to write a review. i suggest buy it if you're on a budget and need an awesome juicer.
