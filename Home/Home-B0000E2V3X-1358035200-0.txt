review/summary: awsome dosa panreview/text: I bought one last year for dosas on a gas stove . The dosas turned out amazingly well on a consistent basis. I just bought my second one to make dosas faster for my family. I have also had relatives and friends tell me they will try to 'steal' the pan .Easy to maintain too.
