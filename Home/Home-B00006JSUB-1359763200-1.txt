review/summary: Lodge never disappointsreview/text: I own several pieces of lodge cast iron and it never disappoints. The food flavors are amazing, the evenness of heating is convenient, &#34;helper handles&#34;/pouring spouts are great, its ability to go from stovetop to oven is unsurpassed and its made in the US!! The price point also makes it very attractive!Tips:1) be sure to use potholders when cooking with cast iron, the handles get HOT!2) Always use enough oil/butter in your pan or foods will stick3) Only clean cast iron with soap or scrubbing pads/brushes when it is unavoidable(soap removes the seasoning)...hot water(even right after food has been removed-then boil the water, pan will come clean easily)4) Use metal utensils, over time this will help create a smoother pan surface5) I avoid canola oil as some studies say it becomes toxic when layered in the pan-why chance it, just use olive, peanut, coconut, butter, or lard...best for seasoning a pan anyway6) Dry your pan completely before putting away...I put mine on low heat for a few minutes to dry, then use a brush to coat with a bit of oil...I leave it on the stovetop to cool and when I pull it out next time, its ready to use(this also prevents rust).6)
