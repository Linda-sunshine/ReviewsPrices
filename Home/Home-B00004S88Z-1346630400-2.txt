review/summary: Setting the Seal for 1st time Usereview/text: Because this is a metal to metal seal (no rubber seal involved) you have to repeat the pressure cooking process as least three times so that the pressure cooker seals itself correctly before processing any food in jars in the pressure cooker. This was not fully understood and delayed the food process the first time. When you set the seal be sure the lid is level before applying heat to the pressure cooker, otherwise it will not seal correctly.
