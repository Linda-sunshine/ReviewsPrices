review/summary: Loving my percolator!review/text: I got tired of having my automatic drip coffee makers looking so dirty, (why make white in a coffee maker when the stuff dripping through is brown?) and for some reason the coffee just didn't taste as good. I clean my coffee makers regularly so when I noticed the flavor diminishing, i thought I'd try something new.Again, armed with my Amazon gift cards I came here and started reading reviews looking for my next coffee maker. I'm a coffee lover, and I do mean lover, so I'm picky about the machines I use. I've got a french press and espresso maker, so all I really needed here is something that would brew grounds well.After doing some reading, I decided to go retro and go back to a percolator. I'm really happy with this coffee maker. It's sturdy, brews fast and the coffee is really hot when you pour that first cup. (Thank you, the reviewer who mentioned that!)As for the transaction itself, I was delighted. The package came really fast...thank you! It must have arrived at least two days before the shipping notice said it would. What a great surprise!
