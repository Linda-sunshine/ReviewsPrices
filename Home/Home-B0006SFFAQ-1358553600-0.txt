review/summary: Great Coffee, TERRIBLE designreview/text: The coffee from this machine is quite good, but the machine is incredibly poorly designed. It has lots of features that are excellent, and I won't go into detail on these, many other reviews do that quite well. Here are the problems.1. It does not let steam out. It has one tiny little vent on the back that is no where near enough when it comes to letting the steam out. Consequently, the inside of the machine is always filled with condensation. Wiping down the inside of the coffee pot every day to get rid of the condensation is annoying.2. The cup measure &#34;step ladder&#34; is annoying and hard to read. Unless you've got really bright lights shining straight down into the reservoir, you are going to find it almost impossible to see how much water you have in there.3. It can overflow. I had my first overflow today and it was a nightmare. I don't know how it overflowed seeing as how I was only making 6 cups, but it did. I was using the mesh filter with a rather coarse grind, and it had massive overflow. The grounds were everywhere. In the reservoir (almost impossible to get out) all around the edges, down around the coffee basin, etc. I have no idea how 6 cups of coffee (not a lot of grounds) caused such a massive overflow.I really was hoping to like this coffee pot, but I do not think it is worth the money. The coffee quality is better than your standard cheapo maker, but the hassle is not worth the additional quality.
