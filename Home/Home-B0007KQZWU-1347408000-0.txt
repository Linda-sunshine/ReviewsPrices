review/summary: cuisinart mcp 12review/text: I have to say I bought these pans based on all of the other reviews and was not disappointed. They are well made, heavy and perform quite well. I was especially happy about the lids that fit the frying pans and my favorite pan is the large sauce pan. They do water stain if you dont dry them right away but that is not a problem. Cooking is definitely more fun now...and I hate cooking! Enjoy
