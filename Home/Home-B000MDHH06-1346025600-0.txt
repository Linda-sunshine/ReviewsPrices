review/summary: Very Pleased Perfect For Mereview/text: A friend recommended the Breville juicer to me. I saw this one had many good reviews and the price was unbelievable, so I ordered one. I have used juicers for at least 30 years.I started with the Champion, then bought a Miracle Juicer. They were good but this is by far my favorite! It has a nice wide feeding tube so you don't have to cut things up very much. It extracts the juice efficiently so that the leftover fiber is quite dry. The pitcher it comes with fits up against the spout so the juice goes into it. When you pour the juice out of the little pitcher there is a plastic lip that holds the foamy part back! I love that feature! AND it is so easy to clean. It is even dishwasher safe! I didn't put the blade in the dishwasher but apparently you can if you use the top rack. I couldn't be happier and I can't believe the price is only 100.00 when I have spent up to 400.00 in the past! I loved it so much I have now written my first review. There is actually nothing about it I don't like.
