review/summary: NOISY!review/text: I read a lot about diferent air purifiers and saw that this Honeywell was top-rated and at a good price so I decided to buy one for our 35' motorhome (about 320 sq. ft.). We winter camp alot in cold weather which means that the rig stays closed up for days on end and smells begain to accumulate. Cooking, the bathroom, and the dawgs. My wife also suffers from mold allergies. Upon unpacking the unit, it was bigger than I'd envisioned. It seems sturdy enough, and the filter element is very generous. Set-up is a breeze. The instructions said to turn the unit on to it's highest setting for 5 minutes, the "Turbo" mode, and WOW! is this thing noisy! And at it's standard operating setting it's like having a major piece of equipment running in your house. And even the "Sleep" mode is pretty noisy. Honeywell reccomends running the unit 24/7 for best results and the wife and I tried this for two days and we kept having to "Talk over" the unit. When I shut the unit off, we were both exclaiming about how loud we were talking to each other! Maybe you won't be bothered by the noise, say if you live in an urban environment with a lot of traffic noise and neighbors and aircraft etc. You might welcome the "white noise". But out here in the campground we want to hear the Hawk cries, the Owl hoots, the coyotes howling, the frogs croaking: the sounds of nature. We like it quiet, and the less noise polution, the better. So I'm going to return it and try something else. It'd be helpfull if the manufacturers would post "DBL" Decibel ratings and max room size for their units.Now: this unit DOES do a GREAT job of filtering the air and getting rid of odors. Buy one if you're deaf....
