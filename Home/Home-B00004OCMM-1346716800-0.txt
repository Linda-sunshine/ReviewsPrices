review/summary: Great product!review/text: I never...and I mean NEVER write reviews. But I had to this time because I absolutely HATE can openers. They always seem to be a hassle and may work slightly well in the beginning but always turn out to be crap. I realize its just a can opener but this one is perfect! Its easy and comfortable to hold, has a great grip, and does not require a lot of force. It opens cans smoothly and I don't feel like I've had a work out after using it. Definitely a 5 star product because I doubt I will have problems with it in the future. Even though it was a tad bit more than I wanted to spend, its sturdy and it works! Mission accomplished...
