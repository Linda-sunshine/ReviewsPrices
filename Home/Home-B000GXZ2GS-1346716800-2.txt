review/summary: Best coffee ever!review/text: After figuring out how fine to grind my coffee beans, I am now preparing and drinking the best coffee I have ever had with my new Aeropress. I had tried many different coffee makers, both conventional drip and the newer kinds that use pods and cups, and even tried a French press, but I returned all of them. The Aeropress is quick and simple to use, and clean-up is very easy.
