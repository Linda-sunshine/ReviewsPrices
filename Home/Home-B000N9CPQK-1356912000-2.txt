review/summary: Could be quieter but still does a good jobreview/text: It's a good machine for the price, cleans the air fairly well. Now that the cold weather set in and the house is shut, it's a good appliance for keeping smoke and dust minimized.It does get a little loud on the higher settings. Manufacturer suggests a 3 foot space between it and the wall so keep that in mind if considering buying. Easy to move between rooms. Easy to clean filter.
