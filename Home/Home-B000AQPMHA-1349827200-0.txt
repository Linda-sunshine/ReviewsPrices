review/summary: 3RD MACHINE IN 3 MONTHSreview/text: I bought my first one in July 2012. It lasted two weeks with only one person using it once a day. Then liquid wouldn't come through. Called the company. They sent me a second one with my paying $7 shipping fee to return the k cup inside the machine. They told me to throw out the machine because they can't do anything with it. This new one lasted a month. THen the same thing. Called again. Once again sent one and returned the k cup. Got another one. Now a month later and it has happened again. Use Distilled water. Not going to call again because the company isn't worth it.
