review/summary: Awesome!review/text: Found this at Costco for $50 last week so I scooped it up after reading all the favorable reviews here. I kept going 'round and 'round between this one and the $100 Breville. I'm SO happy I saved myself $50 and went with this one. The favorable reviews were right! This is a great juicer, well-built and has worked fabulously for me. Now granted I'm only a week in, but I've been using this every day, sometimes twice a day and I have had no issues with it. I haven't tried any really mushy fruits like bananas and doubt I ever will. I'll save that for my blender. But carrots, apples, spinach, kale, etc. all seem to work great. Like another reviewer said, don't push down too hard or you'll get less juice. Follow that simple rule and you're golden! Love this!
