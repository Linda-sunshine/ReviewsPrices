review/summary: the best bottle!review/text: This is my second thermos stainless steel hydration bottle. I had my first one for over a year and drank tea, coffee, water, and all my beverages out of it and it was awesome. Unfortunately, however, I dropped it and it dented and now wobbles when I put it on any flat surface, so I ordered another! This bottle keeps your beverages warm for more than 12 hours and keeps them cold for well over 24 hours, its the best!
