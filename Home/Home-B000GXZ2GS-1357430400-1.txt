review/summary: I'm a believer. A must have for all coffee lovers!review/text: I found the aeropress when I was looking for a gift for my office white elephant gift exchange. After reading all the raving reviews, I decided to keep the thing for myself, and I'm sure glad I did! I saw enough reviews that describe the process so I'll just try to talk about my own coffee drinking evolution. I usually drink my coffee black, occasionally with milk.I started drinking coffee from a regular drip coffee machine. It was okay, but I found it to be pretty inconsistent. My roommate's pot of coffee would taste way different from my own pot.The next method of coffee preparation I experienced was with the DeLonghi Magnifica Super Automatic Espresso Maker. It was great when making a latte or cap but for a regular cup of joe, it didn't taste right.I tried the pod system. No comment here, I only drank it when I had to.Before the aeropress, my preferred way of making coffee was with my Bodum French Press. Although I liked the coffee, I hated the cleanup and the excess. The grinds are hard to dispose of (trash can vs in the In-Sink-Erator) and it makes a mess in the sink! Also, I end up making way too much coffee and it gets cold before I get to drink it.The aeropress solves this problem. The cleanup is extremely easy and each cup of coffee takes only about 2 minutes to make. The taste is amazing, I feel like I'm drinking real coffee instead of water and dirt. I prefer the inverted method (simple google search). I only wish I discovered this earlier!
