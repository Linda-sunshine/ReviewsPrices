review/summary: Finally, a great can opener!review/text: After our 8 year old cuisinart can opener gave up, I tried two others that I despised before finding this one. Thanks to the many great reviews, I tried it and am so thankful! It practically reaches over and grabs the cans to open. There is almost no effort to attach the can and it it is quiet and fast. Great product!
