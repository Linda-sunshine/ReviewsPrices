review/summary: Review for Honeywell 50250-S 99.97% Pure HEPA Round Air Purifierreview/text: My wife and I really like this product. We have two of this model air purifier and they do an excellent job. They are a bit loud, but they also cancel out outside sound and in effect create a &#34;white noise&#34; that actually for us, aids sleeping. Also the speed is easily adjustable for quietness. One point that stands out is our air purifiers run 24/7 and are only turned off when we go on a trip. Our oldest machine is about five years old and is still running like a new purifier. Lastly, we believe that this product is very reliable and will serve you well.
