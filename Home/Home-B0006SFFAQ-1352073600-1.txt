review/summary: Unsafe Coffee Makerreview/text: This was my second Cuisinart Coffee Maker. The first one had an issue with the clock right after the warranty ran out therefore programming was out of the question. I bought a second one and this morning it started spewing heavy white smoke and a horrible burning electrical smell (I've had this one just over a year as well). Good thing I was home. It is now sitting on my concrete back patio. I called Cuisinart to let them know what happened and I was told that it would take 4-5 days for them to get back to me. It is not safe to have these in your home. Clearly there are issues with this model.
