review/summary: Love this product!review/text: I have milk goats and purchased one of these to put my fresh milk in for ease of pouring. I have always used gallon pickle jars and decided I wanted something more appropriate for pouring. These are perfect. They are sturdy and fit in the fridge nicely. I wish only that the lids were a bit easier to clean. I bought one to begin with, decided I needed more so ordered two more, and then just recently decided to buy two more, since it seems like everytime I like something, they discontinue it. If you are looking for a home storage container for your own fresh milk products, you will not go wrong with these.
