review/summary: Solid modelreview/text: Some people complained that it isn't made well...I haven't experienced that at all. Yes, it's loud...but not any louder than my fan that blows air out at the same speed. It seems to run smoothly, and we have it running 24/7. I do admit that I hoped it would help my husband's allergies, and I think it has a little...but it's hard to tell what are allergies vs. just sneezing randomly in the morning.I thought the air coming out would smell &#34;clean&#34; like some other air purifiers I've seen, but I think those were strictly ionizers. We're not smokers or anything, so our air already smells good in our apt; so we can't tell the difference in smell when this is on or not. However, I do think it cleans a lot of air and probably helps keep our dust down. I would buy it again.
