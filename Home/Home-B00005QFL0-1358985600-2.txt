review/summary: After 3 years still wonderfulreview/text: I purchased it in 2010, and now 2013, it is still wonderful! It cooks perfect. I love dough option, it is life saver for me, and it makes perfect dough. I use it once a week for bread, and maybe 2 times a month for dough. So easy to clean. Best purchase I ever made so far.
