review/summary: A great purchasereview/text: This was a decision that I debated for a long time, go with a cheaper insta-bed, and risk the problems, or go with a really expensive one and don't risk it. My assumptions were wrong. This bed was cheap and it has given us zero problems! Everyone who has slept on this bed has said that it holds air very well, it is comfortable, and it is quiet. We have had no issues with it at all and we have had it for over a year now, and probably 40 or so people have slept on it in that time. We use it all the time.
