review/summary: don't buyreview/text: I've owned this for less than 2 months, It's worked great very easy to use. Now i have an issue the key pad does not work at all so i called Panasonic who were very polite and quickly answered. It would be fine if i lived in Virginia Beach so i could carry it in for service, instead i can mail 500 miles and pay shipping both ways. According to Panasonic , even if their product is defective I pay shipping both ways. WHAT GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE I'LL BUY MORE PANASONIC PRODUCTS.
