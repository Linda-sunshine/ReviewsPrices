review/summary: Love,love,love these sheets!review/text: We've been sleeping on flannel year-round for years so we have been through many sets. These are by far the best. After washing (there will be lots of lint in dryer after first few washes), they are so cozy and soft! They are warm, but somehow not hot. We even use them in the summer in Las Vegas! Buy one set and sleep one night & you'll want these for every bed in the house!
