review/summary: Not same product as 2011review/text: This is a mixed review. If I ignored the fact that I purchased one of these in a Queen size last year that actually had the advertised density, I would be giving a much higher review. Please be aware that this product is NOT 3lb density as the seller states. Quick math for the King topper is 18.8lbs / (78 x 74 x 2 / (12^3)) = 2.8lbs/cu ft and that does not consider the holes that are punched through for airflow (yes it makes a difference). These toppers all fall into a category of &#34;not as advertised&#34;.But why is this such a big deal? Because a year ago, the densities matched up. My 2011 Queen topper is significantly more dense to the touch, takes much longer to rebound, and has a more high quality feel. The 2012 King topper is light, has little resistance against pressure, and rebounds instantly.For the price compared to other entry-level foam pads its hard to say its a bad deal. You get what you pay for and this product is now as cheaply made as it is to purchase. A year ago it was a good deal, but if you had purchased one previously and plan on doing so again you need to realign your expectations.
