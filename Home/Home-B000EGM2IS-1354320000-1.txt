review/summary: Just one problemreview/text: I bought this water dispenser to replace one that our family had been using for 15 years. We really like it heat water for tea/hot cereal etc. The only problem I have with this model is that the dispensing area is so short. We have to use a shorter mug to dispense the water into and then pour it into a larger mug. Other than that, it works as well as our older model.
