review/summary: Decent affordable juicer, but a bit of a painreview/text: Bought this juicer a little over a month ago, and while it's not bad for an intro juicer, there's a number of problems I see with it. First up, this thing causes a heck of a mess. No matter how hard I try to cover the top, and sneak things into the chute, particles of food fly everywhere. Second, I've noticed that sizable chunks of food end up getting kicked to the pulp section, thus limiting its efficiency. Also, the pulp is still rather moist when I remove it. I know it's difficult to remove all moisture, but I shouldn't be able to extract juice by gently squeezing the pulp.All in all, not terrible for a relatively affordable juicer, but if you know you're going to take juicing very seriously, I would opt for a different juicer that addresses those two major flaws.
