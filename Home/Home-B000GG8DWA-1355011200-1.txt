review/summary: My smartest purchase everreview/text: This little heater is AMAZING! I bought one for the main floor living room, and another for upstairs. My kids turn on the one upstairs only at night- while I run the downstairs one whenever we're home. The result? My furnace literally only runs a few times a day, for a few minutes each time! I live in Wisconsin, in a large older home... and the heaters have more than paid for themselves in less than a month. I highly recommend!
