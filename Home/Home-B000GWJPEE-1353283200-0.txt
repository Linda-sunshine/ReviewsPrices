review/summary: Works great!review/text: Works great! I had try many of these humidifier and found this one the best.I have a big room with other brand I have to keep on refiling the water, but this one holds good amount of water so I dont have to refil so offen.Unlike some other brand you can't adjust the out power. this means alot because if is too strong your mist will pretty much just go down and it won't fill the room.the only down side is that i wish is more easy to clean this thing.
