review/summary: ABSOLUTELY TERRIFICreview/text: This has to be one of the best things I ever bought for the kitchen. I love coffee and the K-cups make excellent coffee. There are a lot of choices (expresso is really good) and it can be used for tea and hot chocolate. Beats Starbucks in both flavor and cost. Highly recommend.
