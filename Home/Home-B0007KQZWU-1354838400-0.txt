review/summary: very heavy pots n pans, very hard to keep clean as well.review/text: it looks nice and feels heavy duty, but it is so hard to keep clean. the weight is also a problem, i'm an average guy, and when i hold them (just the pot/pan)-it feels pretty heavy already, so imagine the wife using them on a daily basis. if you're a smaller person that does not have strong arms, then i'd recommend you looking elsewhere for something lighter.
