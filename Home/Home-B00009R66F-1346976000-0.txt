review/summary: Hoover SteamVac F5914-900review/text: The motor seemed to get louder the second day I used it, but I wasn't sure. The fifth time I used it, the motor went bad. Replacement from Amazon was very easy. I had a new one delivered in two days. I hope I have better luck with this one. The steamvac did a great job when I was able to use it. The replacement one is not as loud.
