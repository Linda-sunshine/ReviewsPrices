review/summary: Works great on muslin backdrops, not so much on shirts or pantsreview/text: Bought it for taking wrinkles out of photography backdrops and it works very well for that. What took me hours before now only takes a 20 minutes or so. Takes a 10-20 seconds for steam to start and gets very hot, so you have to be careful not to burn your skin. Tried to use it on shirts / pants and was not too satisfied.
