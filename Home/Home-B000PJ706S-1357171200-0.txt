review/summary: Perfect in every way!review/text: I was staying with a couple who had a Capresso glass water kettle for years and absolutely loved it. They used it every day, and while I lived there I did as well. It was perfect. While I was there it just broke (because it was used so much!), it wasn't heating up properly. So, I ordered a new Capresso, and it works. It heats up water quickly and efficiently, and looks very classy. I recommend this product to anyone interested in a convenient how water kettle. Others have complained about the taste or smell from the water while using this machine but we never experienced this.
