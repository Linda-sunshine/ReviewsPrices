review/summary: Use it all the timereview/text: This is one of two or three appliances we use all the time - it's perfect for our family of five. We use it for pancakes, french toast, bacon, eggs, grilled cheese, hash browns, burgers, quesadillas, and just about anything else you would normally fry. It heats quickly, accurately, and fairly evenly. The nonstick coating works and is durable (no noticeable scratches after almost a year of frequent use). It does take up a lot of space, but then it wouldn't be as useful if the cooking area was smaller. I normally place it on the stovetop (electric glass top) and it covers well over half of the stove.All food cooks well, but you can tell with certain things that the heat is not quite even. For example, the griddle easily holds nine one-ounce pancakes in a square pattern (3 x 3). The center pancake always comes out a bit lighter than those closer to the edges (or it takes a bit longer to get to the same level of brownness). Some of the pancakes on the edge do not brown evenly - they are a bit darker where the heating elements run through the griddle. The slightly uneven heat does not affect the quality of the food, and it is not enough that some portions are undercooked or overcooked. A heavier griddle might distribute heat more evenly, but at the expense of some inconvenience for being, well, heavier (and likely more expensive).Although you don't need a dedicated electrical circuit, you do need to be careful with other high-power appliances. We can't run this at the same time as the microwave (at least not on the same circuit).
