review/summary: Well Worth the Moneyreview/text: After using this vacuum for almost a month, I have to say I'm more than happy with the product. The size of the hand-held vacuum is a bit on the bigger side, but nothing too bad. It weights about five pounds, so it definitely will give your arm a workout. The cord length is great, about 20 or more feet. The extension for the tough to reach edges is nicely placed on the back of the vacuum itself. The brush setting is amazing. The first time I used it, I was shocked at all the dust that is picked up from the cushions. Be sure buy more filters, because it's so powerful, you need a replacement. On the plus side, my house feels so much cleaner now. The sliding visor is amazing too. It's much easier to clean the stairs entirely.The only slight drawback is the wind the machine blows directly from the back. You just have to more aware about where you're pointing the machine. But building a greater awareness to things can never be negative really.I'm beyond happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone that needed one. I know what to get people for a house warming gift now.
