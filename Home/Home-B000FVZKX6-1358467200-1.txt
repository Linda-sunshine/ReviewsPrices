review/summary: Most comfortable sheets I've ever slept in, they just fade very badlyreview/text: I washed my sheets as soon as I got them and was immediately upset because I noticed they had faded unevenly and in splotches. I was definitely going to return them but put them on my bed anyway while I was waiting for another set of sheets to come in...now I'm not returning them. The sheets are by far the most comfortable I've ever slept and they aren't too warm like you think they might be. It's just a bummer because the dye fades...I'm keeping them anyway.
