review/summary: Produces burnt flavorreview/text: I was so looking forward to having a new coffee maker that would not be letting the grounds touch plastic... but the water might be reaching too hot of temperature, I don't know, because after 5 days of trying and after buying the most expensive and delicious percolator grind coffee I could find, it still doesn't taste right... so I'm returning it...Also, it is a little more cumbersome to clean it, refill it with grinds and water, etc... the whole routine takes more time than your normal coffeemaker...
