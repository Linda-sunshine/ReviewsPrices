review/summary: Lives up to its reviews.review/text: A friend had this juicer based on her requirements for "easy yo use". I am so glad I got to use it also before buying. While I understand the debate on quantity and quality of the juice, time is very important element to me. And this is easy to use and easy to clean. The motor is very quiet, which my animals appreciate as I do early in the morning. The control is digital, which is not my preference, but I feel I can trust the durability of this product. I bought this used from Amazon and it was missing the rubber spout that connects to the plastic spout. A call to Breville and they volunteered to send me one for free. Good customer service.Update: This does not juice greens. It just chews them up and spits them out (I tried parsley). This is more for just fruit. That will not fully serve my needs. It may have been stated elsewhere but I missed it. It's still a beautiful machine but you need to know you will not be able to use it with greens. Also, if you are juicing a lot you need to decide if 20% loss in the amount of juice is important to you. I tried running the pulp back through but it did not produce any more juice like my old Champion did. So I would only recommend this if you know you are going to be doing quantities of carrot and fruit juices.
