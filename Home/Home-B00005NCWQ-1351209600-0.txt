review/summary: Love My Percolator!review/text: I have been looking for replacement parts for my pyrex percolator with no luck (or time)in finding it. I came across this beauty a while back and was a bit weary of ordering it because of a couple of bad reviews. However, I saved it in my wishlist for future reference anyway. Some time passed, and when I clicked on the product link again, I noticed many more reviews were written--mostly positive. Well, I'm adding myself to that list because I love my perc! It's good looking, it's the perfect size, and its all stainless steel construction makes it a breeze to clean. Maybe those who wrote a bad review should read the instructions?. Sure, I miss my pyrex percolator, but happy I have this one.
