review/summary: great grindreview/text: this grinds coffee to perfect consistency. it is a bit noisy but that is OK as it is not running all the time. I like how it shuts off automatically as that would be very hard to manually turn it off. you know, using your fingers.works much better than my old Krups blade model.I give it 1.5 thumbs up as I lost half my thumb in a horrible blade coffee grinder accident while skydiving.this is much safer
