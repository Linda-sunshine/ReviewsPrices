review/summary: My wife and kids love this thingreview/text: I bought this as a family gift for Christmas and we have used it most everyday since. It is great for cooking things and you can watch them as they cook. You can do just about anything with it that you could a toaster oven, but try sticking a 12&#34; pizza in a toaster oven. The only draw back I can see is that there is not a temperature control for each burner and that the heat escapes into the kitchen. Which may not be bad in the winter but during the summer months it might heat things up.
