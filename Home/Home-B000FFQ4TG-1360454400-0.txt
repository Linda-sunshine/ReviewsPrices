review/summary: Annoying to use and makes a bad cup of joereview/text: the concept of this machine is a nice one in principal. Water is always hot and easy and quick to get a quick brew. however, first problem is that it lacks a timer, but thats ok because you know that going in. The quality that it produces isnt anything great if you like good strong brews.The real problem is that after having this for a year, it stopped calibrating properly and i would pour in 4 cups and get much much less. Additionally, it stopped brewing the coffee and now the water pours through as if from a faucet without giving the grinds any time to give it any taste. So i end up with a smaller cup that tastes like hot water with a splash of coffee flavor. Definitively not worth the $100. for that price you can get a good machine that grinds your beans fresh and has a timer. Avoid this one if you can.
