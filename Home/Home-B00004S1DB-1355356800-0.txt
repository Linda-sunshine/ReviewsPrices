review/summary: Better than expected!review/text: We workamp, which means we travel with our RV and work in different areas every summer. After 2 broken glass coffee presses, I decided to try this stainless steel model! Not only does it not break, but it keeps coffee very warm after an hour or so!Coffee cools very quickly in the glass coffee presses! However, as with the glass coffee pres, this one has a lot of grounds and &#34;mud&#34; seep through with the last cup of coffee! Guess that is to be expected, however I would hope that one day, coffee press makers would come up with a better way of filtering coffee!
