review/summary: excellent little cleanerreview/text: At first I was disappointed with the lack of suction, then realized the problem was a little valve in the handle that just needed to be turned/closed. After that, look out! I swear I could pick up my couch with this thing :)Seriously though, such a small size and big power are hard to find, and for around 50 or 60 bucks a good deal.As another reviewer stated, the easiest way to clean rugs is to start further away from where you are standing and pull the floor piece toward you, rather than trying to push it like a conventional upright vac. Other than the rug, I have all hardwood floors and it did amazingly well getting on them as well as the walls, blinds, windowsills etc. I would not recommend for large wall to wall carpeted areas as that would be far too much work for you and the vac.Very pleased!
