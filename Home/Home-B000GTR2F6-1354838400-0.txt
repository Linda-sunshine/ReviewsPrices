review/summary: READ THIS IF YOUR B70 STOPS DISPENSING WATER AFTER A TIMEreview/text: Purchased the B70. A little big for me but worked OK till last week. No water dispense. Tried all the manual "fixes", till I went on the internet to do THE COMPRESSED AIR TRICK. IT WORKS. DO NOT throw out you B70 till you try this.1. Take a compressed air can used to clean computer keyboards.2. Remove water resivour3. Insert nozzle of air can into left and right silicon holes in upper portion of the unit4. Blow air through BOTH left and right holes in the silicone plug5. Repeat 4 times each blast 5 seconds eachYou will see bubbles and water come out of the bottom and the k cup needle if successful.This will fix your problem.
