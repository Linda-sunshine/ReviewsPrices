review/summary: Yes these are 4 stars +!review/text: Have to agree with 'not cuddly statement' however these sheets are very nice. Wash and dry quickly, covers 2 twin beds pushed together and remains tucked in, blanket does not slip out of position and fitted corners stay in place. All features we expected from 600-thread-count.These sheets are comfortable! We expect years of use before buying again.
