review/summary: Coffee and Grounds Spill Overreview/text: Even after reading many reviews regarding the issue of overflows and following all of the directions carefully in the user manual and making sure the lid was properly seated on the carafe, I still had this coffee maker spill coffee and grounds all over the kitchen counter. I wanted this coffee maker to work for us, but I feel like you have to watch the entire process to make sure you don't end up with a huge mess all over the place. 30 minute cleanup and a burned finger is not worth the price of this coffee maker.
