review/summary: Nice vac if you have catsreview/text: I've found this vac to be easy to use and extremely powerful. I find myself getting it out when I have to do a few quick cleanups - it's easier than dragging out the big shop vac. The cord is very long and I find it ample for my cleaning needs. It's also great in the car too - I've used it in the rear of my SUV to clean up leaves, dirt, etc. The detachable hose gets into the door wells and side pockets well too. Other reviewers mentioned that the weight of the unit is a negative, but I feel it's power makes up for the weight.
