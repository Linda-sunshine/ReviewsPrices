review/summary: so far so greatreview/text: This has been great! It's the perfect size, easy to store. I keep in a drawer at work and take it out to make tea because it's freezing in there. Love it. Leaves no bad taste and comes with a filter on the nozzle. I've had it for 6 months now and it's been great!
