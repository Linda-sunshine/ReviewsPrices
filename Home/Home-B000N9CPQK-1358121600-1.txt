review/summary: It's like we live in the mountains!review/text: I've had this purifier for a month now and I can't say enough good things about it. We live in a small (manhattan small) one bedroom apartment and all we need is one of these - I thought we would need two but it's not the case. One does the job just fine. We have a small parrot and he produces a lot of dander and we also started to have some problems with mold near one of our windows. The first time we used it I put it in the kitchen before bed, left it on all night and when we woke up our apartment just felt different. The air was crisp.....as if we were in fresh mountain air and not ratty old nyc. We have been so impressed with this machine and we can't believe the price!We don't use the ionizer feature that it has because we don't feel like we really need it and ionizers tend to give us headaches and we're not sure how safe ionizers are for birds....birds are sensitive to so much. Also - it is noisy but it's not a rattle or broken kind of noise....you can just hear the fan. A white noise if you will. I turn it down the lowest setting when we watch TV but I won't take a star off for the noise since it doesn't bother me in the least and you don't even notice it after a few minutes of it being on.
