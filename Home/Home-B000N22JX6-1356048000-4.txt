review/summary: Awesome heater, horrendous shipping by Amazonreview/text: The heater has been fantastic so far, it does a great job of heating and the timer for auto-turn off is very useful. The pattern is much more pronounced than the images portray, it looks like a little safari-themed heater.Amazon sent this to me in the heater's original box, with the top untaped and unsecured. Anyone could have opened the package and removed the contents. The box was quite beat up when it arrived, and I immediately thought it must of been from a Amazon-approved reseller. That isn't the case apparently. Because the heater works great, I won't deduct a star and punish the brand. But seriously Amazon, the way you shipped it was a complete joke.
