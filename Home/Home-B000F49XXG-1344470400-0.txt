review/summary: Probably the very best cheap cappuccio maker around; great valuereview/text: This little cappuccino maker surprises as to the quality of espresso and froth it delivers. I have had it for probably around 2 years or more, use it at least a couple of times a day, and it makes great espresso. The frothing wand gasket leaks at times, but this may be due to abuse by turning the machine on and leaving it unattended for long periods of time (DeLonghi recommends that the water is heated for a period of time, and I forget to check it at times). The frothing nozzle developed a leak shortly after purchase, but DeLonghi sent a replacement free of charge. In the event that my machine gives out, I think I will purchase this model again. I am particular about my cappuccino, have taken various espresso makers back or pitched them, but this model works quite well.
