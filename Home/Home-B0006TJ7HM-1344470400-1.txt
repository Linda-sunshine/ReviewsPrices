review/summary: Good solid knives...review/text: I purchased these knives for my kids who are moving into their own apartments. I was very pleased at the quality of the knives. They are sturdy with nice sharp edges. I remember the commercials from the 70s on the Ginsu knives and figured if they had survived over 30 years there may be a reason. I was not disappointed. Very nice quality for the price and a good selection of knives are included from the paring knife to the santoku.
