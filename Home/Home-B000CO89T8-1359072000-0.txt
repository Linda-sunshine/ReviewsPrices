review/summary: This has made my dreams come true.review/text: I am constantly having to make trips to the microwave to heat up my tea, coffee, or hot chocolate. I'm a slow drinker, I can't help it. I don't like to gulp my drinks I like to enjoy them. Sometimes for over an hour! And I have high temperature standards. I like my beverages borderline scalding. That being said, I had doubts that this little gadget would keep my beverages HOT (not warm). It does a great job. Other reviewers are correct in that it will not reheat cold beverages but if you put them on the warmer when they are already hot enough to your liking, it will keep it that way for hours. Highly recommend for any slow drinkers out there. Should have gotten one years ago.Update: it's also useful for keeping a small teapot with tea in it warm for hours. I have a little ceramic tea pot that holds maybe 3 cups of liquid. If you make sure the tea is extra hot when you put it in the pot, it will stay pretty warm for a long time.
