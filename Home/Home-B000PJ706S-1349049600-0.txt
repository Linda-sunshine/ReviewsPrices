review/summary: Crapreview/text: I used this for 2 weeks and then went on vacation, came back and now it does not work at all. It is too late to return and will cost me $12 to ship back for a partial return. The unit blew the power on my outlet every couple of days but we have a reset on the outlet so I figured it was not a big deal. Also, one of the instructions isto always leave the unit empty. That means if you use filtered water you have to dump it out after every boil.Unless Amazon agrees to pay for return shipping it is going in the trash. What a waste.
