review/summary: Great, cheap little machine.review/text: I found myself staying with relatives for a few months. My Capresso machine was home, but I crave one, very large cappuccino every morning. It's no fun to have to drag yourself to the closest Starbucks or bakery/coffee house every morning, so I bought one of these when they had the $20 rebate program going, which comes back now and then, or sometimes it's just discounted that much as a "Today's Deal". You really don't expect much for the price, so I was very happy that it made decent espresso, with better crema than I was getting at home, and the frothed milk was almost always the perfect consistency. Between my visits and my relatives' occasional use, it's gotten the equivalent of six or seven months of daily wear, and it still works like a charm. I like it so much that I have spares in both my garage and my relatives' in case either of our machines fails. If it happens at home, I don't feel that I'll be missing much (besides the other $150 or so my current machine cost). And if the other one breaks down first, it's already far more than paid for itself based on what I would have paid to go out. I have two minor complaints: the coffee puck is really stuck and has to be dug out with a spoon, and cleaning is a little time consuming, but not hard. Both of these become routine after a while.
