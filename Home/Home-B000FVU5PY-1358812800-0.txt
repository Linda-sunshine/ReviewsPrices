review/summary: So scratchyreview/text: I am so disappointed in these sheets. I had read that they were heavily starched, but others have seemed to be able to get rid of the starch or sizing or whatever it is. So far I have rinsed them once, washed them 4 times and soaked them for 4 hours in a vinegar/ hot water solution. They still are so stiff and rough I can not sleep on them. I am now trying soaking them over night in the vinegar and water and then washing them with baking soda and adding fabric softener to the rinse cycle (something recommended online). We will see if that works. I would not go near these sheets again
