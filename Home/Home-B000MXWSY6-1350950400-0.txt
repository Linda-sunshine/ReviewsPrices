review/summary: Doesn't really display correct time, ever!review/text: From the day we received the clock radio, it has not kept the correct time. Unfortunately, the function to reset time has never worked, either! So, we have a clock that started out 10 minutes off, and is now about 20 minutes off.The radio on it is also lousy - gets very poor reception.I've kept it because it's sort of a curiosity - I cannot fathom how an electric clock loses time?! But, I'm logging on to buy a different clock. Despite it's obvious popularity, this one gets a big thumbs down from me.
