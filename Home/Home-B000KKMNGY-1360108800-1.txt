review/summary: well made itemreview/text: The photo doesn't show it but this rack has a back to it and is shaped like a rectangular basket. It is the right size for a box of plastic wrap or the basic size of aluminum foil, but a roll of butcher paper or the longer heavy duty foil is going to be too long for it. That said, it is deep enough that those items don't fall out. The arms are nice and sturdy and slide snugly onto the shelf. It fits perfectly on the top shelf of my pantry closet. I use it like in the photo, for storing food wraps and storage bags.
