review/summary: Wow coffee!review/text: After using this coffee maker I cannot go back to using anything else. It usually brew about 4 cups which is good for my super sized cup. It takes about 6 minutes and makes a perfect cup of coffee. It seems like it makes the coffee have less acidity compared to normal drip coffee makers. I use a #2 coffee filter to avoid any grounds in the coffee. Clean up is easy specially by using the #2 filter.
