review/summary: Theres None Betterreview/text: You can get any better than having a KitchenAid Artisan Series, there's just none better. The best thing I like is the ability to, ground meat, make pasta and do many other things with the right attachments, make sausages. Love the tilt head, the multi speeds. I could go on and on about the KitchenAid, there's no greater mixer than this. 5 star all the way.
