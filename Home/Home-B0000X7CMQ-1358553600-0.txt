review/summary: 200 degree temp and no messreview/text: I always hated old drip coffee makers that dripped on to the heating plate after the pot was removed. This one has no heating plate. Just a well made thermal carafe to keep the coffee hot. The top of the carafe is a bit difficult to grip but it doesn't need to be twisted completely tight. #4 filters fit fine if you fold the seam. Love the brand.
