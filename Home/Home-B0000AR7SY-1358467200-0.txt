review/summary: Very quiet and excellent grinderreview/text: In the past 5 to 6 years I went through three coffee grinders, two Cuisinart and one Bodum. They lasted anywhere from 2 years to 3 months (Bodum). Although I do not yet know about the longevity of this product, it is the quietest and the most functional grinder I ever bought. I paid significantly more for this but I love it.
