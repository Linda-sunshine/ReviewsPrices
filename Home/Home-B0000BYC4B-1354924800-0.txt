review/summary: Storage!review/text: These are great for using jars as food storage containers! I use these lids on jars for dry pantry items, freezing soups and broth, and instead of tupperware for sharing food and for left-overes in the fridge! Be sure to hand wash them though because the dishwasher may warp them.
