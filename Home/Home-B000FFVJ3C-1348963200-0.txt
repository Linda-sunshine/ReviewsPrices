review/summary: Better than much more expensive dehydrators.review/text: I have used several other brands of dehydrators, all with the element and fan mounted on the bottom. This one has the heater and fan mounted on the top. I was impressed that I was able to dry 2 lb of jerky in about four hours without having to sort trays or move the meat. This comes with the fruit roll tray, the liquid tray, and five perforated drying trays. Also, I was surprised that this came with three packages of jerky spice. I would recommend this to a friend and am thinking of buying a second one. This would be a five star review, but the unit is a little loud for me, not really any louder than a box fan, but I wasn't expecting it.
