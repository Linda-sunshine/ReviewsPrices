review/summary: Use Febreeze, smell goes away in an hourreview/text: This product is worth the price. I don't think it's for everyone, but you have to try it out to decide. I like it for the support 'cause I get neck pain on pillows that are too hard or too soft. I would suggest using a regular pillow case rather than the one provided as it makes it a little more comfortable.The "chemical" smell folks are complaining about is correct. However, when it delivered I have it a couple sprays of Febreeze on both sides and let it air itself outside for less than an hour. I notice no chemical smell whatsoever now. Folks complaining about the smell giving them a headache must not be too bright, 'cause it seems like a pretty simple problem to solve.
