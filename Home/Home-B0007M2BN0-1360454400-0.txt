review/summary: Quick, Easy to Peel Eggs, and the Microwave Shuts off on Its Ownreview/text: I've had mine about three weeks and it works great. Took three trials to find out that it takes 11 min. in my microwave to get hard-boiled. Eggs peel super easy. It does seem a bit flimsy, but at 11 bucks, if it lasts about a year or so I'll figure it's worth it: that's how fast and convenient it is. By the way, I've forgotten a few times and left the eggs in the oven for an hour, but they were still quite good hard boiled eggs. When I used to boil them on top of the stove and forgot about them, I had a mess when I finally got to them. This is one thing I'm ordering more of for gifts, and I'm not waiting for Christmas either.
