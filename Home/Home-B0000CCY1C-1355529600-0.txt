review/summary: Not the greatest scoop everreview/text: Well I've had this scoop a few months now, this is about the third time I've used it. It broke because the gear on the handle part went off track so that you couldn't get the cookie dough out of the scoop. I put it back on the track, it went off of it again, got it back on and then it broke again, this time I couldn't get it back on and it ticked me off so I threw it away. I am very disappointed in this scoop. I have the larger one and it works great! But this one stinks and now I have to go back to the larger one, which means my idea of filling jars with cookies for my friends isn't going to work because the cookies will be to large to fit in the jar. I have OCD, they have to be the same size, scooping without a scoop is not an option.
