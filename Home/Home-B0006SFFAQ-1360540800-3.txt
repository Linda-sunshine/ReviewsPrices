review/summary: Love it :)review/text: We have gone through many coffeemakers over the years and this is by far my favorite. no matter how fast you poor, it does not spill. love the look of the white metal (not something you see everywhere). Really like that the programable function allows you to set the length of time it stays on and the coffee taste great. I would prefer buttons to knobs but over all I love it!!
