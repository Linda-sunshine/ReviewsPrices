review/summary: Best thing in the kitchenreview/text: I use this as a skillet, griddle, baking sheet, pizza pan, and a few other things. Coat it regularly with a very light coat of oil, and NOTHING will stick to it. Super heavy duty and well made. My stone wear (for the oven) and non-stick (for the stove top) have pretty much been retired by this thing. It will do pretty much anything except cook soup.
