review/summary: Works for a year but then the troubles begin...review/text: I loved the price of this espresso machine, and loved having professional quality espresso cups in the morning. But after 12 months (the length of the warranty), the problems started to set in.First, the pump began to lose it's "umph", and I had to make sure the water level stayed high. I lived with a host of home remedies to keep the machine pumping, such as jiggling and other TLC to get the espresso in the morning, for another 12 months, until the water started to leak out: first from the seams around the nozzle, and then all over. I'm now at a point where I need to surround the machine with paper towels while I wait for it to warm up, and then replace the towels when I'm ready to make the espresso. It's a lot of paper towels.I think De'Longhi company considers this a "disposable product," and really should tell us that we're getting an inexpensive but fine working machine at a discount price, but expect to replace it every year. That eats at me, so I don't think my next espresso machine purchase -- which I need to make now -- will be a De'Longhi.UPDATE: Now more leaks than the Nixon Administration. Out of warranty by a year, and useless. It's cheap but I think I'd rather spend a little more money and have an espresso machine that lasts more than 2 years.
