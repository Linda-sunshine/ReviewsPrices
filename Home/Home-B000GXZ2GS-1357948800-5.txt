review/summary: Great product and amazing coffeereview/text: I really think the AeroPress does a nice job emulating an espresso maker. Yes it's not the same but for most people who are not truly coffee connoisseurs you will be very pleased. I make sure to brew carefully when the water is at 190F which is optimal for proper extraction. I also heat my milk to 160F and use a cheap but effective Aerolatte mixer to add air to the milk before combining. If you have time it's worth the effort and you save on cafe stops. I would also recommend using a burr grinder for your beans. It is also important for taste.
