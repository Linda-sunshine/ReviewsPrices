review/summary: OKreview/text: Slow response and fragile wire make this less than desirable. It is accurate though. Since you need to route the wire through the oven's seal it is subject to damage. Mine broke after 5 uses. maybe if the oven didn't seal it would last longer. After it broke, I did think of putting the entire unit in the oven but decided it wasn't worth chopping off the melted plastic afterward so I just trashed it.
