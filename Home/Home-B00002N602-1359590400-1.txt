review/summary: so fast and easyreview/text: If you want to make a wicked good chicken soup. Use this cooker. Renders the chicken fat perfect. We put a whole chicken in with herbs and white wine, cook the chicken for 15 minutes. Pull it out let cool. Then take the bones and other inedibles put em back in and let it break the bones down more. Fantastic!
