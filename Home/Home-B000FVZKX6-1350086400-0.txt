review/summary: Soft and Comfyreview/text: I washed the sheets before putting them on my bed and they fit perfectly, no pilling or shrinking. They are soft as velvet and warm but not too warm. We had our first snow of the season and they arrived just in time. So far, I'm very happy with my purchase.
