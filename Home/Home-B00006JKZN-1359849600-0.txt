review/summary: Great waffle maker; minimal pricereview/text: We bought this as a starter waffle maker since we had never made them before. As a novice, me and my husband picked out a recipe from the food network. We followed the directions on the maker to the dot and got instant perfect waffles every time. The only downside is that I wished i bought a Belgium waffle maker.Also, for a more crisp setting we go to 5; 4 is or a mid crips level and anything lower will give you a mushy pancake feel.
