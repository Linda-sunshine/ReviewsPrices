review/summary: Rusting after a couple of uses even though washing by handreview/text: I have read the existing reviews regarding rust, etc. However, I went ahead and bought these anyways. I love the set in general. I love serrated knives. We only wash all our knife sets by hand. We never put them in the dish washer. With our 2 other existing knife sets (much more expensive, though), we never have problems with rusting. However, my kids (teens) left these knives with water spots left on them overnight. In the morning, there are visible rust spots. We told them about this new knife set and how to care for them.I'm currently contemplating returning them. I'm sure if we always wash them (by hand like we always do) but also dry them right away, we should probably never have issues. However, since we've never had rust issues with our existing knife sets even if water spots are left, I'm debating on returning them. We'll see.
