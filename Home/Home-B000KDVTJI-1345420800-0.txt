review/summary: Leaks, rusts?review/text: I thought I was safe with a product with four stars and over a thousand reviews, but should've paid more attention to negative reviews. Like others, my kettle has started leaking and upon close inspection has 'rusty' spots along the bottom where the stainless steel meets the black plastic. I'm not sure if mine shuts off automatically or not either because I usually flip it off myself (usually like my water not quite boiling). Alas, threw away packaging.
