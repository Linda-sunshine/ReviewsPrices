review/summary: Perfect (and tastes better than Brita)review/text: We had been using the Brita pitcher, and this makes the water taste so much better.I especially love the fact that dust cannot get into the reservoir, as in the case of a pitcher.. so I can keep one in my room and not worry about cat hair settling into it.
