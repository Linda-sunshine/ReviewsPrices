review/summary: Broken after less than one monthreview/text: The base of the chair cracked (irrepairable) after less than a month of use (heard something "crack" the very first time I sat down in it so it may have been defective when we received it). Also has a very "chemical" smell to it, so we let it air out for a few days after assembling before placing into baby's room. Very disappointed, would not recommend this chair. Based on other reviews, doesn't seem to be even worth trying to get our money back from the manufacturer.
