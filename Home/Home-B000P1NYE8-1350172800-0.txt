review/summary: Measures accuratelyreview/text: I bought this tiny little scale to measure out straight caffeine powder to make my own energy drinks. It works perfectly. I love the fact that it is so small and compact, and that it measures in grams. It is very accurate, which was my main concern when I bought this scale because I definitely do not want to consume too much caffeine, since that is a very dangerous thing to do. I would definitely recommend this little scale, it is about the same size as my smartphone, which should give you an idea on the size.
