review/summary: Not all things made in China are bad....review/text: Percolated coffee does seem stronger than the brew you get from a traditional drip coffee maker. If you'd like to give it a try, you can't go wrong with this beautiful Yosemite model. It is solid and well made, and has a comfortable heft to it, even though it carries that dreaded &#34;Made in China&#34; label. It's a lovely percolator, and the only reason I gave 4 stars as opposed to 5: Amazon describes this item as having a GLASS percolator top: &#34;the percolator should be hand washed, although the filter basket and glass cap can go into the dishwasher.&#34; Maybe Farberware changed the design, and Amazon just hasn't had a chance to update, but I felt I had been misled a little. Mine was most definitely plastic. There are no issues, and the plastic cap works fine, I just feel that glass would be less prone to staining and would hold up better over the long haul. All things considered, this is an outstanding buy, especially when I see other brands going for $10 to $20 dollars more, and do not appear to be as well made. Sharp, shiny and solidly constructed, you won't be disappointed. Just be aware that yours will probably have a plastic, NOT GLASS, percolator cap.
