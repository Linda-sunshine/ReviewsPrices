review/summary: Simple design, good function, nice pricereview/text: After the espresso half of our Krups machine suddenly died we started to look for a new machine. Since we didn't use the espresso part much (which may have contributed to its malfunction) we decided to look for just a coffee maker. After reading the reviews here on Amazon it became crystal clear very quickly that we would not be able to rely on the reviews to guide us since every single machine has abundant negative and positive comments. We walked over to our neighborhood Bed, Bath & Beyond to peruse their selection.We settled on this model for several reasons:1. Footprint - Our previous espresso/coffee machine took up a LOT of counter space and we were very much interested in reducing that. This machine fit the bill perfectly as it reduces the counter space used by almost half.2. Simple design - We don't like lots of unnecessary "flash" in the appearance of our appliances, and the clean aesthetic of this model fit our preferences. We chose the silver over black because black plastic always shows ANY dirt or dust immediately.3. Ease of use - Very simple to fill the reservoir and cone filter. The pitcher pours very well, unlike our last one which would dribble a lot if coffee was poured too quickly. The lid of the carafe is much easier to remove and clean and fits very snugly on top.4. Ease of programming - Fairly simple to program, but we still don't understand why so many buttons are required. I think this design could be more streamlined.My only criticism is that after use, condensed water on the underside of the top lid with run down the back of the machine. The next model should redesign the hinge area so that any runoff would be caught and funneled into the reservoir.Dave
