review/summary: Breville Juicerreview/text: So far i have used the machine 3 times. The first use (for carrots only) was great. I was very pleased that the pulp came out very dry. The second time was less satisfying as the pulp is kinda wet and also i found large pieces of carrots in the pulp. The third time use was even worse, this time i mixed the carrots with apples and pears. First of all, the pulp came out very wet, there are many large pieces or chunks of apples and carrots in the pulp. I tried to pick them out and rerun the machine, but didn't help, the large pieces still went to the pulp container. This is rather wasting to me so i don't think it will be used much in future. For the price i paid, i don't think i will recommand it.
