review/summary: A great buyreview/text: I've been wanting a cast iron griddle for a long time. This griddle is reversable, flat on one side, ridged on the other. WIth the pan scraper, it's easy to clean and maintain. Fits perfectly on my stove. I'm excited to be able to grill inside when the weather is bad!
