review/summary: Adds depth to my shallow tub!review/text: Our tub is very shallow and I am not the tallest person so I know it will be even more useful to others! I got this because since I got into the third trimester of pregnancy my belly is no longer able to get under the water... Thanks to this product I can take more comfortable baths. It adds a nice extra depth of about 3 in to my tub.It has a hole on top so that in case the water WOULD go over that then it would start to drain it.-Carolina
