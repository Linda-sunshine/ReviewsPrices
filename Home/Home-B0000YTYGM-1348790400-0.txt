review/summary: Overflow fixreview/text: I have owned this coffee maker for a lot of years. Mine is white and that color hasn't been available for awhile. The only consistent 'problem' that I have read when checking the reviews for this product is 'overflow'. There is a very simple solution to this. When using a paper filter: After filling, carefully remove from basket and then tap the overturned basket on the counter. When using a permanent filter: Fill the filter and carefully place into the basket. The only time there would be an overflow problem with this coffee maker is when there are coffee grounds between the filter and the basket. This will cause the value of the basket to stick open which could lead to an overflow (after the value on top of the pot is clogged). The only other thing that will make a permanent basket overflow is using too fine of a grind (e.g. espresso roast). Too fine of a grind will clog the pores of the basket.There are more tips to making a GREAT cup of coffee but that would take more space than I'm allowed and a lot more discussion between us anal coffee types.Bottom line...two tablespoons per six ounce cup of freshly ground, whole bean coffee (at the proper temperature) will make a fine cup AND your coffee will be less bitter.
