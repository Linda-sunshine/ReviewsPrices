review/summary: Very good coffeemaker!review/text: I bought my Zojirushi 10 cup carafe coffee maker 2.5 years ago and have used it 5 days per week, every week for that entire 2.5 years. It has consistently made excellent coffee throughout that time. The grounds are saturated, the coffee is hot - and stays hot all day sitting on my office desk. I drink a pot a day and it is nearly as hot at 5:00 pm as it was at 8:00 am. The carafe works great, except on that rare occassion when I neglect to put the "plug" in the carafe after brewing. Finally, after 2.5 years the coffeemaker bit the dust. I suddenly realized that I had neglected in 2.5 years to de-lime the maker! Oops! My only complaint is that there is no practical way to mechanically clean out the water lines within the unit without completely dissassembling it. Of course, that wouldn't have been a problem if I had regularly run vinegar through it. I plan to buy a replacement Zojirushi carafe coffeemaker to replace the old one.
