review/summary: Great value, great thermometer, auto-turnoff is a bummerreview/text: This is a great little thermometer for the price -- accuracy is high, it's easy to use, has a high range of temperatures, and switches between F and C.My only issue with it is that it automatically turns off after 15 minutes or so. If you want to do long term measurements -- measuring the temperature of butter or oil over time, etc., you find yourself turning the meter back on every once in a while.But for $13? It definitely does the job.
