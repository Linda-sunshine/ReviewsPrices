review/summary: Feels like you're sleeping on a tempurpedic for a lot less!! Great for dorms!!review/text: When I was reading through the reviews it made me a little unsure whether or not to choose this one. I was looking for a mattress pad for my dorm bed. It is amazingly comfy. It is a lot thicker than you would expect, you really don't sink through it. it makes you feel like you're sleeping on a tempurpedic for a lot less money. It has a slight mint smell when you first get it, but it isn't bothersome or overly strong. I can't really smell it with my sheets covering it. GREAT BUY OVERALL! You can't beat it for the price
