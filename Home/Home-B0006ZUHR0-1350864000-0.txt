review/summary: Excellent step up from the 2020review/text: Just got this after our B&D; 2020 shorted out. We had an issue with an outlet which caused the short so no real ding against the 2020 iron which was great for us for almost 5 years.The 2030 seems to be a surprisingly good upgrade to the 2020. We still have the features we like - relatively heavy iron, good coverage, great water tank, and great steaming. In addition the digital readout is more detailed telling us the numeric setting along with a brief description of the setting (ie. COTT for cotton).It also complains now when there is insufficient water and seems to heat up significantly faster.All-in-all I'm glad we stuck with the brand and B&D; seems to have done some small, nice increases in functionality without affecting the price.
