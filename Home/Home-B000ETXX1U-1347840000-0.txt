review/summary: Nice solid bed...review/text: Held up myself, wife & kiddo just great totaling 390lbs. Was firm especially at the edges & didn't sag even on the second night. When deflated, it packs really well nearly to its original shipping size, this is a big plus considering how crucial cargo space is when packing. Only reason I didn't give this mama jama 5 stars is it lacked an option of inflating via a foot pump. Not sure even if that feature exists to have two inflatable options but if not, they should get on it!
