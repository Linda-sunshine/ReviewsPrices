review/summary: Excellentreview/text: This is great for such a tiny thing. Very easy to clean in the dishwasher or by hand. The only time I have trouble with it is in very shallow mixtures or if there is not enough liquid. Shallow is easy to fix - pour whatever you're blending into the provided measuring cup (or another cup) so it is deep enough for the blending mechanism to be completely submerged. Be careful not to bring it above the surface while blending or it will splatter everywhere.
