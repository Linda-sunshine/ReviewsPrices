review/summary: Cuisinart 9-Cup Food Processorreview/text: I upgraded to this machine from my tiny two-cup food processor. It is powerful, fast and quiet. I cannot live without it and it is so easy to use and clean. My old one was such a pain because I had to process in batches, I love having the larger size. Great product, Cuisinart has never let me down!
