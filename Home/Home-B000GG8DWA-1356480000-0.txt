review/summary: Larger than Expected--Won't Distribute Heat--but Toasty within a Foot Awayreview/text: The radiant heat has its pros and cons. It's great because it doesn't dry out my sensitive skin. But it's disappointing as it only warms the area about a foot away from and above the heating element. So if I sit just a foot away it can keep me nice and toasty, but is unable to distribute the heat around a small room.But the price is right and so far (in the last two weeks) it has not given any issues. It is also alot larger than the picture makes it out to be- about 1 foot x 1 foot. There are 2 heat settings 400W (top bar heats up), and 800W (as pictured, top and bottom bars heat up). And the areas in white stay cool to the touch. Not disappointed with this purchase (:
