review/summary: Excellent machine missing critical partsreview/text: I have owned this machine for several years and have used it on various surfaces at least once a week. Its great with pet hair etc. Its so good I just ordered a second one. It came MISSING the two critcl bolts that hold on the handle. Its unfortunate as I had a big cleaning day planned. The old one still works fine, but the plastic clip that locks the machine in vertical position snapped off and costs over 90.00 with shipping to be replaced. Its molded into the back of the handle. So High marks for cleaning and ease of use, Very low marks for packaging, vertical locking clip design, and quality control in shipping. It was also missing the back plate for the hose. Too much of a PIA to send back and can get bolts at store and not storing th hose on the handle isn't a hardship...so long as I remember where to store it. BUT, if I did not appreciate how well the machine cleans, I would say that missing parts in packaging and poor locking clip design does not bode well for quality control in other areas.
