review/summary: Product Box in terrible condition - beware if giving as a giftreview/text: Ordered from seller Amazon, LLC. Haven't tried product yet (giving as Christmas gift to someone) but product box arrived completely damaged. There are dents, it is bent in places, scrunched in corners, there's a spot where it looks like someone stabbed it with a knife. It basically looks like someone tried to use it as an accordion.The reviews I read for this product sound like it's a wonderful product to have. However, I'm going to be very embarrassed to give this present in this condition. I'll have to cross my fingers it's not damaged inside. I usually buy products from Amazon, LLC to avoid this all together (though this is the second year in a row Christmas gifts have come in damaged condition).I just recommend if you're getting this as a gift for someone, the box may arrive in very poor condition. I guess on the 26th I'll find out whether it came damaged as well...Disappointing.
