review/summary: It's okreview/text: The automatic turn off doesn't appear to work, which is irritating because at work I have to keep it on my floor (no extension cords allowed) and so if I'm not paying attention I don't know when it's done and it could just boil away... Also I've used it several times and the stinky smell hasn't gone away. I'm hoping that goes away soon. This seems a cheaper product than I thought it would be and I don't think it should be $30!
