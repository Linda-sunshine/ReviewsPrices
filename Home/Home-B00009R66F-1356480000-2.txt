review/summary: Sucks ... not really wellreview/text: This product is average at best. So many of the Hoover products seem cheaply made. We've been through MANY of them. Finally broke down and bought an Oreck. That was worth the investment.We are in our 3rd year with the Oreck and have had little trouble. It weighs less than a Hoover. Easier to move around! It does not break/jam like a Hoover.
