review/summary: Great!review/text: I've always loved Willow Tree and wasn't disappointed with this. It's Just what I expected from Willow Tree. Beautiful set and a good quality item. Compared to other Nativity sets it's in the same price range and I actually feel like it's larger and better quality than some others that are similar.I'm looking forward to collecting the other pieces to add to my set in coming years. It's a wonderful addition to my Christmas decor, but is so beautiful I would consider displaying it all year long.
