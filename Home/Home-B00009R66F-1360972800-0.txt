review/summary: Good for surge cleaning, but the attachment...well..review/text: I have had this vac for MANY years and it always came through for me. I have this really old Berber carpet that comes next-to-new every time I clean it. I just have to remember to rinse the seal part on the dirty water tank (there is a lid that comes off) so that it continues to suck the water on your next round. Also, connecting and using the attachment hose is a bugger. I did figure it out, and it works ok but not enough to use it a lot. I guess none of them are as good as the actual vac part. I was doing the stairs and ended up just using the machine itself (and that was a back breaker). Over all it's good for the price if you want to just steam the carpets and not use the accessories hose. One thing I like is the tanks are really easy to clean. After pushing a vac for awhile the last thing you want to do is mess with a heavy, nasty tank. So kudos to them for that part. I have heard that not all machines are that easy to clean. OH and be sure to vacuum your carpets thoroughly first, especially if you have pets. You be glad you did. Picking animal hair out of the filter in the dirty water tank is gross!
