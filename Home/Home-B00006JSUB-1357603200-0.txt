review/summary: Lodge Logic L14SK3 15-Inch Pre-Seasoned Cast-Iron Skilletreview/text: This is one large and heavy 15 inch skillet. I was tempted to order a 17inch (available elsewhere) but the Amazon price for 15inch is an exceptional value, especially with free shipping, and adequate size. Now I can blacken at least six NY Strips at the same time.Note that the 15 inch measurement is diameter rim to rim, the actual inside flat cooking surface is approximately 12 inch diameter.
