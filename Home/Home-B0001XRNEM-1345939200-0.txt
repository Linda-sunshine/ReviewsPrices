review/summary: Couldn't Make Expresso Without Itreview/text: This tamper is such a simple but essential tool. I've been using it for over a year and it's ideal for its purpose. The 50mm end of it is the perfect size for tamping the coffee grounds in the basket before I snap it into the espresso machine. It's very durable and should last me as long as I own my espresso maker (or maybe as long as I live).
