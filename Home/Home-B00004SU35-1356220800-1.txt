review/summary: Twelve years and still working great!review/text: I purchased one of these as a gift for my dad twelve years ago. He loves making popcorn and this is still his go-to popping method. After he received it, he stopped using microwave popcorn altogether (which is bad for your health anyway, Google it!). Very happy with this product and love how durable it is!
