review/summary: Well worth the none discounted pricereview/text: The chair arrived on-time.It was simple to assemble, taking less than 5 mins. A bit heavy, so if you can assemble it in the room you're going to use it in.Has great functionality; height and tilt adjustability. Looks nice, modern mesh and solid materials.Roommate bought this at full price. I loved it, when I checked on Amazon I was pleased to see it was discounted.Totally worth it!
