review/summary: Best Coffee Ever!review/text: I bought this coffee maker originally for the sleek retro look (to go with a retro kitchen) - and hoped the taste would be good too - well - the taste is fabulous - I love that you get a HOT cup of coffee even on the second or third cup of the morning! I read many reviews and this had the best so I went with it and am glad I did. I am careful to wash it out carefully and make sure there are no grounds in the holes. I use the simple disc filters found at Market Basket - I put one on the bottom, add the coffee, and put one on the top. So far no problems at all and no grounds. The smell and the sound are an added bonus. I love that it is simple, sleek, and delicious.
