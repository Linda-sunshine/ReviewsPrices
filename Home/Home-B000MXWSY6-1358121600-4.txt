review/summary: As advertisedreview/text: This radio alarm clock works as advertised. The screen is large enough for us to view from 10 feet or more, and the dimmer feature makes sure that the glow does not keep us awake. The speakers are not the highest quality, but they are loud enough and clear enough for talk radio (or music if you aren't picky).
