review/summary: not worth the money!review/text: I have had this blender for two years and hardly use it until recent last 6 months making smoothies. At first I really liked it and then the carafe started leaking and having hard time getting the smoothies made. Called customer service and they said there was a defect in the blades and was mailing me another pitcher. It came a few weeks ago and though it does not leak anymore, I can't make a simple frozen smoothie without a big production. Stopping and stirring and adding more and more liquid! I think it is a faulty motor and it is no longer under warranty! It only lasted me less than 2 years with min. usage!!! Don't buy!
