review/summary: Overall a good valuereview/text: I think this is a good product - only faults are a) it seems to take some pretty big chunks occassoinally that aren't 'juiced' and b) it has a little issue with air being forced up through the plunger hole where the product goes in to be juiced. Other than that, it works very well and seems pretty solid and technically of higher quality.
