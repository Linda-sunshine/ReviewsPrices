review/summary: this is awesomereview/text: This is such an awesome machine. I was looking around for a whole house humidifier and they were so expensive. Then I found this little treasure. It's quiet and keeps the air nice in our house. I run it a lot during the winter so noses stay not so dry! The only thing is that if you run it on high for a long time, you have to refill it constantly. It holds a lot of water so it will take a while to run out but the refilling is just me being lazy. It's a good idea to keep the original box to store this item in while you aren't using it. It has a filter that will need to be eventually replaced but when it's full, it's heavy so thank goodness for the wheels on bottom! Great buy!
