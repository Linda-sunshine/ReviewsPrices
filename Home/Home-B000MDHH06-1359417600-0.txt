review/summary: Best Juicer Everreview/text: I am very happy with my Breville. I really love how well this Juicer obliterates my ingredients. So far the hardest vegetables I used were beets and sweet potatoes, they were gone in a second with ease. The motor is fast, the feeder chute is large enough for a whole apple, it's super easy to clean, and the juice is well strained.I used to have a Jack LaLane Juicer, and I just wasn't happy, it seems like it had to work so hard for even the simplest ingredients and the juice it produced was too thick. Also, there were too many parts to clean, taking it apart and putting it back together each time to clean it was a pain.
