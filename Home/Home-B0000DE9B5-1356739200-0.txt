review/summary: Perfect for what I wanted--hot and cold beverages.review/text: This pitcher is a good size and well-designed. So far it's stood up to use very well with both cold and hot liquids. Love the sealing lid and did not find it hard to use at all (some reviews said it was puzzling--I found it to be pretty intuitive and there was a little instruction note in the box if I hadn't already figured it out myself). Durable, easy to handle, pours well. Very glad I chose this one.
