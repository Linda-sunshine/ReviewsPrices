review/summary: Read the reviewsreview/text: I bought this because I wanted to make my own sausages - the pasta was an extra bonus. I had not read any reviews but by chance the meat I ground on the first batch was not too fatty and was also semi frozen. Turned out great and I was super thrilled. Decided to make pasta and meat sauce - the meat great but the pasta was a nightmare. Stuck together when it did come out and was basically a complete dud. The next day I was excited because my sausage casings (which I bought from the internet) had come and it was finally sausage day. Totally different experience - the meat clumped and the fat and sinews clogged the system. After taking it apart and reassembling it twice I got through the meat but I was exhaused physically and mentally. I had added some chilli and it would not grind it at all. Placed the sausage tube on and it was almost total failure. I was so disappointed. THEN I READ THE REVIEWS. The booklet is very basic and the reviews helped me get the best out of the gizmo. Semi frozen meat, sliced into manageable sizes is first and foremost. I had tried to do my sausages with the blade still attached - nowhere did it show me how to assemble it for stuffing sausages. With all the help from the reviews I flew through the next batch and got my lamb sausage out perfectly. Seasoned with mint and greek seasoning it was divine. Without the casing i just stuck the sausage onto a wooded skewer and bbqed them. Fantastic. The pasta maker is still duff though. All in all I think it is good value for money when used for small families. You want more you gotta pay more.
