review/summary: Lorell Executive Chairreview/text: Everything was fine until I tried to connect the backrest to the seat. The bolt, nut, and washer would not connect the seat to the backrest. The chair was defective (the connection from the seat to the backrest), had my brother help me put it together and tried for 2 hours to fit the seat to the backrest, but to no prevail. Plan on receiving a refund for this.My first shipment was mia never found out what happened to it so amazon sent me a second one that was delivered exactly 2 days later. Thanks amazon for your kindness this is no way your fault for the faulty chair.
