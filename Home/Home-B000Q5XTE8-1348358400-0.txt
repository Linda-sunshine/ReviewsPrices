review/summary: Quite Decentreview/text: I am seconding all the reviews that mention that this is meant to be a task chair rather than a lounge chair.Sturdy construction and the adjustments make the chair highly customizable.This wasn't visible to me from the pictures, but the armrests are in fact padded with a very dense rubber foam-type material and are not bare plastic.Use this chair daily for several hours and so far no complaints, it is a solid chair for the price. Would have been great if the lumbar support was adjustable but that would cost a bit more
