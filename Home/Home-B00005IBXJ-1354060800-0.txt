review/summary: Good Investment.review/text: A good product for a reasonable price. Simple to use. Easy cleanup. Cooks all sorts of foods normally cooked in an oven in less time and with less energy. We used to use our oven 5-6 times a week for 30-40 minutes at a time (not including preheat times of about 15 minutes). Now I hardly turn on the oven at all due to this device and am done cooking in a fraction of the time. I have seen a decrease in in the power bill since we have been using it also, which is the main reason I purchased it. Of course the food is not heated exactly as if it was in the oven, but it is close and possibly takes some adjustments of the top burner or lower burner for perfection. The top and lower burner can be turned on or off independently of one another according to your cooking needs. I usually have both on for simplicity. The unit does give off some heat, but no more than a toaster oven and definitely not as much as an oven when you open the door and heat scorches your face. I would buy it again. In fact bought one for my daughter as a wedding gift. A great product for anyone looking to save time and money.
