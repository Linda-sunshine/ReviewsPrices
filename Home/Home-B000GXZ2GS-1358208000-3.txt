review/summary: A great espresso or cafe americano style cup of coffee!review/text: Fast and easy to use, it makes the best cup of espresso I've made in around 3 minutes including cleanup time!This is the smoked color version of the Aeropress. I had hoped for the clear one but this will do.I love that cleanup is so simple, after the 10 second brewing process you push the plunger down all the way for your espresso. Then just pick up the device, screw off the filter holder and eject the waste grounds and filter into the trash. Many people say you can also reuse filters several times quite effectively, however they're super cheap so I haven't bothered to do so. I've been using plain maxwell house coffee in mine and it makes really smooth espresso with no bitterness or sourness, great for making lots of starbucks style drinks! I am recommending this brewer to many of my college friends who like coffee since it's so small and un-complicated.
