review/summary: Not for anything remotely liquid.review/text: Well, I just tried it for the first time out of the box to make salsa and it was a disaster. There is no seal on the bottom of the processing bowl under the blade, so any liquid will go up under the blade and leak right out the bottom all over the processor base and the counter. I suppose it's useful for dry ingredients, but I'll be returning mine.
