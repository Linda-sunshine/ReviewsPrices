review/summary: Great Vacuumreview/text: Most vacuum cleaners suck. The are hard to maneuver and they wear out too quickly. I've had many different brands, some costing 5 times the cost of this Hoover, and none were as good as this. This vacuum actually brought new life to our old carpet. The price is so reasonable too, you can get 5 or 6 for the price of a Dyson. Highly recommended.
