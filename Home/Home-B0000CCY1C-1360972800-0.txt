review/summary: Cookie scoopreview/text: I have purchased a few different cookie scoops that have broken within the first few scopes of making cookies. I purchased this scoop and I love it, it works great and doesn't stop in the middle of releasing the dough I would highly recommend this scoop for people who make cookies as often as I do (every other week for the husbands lunch box) it works so well and makes making cookies so much easier.
