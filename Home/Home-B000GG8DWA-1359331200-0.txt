review/summary: A Techs opinion of the Optimus H-5210review/text: Very good construction. I was expecting a cheap ugly heavy monster. But it looks very nice. The outer shell made of high quality light plastic making it easy to move around. Also thinner than expected. Some reviewers say, "it isn't made of metal and the plastic will melt". The plastic is formulated to take the heat. If it were made of metal(because of conductivity) it would burn you if touched in a hot area like the top. Metal would also be heavy.This heater heats in 2 ways. It radiates the heat instantly to whatever is in front of it. And it also heats the room up slowly like a convection oil filled radiator. If you put your hand above it you will feel hot air rising like a radiator.It's only 400 or 800 watts so don't expect it to heat like a blast furnace. I usually only use the low setting and sleep all night conserving electricity. Have it up on a stand pointing at the top of my bed. I use a 1500 watt ceramic fan heater if I want the whole room warmed up quickly. Depending on how cold it is out side, how large a room, how well your room is insulated, will determines how effective it will be at raising the temperature.When sleeping I like to set it at 400 watts to save power. Ideally having another ceramic heater waiting in the wings set at a certain temperature. If it gets super cold outside and the 400 watts aren't enough, the ceramic heater should kick on if needed. The problem I'm having is..... The thermostats on the ceramics I've tried are totally unreliable and wildly turn off and on at different temperatures. Probably better off just turning it up to 800 watts if 400 isn't enough, and just forget the ceramic heaters.This heater doesn't dry out the air like a ceramic so less coughing. The glow coming off the elements is dim enough to where it isn't a nuisance.
