review/summary: Very Firmreview/text: If you're looking for a firm pillow, this is the one for you. My husband loves these pillows...I do not. That's why I gave it a 3 star rating. If you remove the zippered cover it makes the pillow a bit softer, but not pliable enough for me. We've had our about a year now and it looks and feels like new. It doesn't lose it's shape at all.
