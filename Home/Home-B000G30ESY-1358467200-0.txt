review/summary: Couldn't Be Happier!review/text: I bought the &#34;Zojirushi NS-LAC05XA Micom 3-Cup (Uncooked) Rice Cooker and Warmer on a &#34;Lightening&#34; deal and couldn't be happier! Not only does it cook perfect rice, but I use it to cook Quinoa and Steel Cut Oats as well.Before I got the &#34;Zojirushi&#34;, I dreaded cooking steel cut oats in the morning. It was a chore and I always made a mess because I would take my eyes off of the pot for two minutes and invariably the water would boil over and I would have a mess to clean up after everything cooled down. Now I can put my oats and water in the bowl, set the timer for the next morning and when I wake up, my fresh steel cut oats are waiting for me. No mess, no fuss. A win-win situation!
