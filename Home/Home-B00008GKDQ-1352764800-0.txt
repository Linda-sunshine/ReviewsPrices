review/summary: The Griddle of My Dreamsreview/text: Well, I didn't really dream about a griddle but if I did I'd dream about this one.Cast Iron is the best surface to cook on - period. The heat is evenly distributed throughout the cooking area and the flavor is great. If you use this on a stove you may have hotspots directly over the burners but I found that if you let the grill heat up slowly it's not much of a problem. I leave mine on my stove (electric burners) and use it all the time. Clean up is easy yet takes some special care like drying the grill right after you wash it and then a super light coating of vegi oil and it's done.It is a little heavy yet you know this thing is well built and will last longer than you will! I also recently bought the Lodge 8 quart CampStove and the thing is a work of art. You can't go wrong with any Lodge Cast Iron cookware.
