review/summary: Consistent Quality and Worth Every Dollarreview/text: I first saw one of these in a coffee shop and was very intrigued. What a simple and ingenious way to brew tea. Later I got a similar version from a cheaper brand and it wasn't designed nearly this well. Now I finally bought the real Ingenuitea product and it was worth every dollar. Design is great, and I use it both a single-cup brew and as a brewing pot to make very concentrated tea that can be diluted with water. Easy to wash too.
