review/summary: Best Iron I Ever Had !review/text: After my old iron broke, I purchased this bad boy. Oh my gosh am I glad I did! The description about this iron is very accurate and true! I can't even begin to explain to you what I love about this iron. Just read the description about it in the ad and everything that it says it does, IT DOES !! You will not regret buying this! Awesome product !!
