review/summary: Brita Grand Customer Servicereview/text: When after many-many years of use our filter resevoir developed a crack. Looked on line for parts and talked to Brita. Since we had the pitcher so long I thought it unlikely that they have the same model or parts to fit. We love our Brita and it has always worked extrememly well and the Grand styling fits nicely in the refrigerator so when customer service said they had the part I was happy. We didn't receive the part when expected so I called again, they were very apologetic and said it would go out asap. Recieved a part fast, couple days later along with a gratuity filter. The problem was it is the wrong part, I called cs again, customer service reps always nice and easy to get through to said they were sorry and sent out the correct part which received a couple days later, much faster than quoted and no charge. From our experience I can not believe there are any bad reviews for Brita. For us Brita has proven itself with great quality, styling and service. We do not or have ever worked for Brita just a fan of the company and product!J.San Diego
