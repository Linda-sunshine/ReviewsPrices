review/summary: Good at first, now always jamsreview/text: Was very happy for a few months, purchased it July 2012, now jams all the time. Gets jammed on can labels and when it gets stuck, have to unlock and start over. Same kinds of cans used all the time, sometimes it works all around one can, more often tho - it jams ... I did put in the the dishwasher, maybe that had something to do with it. Now looking for an opener that has a magnet that brings the can's top up instead of dropping into the product. Had one a long time ago, much better!
