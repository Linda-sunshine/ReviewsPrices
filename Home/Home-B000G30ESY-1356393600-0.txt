review/summary: takes a long time; rice tastes badreview/text: pros:-great construction and high-quality materials-timer is convenient-notification sounds are cute-nice seal to keep rice from being dried up when keeping it warmcons:-takes a long time to cook the rice, even in the quick mode-(because of the long time), rice tends to be over-boiled. To be specific, the surface of each piece of cooked rice tends to be &#34;boiled down&#34;. Kinda like dried porridge. It does NOT taste good and the rice loses its own flavor.
