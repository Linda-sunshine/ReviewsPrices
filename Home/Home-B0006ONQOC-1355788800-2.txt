review/summary: Good looks, good treatsreview/text: I have always been a Haggan dazz kinda guy, but this machine changed that. Only your creativity will hold you back. I would have given this 5 stars if it were not for one thing, the advertising says 2 quart. It has been through many trial and error that I have found this to be a 1 maybe 1 1/2 quart ice cream maker. There wasOne time when I was able to make 2 and that was when it was18 degrees outside and I put the whole machine outside. The secret to smooth ungrainy ice cream is to get it cold FAST. If you try to make a full 2 quarts, you get grainy ice cream, or at least I do. Having said that, I just bought one for my daughter.
