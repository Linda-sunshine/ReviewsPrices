review/summary: just okreview/text: The mirror itself is nice but the quality of the product seems minimal. It is wobbly and doesn't close nicely. I had an older model that gave out that was well made so ordered the same brand but just doesn't seem as well made. Works for what I need it for and the outlet on it is very convenient as well.
