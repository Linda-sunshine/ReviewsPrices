review/summary: rarely use my blender nowreview/text: i love this blender. since you control where the blender is in whatever you're mixing, you never have that problem with really viscous liquids where your blender gets stuck and you have to shake it or mix it with a spoon. so it's one of my more used kitchen gadgets
