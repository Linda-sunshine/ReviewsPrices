review/summary: great productreview/text: great product. works great, affordable. I boiled water about ten time prior to actually using it, so I never had any problems with the plastic taste, like others commented on. However, if you read the instruction manual (who does that?) it says specifically to boil water about 10 times, so I did just that and no problems.
