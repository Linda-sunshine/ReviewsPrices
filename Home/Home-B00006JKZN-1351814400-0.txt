review/summary: It's a waffle iron, what do you expect?!review/text: This is the third time I have purchased this waffle iron. I have one for home and one for our beach house. We rent out our beach house and a guest dropped it on the tile floor breaking the hinge. I have been happy with the product, Cuisinart is a great name and the price is right so I just ordered up another. Cooks evenly, non-stick surface is just that, great waffle iron, you can't go wrong.
