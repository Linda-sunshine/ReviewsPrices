review/summary: Can i be happy and sad at the same time?review/text: Pro: Product quality is exceptional!! We finally purchased our first pan! Con: It's wayyyy tooo big. I need to hold it with two hands and that's w/o food in it. I would only recommend this to families that have more than 5 mouths to feed. B/c the pan is so large, the heat distribution doesn't work well on a normal stove, so it gets really hot in the center but not enough heat on the side. It probably would much better on a bbq or outdoor grill. I can't wait to purchase the more "feed couple only" 10" one!
