review/summary: ummmreview/text: Received the mattress and blew it up; was great for a couple days but then started losing air. We were sinking into the middle every night making it very uncomfortable so then we had to pump it up everyday. My boyfriend is 230 and I am 128 so the sinking was pretty significant after air started leaking. They say it stretches, too and it did. Queen sheets fit the first 3 nights then we had to use the flat sheet on the bottom as it was too small. I would have had to get king size to fit. Returned it. I am sure some work great but ours, unfortunately, was a flop. Seems to be built well and is durable.
