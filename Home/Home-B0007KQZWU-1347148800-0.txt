review/summary: Great Quality but Cheaper at Costcoreview/text: You can get this same exact set at Costco for over $100 cheaper. I picked the set up for $179.99, the details are the same down to the brushed stainless finish. The picture in the use and care guide is also the same exact for advertising it on cuisinart.com. Great cookware set!
