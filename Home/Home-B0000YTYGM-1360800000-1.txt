review/summary: Worst coffee maker ever!review/text: The DTC-975BKN really is the worst coffee maker ever! I used the product one time and plan to return it. Here are all the things wrong with it.1) The coffee maker produces more steam than a hot shower. Don't even think about putting this machine under a caninet. You'll ruin the cabinet and the collected steam will drip everywhere.2) Steam collects on the outside of the coffee maker and drips down onto the kitchen counter. It's not a lot but who wants dozens of droplets of water on their countertop every time you make a pot of coffee? It's a ridiculous design flaw!3) A fresh brewed cup of coffee is warm but not hot at all. I don't know how that can be. This coffee maker boils water and turns it to steam like any other one. Maybe it's the lack of a hot plate below the carafe though I drank my coffee before it had the chance to sit in the pot. Anyway, the coffee is not hot!4) There is a minimum amount of water required in the reservoir for coffee to brew. So, if you make coffee that is too strong, you can't simply add an additional cup of water to the reservoir to dilute the pot. It won't brew without a minimum amount of water. I actually tried adding 2 cups of water (about 16 oz) to the reservoir but it still wouldn't brew. I don't know how you could ever brew just 1 or 2 cups of coffee.I've read dozens of product reviews for coffee makers and still haven't found the perfect machine. They all seem to have flaws. My search continues!
