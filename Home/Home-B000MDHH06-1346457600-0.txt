review/summary: Not so great with the greens, very wet pulpreview/text: I bought this juicer when I was new to juicing. I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on something I might not use for long, and having read reviews on this juicer I decided to go for it.It was going all right at first. Until the neighbors started complying. If you live in an apartment building, this thing is not good for early morning juicing. So I put it away and bought a hand crank juicer.And this one sat around unused for almost a year. Then I decided to do a three day juice fast. And I started using this again. Chopped greens would end up whole in the basket, the pulp was so wet that I had to run it through a second time, and I got a significant amount of juice out of that pulp. It was a pain digging around in the basket for the pulp. With this style juicer I would have preferred a pulp ejecting juicer if I had know that. and sometimes cut vegies would fly out at me, because I couldn't get my hand or the push bar in fast enough. Clean up was very extensive. A few days into the the fast, and I couldn't handle this one any more and ended up buying a new juicer. I would recommend this more for a person who doesn't juice very much and who doesn't need to worry about noise.
