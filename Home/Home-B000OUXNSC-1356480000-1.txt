review/summary: I thought it would be cheap, but it is greatreview/text: I was convinced this would only serve temporarily while we had guests in town, but it actually is really a nice cover and I was super surprised how sturdy it is. The reviews are actually right on this one, and the sides are very deep, so even if you have a pillow top or an additional topper on top of a standard mattress, it's going to totally wrap under and not budge.
