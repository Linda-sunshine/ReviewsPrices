review/summary: Makes the worlds best cup of coffeereview/text: My wife loves her Keurig B60, Its easy to make a great cup of coffee and its easy to keep clean. We recomend that you get the mesh filter, we use it to make green tea, chamomille that we get at the local store. Refilling the water is simple. The shape of the product is really cool and fits right in. We would recomend this to everyone that likes to drink coffee, tea or hot chocolate. Pleanty of vendors carry kcups online and even the local store carries them incase we run out.
