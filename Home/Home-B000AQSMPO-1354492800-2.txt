review/summary: Keurig Brew Reviewreview/text: I have purchased several of these machines over the last few years as gifts and for my own house, and the first thing I can say is the WOW factor was really what sold me. It's quick and efficient and as the brand has grown more popular, you can find many different places to buy the coffee for the Keurig. Everyone in the family loves to try and use this to brew their coffee, tea, and chocolate.The drawback is the issues you start to see with the machine after months of use. The Keurig unfortunately does not stay free from issues for very long, and has disappointed me personally as a consumer, and as a gift product. If you brew a stronger product, or hot chocolate for instance, you better run an additional cup of hot water thru the system or you could end up with a clogged system. Sometimes the machine seems to have a mind of its own, deciding to brew a small cup even when you have told it to give you the larger cup.All in all, it is a cool little gadget, but if you want the tried and true multiple cup and always-ready-coffee maker, go back to the original. It doesn't look as cool on the kitchen counter, but it is going to work.
