review/summary: Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge, F5914-900review/text: So far so good. I still haven't used the upholster cleaning feature yet.I use a Sears Rug shampooer machine with scrubbing brushes first to clean the rug,then I only use the Hoover Carpet Cleaner with clear water to rinse the carpetand suck up the filthy soap water. I like that I can turn off the brushes on the Hoover Cleaner,because The Sears Shampooer already did all the scrubbing work.The Hoover Carpet Cleaner should last a long time seeing how I don't use the brushes and justuse plain water to extract. ( I have been doing this 2 machine process for years with great success.)
