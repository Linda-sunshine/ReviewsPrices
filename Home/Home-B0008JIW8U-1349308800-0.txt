review/summary: Great Little Machinereview/text: We live in Manhattan where space is a hot commodity and this little machine is exactly what we needed. The 4-cup programmable machine is perfect for 2 full mugs of coffee for 2 adults. The key is not to leave it on the warmer too long after it brews. It is largely made of plastic and if you let plastic sit with heat - things will break. So use logic - turn it off after it has brewed and fill your mugs. Open the top to vent the hot steam that accumulates during the brew cycle. Wash it out after every use and make sure to run plain water through once a month as it suggests to keep it clean. We were concerned about how long this machine would last, but by being consistent with those minor details - it has been part of our daily lives for about a year and it's still going! Sometimes we run water through it to make tea or we program it to make coffee in the morning. We adore our little Mr. Coffee. It is practical and easy to use. It's no wonder why most hotel rooms around the world have a similar brewer in their rooms...
