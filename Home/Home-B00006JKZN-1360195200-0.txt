review/summary: I love round waffles.review/text: This is the second Cuisinart waffle iron and I enjoyed the first one I know I will enjoy this one. The only problem I found with my first iron was the lid had become loose after time of being stood up on its black handle. I would recommend not to stand it up but place it flat on a shelf.
