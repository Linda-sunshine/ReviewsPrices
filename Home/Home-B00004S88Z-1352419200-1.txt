review/summary: the only one to ever buyreview/text: I purchased the smaller unit for myself. A word of caution, if you have a range hood the larger model may not clear it. All pressure cookers say not to cook on a ceramic or glass top...well, I've used mine for years on my electric glass top with no problems...I am careful not to jossle it around when full but that's the only precaution I take. With no gaskets, this cooker will last a lifetime. It's quite heavy but that's what makes it so solid a cooker. If you like to can, this is the only pressure cooker you should buy. Highly recommended
