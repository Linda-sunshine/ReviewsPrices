review/summary: Perfect!!!review/text: When Ireturned home after abdominal surgery I had to sleep in a recliner for one month. This topper made the recliner feel like a bed. It's breathable, feels like memory foam but better and is very pliable. I cut it to the correct size for a recliner and it allowed me to be as comfortable as I would have been if I were able to sleep in my bed.
