review/summary: best for the price, so powerful and easy to cleanreview/text: I did my research before buying this juicer. It's very powerful at 700 watts and chews up the fruits and veggies in no time. It's easy cleanup for a juicer, you have to expect time cleaning the basket but it's not that bad. For the price I paid I think it's more powerful that some of the larger and more expensive brands. I not only recommend it, I bought two more for Christmas presents.
