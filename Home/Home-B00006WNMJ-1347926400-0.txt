review/summary: I like it!review/text: I do not have any experience actually 'testing' the water to see if it does what it says it does, but I've been happier with the taste. I cannot drink plain unfiltered Tap water, nor can I make Tea with it, so I use this a lot (with the appropriate faucet mount of course) this is a review for just the filter.I filter my cat's drinking water at a ratio of 90%. That means I fill the bowl with mostly filtered and then add some regular Tap water. Apparently they find the smell more appealing, though I can't see why. ;-P
