review/summary: Great value for the price.review/text: I have owned many food processors over the years and decided to move up to a Cuisinart as most of the other brands were inexpensive and not sturdy. I read other reviews here to make my decision. So far I am pleased with the DLC-10S performance. The accompanying CD is helpful to understand proper use. I watched most of the recipe section for technique and got some good ideas there. With the current abundance of our garden produce, this appliance has been invaluable for chopping herbs and vegetables for canning.When chopping basil or parsley, I was surprised and delighted to find everything chopped and no large pieces remaining that the blade missed.I have also used it with good success in making bread, grinding nuts for cakes, and in making uniformly sliced potatoes for scalloped potatoes. I can report no downside to my experience with this processor.
