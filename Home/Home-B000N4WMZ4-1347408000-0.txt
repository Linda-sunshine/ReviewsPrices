review/summary: It ain't heavy, it's my cookerreview/text: Last winter my friend Lori showed off her new dutch oven with a fabulous chicken dish and ever since I've been lusting after a dutch oven of my own. But, being a free lance writer with a sketchy income, I put off a purchase until another friend gave me an Amazon gift card for my birthday. Right away I purchased the Lodge Dutch Oven in spicy red and have been using it to braise meat, put together one-pot meals and cook up homemade jams. The heft of the pot is a mixed blessing -- great for the cooking part, but a little cumbersome when washing it. (I don't have a dishwasher, remember I'm a poor free lancer). But hoisting it around has firmed up my arms and saved on a gym membership.
