review/summary: Cuisinart ICE-30BC Frozen Yogurt, Sorbet, and Ice Cream Makerreview/text: Love it! I have been making all kinds of ice cream since purchasing this. I would highly recommend this to any ice cream lover. It makes it so quickly. To get a really hard ice cream, it has to have additional freezing in a good container. Got a Ben and Jerry's ice cream recipe book and have made some fabulous ice cream.
