review/summary: Filter full of ANTSreview/text: I've been using filters (mostly another popular brand) for the better part of 20 years, but this was my first experience buying replacements from Amazon. I opened one of the filters this evening, read the directions, and soaked it in a clean measuring cup.After 15-20 minutes, I poured out the soaking water, rinsed off the filter, and set about replacing our old filter. I poured the water out of the old pitcher, tossed the old filter, and put the new one in. I filled the pitcher with water, and started noticing little specks in the water. I thought it was carbon and thought nothing of it. Then I looked closer and realized the specks were ANTS, loads of ANTS.I poured the ant-y water out, took the filter out and rinsed it, only to have more ants come crawling out. The filters are now quarantined in the garage and will be returned ASAP.
