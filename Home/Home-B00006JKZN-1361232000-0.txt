review/summary: Perfect waffles - easy operation.review/text: Bought one of these and it is just great for the price. Has a more solid feel than a lot of the really cheap waffle irons, and just makes great plate-size waffles. I think we've used it 20 of the last 30 days since buying it. Solid, quality purchase for a great price.
