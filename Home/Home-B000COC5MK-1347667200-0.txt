review/summary: probably not for wine experts - fine for mereview/text: There are a couple of things that are confusing. I'm not sure if its a defect with my unit, or if its a design feature. When plugged into the wall, it has a red glow - which I assume means it is in charge mode -- but it never turns off, so maybe it just means it is plugged in. Anyway - I unplug it and we use it for a few weeks then plug it in again.Before buying this we bought screw top wines -- which do not require a cork screw skills. There are a lot of really good wines with screw tops -- New Zealand, Australian and some Washington State wines -- but using this extends our range ...The only problem with the opener is that it is a traditional cork screw that extends all the way then retracts, pulling the cork out of the bottle -- when it extends all the way it, some cork inevitably falls into the wine -- not much - and it doesn't spoil it -- but for some -- this might be a deal killer. There might be a technique where you quickly put it into reverse before it goes all the way through the cork, but I don't know what that would be.
