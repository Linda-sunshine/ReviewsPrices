review/summary: Sturdy, comfy, prettyreview/text: I didn't want to spend a lot on a glider so I went with this one. I believe I made a great choice! It's super comfortable, nice looking, quiet, and not so large. We have a smaller nursery so it's nice to have a smaller glider. I'm a huge fan. All night feedings and story readings happen in this chair, so there are books and burg cloths in the pockets. The footrest also glides so your body is ultimately comfortable.
