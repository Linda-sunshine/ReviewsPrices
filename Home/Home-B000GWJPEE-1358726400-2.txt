review/summary: Frog humidifierreview/text: This is my third humidifier from Crane and I love it! The first one I had was the penguin which was my all time favorite but I tripped and dropped the body and it broke. The second one was a used yellow duck and idk what happened but it started to leak really bad so I decided to not get a used one and just go for brand new. I have been using this for several weeks now and have zero problems with it! I love the fact that the mist output is so adjustable. I set it on medium, have it running only at night and it lasts for at least three days without needing a refill. It isn't too loud so it doesn't bother the baby at all and when I have to go to her in the middle of the night I don't need to turn on a light bc the indicator light is bright enough for me to see by, which is very helpful bc then I don't have to fully wake up as I am soothing her back to sleep!
