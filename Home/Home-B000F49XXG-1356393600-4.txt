review/summary: De'Longhireview/text: I hate it. Too low to add any other regular cup underneath the dispenser, of course I did not pay any attention to the other bad reviewers and went for it because I like to give to everything and anything the benefit of the doubt. The coffee tasted like burned rubber. Too noisy, too. Refund took 30/days.
