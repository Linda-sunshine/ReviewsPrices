review/summary: Good valuereview/text: Brita filters have been around for as long as I can remember. This is for a reason: they do their job. I can't assess their ability to remove contaminants with no taste (like bacteria and heavy metals), but I can tell you that they improve the taste of tap water remarkably. This site has a better price on them than any of my local stores, so I order here.
