review/summary: Best stick vac with powerreview/text: I have mostly bare floors with a few small carpets. This works great! Great suction power. Easy to switch from bare floor function to carpet. A little heavier than I thought it would be, but will sacrifice that for the extra power. Stands on its own. Have not had a problem with overheating, since it doesn't take much to vacuum my floor space. Cannot be used on scatter rugs since the suction is so great. Would definitely recommend.
