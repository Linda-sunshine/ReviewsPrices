review/summary: an instant favoritereview/text: This is an excellent piece of cookware for 30 bucks. I had considered a carbon steel wok, but wasn't ready for the maintenance. I had considered a more expensive clad stainless steel stir fry pan, but this Cuisinart Chef's Classic was just so much cheaper. Luckily, it works great even though it's only clad on the bottom. And because of its simple construction, the pan is surprisingly lightweight even for someone with a small build as myself. It is surprisingly nimble to hold. I love being able to just pile my ingredients in the pan and not worry about them overflowing or even splattering. I do heed other customers' warnings about the glass lid, so if I use the lid I always keep it slightly ajar to let steam escape.I have been a big fan of Cuisinart's Multiclad Pro line, and while the Chef's Classic line is just a step below it, it's very good value for the money.
