review/summary: COFFEE EVERYWHEREreview/text: I used this product for about 13 months before it expired because the outlet for the grounds clogged (don't remember reading a caution about that in the manual) There did not seem to be any way to clean out the interior...I would have thought some maintenance would be necessary. The most annoying feature of this grinder is that it is absolutely impossible to grind the beans and remove the grounds from the receptacle without coffee flying everywhere. I had been operating it in the sink in an attempt to minimize cleanup. I am glad it is gone!
