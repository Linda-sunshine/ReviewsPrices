review/summary: Great so farreview/text: Bought the BJE510XL for my wife for XMas 2012. Have used it several times every week since then and we are very happy with it. Makes great juices and is very easy to clean afterwards. We bought a cheaper juicer a few years ago and we barely used it. Bottom line, you get what you pay for and the BJE510XL is worth every penny.
