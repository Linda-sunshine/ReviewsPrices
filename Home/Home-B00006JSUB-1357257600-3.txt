review/summary: Can't beat Lodge cast iron cookwarereview/text: I found my 15 inch skillet for sale at a flea market for next to nothing. I bought it on a whim not really ending it but have used it quite a bit more than I expected. A friend saw it and had been wanting one so I got them one for Christmas, they love it and use it frequently. They have a large family to cook for and the large pan suits their needs. Lodge also has a 17 inch pan but the jump in price makes it hard to justify.Since Lodge still makes their cookware in the USA it's the only brand to consider buying. Except for a waffle iron, sadly Lodge doesn't make one.
