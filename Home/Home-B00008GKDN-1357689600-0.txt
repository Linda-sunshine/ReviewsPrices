review/summary: Cast Iron goodnessreview/text: I enjoy camping with the family and we prefer the cast iron for cooking despite the usual weight they add to the packouts. So far this one is great. Just have to remember after cleaning and drying to rub a little oil over it for storing so they don't rust. Following directions often helps...that's what happened to our last skillet.
