review/summary: Quiet and Warmreview/text: I put this under my desk to warm my legs and feet while I do work on my computer. I like that it's more like an intense sun lamp than a heater that blows out hot air. It has two settings: 400W and 800W. I use it at the 400W setting with the heater about a foot/foot and a half away from my legs and that works out pretty well for me. If you use it at the 800W setting, it's probably best to put it about 2-3 feet away from you. Be careful not to put it in a narrow space because it can get pretty warm and you don't want to heat up your furniture. I have a table for a desk so there isn't much furniture/wood/plastic that it can heat up and destroy if I put the heater underneath.
