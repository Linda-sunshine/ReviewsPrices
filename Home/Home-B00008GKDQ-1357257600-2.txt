review/summary: I wanted to like itreview/text: but it just didn't work well. The heating was very inconsistent from one end to the next. It was even inconsistent within a 8 inch radius on the griddle. Made it very difficult to make pancakes. Half of the pancake would be cooked and the other half would be completely uncooked. Broke down and bought a plug in griddle last month.
