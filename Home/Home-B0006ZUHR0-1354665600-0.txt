review/summary: Awesome Steam!review/text: Great iron. The reviews on this one are correct. This is much better than the Rowenta we had. It starting leaking several months ago and one night in a fit of rage with it and the soaked ironing board a I bought this based on the great reviews. They were correct. My only complaints are that the water cup to fill it up is very cheap and has too small an opening to easily use with the fridge. I like to use filtered water in the iron. Also it is kinda annoying that is does not go to the last setting used. All my stuff is cotton so I always use maximum heat/steam. When you turn it on it defaults to the lowest setting and you have to cycle up to the preferred heat setting. Overall though it is a great iron.
