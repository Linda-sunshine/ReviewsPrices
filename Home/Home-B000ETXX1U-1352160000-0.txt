review/summary: Dreview/text: For the short term, this bed is wonderful. It really holds air well, and it's very comfortable to sleep on.I specify short term because after almost exactly 2 months, I came home to find there was a small hole in the inner chamber. For the next week I waged war on this mattress, patching it in a variety of methods, but the hole size/quantity kept increasing. As the outer chamber was still solid, the effect was that over the course of the night, I would sink to the floor in the middle while being surrounded by the outer chamber.Kind of felt like a hammock. But not in a good way.For 2 months it was totally worth the purchase, as I wasn't ready to invest in a mattress. Happy I bought this, and had no qualms with throwing it away when finished.If you buy you'll probably want to try king size sheets after it's stretched out a little, because queen size doesn't fit too well post-expansion.
