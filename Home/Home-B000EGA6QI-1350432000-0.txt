review/summary: deceiving photoreview/text: I did a search for cordless Cuisinart hand blenders and found this....hand blender with great reviews. Looking at the photos, I see no chords. I buy the blender; open it up & it has a cord. I go back to Amazon & double check what I purchased & yes, Photoshop has made the cord disappear.
