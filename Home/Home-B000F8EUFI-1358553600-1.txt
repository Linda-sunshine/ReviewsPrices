review/summary: Terrible qualityreview/text: This vacuum died after just 2 uses. It began to give off a strong burning smell and wouldn't suck dust anymore. It's also impossible to push smoothly on thick carpet. That's the last time I spend any money on a Dirt Devil product. Glad I could get a refund though.
