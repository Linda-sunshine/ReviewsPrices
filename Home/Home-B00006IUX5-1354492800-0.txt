review/summary: Cheap Grinderreview/text: Pros: This grinder is cheap, at only $13.99, and it looked like it could hold about a cup of grounds.Cons: This grinder is a piece of crap; the on/off mechanism is the smallest, cheapest piece of plastic I've ever seen, it will definitely be breaking soon. It doesn't hold enough coffee either; it holds less than a cup of coffee (needed for brewing a 1/2 gallon of coffee).Would not purchase again.
