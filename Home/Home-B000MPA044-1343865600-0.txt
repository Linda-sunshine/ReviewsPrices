review/summary: Fast, safe and easy!review/text: This is my second purchase of this item as I was so impressed I purchased another as a gift. The recipes are good and easy to follow. The instruction book could have been written a bit better but I find that most instruction booklets are lacking a bit so I will not ding the actual product for this shortcoming.Pressure cookers of old scare me a bit. Heard war stories and never realy took to them. These electronic high/low pressure cookers take the guess work out and are not only easy to use but versatile as well. As a quick example I made a delicious pulled barbeque pork dish recently. Bought some pork shoulder and made slices which I browned in the cooker on the browning setting. Then added the onion, brown sugar etc into the mix and set the high pressure cooker for 45 minutes and let the pressure release naturally. All I had to do was set it to high pressure, set the timer and press start. The cooker notified me when the HP cooking was complete then I just waited for the pressure indicater to drop so I knew the cooker was no longer under pressure before taking the lid off. Once removed everything was cooked perfectly and just needed to remove some excess liquid and add the barbeque sauce and cook for a few more minutes per the instructions. Perfect and delicious! So easy because eaverything was prepared using the cooker and the non stick is exceptional! I highly recommend!
