review/summary: Love itreview/text: I love this juicer so much, I just bought one for my mother. Cleanup is surprisingly easy, the blades are sharp, pulp is pretty dry (an important indicator of juicer quality), and the nozzle mouth is big enough for a whole tomato. If you're looking for a well priced, well working juicer, this is the one.
