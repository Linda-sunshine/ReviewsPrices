review/summary: Huge, Comfortable, Affordable - I Sleep Like a Babyreview/text: I had an allergic reaction to my old mattress for some reason and have been sleeping on an air mattress since Christmas. From the beginning, I had difficulty with it. It had several holes and I'd wake up in odd positions and had difficulty getting out of the bed in the morning. Later on, the seam in the middle busted and it looked like one of those air castles you see at children's parties.I wanted to get a Liberator Zeppelin, but I ended up discovering my room might be too small. (It's a round bed.)I ordered this because it was the number one air mattress in the category and the price was right. I was scared the queen would be too big but figured I'd make it work - and I did. I LOVE THIS BED.Pros:- Not too heavy: this bed wasn't too heavy to get up the stairs. I was able to get it up a long flight of stairs by myself.- Built in air pump: You will not lose your air mattress pump because it's built into the air mattress and it's easy to use- HUGE: this is a full queen size bed, and it's raised high enough to feel like a real bed. You won't need to do awkward reverse downward dog positions to get out of bed in the morning. and I'm 5'4", so the bed really has a lot of room and space for me.. and all the stuff i throw on the foot of my bed when i enter my room- Comfortable: I literally slept like a baby the first few nights. it is heaven compared to most air mattressesCons:- color: it's like a hunter green. I don't care but you can't choose the colors, so if you're picky about your color palettes and interior design, plan around this or have a means to cover it- two air mattress pumps, and it's confusing which one you need to keep the bed firm
