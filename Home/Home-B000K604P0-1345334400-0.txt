review/summary: Best water bottle ever!review/text: I've tried numerous water bottles, looking for the perfect one. I finally found it with the Thermos Nissan! Very impressed. It is a perfect size, not too big or too small like most water bottles. The liquid flows out perfectly without having to suck it out of a straw or spill all over. And, it maintains temperature better than any standard water bottle. I can put a couple of ice cubes in the bottle and they'll still be there ten hours later. I highly recommend these bottles.
