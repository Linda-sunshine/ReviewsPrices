review/summary: I love my R2 Unitreview/text: I live in a WWII-era studio with hardwood floors that for some reason, is a dust manufacturer. I have had this thing for a few months, and had to clean the charcoal filter one time ( I just vacuumed it off with a dust buster, reset the filter-check light, and no problems).I have some mean allergies and snore like it is my job. With this thing on all day and all night, the white noise drowns out most neighborly sounds, the filter helps me breathe AND sleep, simultaneously, and I barely have to dust my apartment. WIN, WIN, WIN.However, I did spend the first month trying to figure out how to cover up that blue LED.Initially, I had duct taped an old potholder over it, but realized it was high time for a more sophisticated approach. This guy's instructions (Nathan Pullen from Sept 21, 2008 review) were right on, I snipped the LED right off, put the panel back on, and have been in business since.
