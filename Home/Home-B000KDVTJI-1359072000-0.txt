review/summary: Very fast and convenient!!review/text: Heats up VERY fast and automatically shuts off when done. The fact that it's cordless too is icing on the cake. We had an old corded kettle and that thing was a pain to pour. But this one is perfect. Easy to clean too.A kettle with a dock. Doesn't get any better than that.
