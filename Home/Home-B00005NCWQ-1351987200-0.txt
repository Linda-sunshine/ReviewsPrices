review/summary: Great percolator. Built to lastreview/text: I purchased this percolator (and an electric version by Presto) after searching high and low for a decent cup of homemade coffee. I tried the fancy french press and was not impressed. Drip machines produced the same boring cup and the Keurig would get the coffee hot enough (and cost a fortune in pods). I finally came across this Farberware stove top percolator. The coffee is delicious and the unit in nice and heavy. Definitely built to last. The only down side is the pot must be watched. Once the water boils you need to turn down the heat then time the percolation. I bought an electric percolator for the days when I don't have the time to hang out by the stove and love it as well.
