review/summary: Does the job quietlyreview/text: In the first week or so of using this my house was very dry and I ran the unit on full blast, refilling the tanks almost constantly, etc. Now I refill every few days and keep the fan on low so I barely notice the noise. My skin is much happier with me and my furniture seems to be less dry. It definitely does its job.I've had lower back surgery and found the tanks to be slightly too heavy for me to pick up safely when filled to the brim. I fill them each about 2/3 full. I doubt most people would have this problem, but it's an easy fix if you do.
