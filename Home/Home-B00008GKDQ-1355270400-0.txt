review/summary: perfect!review/text: This is exactly what I needed. I had been using an electric griddle for years but was worried about the chemicals from the nonstick surface leaching into my food. Other griddles were so expensive, I didn't want to pay the price to find out if I liked cast iron. THis is perfect. It was a great price and works fabulously..who needs expensive models?!
