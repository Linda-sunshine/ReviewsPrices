review/summary: Excellent spice grinder.review/text: I use this grinder only for spices, so I cannot comment on how well it works with coffee (I use a burr grinder for coffee), but as a spice fanatic, I can say that this is easily the best small spice grinder I've ever used, especially for the price.I put A LOT of wear and tear on this: grinding hard chips of Vietnamese cassia, freshly toasted spices at ~300 degrees Fahrenheit, oily spices that gum up the works. Against all advice, I also (very carefully) wash the metal interior grinding dish under soap and water. The plastic cup has dozens of hairline fractures from splintering due to blazing hot spices fresh off a toasting pan and it's stained yellow from turmeric and annato, but, even after two years of heavy duty use, it hasn't broken or leaked in the slightest bit.The only problem: occasionally, some ground spices clot around the lower gasket connecting the blade to the appliance, and the blade will stall. I just manually turn the blade a bit until it comes unstuck - it usually takes minimal pressure - and then turn the grinder on with nothing in it to loosen up all the particles. It's worked every time.Long story short, if you want a reliable electric spice grinder, this is invaluable, and it's dirt cheap for the amount of use you can get out of it.
