review/summary: Excellent!review/text: Amazon you rock! This is a great juicer; powerful, compact and easy to clean. I'm a newbie at juicing and I didn't want to spend a lot of money in a juicer so I bought the Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Juice Extractor 67650, this unit came defective(on/off switch was loose and didn't turn on)so I returned it and replaced it with this one. I was very desapointed with the Hamilton because I purchased all my ingredients for two juice receipes prior to checking the juicer and then discovered the fault. But Amazon exchange was amazingly fast, in less than a week I had my new juicer and was still able to use the vegetables and fruit. This is my first juicer and I'm in love! I deceided to spend a little more $$ and get better quality and I got that with Breville. Thanks Amazon!!!
