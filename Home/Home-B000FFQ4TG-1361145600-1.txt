review/summary: Bunn quality is no longer the samereview/text: Like many other reviewers, I have had Bunn coffeemakers for years and love them. That quick pot of coffee had no match. When it was time to buy a new one, I just couldn't believe all the negative feedback and decided to take a chance. This was Bunn! Well, I wish I had listened to the reviews. When folks said the coffee started brewing and dripping immediately, I didn't realize they meant that it started before the lid was closed (in previous versions, closing the lid started the brewing process. With this model, if you don't pour the water and get the pot under the drip FAST, you have coffee dripping before the pot is in place. What a pain! And the new carafe is impossible to pour without spilling. It also seems the quality of the housing of the machine is much lower. I'm so disappointed to be saying goodbye to Bunn.
