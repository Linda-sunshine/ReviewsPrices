review/summary: The good and the badreview/text: The good:-Nice size-Cleans air - fresh feeling/smelling air - ionizer must be working-Nice looking filter unit - cleanable/reusableThe Bad:-pushing air through small vent holes makes quite a bit of noise, even on low setting. I would not describe it as 'quiet'.-volume of air pushed is not substantial.-Ionizer power indicator light is a bright green light - Bright enough to be annoying when you sleep and I can see the light through my eyelids during sleep; had to put some tape over it.-Unit became defective after 3 days - fan was making a whirring noise which increased. Sounded like out of balance fan or defective fan mount.
