review/summary: Absolute Best Coffee Maker Everreview/text: I have been using the Faberware perculator since I was old enough to drink coffee, and to be clear, this is the first replacement I've ever had to buy for it so that should be a testament to the percolator's durability.This new model brews the coffee much more quickly than the older models. The coffee that it produces is smooth and rich. If you're an enviromentalist, you'll appreciate that this coffee machine uses no paper filters or any other disposable elements. It's all washable steel.Using a percolator vs. the Keuring or other traditional coffee machines is a bit more involved, but for the quality of the coffee, it's well worth the extra few minutes. My one and only gripe about the percolator is that when I have company over, it doesn't hold enough coffee for a full house - however, there is a larger version of this pot so if you frequently have company over, or if you have more than 3 people vying for a cup of coffee in the morning, go with the larger model.This is a durable, and relatively inexpensive machine that brews the best cup of coffe I've ever had. I highly, highly recommend it to anyone who drinks coffee.
