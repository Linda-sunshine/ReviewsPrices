review/summary: We use it every dayreview/text: I had some misgivings about this product based on the range of reviews - the same misgivings I have whenever I shop for small kitchen appliances. How well a product performs seems to have a lot to do with what kind of a day they were having at the Third World factory when it was made. You can get a good one or you can get junk.The Mr. Coffee coffee maker we bought in 2006 had the same kind of mixed reviews as the Presto 16-inch electric skillet but it's still working perfectly after nearly daily use six years later.My wife is giving the Presto electric skillet a real workout and hardly uses her electric cooktop range since it arrived.She loves the large cooking area and the precise controls and is particularly pleased with the ease of cleanup of the non-stick surface.So far, it looks like we rolled the dice and got one of the good ones.
