review/summary: I love my Brita Pitcher!review/text: It has been a few years since I have used a Brita Water Filter Pitcher and I enjoy having a Brita for my primary water source instead of lugging Water Mart 3-gallon jugs up and down a second floor apartment. Since our four-legged companion and I are the only ones drinking Brita Filtered water, the size of this pitcher is just perfect. Unlike some reviewers, I have had no problems with a loose lid when pouring water from the pitcher to a glass or the dog's water bowl. I plan ahead and refill before I need the water and am careful not to over-fill so when the water has finished filtering, the water level is not higher than the top of the filter reservoir. I appreciate the 8 week reminder to change filters (I ordered extra) and I even like the apple green color I chose. It was packaged extremely well and arrived in tip-top condition and within the promised delivery date.
