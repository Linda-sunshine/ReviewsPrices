review/summary: Can't live without onereview/text: I love fresh, hot coffee, but as a teacher, I seldom get to drink more than one cup in any 3 hours stretch. I bought a basic Keurig like this in 2009, and loved it so much I got the platinum one soon after, relegating this one to the teachers lounge. It is still going.The platinum one has had much lighter usage, as I have it at home. It has started to leak, however, so I have just bought this one to replace it.
