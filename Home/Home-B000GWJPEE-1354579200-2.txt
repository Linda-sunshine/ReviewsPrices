review/summary: Penguin Humidifierreview/text: This is the second Crane penguin humidifier I've owned. The first one worked great for a couple of years until this spring when one of my kids dropped it. I just received the new one I ordered from Amazon. For the first couple of hours it worked great, but by morning it had stopped working, was surrounded in a puddle of warm water and the clear blue plastic had fractures in it. I just sent it back and will not be ordering a new one due to so many bad reviews.
