review/summary: finally!review/text: We have been using another humidifier in our bedroom running it on high 24/7 and haven't felt a bit of moisture in the air. We wanted to try a new one that would work a little better, the air is so dry here and we have a baby on the way. I filled this one up and as per directions (for the first two hours), turned it on high with max water output... our entire house, for the FIRST time felt humid! I am so excited! I can't comment on the lasting qualities of this humidifier yet, but I can say it WORKS!
