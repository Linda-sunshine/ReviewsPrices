review/summary: WOW!review/text: After going thru many expensive Keurig coffee makers, I decided to go the inexpensive route. Let me tell you I'm happy I did! This Brew & Go is perfect! Depending on the morning, I use 1 or 2 scoops of coffee, add water, presto! It's that easy. Don't hesitate to get this.
