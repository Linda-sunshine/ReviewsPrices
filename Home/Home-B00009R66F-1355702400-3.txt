review/summary: Not rigid, durable, good for couple of month.review/text: I own this VAC for a bout 1.5 years, so the history is simple,- good for 4 month, then start falling a part, motor that spinning brushes went out, then locking switch got broken.I noticed couple of design flaws, the plastic suction cover has splitter which collects all the moisture, which is getting stuck on those splitters,In general I feel that I wasted money on this device, so I guess this device should run about 80$, for that quality,I ended up baying German brand which will last me for long, but the price tag as twice as much +.
