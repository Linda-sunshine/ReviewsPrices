review/summary: Better than I ever thought!review/text: So I was originally turned onto this product by a friend who has a presto salad shooter from 20 years ago...still going strong for her today. I had looked at it and decided that I would go for a kitchen aid attachment instead, due to the small storage space we have for our kitchen. However, after reading all the reviews about the kitchen aid shredder attachment, I read the reviews for the presto and found that more people had success and long term enjoyment out of the salad shooter. I thought, what the heck, so I bought the salad shooter and I LOVE IT!!! It is perfect and does NOT take up any more room than the shredder attachment would have....plus it is fast and I mean FAST!!! Not enough love can be expressed for this product! If you have to buy a machine for shredding or chopping...this is your best bet...and it is easy to clean...enjoy! I know I am!
