review/summary: Amazing!review/text: Wow, I am totally impressed with how well this machine cleaned our carpet. I'm ashamed to admit that in the four years we'd lived in our home we had never had the carpets professionally cleaned and you could definitely tell. With two toddlers running around, our main living room carpet wasn't looking so good. After cleaning the carpets, the carpets almost look brand new. We used the Hoover carpet cleaner and are very pleased with the performance and how quickly the stains disappeared. I did spot treat the carpet before with Folex (and there were a lot of small spots) and now the spots are gone. My husband operated the machine and it took us about an hour to clean our large living room! I'm excited to use this steamer in the rest of our home!
