review/summary: Strange little machinereview/text: I bought the Presto Pizzaz because of the extreme hot weather that's been plaguing the Midwest and didn't want to heat up our kitchen. The excellent reviews given it by Amazon customers made it a no brainier and I knew that if I wasn't pleased with it I could easily return it for a refund.The fact is I couldn't be more pleased with it. So far I've used it for baking thin crust frozen pizza, toasted cheese sandwiches and frozen pretzels. The results were every bit as good as in our convection range. Th Presto Pizzaz is a bit clunky and looks rather unstable but it does the job in less time than the above mentioned convection range. Another point in it's favor is because it doesn't usually make a mess as some times happens in the oven. The counter is far easier to clean up than the oven. I probably won't use it as much in the cooler weather as we generally bake more than one pizza at a time and the Presto Pizzaz only holds one twelve inch pizza at time.In closing I would highly reccomend the Presto Pizzaz to anyone who might not have a regular oven range or anyone who may not want to heat up their kitchen to bake one pizza.
