review/summary: Don't buy this. It will only last 1 year.review/text: We got this electric teakettle for our wedding gift and we loved it at first. It's nice looking and worked well. But I kid you not, it just stopped working for absolutely no reason, and we are JUST outside our 1 year warranty on the thing. Almost like there is some hidden mechanism inside to break as soon as the limited warranty is up. We wrote to the company and they offered a discount on a replacement. Seriously, the thing is brand new. Don't spend the money on this one. Just buy a cheap one, that way if it breaks at least you didn't spend that much.
