review/summary: Comfortable Insta-Bedreview/text: The best part about this bed is the fact that you don't have to crawl onto the floor to get out of bed. Because of the height after the bed is inflated, you are able to plant your feet firmly to stand up. The inflation/deflation time is a bit longer than most air beds at about 5 minutes for each. I would suggest buying a deep pocket mattress pad to add a little more comfort to the bed. You can also adjust the inner channel of the bed seperately for additional firmness if needed. Overall, it is a good product.
