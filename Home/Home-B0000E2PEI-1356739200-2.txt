review/summary: Best one ever!review/text: We've had a number of bathroom scales and have never been pleased with any. About a month ago we spent a few nights at the St Regis hotel in Houston and this scale was in the bathroom Not only does is look sharp, but the thing I really like about it is that it is consistant. Our former one would gain or lose four pounds just getting on or off of it. The only thing I would want to improve on this is the read out. It really needs a built in light to show the numbers better. Other than that, this is the best ever. Highly recommend.
