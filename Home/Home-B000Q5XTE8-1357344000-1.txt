review/summary: This chair is fckin awesome.review/text: I love how you can extend the arms. The chair is also very easy to get into the proper height, back angle, and lower seat position. I love this damn thing. In my old chair, I would be uncomfortable and hurting not even 5 minutes into sitting on it. In this one, I can sit for long periods of time, and I don't even feel a thing. I love it---great for when you have long projects due, or gaming.I'm 5'4 if that helps anyone out.
