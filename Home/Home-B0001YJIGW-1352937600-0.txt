review/summary: Franky, surprised. Very good quality.review/text: I bought this on a whim thinking that if it didn't work it wasn't that much money just to try it. Well, I was wrong. It works like a charm. There's a hole in the side that you can position at the height desired so you will still have overflow protection. This was great for me because my overflow drain is much lower in the tub than I would like. Not only does this allow me to get a higher water level, the water seems to stay warmer longer. Not sure why that is; perhaps the absence of the draining? In any event, a very good purchase that does exactly what it advertises.Also, I really like that there are many small suction cups all around the rim. It gives a nice tight fit but makes it easier to remove for cleaning. It was a cinch to install. I simply dipped the rim in a bit of water to wet the suction cups, put it in place and pressed around the edges to push each suction cup. Took less than a minute and was completely secured.
