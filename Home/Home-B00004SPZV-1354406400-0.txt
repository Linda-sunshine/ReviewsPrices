review/summary: Great alternative to cooking sprayreview/text: I was getting leery of the propellants and other additives in the &#34;olive oil&#34; cooking sprays. Plus, I didn't like the taste. I had recently started using cooking spray to reduce the amount of oil I was using for cooking. The Misto is perfect for getting a small amount of oil on the food that you are cooking. the spray is not as perfect as the cooking spray cans, but the difference is worth it to not have the additives in the oil. Just remember to release the pressure after each use.
