review/summary: The best! except...review/text: My original review said: These are the softest, warmest, most snuggly sheets ever. I absolutely love them. They are a very subtle shade of green, a little more pastel than I had anticipated, but still very pretty. They are the only sheets I own that easily fit over my tall mattress plus a feather bed on top.Three weeks later, that's still true, except that after two washings, the color is fading away in spots. Lots of spots, and they're yellow. It started with the first washing, and after a few more washings, they'll look tie-dyed. So they're great for me, but I'll never be able to put them on a guest bed.I bought a camel-colored set for my boyfriend two years ago, and he hasn't had this problem, so maybe this is only with the sage green. I will buy a cream-colored set because they are so wonderfully soft and warm, and I assume that color can't change much.
