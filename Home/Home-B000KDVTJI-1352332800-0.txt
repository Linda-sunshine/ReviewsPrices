review/summary: Worst kettle I've ever seenreview/text: The water filter is awful in this kettle. It is so badly designed that it is hard to believe that it can be done to kettle.The filter is attached inside of the kettle, right on the kettle nozzle. It is flimsy piece of plastic which will hardly filter anything except stones? You will think what a bid deal, just get rid of it and use filtered water. Yeah I tried that. Be ready not everybody can come with such "productive" idea. With no filter kettle will never turn off. So basically you have the first class fire hazard in your home, ready to trash your furniture before fire by producing tones of steam. I would want to look into eyes of engineer designed this piece of junk. Another option to patiently check filter each refill and place it back to its place at the nozzle. Good luck with that! If you do not have tiny little hands it is hard even to get inside. And when you do this you will be surprised how this filter even holds on. The edges which supposed to be place to attach it so tiny and uneven that it is really hard task and no surprise that it falls off all the time.I give it one star because it is real FIRE HAZARD, and it is not acceptable for your kitchen appliances.
