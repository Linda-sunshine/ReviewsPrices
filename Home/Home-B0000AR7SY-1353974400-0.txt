review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I was very excited to be replacing my old Krups burr grinder as I never could get a fine enough grind for espresso. Based on the reviews of this machine I was hopeful. Sorry to say that I am finding that even at the finest setting, I do not get a powder. Nothing even close to espresso let alone Turkish.Otherwise it seems like a well made grinder. For drip or French Press coffee it does the job quietly, cleanly and consistently. Just not going to help me with my espresso issue.
