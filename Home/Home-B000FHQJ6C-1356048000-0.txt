review/summary: good little juicerreview/text: i give this three stars - only for the reason, that I've never used another -and it performs as stated. easy to clean, easy to work - even the kids like this. there is a special cleaning brush for the wire basket...it's basically a smaller dish brush...don't be intimidated ...dishwasher safe, its a good little juicer.
