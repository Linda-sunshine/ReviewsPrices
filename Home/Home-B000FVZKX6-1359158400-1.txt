review/summary: Soft and warmreview/text: Recently moved from California to Tennessee and the cold winter was starting to get to me. These sheets are so soft and warm (but not hot), that I can no longer complain about the cold at night. I love these, especially for the price. Way better pricing than sheets of similar quality from vendors who specialize in this type of product.
