review/summary: Great coffee when used as directed..review/text: Presto Percolator..brews a great cup of coffee.Others have written a negative review, I will relate the negative experience to user error..People really need to read the owners manual, if you find yourself with grounds in the coffee then grind your coffee for a percolator, or use a filter like the owners manual says. Problem solvedCold coffee?? leave it plugged in.. (face-palm)..problem solved.Just maybe this is too complex for the simple minded.Carry on...
