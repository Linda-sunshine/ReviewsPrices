review/summary: Coffee in a snapreview/text: After reading about different Keurig makes and models, I asked my husband for the B40 Elite Brewing System for Christmas. I really could not be happier with my gift! Within 10 minutes of removing it from the box, I was enjoying a fresh, hot cup of coffee.Pros:- Setup is extremely easy. You literally pull it out of the box, wash and fill the water reservoir, and plug in.- The selection of coffee, tea, and other beverage Kcups available is large, and seems to be growing every day.- The newest update to the B40 Elite Brewing System has added a third cup sizeCons:- Price. This is definitely not the most cost efficient way to make a cup of coffee. Of course the price will vary depending on what brand of coffee you buy and in what quantity.- This is definitely not the most environmentally sensitive product out there. All of those little plastic K cups eventually end up in a landfill somewhere. However, you *can* buy reusable cups and use your own coffee. Doing this also helps cut down on the expense factor as well.My biggest problem now is that it makes it too easy for me to drink more coffee than I should!
