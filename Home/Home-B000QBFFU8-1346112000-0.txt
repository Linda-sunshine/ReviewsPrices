review/summary: Best balance in a Juicer!review/text: I love this juicer! I have owned several others including other Brevilles and this one by far has the best overall design. Great interface, and they fixed many flaws of other models minimizing fragments of pulp thrown into the juice at high speed. Try to stick to the slower speeds if possible for best results.
