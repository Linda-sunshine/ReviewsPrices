review/summary: great openerreview/text: I wish I hadn't waited this long to buy a replacement can opener. Every single time I use this, I appreciate its smooth and easy operation and the way it holds onto heavy cans (example - large cans of pumpkin). It looks sleek yet unobtrusive on the counter, doesn't take much space and is an absolute pleasure to use. I've used other electric openers before but this works the best, easy to clean and I have no complaints or criticisms at all.
