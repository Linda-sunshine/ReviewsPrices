review/summary: great for the pricereview/text: I do love cast iron and I love that Lodge products are made in the USA. My dutch over did come with some small rust stains on it, but fixed it. It feels like the inside of the dutch oven is sort of rough. When I try to rub some oil on the inside with a paper towel...the towel fibers get left behind because it's so rough. I'm thinking of reseasoning it . I was thinking if I ever had to buy another one, that I might by the ones that are enameled.
