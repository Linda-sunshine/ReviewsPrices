review/summary: I now search for recipes that require a dutch oven!review/text: I use this dutch oven for soups and jams mostly. It's sturdy, distributes heat evenly, cleans easily, and creates an overall sense of sturdiness as I saute, stir, and simmer. I've also used it for a pork roast and it did a great job going from range to oven. I'm so happy with this piece at $50 that I can't imagine how/why one would spend hundreds on the high-end brands.
