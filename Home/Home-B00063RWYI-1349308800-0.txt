review/summary: Great product especially for the price!review/text: This dutch oven works great! I bought this mainly to make basic no-knead bread and the bread turned out awesome! It seems to be of great quality, it's pretty hefty and heavy. I like how it comes pre-seasoned and ready to use. Also, it's such a great value compared to other dutch ovens. I'm sure this dutch oven will last a long time.
