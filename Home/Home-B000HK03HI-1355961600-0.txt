review/summary: YES! A can opener that works!review/text: Love it.After being frustrated with crappy can openers (notably including the Kitchen Aid one priced similarly to this), I did the online research thing and ordered one of these. It so far lives up to its billing. Can't yet comment on durability, but I am optimistic.BTW, as I was bound and determined to get me a good *#$% can opener, I also ordered the OXO one. That also works very well. For now I'd give a slight edge to the Zyliss based on the clever locking mechanism.
