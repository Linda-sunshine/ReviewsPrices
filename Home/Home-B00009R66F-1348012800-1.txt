review/summary: Hoover SteamVacreview/text: I bought this cleaner and received it very fast. I did not use it right away and my husband asked if I was ever going to use it? Well, today was the day and what have I been waiting for? This cleaner works great. I had a really dirty carpet and for the first use, it cleaned great! I did not use the spot cleaner or anything else for the real bad spots just the cleaner that came with the steam/vac. I will probably clean it again in about a month and see if gets any cleaner. This is a good product and works like it is advertised. Don't be afraid to use it!
