review/summary: Absoulutely Awesome!review/text: I bought this Keurig Model in the Summer and it was the best purchase ever! My husband and I love coffee and this brewer really delivers! If you like strong, good coffee like I do, do not be afraid to purchase this coffee maker. It all depends on the coffee you buy--there are tons of varieties of Keurig coffees available in the supermarket for every coffee taste. Here in S.F., CA. where I live we have access to some great local organic blends made to fit a keurig. I used to use a French Press but this is dynamite. No clean up! The coffee is hot but not too hot. It is quick! Easy to use--I am not that great with coffee makers in general but this was so easy to use. We use it every day and it works great every time. Also, you can brew tea--and it comes out great. You can also brew herbal teas--and they are terrific. And, of course hot chocolate--very nice! My only other love that i have is the Nespresso Espresso machine which I also love, love! (Definitely invest in one!) But seriously, I was skeptical about this machine--but after I got it I could not believe how I ever lived without it. If you love coffee and you like variety, convenience, instant gratification and easy to no cleanup--then this is the machine for you! You will never go to starbucks again. Also, I highly recommend the Nespresso steamed Milk frother --it is also absolutely awesome. So, if you want great, easy coffee--this is it!
