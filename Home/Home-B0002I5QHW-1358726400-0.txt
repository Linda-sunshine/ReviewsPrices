review/summary: Sausage grinderreview/text: Used this one time since I received it. Ground up 5 lbs of turkey breast for sausage. Used the course grinder first and the fine one second. It worked great. I cut up the turkey into 1&#34; to 2&#34; pieces & I had no problems at all. I took it apart to wash it, which was easy. Glad I got it.
