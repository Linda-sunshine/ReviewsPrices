review/summary: Love it!review/text: I have been looking for a coffee pot that had both form and function,I found that with the Presto 12 cup Stainless steel coffee maker. Brews a pot in 6-10 minutes keeps it hot until you are ready to pour. Has no plastic that comes in contact with either the coffee or your water to leach potentially hazardous chemicals into your drink. And of course fills the entire house with that wonderful aroma of fresh brewed coffee,you just don't get that with an auto-drip. :)
