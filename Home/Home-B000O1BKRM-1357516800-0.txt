review/summary: Nice idea but doesn't workreview/text: These ice cube trays make a really nice sized I e cube, but I have extreme difficulty getting the ice cubes out of the trays. The third time I used them one of my fingers actually started to bleed. Now the company says that mineral build up will cause the cubes to stick...ok ...but the stuck like they were glued in the first time I used them. This time however I didn't fill the trays to the top, and when the water froze it expanded and made a ridge around the top of each cube...ok...my error. The second time I used them I filled them to the brim, the ice cubes still stuck ,Ike they were glued in....washed the trays more carefully and tried a third time, filling the trays to the brim, and the cubes still stuck, making my finger tip very cold and sore. I have stopped using these trays, the silicon in these trays does not appear to be a good grade of silicon, silicon is normally slippery, these trays are not s,I papery.
