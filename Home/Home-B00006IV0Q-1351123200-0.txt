review/summary: Gave as gift. Recipient loves it. Very hot coffee!review/text: I purchased the Presto 02811 12-Cup Stainless Steel Coffee Maker as a gift, and the recipient loves it. The only problem with the item is that the plastic handle was broken/cracked on the first one that was delivered. However, Amazon quickly sent a replacement. Within two days, the broken item was picked up from the recipient's home and a new one was delivered. While I have not used the percolator, the recipient says that it feels very sturdy, of good quality, and makes very hot coffee -- and keeps it that way. Finally, the large 12-cup size is nice for occasions when you have company. While you may make as few as four cups of coffee with this percolator, it is nice and convenient to have the option to make more if needed.
