review/summary: Awesome appliance! Should be standard in everybody's kitchen!review/text: I love my Cuisinart CPC-600 pressure cooker! It is so easy to use, and clean up is a breeze! I bought it a couple years ago (just now getting around to doing a review!), and it still works excellent; I try to use it once or twice every other week, but planning to us it much more often. I've made quite a few meals with it; chicken tacos (with boneless chicken breast), and they came out moist and delicious; easy to shred too! Porcupine meatballs are melt-in-your-mouth yummy! This is also great for legumes (pinto beans) and rice dishes. I plan to experiment with desserts very soon!
