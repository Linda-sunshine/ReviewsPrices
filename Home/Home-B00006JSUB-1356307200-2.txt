review/summary: Very good skilletreview/text: This is a really good skillet to cook and and when it comes to iron skillets you cannot go wrong in cooking healthy too. The only thing with this skillet is that its extremely heavy and not for someone who has issues with dealing with heavy stuff around the kitchen. Given that its cast iron and good quality, I am not surprised that its heavy..but it does cook what it says..cooks extremely well and easy to clean as well. Packaging and shipping was awesome as always..
