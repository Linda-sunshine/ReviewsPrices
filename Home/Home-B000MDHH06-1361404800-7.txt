review/summary: Oh My, changed my life.review/text: I use it almost every day. I find it super easy to take apart and clean. Can beat the price. The best part is, it fits under my cabinets so I can leave it on the counter. So you know, if you can leave it on the counter, it's easier to use and you'd use it more offten. The only problem I have, is that the chute for the veggies is directly over the juicing basket. That spining motion creates quite a force, so I've ocassionally had leaves and broccolie bits fill back up and out when adding more veg, but that is a really minor issue. Just be prepare to keep your hand over the whole.The mouth of the chute is also super wide, so you can easily fit whole apples, pears, bell pepper halves, and easier 4-6 carrots in.I just love it. Can say enough great things.
