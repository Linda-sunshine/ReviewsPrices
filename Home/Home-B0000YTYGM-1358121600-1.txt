review/summary: Just quit working for no reason I can seereview/text: Had this coffeemaker, used every day for one pot of coffee in morning, for six months and it just stopped working. I don't know why and I can't fix it. And as long as I am complaining about it, I will say the lid is somewhat of a challenge. Have to make sure it is put on right or coffee and grounds all over. I could've lived with that because once you got used to it all was well. I hate that I payed $90 for a coffee pot that only worked for six months. But, I like buying from Amazon, it is not their fault that this Cuisinart Coffeemaker is not a good one. I never had any other Cuisinart Appliances, large or small and surely won't buy another after this. I replaced this with a percolator, no more coffee messes in the morning. I should've listened to all the reviews, but no not me. I could figure out how to put a lid on : ))))). Also, the little red ball stopped working. I learned to "listen" to the reviews and decided not to get another thermal pot. I think they all had a lid issue, but at least they kept working.
