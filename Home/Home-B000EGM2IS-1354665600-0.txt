review/summary: Sunbeam Hot Shot How Water Dispenserreview/text: I had one of these for at least 10 years and it finally died on me. As soon as it did, I immediately ordered another one. If you want hot water fast, this is the item you want to use for it. You can use it for coffee, tea or to even sterilize an item. You can use this for anything that requires hot boiling water,i.e. jello, bouillon cubes, etc.You won't be disappointed.
