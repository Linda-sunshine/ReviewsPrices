review/summary: Totally worth itreview/text: I just got this last week, and far I have very pleased with this product. Boil water really quick, and I dont really find much "plastic" smell in my tea.Also, I just love the auto shut off, because that mean I dont have to stand in front to watch it anymore. If there is one thing to imporve, I think they should make a long cord. The one that comes with it is like 2 feet long. I am looking forward to see if this will last.But, for just 10 bucks, you just cant beat the price.
