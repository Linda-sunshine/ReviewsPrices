review/summary: Pleasantly Suprised!review/text: I just had to write this review for anybody considering this machine. I ordered the b40 thinking it only had two brew size options 7.25 and 9.25 ounces, yet lo and behold when i unboxed this little beauty it had a third brew size as well for 5.25 oz! I'm guessing they included this for the latest ones they manufactured for this model. This is a great bit of info to know about this machine especially since its still advertised here as only having two brew sizes. I was pleasantly surprised to say the least, and i had to share this with everybody who wants a keurig but is shelling out more money on a more expensive model for the extra brew size. Not to mention this baby makes some delicious gourmet coffee! This is one great machine and i highly recommend it.
