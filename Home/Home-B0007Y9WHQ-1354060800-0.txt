review/summary: So Cool!review/text: I love this product! OMG I can make little carrot swirlies and zucchini noodles! It's also super easy to clean since the whole thing is made out of plastic you can just run it through the water in the sink. I haven't tried to put it in the dishwasher, I probably wouldn't do that. The blades require a brush to get the food out, but that's easy.Speaking of the blades, there is a cute little drawer built in where you can store the two that aren't in the unit.I just love this thing, and I can't believe how inexpensive it was.Get it NOW before they raise the price!
