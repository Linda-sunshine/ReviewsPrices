review/summary: Good job cleaning dirty carpetreview/text: It performed perfectly at the first use, and after a little studying of the instruction manual, was easy to use. Reading the manual is essential, in order to know how to clean it after use. The components do take a bit of time to dry after use, and it may not be as intense a cleaning as with a service, but you can clean so much more often that in the long run, you cannot beat it!
