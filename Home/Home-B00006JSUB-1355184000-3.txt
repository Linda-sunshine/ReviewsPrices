review/summary: So many words.......review/text: There are so many words to describe this pan but I am going to make it simple........AWESOME....Bacon and eggs for the maiden voyage and all went well......less than a tablespoon of lard and not one sticky situation....Will never touch Teflon again!Clean-up was less than 5 mins and 2 1/2 of those were just me admiring my nice new pan!Coated it in oil ...let it cool a bit.....and put it away and it is ready for tomorrow..........
