review/summary: I just don't get it...review/text: Couldn't wait to get this vacuum and my husband beat me to opening and trying it out. He said, "I just don't get it". When you turn on the vacuum and lower it to the ground to pick up the dust, the exhaust (located at the bottom) blows all the stuff away as you move it. So you end up sweeping the dirt again, only to have it happen again. There's no way around it. The cord isn't long enough to be able to vacuum a sofa. There's more, but it's really not worth it. It's being returned and I feel let down by my Amazon ratings...first time EVER my choice was wrong.
