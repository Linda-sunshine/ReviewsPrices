review/summary: Very effective for grinding seeds and dried herbs into a fine powder!review/text: I'm glad I purchased this grinder, it is much more effective for seeds like sesame seeds and chia seeds than the food processor. It grinds them into a fine powder quickly and easily. I can also use this to grind whole dried herbs, like rehmannia and drynaria, into fine powder. The only drawback is it's hard to clean, since it can't be submerged.
