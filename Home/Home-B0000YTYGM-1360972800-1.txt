review/summary: Cuisinart Thermal Coffeemakerreview/text: I knew I had had it awhile and we make coffee 365 days a year ...... you do realize until it goes out that you do not have a backup. We had this very same coffeemake for about 7 years and my husband said he wanted the very same one. So I went straight to Amazon that morning (after no coffee) and found it and 4 days later we were back happy again. We love the timer and that we can take the thermal pot into any room that we may be working, reading or watching television and take it with us. It will stay at the original temp at least 4-5 hours (if the coffee lasts that long). The coffee is great whether you make 3 cups or all 12. Obviously would recommend the purchase.
