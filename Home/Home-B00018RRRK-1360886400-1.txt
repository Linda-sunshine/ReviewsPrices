review/summary: Broke Second Usereview/text: Having used a Krups blade grinder for about 3 years, I was looking forward to the increased volume that this unit seemed to offer. I usually grind 3 lbs of coffee at a time (make enough pods for a month) and the Krups did a good job but was slowwwwwwwww. This unit is apparently only for light daily use. On my second use the motor has apparently burned out. No use sending it back under warranty since the cost of shipping and insurance will be more than I paid for it. I also use French Roast coffee which is very oily and it does tend to gum up the burr grinder. Well, back to the Krups!!
