review/summary: Amazon Customerrreview/text: I have been using this little six cup Presto electric percolator for about ten months. It makes consistently good, hot coffee. It can also sit for a couple of hours without tasting old, it's very handy for making just one mug of coffee, and it's easy to clean. I was replacing a more expensive pot that soon made only warm coffee. I'm very glad I chose this one because I like my coffee hot.
