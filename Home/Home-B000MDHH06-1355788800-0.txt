review/summary: Powerful & Awesomereview/text: This juicer is powerful and awesome. I recently bought several BluePrint Cleanse juices and was hooked, thus I decided to buy a juicer and try my own recipes. What a great idea, and what a nice juicer! Have made green juices, fruit juices, and root juices so far. I highly recommend the Breville Compact Juice Fountain. I remember using a juicer of my dad's back in the '90s... this juicer is way better. Love it.
