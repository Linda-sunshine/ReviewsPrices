review/summary: Nice blending but risk of shearing plastic gearreview/text: I purchased this product at Amazon, March 7, 2011 and only used it for soup about 10 times before it failed February 3, 2013 while still under warranty. The plastic gear teeth in the drive shaft seems to have sheared off or worn down. Therefore I ordered another one today since pleased with it while it worked. The one star ratings for this product also list the plastic gear failure for their reason. I still bought the product again because it blends well and quickly.The newer version may reduce the plastic gear failure with a slower speed but I don't know if it kept the same plastic gear or replaced it with a slip mechanism when the blade hits a carrot in the soup mix that is not soft enough. The plastic gear may be part of the design so it shears off before your thumb does. So I gave this product two thumbs up because I have both of them. Then two more stars because it blends well.There is a 3 year limited warranty on this unit and I haven't attempted to get it fixed yet since need another right away. Perhaps they'll send some replacement gears that can be dropped in as needed. My Sears rototiller has shear pins so when I hit a rock the blades stop spinning but the product is still usable after I replace the shear pins. If that is the case for this product then I'll up the rating to 5 stars when I get the replacement shear gear and it works again.I'll have two of the same unit if I get the broken one fixed. We'll see.
