review/summary: Too Small For Mereview/text: This seems like a fine coffee grinder for most people, but for me the grinding chamber was too small. I grind six large tablespoons of beans for each pot. Though it ground the coffee fine, the coffee spilled out when I transferred it for brewing. Amazon accepted my return without question.
