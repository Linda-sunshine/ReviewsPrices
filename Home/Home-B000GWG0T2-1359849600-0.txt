review/summary: Works great, a bit large for mereview/text: A great large nonstick pan. I wish we had a cover big enough to fit it. If I could do it again I might get a slightly smaller one. This one is bigger than the size of a large dinner plate, which can make it hard to turn certain dishes out for serving.
