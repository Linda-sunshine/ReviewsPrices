review/summary: Okay productreview/text: I got it very quickly, which was good. I've used it a lot since I purchased it, but already there is something wrong with it. The lighted on/off lever used to switch completely off, but now it's like it takes an intermediate step and slipe in between being on and off. Seems dangerous unless I'm aware of where it is in the heating cycle.
