review/summary: Does what it's supposed to do!review/text: After spending $50 on a air purifier the only thing to ask is wither it cleans the air $50 better. I think it does. It's basically a good sized vacuum cleaner that has a good filter on it. I put it on a rolling stand maybe 3 feet off the ground and put it in the middle of my 10x12 bed room. Usually set it to low setting with ioziner and i think it was worth the $50. My room always seemed pretty dusty (could see dust particles in sunlight) and maybe it got 60% less dusty in my observation. Oh and side note i ran it with a energy estimator and it says it would cost $50 in energy costs a year for california rates. Dunno what the estimator bases that on (hours per day) but i'm sure its a average best guess figure.
