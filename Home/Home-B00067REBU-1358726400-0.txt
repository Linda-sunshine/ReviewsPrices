review/summary: Nice machinereview/text: This is only the second bread machine I have owned in 15-20 years and I have already used the Sunbeam more than my previous one. It is a solid, quiet, and easy bread maker to use. I have to tweak the recipes in the book because of my altitude, but they all seem ok. I really love the dough setting for cinnamon rolls that are amazing!!!! I would absolutely recommend this machine.
