review/summary: Three Strikes Your Out!!review/text: Farberware is not what it used to be. We recently had to retire our third Farberware percolator. On average, they last just over a year. Enough is enough!!!No willing to further perpetuate the cycle with another piece of junk that will fail just after the warranty expires, I decided to contact Farberware. I was seeking to get my hands on a few thermostats so that I can repair the pot once a year as needed. Long story short, Farberware isn't backing their product.I decided to seek out a vintage percolator when they were manufactured in the USA and were a quality product. I hit the thrift stores. If found a Dominion unit that show much wear from years of hard use. Considering the price of four dollars, I was willing to take a gamble.After a thorough cleaning, the think works perfectly. This thing is years old and obviously has some miles on it, but it "still" works flawlessly.They just don't make'em like they used to!!!! It's a shame that i have to buy used these days to find quality. I would much rather buy new if I though I would get the mileage out of it.Long story short, avoid this one. There are better options out there. It's had a weak link for some time, Farberware knows it, yet they don't fix it.As a wise old woman once told me, "poor people can't afford cheap stuff". I love the wisdom of that statement!!!
