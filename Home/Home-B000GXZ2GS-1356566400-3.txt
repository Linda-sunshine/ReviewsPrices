review/summary: Iced espresso!!!review/text: The areopress is amazing!It is simple to use, takes up almost no space, and makes amazing coffee.Iced coffee (unless cold-brewed) is treble watered down coffee.A double shot of espresso chilled by brewing your coffee with the areopress over your cup of ice doesn't add extra water; it melts the only the ice that you put in the cup making a fantastic cold coffee drink.If you buy this only to make Iced espresso in the summer you really can't make a better choice.
