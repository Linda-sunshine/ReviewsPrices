review/summary: Woo-hoo! This has changed my life!review/text: I love, love, love this juicer! It is well-priced, sturdy, powerful, fast, and SO easy to clean! I bought this because I wanted to try juicing but didn't want to spend tons of money in case I lost interest quickly... and after I read lots of reviews, both on Amazon and juicing websites.Even though most places suggest that you can't get a great juicer for under $200-300, I bought this because of the low price, the more compact size, and the fact that all of the parts are dishwasher safe. First, it ROCKS when it comes to making juice. From the first try (two apples and three stalks of celery) I was hooked! YUM! (For those wanting to juice for health or weight loss, I've only been using this for two weeks, juicing 1-2 times a day and having regular meals the other times. I have definitely cut down on calories, and have lost 5 pounds... but the other things I'm seeing are amazing. I'm clear-headed and never get tired during the day, and my skin is luminous. (Can you say that about your own skin? Yes, apparently - I just did.)And then I cleaned it... and (I am not kidding) it doesn't even take 5 minutes to hand wash each piece. I don't even want to put it in the dishwasher, even though I can! I recommend cleaning it immediately so that it doesn't discolor from the fruits and vegetables. (Tip: The basket is easiest to clean if you brush it around the outside while running it under water. Cleaning brush is included!)Bravo, Breville! Nice product. You are my hero.
