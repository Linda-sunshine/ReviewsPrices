review/summary: Best EVER!review/text: I have been canning for as long as I can remember. Peaches presessed the old fashioned way with Gramma at 5 years old. :) I'm now canning for my own family. Spending harvest time from 4:30 till bed time processing. This is just the best canner ever, seriously! It let's me double stack and process so much at once. The waterbath/steam option is so helpfull and fast. I just can't give enough praise. I never fear this thing blowing up a speople often warn. I feel safe useing it. I can't immagine ever even looking back at all theyears wasted without this baby. So far it has processed 1 bushel of pears, 4 of apples, and I can't even count all the veggies! My options are endless. No more cooking apples before canning the hard way. This thing is big enough to throw enough apples in there to cook, I'm just amazed, keeps me busy all day. It is one fast cooker, I'll tell you that. I can't wait to toss a roast or whole chicken in it! I'm so happy. :) It even qualified for the free shipping option. Cheapest place with no dought to get it! And the shipping way fast! I made the wrong purchase and the cs was great about letting me cancel and purchse this one. Thanks amazon family!Sarah. &lt;3
