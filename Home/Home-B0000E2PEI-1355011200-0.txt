review/summary: Overall a pretty decent quality scalereview/text: The ratings for this product seem to be all over the place so I was a little worried when I ordered it, which I eventually did seeing that the general consensus was that it was decent. Luckily, I was not disappointed! The scale does tend to vary about a pound or two max (in my experience) but no scale can be completely accurate all the time. It'll definitely serve most uses and it looks pretty sleek too!
