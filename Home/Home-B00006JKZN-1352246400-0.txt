review/summary: Great Waffle Maker, with a Couple of Flawsreview/text: I've used this about once a week for several months.Likes:* It makes great waffles. Better than the restaurant ones, much better than frozen, better than other waffle makers I have tried.* Although the cooking surfaces are not removable, it is easy to clean. Any leftover waffle can be wiped off with a damp cloth.* It's easy to use and heats up quickly* I like the fact that it is adjustable. The waffle maker I owned before only had one setting.Dislikes* It becomes VERY hot on the outside. The maker I had before would get very warm, but you could still touch it. The outside of this will fry your hands if you touch it. I've accidently burned myself twice now. Not something you want to use where kids might touch it. To me this is the unit's big flaw.* A light indicates that the waffle is done. That means you have to watch it if you do not want overdone waffles. If you don't take the waffle out quickly after the light changes, the waffle may be overcooked. I think they should also have an audible tone, a bell or beep, so you can do other stuff when it is cooking, rather than watching for the light to change.Despite some gripes I really like this appliance and use it a lot. I recommend it, just be careful of the heat issue.
