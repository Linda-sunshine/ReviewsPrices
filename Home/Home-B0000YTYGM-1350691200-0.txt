review/summary: From 4 star to a 5 starreview/text: I would have rated the Cuisinart a 4 star rating until I had problems with it and contacted Cuisinart about getting it replaced and they directed me to go on line at Amazon to have it replaced. I did and got a new one in two days with very little efford on my part. This says a lot about a company, any body can sell you something, it's when you have a problem with your purchase and how they resolve it. That moved them to a 5 star rating for Amazon and Cuisinart.
