review/summary: Good productreview/text: I had been using a Brita Pitcher for 2 years and decided to get this one because of the large size and the tap like interface.One big advantage I've noticed with this filter is that you do not need to lift/tilt the filter. With the Brita Pitcher I had to wait for the water in the upper compartment to be filtered before I could start pouring filtered water.No more waiting now :)On the flip side - initially I thought the taste of the water to be rather odd, in fact even a bit nasty. But after a month of using it, it got normal. I don't know what to make of it since I never had any issues with the new Brita filters.Dec 2012 update: Just changed the filter a week back. I can now confirm that a new Pur filter does add an odd taste to the water which goes away after some days. I did soak the filter for the recommended time, etc. So, while the dispenser is awesome I think the Brita filters are better.
