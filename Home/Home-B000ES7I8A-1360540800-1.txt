review/summary: Can't pour without dribbling!review/text: On the bright side, this product is stainless steel, no plastic inside, & electric.The problem with this kettle is that it dribbles all down the machine and onto the floor (and your shoes) no matter how fast or slow you try to pour due to a terrible spout. AWFUL. The problem is that the spout area is thick and wide. Usually spouts are very thin and come to an edge. Think of it as the difference between water shooting off a gutter vs. spilling over a bathtub. This is just bad design. I returned it after trying to deal with it for 2 weeks. Gave it a good chance!
