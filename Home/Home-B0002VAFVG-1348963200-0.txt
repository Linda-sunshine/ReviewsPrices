review/summary: This is a Monsterreview/text: I love this thing. I have been juicing for a few months now and this thing has outperformed in every way. First off, I do not know about the debate about pressing versus centrifugal juicing and I don't care, I am putting more fruits and veggies into my body than I ever have.In terms of cleaning the device, yes, it takes a bit of time to clean but I think all juicers do. After some practice, this one is easy to clean, I rinse it immediately after preparing my juice while I'm drinking the juice. Every now and then I put it in the dishwasher.In terms of noise, yes it is a bit loud but not louder than any of my other appliances like my vacuum cleaner, blender or chopper. Given the amount of power this thing has I'm willing to live with the noise level. The power is noticeable in the amount of liquid left in the pulp: NONE. The pulp is dry.A few things I have learned to make my juicing life quicker and more sustainable: Organic carrots (just brush with vegetable brush), apple corer, use the vegetable brush for the filter (larger and quicker then the supplied brush). A few more observations... use a plastic bag in the receptor, this makes one thing less to clean. Only once did this juicer vibrate weirdly, I guess somehow the parts where not pieced together correctly. I also suspect if the juicer is not placed on an even level, then it will vibrate weirdly.And the best thing is that my 3-year old son is helping me juice. He thinks it is the "jet engine" from Thomas and Friends. He puts fruits and vegetables into the chute. And he even takes a sip or two of the juice!
