review/summary: Great coffeereview/text: Perked coffee is great! I have loved it for years but now it's out of style! People have settled for drip coffee from a plastic contraption that doesn't last makes coffee that is not hot enough and takes up to much counter space. I love my farberware stovetop coffee maker!!!!! I have tried farberwares electric coffee pot but the electric part didn't last. So back to stovetop and I couldn't be happier!!!!
