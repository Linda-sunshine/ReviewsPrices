review/summary: Great feelreview/text: Relatively new to cooking, but numerous online sources told me this was the knife to get. The plastic handle feels a bit cheap, but the blade is what you're paying for here. Can't say much more, but if reddit's cooking subreddit likes it, it's good enough for me.
