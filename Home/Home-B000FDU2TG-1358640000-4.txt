review/summary: Nut comes losereview/text: So, when I bought this blender I did a lot of research because I want to make copy kat recipes of starbucks that I dream up. Everything was going pretty good for the first month, then I noticed that it was leaking majorly around where the blade is screwed into the base of the jar. I found the jar for $25 but I don't want to spend 25% of what I spent on the blender on just the jar and the same thing happen in a few months. I love KitchenAid and have always trusted them to sell durable products, however no more. Do NOT buy this blender. Find another, you might have to pay more then $100, but it's worth it.
