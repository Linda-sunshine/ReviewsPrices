review/summary: Like resting your head on a bag of cement.review/text: I'm not even trying to be funny. I read about these micro bead pillows and it sounded interesting. So I ordered it and tried to sleep on it and it was too hard by a long shot. It is even too hard to sit on, never mind rest your head on. If you are looking for something with absolutely zero give then this might be for you. Not even suitable for camping.
