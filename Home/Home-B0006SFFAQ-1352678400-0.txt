review/summary: 12 years and still tickingreview/text: I bought this coffemaker in March of 2000. I loved it then and I love it now. After 12 years, it is still making coffee the way I like it at the right temperature. I bought another Cuisinart coffee maker when Linnens'n Things went bankrupt, in case this one would die, but at this rate I will probably never get to use it; it will rust in the closet.
