review/summary: Faulty Switchreview/text: Like other reviews, the product worked well for about 4 months then the on/off switch broke. You press and press but it does not click. Now I have to press and hold and wait for my water to get heated. I just went back to using my microwave.Update: I tried Aroma AWK 11S as well. It took about 3min 23 seconds to heat 8oz of water where as Sunbeam actually did the job in less than 2 mins. If only the on/off switch was better designed.
