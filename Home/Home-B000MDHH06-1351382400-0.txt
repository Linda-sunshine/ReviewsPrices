review/summary: Great reasonably priced juicer! But...review/text: This is a great juicer for the price, it does what it's supposed to do. Unfortunately it doesn't always do it great. Lots of time I purees the fruits or veggies and you don't get much juice from them. What I've taken to doing is re-juicing the pulp probably about 3 times. So while it works great, it's a lot of work! Don't let the title of it being compact fool you, this is a pretty good size appliance.So if I could go back and purchase a juicer again, I would probably try and invest a bit more money so I could buy one that works more efficiently. If you are on a budget as I was when I purchased it and have the patience and time to re-juice the pulp, it works great.
