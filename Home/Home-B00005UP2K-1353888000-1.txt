review/summary: My best friendreview/text: I love my KitchenAid mixer! I was already quite the baker, and truthfully at first I was not that excited about using this when I bought it two Christmases ago... if you're used to doing things by hand you have to re-learn how to bake by sight since your hands won't be in the batter anymore. I joke that now I just assist the mixer. You also have to be careful because since it mixes much faster than even a hand mixer you can really over-do it very quickly. But, after I used it a few times I really came to love using my KitchenAid and I use it all the time. It is especially great for things that were hard to mix like bread dough and frosting, we even make gnocchi in it. We got the ice cream maker attachment and homemade ice cream is AMAZING.
