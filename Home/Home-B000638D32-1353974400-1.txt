review/summary: Great knife at a great pricereview/text: I purchased this knife due to a rating in one of my cookbooks. I received the knife, and to my surprise, it was remarkably sharp. It holds its edge well, and once it does dull up, sharpens easily. I have not had any issues with rusting, but I hand wash it and don't let if sit in the sink for days at a time. I'm very happy with this knife and now wish I would have purchased the whole set right away.
