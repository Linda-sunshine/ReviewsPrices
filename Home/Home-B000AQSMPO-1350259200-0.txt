review/summary: Ack!review/text: We did buy this machine at Costco, not Amazon, but it has never worked well. Every once in awhile we must descale (code for "hard water issue"?) and it is a pain. When it does work, it does not function appropriately. We should probably have returned it immediately, and with Amazon's wonderful customer service we now know to buy future items from them.
