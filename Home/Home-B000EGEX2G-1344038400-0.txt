review/summary: Did not last...review/text: We bought this glider pending the birth of our second child. It seemed good enough when we first got it, but within a month or so, we had one of the springs from the cushion popping off repeatedly. We removed it from the bottom since it wouldn't stay in place. About six months later, a second spring did the same thing. Today, about 11 months after purchase, one of the rods that holds the gliding mechanism in place came out from the holder and the whole thing is now trash. When you open it, the rod slides into a groove that is surrounded by six ball bearings housed in a flimsy casing (thickness of thin-gauge wire) and a very thin ring surrounding that. Both of these looked like they had been chewed on by a dog. Very disappointed that it didn't even last a year. Buy at your own risk.
