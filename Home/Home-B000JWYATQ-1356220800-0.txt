review/summary: The absolutely worst bedding ever!review/text: The fabric is the same as the sacks that in the 50's held chicken mash (chicken food) from the feed and grain store. No amount of laundering or wear will ever soften this coarse and rough cotton enough to make it comfortable to sleep on. They are not a true white, but more an ivory and made to "resemble" a popular striped sheet you find at local stores and even hotels. I was astounded that such a poor textile was still in use much less sold as bedding.I took a leap of faith in the 90's and used my credit card to buy books through the Internet on the site known as Amazon. Now many years later after having purchased probably hundreds of products,this will be my first return. I think the consumer and Amazon have been deceived.
