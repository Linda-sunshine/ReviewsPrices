review/summary: It stopped working in less than a yearreview/text: I loved this grinder when I first got it. I have been using it at least once a week to grind almonds. It did a much better job than the food processor I used before. It ground much finer and faster than the food processor.A few days ago the blades stopped spinning when I added more than four or five almonds to the grinder. With such few almonds it only spun them around; it did not break them. So the grinder is now useless.The window for returning this item to Amazon has expired. So I'm buying another brand of grinder. I don't recommend his particular brand and model.
