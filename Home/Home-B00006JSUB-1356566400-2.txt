review/summary: It's a love/hate relationshipreview/text: Love: after seasoned, I could cook anything in it without sticking! Easy to take care of. Just wash with hot water, without soap. Dry with a towel and spray some cooking spray on it before putting it away.Hate: So HEAVY! I can't lift it with one hand with that tiny handle, even worse when there is food in there! I know it's cast iron, I know, I know.....It makes stove top to oven cooking method quite challenging.
