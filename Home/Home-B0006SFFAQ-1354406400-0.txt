review/summary: Great Coffeemaker....best I have owned thus far !review/text: This is our second unit. Our original unit failed after 5 years of daily (heavy sometimes 3x daily) use. Always provided excellent morning coffee. Always used premium whole bean ground just before brewing. Use with Gold mesh strainer & charcoal filters. Love my new unit. Highly recommend this machine. Excellent price & delivery. Thanks.
