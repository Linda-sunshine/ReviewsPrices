review/summary: I use it every day in every way stovetop and ovenreview/text: I have looked for a nice cast iron skillet and went to Amazon and found this deal. I read the reviews and chose the Lodge Logic 12 inch pan. Easy to use and care for and should last a lifetime. Make sure you follow the directions to keep it in tip top shape
