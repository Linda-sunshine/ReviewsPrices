review/summary: Micro Bead Pillowreview/text: This pillow is harder than I expected and is uncomfortable for sleeping. for the past 6-7 years I've slept on a water-filled pillow which I prefer. I wanted to try a different pillow and after reading the mostly positive reviews on Amazon about the Micro Bead,I decided to try it. I will continue to use it for now thinking it might loosen up a bit and conform more to my body. If it doesn't I will go back to the water filled pillow.
