review/summary: why it stoped working.review/text: My 4 cup Mr Coffee is not the clock model, I bought mine about 6 years ago to put in my Motor Home. I really didn't use it much, 8 or 10 times a year, until a couple of years ago, when I got rid of the MH and I brought the 4 cup into my home to use instead of a 12 cup brewer.The 4 cup is really a 2 cup, who uses an 8 ounce coffee cup?After over 2 full years of using it every morning, it stopped working, right in the middle of the second cup.I was about to throw it away but instead, took the bottom off and found 2 fuses, soldered across the bottom of the heating element. One fuse was open (burnt out). These are special fuses (NEC SF214E). Replaced the fuse and it's been brewing great coffee once again, for the past couple of weeks now.I have no idea why someone would need a clock to brew with this type of brewer. I takes about 5 minutes to brew the first cup. It takes the toaster longer to toast then that 1st cup to drop down.
