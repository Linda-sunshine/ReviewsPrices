review/summary: Quiet, effective, and cute to boot!review/text: I moved to the desert and was tired of waking up with my nose feeling all weird, so I started looking for a humidifier. This one, amusingly, was cheaper than the equivalent "adult" one so I decided to give it a shot, and I haven't been disappointed.- It's quite quiet (there's an occasional blurp of water, but never enough to wake me up or disturb me while I'm reading)- It's quite reasonably priced (I paid just over $30, compared with $40ish for humidifiers not shaped like penguins)- It does the job of keeping my bedroom humid (no more raw nose in the morning!)- It's not too annoying to fill (there's even a handle hidden under the penguin head to make it easier to carry the resevoir)- It looks like an absurdly adorable fire-breathing penguin (at least until I adjust the humidity metre so it's at the recommended levels. Also, if you don't like the penguin thing, the head is removable.)I wouldn't have expected a humidifier to make me smile, but this thing has totally exceeded expectations!
