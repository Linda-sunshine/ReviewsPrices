review/summary: Good hand held vacuum.review/text: I bought this for our camper. This is a powerful but loud little vacuum. The cord is long and the attachment is very nice. It does get a little heavy if I'm attempting to vacuum large areas. Its great on the couches and beds. Love the brush which can can turn on or off. Easy to clean.
