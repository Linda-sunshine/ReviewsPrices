review/summary: Great coffee pot...well worth the moneyreview/text: As an avid coffee drinker I have had many different types of coffee pots over the years. I finally decided to spend the extra money and get a pot that was sturdy and functional. I love this programmable coffeemaker an would recommend it to anyone who likes good coffee, served hot and ready quickly.
