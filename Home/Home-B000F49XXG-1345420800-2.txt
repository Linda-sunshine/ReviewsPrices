review/summary: Not bad for the money, but has some annoying featuresreview/text: I bought this espresso machine after a trip to Italy, where I fell in love with espressos. I bought this machine to have the convenience of espresso-making at home, and overall, it does what it has to do: makes great-tasting espressos at a reasonable price. However, this machine does have some pretty annoying aspects to it, so beware. First, when it is making espresso, it vibrates rather hard and loud, making it hard for me to make espressos while my people in my apartment are sleeping, as well as causing the small espresso cup to move out of place. So you have to hold the little espresso cup in place or you'll have the espresso drip miss its mark. Second, the machine drips on well after it's been turned off, which gets a bit messy. All in all, the annoyances are not such a big deal, but I would have spent some extra money to get a machine that doesn't drip past the shut off point and doesn't vibrate so darn much and so loud.
