review/summary: An Amazing Juicer For An Amazing Pricereview/text: It's really easy to use and to clean. They give you a brush with a handle part that fits perfectly to clean out the extra gunk and the brush helps clean out the strainer part of the juicer. If you don't like apple cider I feel that it's better to carve the apple first. The juicer does remove most of the skin, but it doesn't get all of it.When you make juices that contain bananas, try to only use half of 1/4 of the banana because it is very present in taste.
