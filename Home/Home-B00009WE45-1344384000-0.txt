review/summary: Dead batteryreview/text: Item arrived promptly, but with a dead battery. After going to the drug store to get another one (grrr), the battery compartment was quite a challenge to put back together. It took my wife and I a good 10 minutes trying to jigger it back in. Granted, it works and takes the temperature, but next time I'll purchase a different brand.
