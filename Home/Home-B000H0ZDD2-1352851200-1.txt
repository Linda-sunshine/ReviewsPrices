review/summary: Awesome product!review/text: Bought this for our camper. We've had alot of sweating around ceiling corners, especially in the bath/bedroom area and slideouts. Damprid just wasn't working enough. We've never used an electric dehumidifier before so we were skeptical, but this little guy really works! It is quiet enough, small enough to sit discreetly on the dresser, and pulls enough moisture to fill the reservior every 6-7 days!! Now that I know how good it works I wish i'd gone with a larger one!
