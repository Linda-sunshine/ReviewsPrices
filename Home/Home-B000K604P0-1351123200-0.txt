review/summary: So good I bought it 3 timesreview/text: I love this thermos so much I bought it 3 times. Each time I lost it (left it on an airplane, on a train somewhere), I would go back to amazon and hit 'buy'. It keeps coffee hot for a long time and cold drinks icy too. I thought it was indestructible but alas, it is not. After bringing it to the desert (yes, I brought it camping in the desert- it's that good), the latch broke. Total bummer. Anyway, buy this thing. It's the best coffee thermos on the market and trust me, I've tried them all.
