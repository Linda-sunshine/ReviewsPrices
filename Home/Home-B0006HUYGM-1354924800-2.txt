review/summary: Cool for what it isreview/text: It's cool and works exactly as described. It's not going to move mountains but it's plenty powerful. The vent placement is extremely annoying and often ends up blowing away the stuff you're trying to vacuum. Takes a little getting used to.I give it 4 stars for what it is, the price and the quality. However, if you're thinking of getting the dyson because it's cordless, powerful and has a ton of tools, don't be cheap and get the Dyson. I should have done the same. That being said, this will get good use.
