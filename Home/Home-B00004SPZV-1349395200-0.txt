review/summary: Not just for use in the kitchenreview/text: Bought a 2-pack at Costco for under $19 and I couldn't be more pleased. First off, they are aesthetically beautiful. My set came w/a brushed aluminum and a gorgeous metallic eggplant color. They also make a metallic olive green. Be sure to follow the directions and resist the temptation to over-fill. As others have mentioned, you'll be surprised at how long such a small amount of oil lasts before having to refill it. The nozzle does get clogged every so often, but it's not a major problem as it's instantly solvable by rubbing the dispenser hole w/a piece of paper towel. I keep one of my Misto sprayers filled w/grape seed oil in the refrigerator for cooking purposes, and the other one I've filled w/my rose water facial toner which I mist over my face and neck after cleansing. It feels so light and refreshing; a much better misting experience than what I was using previously (an ordinary plastic spray bottle). If you're going to use it for that, my advice would be to just hold your breath a bit while you're spraying because of the aerosol action, and don't hold the nozzle too close to your face of course. I love this product equally for both cooking AND cosmetic purposes! Oh, and I've heard of other people putting vinegar in it, but personally I wouldn't (just because vinegar has a distinct smell that you probably wouldn't want sprayed about). But truth be told, you can use it for whatever you wish!
