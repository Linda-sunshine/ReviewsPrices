review/summary: A Good Coffee Makerreview/text: This makes coffee and it does it well and it has not broken after about a month of usage. I like that it's not very big. It makes enough coffee for two people's coffee mugs to be filled up almost all the way, or for three people's mugs to be filled up about two thirds of the way. If you want to save space and you don't have a lot of coffee drinkers in your house then this one might be for you!
