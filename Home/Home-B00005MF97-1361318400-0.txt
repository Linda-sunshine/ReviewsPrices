review/summary: broke quicklyreview/text: i LOVE this chopper. I had the same one for a couple of years, but ordered a new one after wear and tear. The new one was the same, but broke in two places within the first couple weeks of use. There is a crack in the bottom and the metal piece that holds the blade broke out as well. Still works. Still use it. Wish it were a little more durable.
