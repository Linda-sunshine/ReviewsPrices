review/summary: Excellent for the Pricereview/text: When I was looking for a Juicer I search and wide for the best one for the best price. I have a Consumer Reports account. This juicer was only a few points be hide the the top end juicer that cost a few hundred dollars. I have had this one for over a year and nothing seems to have broken or worn down yet. The blades still are sharp and the motor is running well.Pros: Reliable motor. Sharp blades, big loading mouth, and a large pulp collector.Neg: notable amount of pulp remaining in juice (I cannot compare to other juicers).
