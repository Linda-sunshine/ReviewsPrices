review/summary: I Recommend this productreview/text: Works out of the box, no assembly, no complicated anything. It has a timer, auto on/off temp thermastat, on/off oscillating fan, various heat settings, comes w/remote, and it's attractive. I especially like the timer, so i don't have to worry about nightowls forgetting to turn it off. It's fairly quiet, and you do hear the fan once the TV is off; the timer gives peace of mind. The warnings are to plug directly into an outlet; i wish the cord were longer, and it warns that it could discolor a wood floor, so i put it on a large ceramic tile, which matches the unit and it looks nice. I have it in a large room (apprx. 25X30) so it takes a while to warm the room, but it does the job.
