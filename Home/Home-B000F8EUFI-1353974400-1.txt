review/summary: its ok but there are betterreview/text: it works, its powerful...if you just want to vacuum the floors and not use the extending "arm" this is a great vacuum....but the vacuum tube that you use with the brush etc is reallyyyy short. I could't vacuum the top of the bed without having to pick up the whole thing because it would't reach. I would not recommend this, there are better ones out there.
