review/summary: good but not superbreview/text: We bought this after using a cheap $10 rice cooker for years. I can't say that the quality of rice is any better, and it does seem to take a long time to cook. My daughter loves the little song it plays at beginning and end though. The timing and other features work well, though we rarely use them. It makes good rice, just not anything special as far as I can tell. We eat rice just about every day.
