review/summary: Great product!review/text: I ordered this last week from Amazon, it was delivered quickly. However, when I was opening the package, broken pieces of the pulp container fell onto the floor. I packed it back up into the package and went right online to Amazon to request a replacement and planned to ship the broken one back the next day. Before I even got to UPS to drop off the juicer, I received an email from Amazon that my replacement had shipped! I received the juicer today and it is in perfect condition. I am new to juicing and was excited to try it out. I had spent the last few weeks debating on whether or not to purchase one. I had done a lot of research on juicers that were affordable. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a product I was afraid I wouldn't like but still wanted something reliable and durable. So after seeing a lot of positive reviews for this juicer, I decided to go ahead and buy this one. This evening I made my first juice and while it seems to be an acquired taste, I think juicing will benefit my health greatly. I even made some for my 17-year-old son, He agreed that while it tasted weird, it wasn't bad and drank it up. I purchased this item with the Juice Bible and the book has tons of information on fruits, vegetables, recipes you can use for the pulp and loads of information on overall juicing benefits. I am looking forward to making more juices with this and so far, I am glad I purchased this. I am also truly happy with Amazon. I've always loved purchasing items from them but this was the first time replacing an item and was quite impressed with their speedy customer service.
