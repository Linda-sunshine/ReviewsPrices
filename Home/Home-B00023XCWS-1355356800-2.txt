review/summary: Like it a lot!review/text: I like this water heater very much, I bought it a while back because I wanted to have water available to drink hot tea in the cold days, but I didn't want to wake up and wait for the water to boil.I pour water, turn it on and then in a few minutes the water is ready. I use it a lot to make jello, it's just easy to keep the water warm and just reheat as I need, as opposed to running back and forth to the stove and keep it boiling.
