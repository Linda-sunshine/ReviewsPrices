review/summary: Wonderfully warm and soft!review/text: You can trust me on this one. I have to be the pickiest person when it comes to my sheets. I spare no expense. These sheets aremore than I would have expected. They fit my tempurpedic mattress perfectly. I hate sheets that fit loosly. These fit snugly and don't come off the mattress or get wrinkled on the bed. They are soft and warm!. I live in the northeast and it get cold. I have these sheets, vinton plush blanket from amazon and my light weight quilt on my bed and Stay toasty warm. I took my electric blanket off of my bed! Don't pass these up!!
