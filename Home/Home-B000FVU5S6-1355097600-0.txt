review/summary: like sandpaperreview/text: I bought these sheets a few years ago and loved them--softest, best quality sheets ever for the price. So when my bottom sheet wore out decided to buy the same sheets--sadly as many reviewers have noted they are NOT soft. They felt smooth when I took them out of the package but they actually got rougher after washing instead of softer! They had a terrible chemical smell --so I washed them several times before even trying them--added Bac-out odor remover, and vinegar to the rinse, and natural fabric softener. Tried them last night and felt like I was on sandpaper!There is no way these could be the same fabric as before. The good reviews must all be from before they changed(in fact I think I may have given them a good review a few years ago!) I am going to return them--I might try a few more washes but with the 30 day return limit figure I better just do it now. Anyone have trouble with returning them after being washed?
