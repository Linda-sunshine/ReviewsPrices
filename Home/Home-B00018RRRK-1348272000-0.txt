review/summary: Ex-static!review/text: The machine has met all my expectations. Having ground coffee by hand in my youth I appreciate having it motorized. The 'dust' effect is all inside the container and a good paint type small brush gets it all out to where it needs to go. No mess. I just drop the amount of beans needed for single use and let the timer do its thing. A bit loud at the end alerts me that it's done just before it shuts off. I do not know how coarse it can grind because I use the 'finest' of settings, which suits me and my little espresso maker well. I am well-pleased with my purchase.
