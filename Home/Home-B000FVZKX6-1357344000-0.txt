review/summary: Very warm and smooth feelingreview/text: I like to be warm in bed (like 2 blankets and a comforter on top in the summer warm). I've had flannel sheets before on my old full sized bed, which I loved because they were warm, but they always seemed a little rough to the touch. These are the first set of flannel sheets we've gotten for our king bed and we love them! The are much softer than any other flannel sheets I've had in the past and are SUPER warm! We haven't tried them yet in warmer months, but I suspect you could use them in the summer as long as you didn't have any other sheets or comforter on top.
