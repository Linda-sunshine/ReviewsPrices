review/summary: TERRIBLE WASTE OF MONEYreview/text: I bought this and it worked for about eight weeks and then broke. It is under warranty, but the shipping costs to send it to an authorized service dealer is not covered. The coffee maker itself is unbalanced once you fill it with water and seems like it will tip over very easily. The lid is very difficult to screw on and off. Overall, this is a very poor quality product and not worth the money.
