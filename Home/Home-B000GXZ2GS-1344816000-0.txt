review/summary: Best Coffee ever - simple, works greatreview/text: Like the Aero Press a lot - I have had it 2 weeks and love it - the coffee is great and a lot better / easier than an electric coffee maker. If you love great coffee, this is the only way to go . Well made, sturdy and looks like it will last a long time. Keep a teapot of water on the stove. It takes only a couple of minutes to heat the water. A lot of reviews mention the need to use a thermometer to get the water the the right temperature. I never have - once the water in the tea kettle starts to make a sound, it is ready to go (for my liking)
