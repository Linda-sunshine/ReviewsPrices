review/summary: Unit failed after 2 yearsreview/text: I had this connected to an external antenna. The unit worked well and I was able to select the area I wanted with the S.A.M.E. technology and the alerts I wanted and didn't want. I started getting a message "check op" which means it is not getting signal. I press the -weather- button on top and I get silence. I had an older Radio Shack Weather Radio (without S.A.M.E.) and placed it next to this Midland and was able to hear the weather announcement without the external antenna. I tried the regular antenna on the Midland and still no weather. I have always been skeptical of Midland from past experiences but gave them another chance. This was Midland's last chance with me and the unit failed. I have no recommendation for another manufacturer but I plan to try another manufacturer out. Bottom Line: Good when it worked, I do not recommend Midland products. If anybody has had any luck with other Manufacturers please leave a comment, thank you.
