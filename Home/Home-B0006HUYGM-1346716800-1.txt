review/summary: Works as advertisedreview/text: It's been about a year since I bought this vacuum and it is still working with out any problems.What I like about the product is that its great for cleaning up the carpet my dog likes to eat crackers and leaves crumbles and the machines spinning bristles seem to do a pretty good job on cleaning up. Also the visor in front moves down so you can clean with bristle in front by shifting down the visor and can clean with out having to rotate the vacuum in an awkward position. The vacuum also allows you to use just the hose which is great for when you want to take out the air of those spacesaver bags. The only downside is the machine is a bit loud.
