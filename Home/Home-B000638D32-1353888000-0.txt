review/summary: Very nice chef's knife!review/text: I bought this knife to replace a brand of knife well known of their "grippy" handles. My previous knife had a problem where the blade came off the handle. That company was actually fantastic in their service and sent me a replacement, so no complaints there.Now on to this knife. First of all, I didn't expect the knife to feel so good. It's very heavy and the factory sharpened blade is incredibly sharp. I did see the reviews here on Amazon first and looking at the pictures, I actually had my doubts. In fact I tried to look for it at local stores. I only found sealed ones so I didn't try it out.I am going to compare this knife to the "grippy" handle knife I had, and to a chef's knife from a mail order company that likes to sell products that "cut" out the retail stores. The second knife was recently factory resharpened. This knife is so much better! Everything cuts effortlessly! I know I will need to keep the knife honed to keep the performance up. Overall, it is currently my favorite kitchen knife, and I didn't spend a lot on it! I also won't feel bad if I accidentally break this.
