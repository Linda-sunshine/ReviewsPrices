review/summary: Good airbed for the pricereview/text: I bought this to replace a Queen Aerobed I had. I used this and the Aerobed as a bed on a regular basis. Both airbeds lasted ~8 months before they began to have structure problems. The Aerobed when inflated didn't keep a rectangle shape but had bulges along the length sides. Both were comfortable. I placed a Japanese traditional futon on top and had lots of pillows and I sat in bed to do work or watch TV often. I only had to re-inflate once every 2,3 weeks to keep the firmness I liked. Comparing price, this Wenzel was cheaper and with Amazon Prime shipping it's a great deal. The problem I encountered with this product was the seam separating the top and the middle began to loosen up, making bulgings on the sides. Soon after, the outerchamber began to lose air despite my re-inflation. I didn't attempt to contact customer service for replacement as I needed a replacement right away and had already bought an Intex one at half price.
