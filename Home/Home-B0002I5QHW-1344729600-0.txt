review/summary: Works well with a few issuesreview/text: I was recently diagnosed with diabetes. I noticed that most breakfast sausage contains sugar as an ingredient and I wanted to avoid limiting sausage in my diet. This meat grinder allows me to grind pork and make my own sausage. In the past two weeks I've put about 20 pounds of pork through the unit and frozen enough sausage for several months. I think I have a pretty good sense of both the positives and negatives of this unit.Positives. 1. The nor-pro grinds meet very nicely. Put it together as directed in the instructions and you should have no problems. I would ignore the reviews that say the unit doesn't work. There are several possible ways to assemble this incorrectly and this would leave the user with the unit that looks good but won't work. 2. When complete, it's very easy to clean. A little soap and water do the trick. 3. Although made almost entirely of plastic, the unit seems sturdy.Negatives. 1. This definitely is not a commercial type unit. Grinding several pounds of meat is a chore. Any more than that is work. 2. The norpro clamps to the counter by way of suction cup. This works decent but it does slide around some and becomes an annoyance. 3. You need to cut the meat into relatively small chunks for this to work efficiently. Anything more than a 2" x 2" piece is asking a lot of this meat grinder.Bottom line. This unit does what it says it is supposed to do. It's perfect for someone who wants to grind 1 or 2 pounds of meat a week. If you're going to grind more than that however, I would suggest getting a larger unit. Also, I don't see how plastic can stand up to the type of abuse this takes while grinding meat. Over time, I suspect some of the plastic parts will fail.
