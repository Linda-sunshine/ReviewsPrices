review/summary: Quality product, excellent value, delivers a great cup of hot coffee...review/text: Have owned several 'auto drip coffee makers', most failed the durability and hot coffee test after a few years of use...This retro product takes a couple minutes of your time to install the square paper filter & the coffee grounds but delivers a great end result. Invest ten dollars in a plugable timer and your coffee is hot and waiting for you in the A.M.
