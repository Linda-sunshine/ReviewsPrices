review/summary: Good Wine Openerreview/text: This wine opener has been operating very well for months now. It does a great job of removing the cork quickly and without mess. It comes with a &#34;chiller&#34; to put the wine and ice in. It stays charged for many uses and will recharge quickly. This is a good gift for someone that likes to savor the flavor of wine.
