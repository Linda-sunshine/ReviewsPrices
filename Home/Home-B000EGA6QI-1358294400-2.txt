review/summary: Great little blenderreview/text: I am really enjoying this Christmas gift. I have had a couple of these hand blenders now and this is the best. The 200 watt motor is plenty for blending soup or even something thicker like mashed potatoes. I used it this week to make a batch of yams into baby food. It feels solid and well balanced and the on/off switch is easy to activate without getting in the way. The wand removes easily for cleaning but is firmly attached for use. Very happy with this purchase.
