review/summary: Solid Professional Quality productreview/text: I was a little leary about the price since it is more than twice the price of other brands, but I've been trying my best to purchase American products whenever possible. Well, that being said, this thing is awesome! I love that it doesn't have a rubber seal. It is solidly built and should last for many years to come. I'm new to the canning world and this is worth every penny.
