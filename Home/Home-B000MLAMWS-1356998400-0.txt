review/summary: Great for basic home bakingreview/text: I have owned the 6-qt mixer for a few years and absolutely love it. I do a lot of baking, things like cookies, cake, bread, candy, etc. It makes baking tasks so much easier and leaves my hands free for measuring and working on more than one recipe at once. That comes especially in handy during the holidays while baking goody plates for friends and family!The ONLY issue I ever had with this size mixer (the 575 watts) was that it couldn't handle multiple batches, done one at a time in succession, of thick bread dough. After the first batch the mixer would sometimes overheat and I'd have to wait an hour or so before I could finish. I don't fault the mixer for this at all, I know it's a very heavy duty job. Because of that, I upgraded to the 7-qt Proline mixer (1.3 hp) and with the new mixer haven't had any issues.With that being said, if you want a mixer for basic every day baking. Cookies, ONE small-medium batch of bread dough, cakes, etc. this is definitely the mixer for you. If you do a lot more with bread, especially multiple batches, maybe take a look at theKitchenAid 7-qt. Pro Line Stand Mixer, Candy Apple Red. Either way, I would definitely suggest not going any smaller than this 600 series mixer.
