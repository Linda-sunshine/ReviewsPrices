review/summary: disappointedreview/text: Can't read the blue faced time from a distance of more than a few feet. And not at all from any angle other than straight on. Complicated and misplaced buttons resulted in unknowingly setting the alarm which automatically goes off at midnight. Not fun at all, especially when it isn't easy to turn off the alarm. So the only recourse was to unplug it and put it away in a drawer. That is where it is now - in a drawer.
