review/summary: Needs to be simplifiedreview/text: Besides the fact you have to really stare at the too bright display to tell the time, setting the alarm could be a lot easier. The volume of most sounds too low,except the waterfall. It would be nice if this machine was a little slimmer and smaller for travel use.
