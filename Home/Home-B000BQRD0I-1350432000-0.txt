review/summary: Great product and great customer service!review/text: I bought this steamer just under a year ago and love it. I loathe ironing and haven't had to use an iron since purchasing this.It heats up very quickly and steams almost everything on the hanger. It comes with attachments for those occassions you need assistance with tricky items.I don't use the hook on the steamer because its not tall enough for me and doesn't seem too stable.After a year of use, it just wasnt steaming properly and I found the piece that connects the hose to the main unit was cracked. Just got off of a 5 min call with customer service (no hold time) and they are sending me a new hose no questions asked.I cannot tell you when I had a more pleasant customer service experience.I would highly recommend this item.
