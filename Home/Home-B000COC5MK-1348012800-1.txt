review/summary: Excellent wine opener for about 5 years.....review/text: ....then it broke and I just now ordered another one from Amazon. It was being used about 2 or 3 times a week. I hardly ever drink anymore, but my mom goes through 2 or 3 bottles a week. I set a note in google calendar to only plug the charger in 2 twice a month over night. No reason to leave it plugged in all of the time.When this one broke, I took it apart to find that the plastic speed reduction gears had stripped. Motor still worked fine but the screw wouldn't turn.I figure $15 (Costco) for 5 years is good enough, its almost all plastic.When I first bought one, I bought 12 of them for Christmas gifts. As more guests arrived at Christmas morning, people were pulling corks over and over showing people how it works. It was a big hit that morning. Mine is the only one I know of that broke.
