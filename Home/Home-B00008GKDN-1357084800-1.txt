review/summary: I love cast iron!review/text: I love cast iron cookwear, and Lodge is the best of the best. American made, preseasoned, even heat; what's not to love! This piece is great for tortillas, grilled cheese, quesidillas, pancakes, burgers, etc... Just use your imagination. Plus, I'll be able to give it to my grandkids some day, and I'm only 27! Spend the little extra money and get the Lodge brand cookwear. It's good for America, plus it really is a better piece. Amazon shipping is always fast and the price was right.
