review/summary: good espresso ... for three monthsreview/text: Considering the price of this machine and Delonghi's reputation for espresso makers, I expected much more. Espresso was great for the first few months. After that, the water leaked everywhere, there was no pressure of water through the coffee, and forget steaming milk. I tried to look for a leak or figure out if something just wasn't lined up properly. In the end, it seems to be a design problem. The seals and hoses that push the water from the reserve through the machine seemed to break down, and any small amount of pressure loss made the machine inoperable. I got this as a gift so I was out of luck. Don't waste your money. Really makes me worry about some of their other products people are paying 500+ for on the market.
