review/summary: No More Disposable Bottles!review/text: My daughter and her roommates were constantly complaining about the taste of the water in their new apartment(hard water, mineral taste.) I was horrified to learn they were dealing with it by buying bottled water by the case load! I has Amazon ship one of these off, and that brought an end to the disposable bottles. The girls think the water tastes great -- and after visiting this weekend, I have to agree!UPDATE -- Six weeks in, and it was accidentally dropped, empty, less than three feet onto a resilient (not ceramic or other hard surface) floor and it shattered into many pieces. I could maybe understand a crack -- although it really ought be be able to survive that kind of drop -- but to shatter? Something is not right structurally.
