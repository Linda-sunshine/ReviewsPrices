review/summary: Amazing!review/text: I have been using the same tiny food processor for 8 years. I finally asked for a new one because my use increased when I switched to a paleo diet and I needed one with bigger capacity. I went with 9'cups and am happy I did because it seems like the perfect amount. Now the part that made me fall in love... The noise level. It was like nothing compared to my old processor that sounded like a jet engine taking off in my kitchen and caused my child to run and hide. I first used this one to cut up my sweet potato into discs and I turned it on, braced for take off but instead all I heard was a dull &#34;whomp whomp whomp&#34; of the blade hitting the potato, then nothing. This took a matter of seconds as the device took care of business in no time. I am so happy I received this as a gift for christmas. I am in love. I no longer have to fear when I use it that it might wake a child. I will be using often.
