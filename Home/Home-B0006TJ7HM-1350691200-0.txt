review/summary: Sharp, but not as sharp as professional bladesreview/text: Bought this because of the rave reviews this received + the good price. Barely use them except for the steak knives now and then. I thought this would give me professional level cutting power but compared to my custom made knives these aren't even close. Good show item, I guess.
