review/summary: side sleeperreview/text: I am a side sleeper. I have an old hard mattress and I would often wake up with sore back and shoulders and numb arms/hands. This pad completely changed my bed. I cant believe how soft and comfortable it made my old crappy mattress! All of the problems I had without my old mattress are gone and I now I sleep comfortably without tossing and turning like a giant happy man baby! Before I purchased this I tried several different pillows thinking that poor pillow support was the problem. It definitely wasn't! I can use any pillow now and wake up without a stiff neck.
