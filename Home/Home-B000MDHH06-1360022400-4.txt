review/summary: Exactly what I was looking for!review/text: I love this juicer. I bought it to start juicing and live a bit healthier and cleaner lifestyle. Living in NYC is a bit hard to find a large kitchen, so the compact juicer size and easy use is a definite plus. I'd say about 95% of the fruits or veggies that I juice are fully broken down and for the price this is a great deal. When I get a bigger space would definitely consider buying a larger juicer from Breville.
