review/summary: Two Units in Three Years: I give upreview/text: First one I got quit working in 4 weeks. Returned it to Target and started over. 2nd unit quit working after 2-3 years. Personally I am tired of high price processing for coffee. Graduated to pour over coffee system--- really inexpensive and better brewing.HIC Porcelain No. 4 Coffee Filter ConeAs for the individual tea preparations--- changing from a tea bag to a plastic cup and charging how much more? Marketing genius. Or should we just let the maker pour out hot water and put the tea bag in.
