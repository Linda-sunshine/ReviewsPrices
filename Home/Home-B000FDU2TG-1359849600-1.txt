review/summary: Don't let the pretty color fool you, this blender is garbagereview/text: I got this as a gift for christmas. I was so excited over the pretty yellow color that would match so well in my kitchen. The first use, i was highly unimpressed. I made a smoothie of mostly fresh fruit with some frozen fruit and no ice. It took forever to blend. After just s few seconds the blades would act like they were caught on something and just stop spinning. I'd open the lid and use a spoon to free any caught fruit. Same problem. For how much time/effort it took just to make 1 smoothie it seemed i could have just smashed the fruit by hand for less effort. The second day was even worse. The way the jar/blade attach to the base it seems that if the blades get stuck, it will just strip the gears out. Halfway through the second smoothie blending i just gave up. It wouldn't even blend after taking all the large chunks out. Garbage. Also, the way the jar is designed, there are a few tiny crevices that food likes to get stuck in after washing. I used the dishwasher, but found i had to pick the food out manually and wash by hand anyway. Last time i will ever buy a blender based on its color or one made by kitchenaid. An absolute waste of money.
