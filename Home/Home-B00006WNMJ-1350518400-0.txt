review/summary: No Spraysreview/text: I have tried several varieties of water filter attachments and have been annoyed as they all end up making a poor seal and eventually spraying water when you try to use them. I have used these for several months and never had a problem. They also seem to last more like 3 months than 2 months.They are competitively priced and convenient when scheduled for delivery every 2-3 months...they are nearly impossible to find at local retailers (vs their inferior competition which are everywhere).
