review/summary: Superlatives! Once seasoned, it is Indispensable for daily cooking instead of Teflonreview/text: After much strong urging of my daughter who wanted me to stop using Teflon pans, I reluctantly bought 1 griddle & discovered it to be the BEST thing since...Of course i did not listen to her to pre-season 'cuz Lodge says it wasn't necessary but food stuck. The griddle was Miraculously Non-Stick after pre-seasoning & just a rinse in hot water cleans it.Now, I use it for all heating, frying & saut&eacute;ing unless the ingredients are falling out of the pan. I find the deeper cast iron pans too heavy so this is the optimum size & weight for me.It is also the best pan for Indian Dosa (crepe). I love it so much that i bought a 2nd pan on sale locally.P.S. Jan. 6, 2013: I bought a 10 inch Lodge pan with higher sides for stir frying and it is not too heavy & i like it a lot. Of course, i needed to pre-season etc.
