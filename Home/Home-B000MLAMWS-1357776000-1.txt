review/summary: Kitchen Coupreview/text: My better half had always wanted a stand mixer, so amazingly, one arrived this year under the tree. She has used it a few times now and loves it. Only minor issue is with getting the bowl off and on. The muted black Licorice color was perfect for our kitchen too.
