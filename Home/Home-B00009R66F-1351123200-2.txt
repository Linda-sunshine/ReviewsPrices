review/summary: It is very poorly made and cheap feelingreview/text: We tried to use this steam vac the day we received it following all the instructions to the letter. It started leaking from several spots on the several of the seams where the plastics met. We called Hoover and they said it was common and we would need to take it into a service center. When we did that the service center told us it would be at least a week before they could work on it. I am so thankful that Amazon has such a great return policy and they are so easy to use. I am going to send it back and get a refund and buy a bissell steam vac.PS I did what some of the people who said that if it leaks that you need to press the trigger and the surge button. I tried it for about ten min and was not able to get anything to snap like what other reviewers said to do.
