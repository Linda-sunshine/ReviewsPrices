review/summary: Easy to use and cleanreview/text: Purchased at a local retailer for the same price as Amazon plus 2 year no questions asked replacement warranty. It does a great job of extracting juice from everything I've tried thus far. It is a piece of cake to clean and seems to be solidly constructed. Typically use it twice per day.
