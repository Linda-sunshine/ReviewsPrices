review/summary: 8 years and still going strong!review/text: I bought this coffee maker 8 years ago and I still love it! It was easy to set up and program and cleaning is easy as it does it for you. I doubt I will have to replace it any time soon but if I do it will be one of these. The customer support from Cuisinart was wonderful as well. I had an issue with another product (bread machine) and they took care of it promptly. Have recommended it to friends and they are happy with theirs as well.
