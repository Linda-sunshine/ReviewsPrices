review/summary: Simply the (Near) Bestreview/text: While I'm certain there are more bells and whistles to be found on other, more expensive units, this is an ideal hot air popcorn popper.It's compact size shouldn't fool you: the half-cup kernel capacity will provide a huge bowl of movie night popcorn, and it makes it in about 2 minutes -- with subsequent batches (for longer movies) taking as little as a minute thanks to the unit heating up and staying so hot.I had zero problems batch after batch with fly-away, but what DID take my rating down one star (even though it's very manageable) is the fact that a whole bunch of kernels will blow out before the popping starts, simply because of the super strength of the heat fan.Throw them back in, toss 'em over your shoulder for good luck, chuck 'em in the trash, or whatever -- it'll only be a spoonful, and it certainly doesn't make this any less appealing than the other (MANY other) poppers I've owned.Plus, it cleans up with a shake-and-a-blow, wipes up if necessary, and cools down quickly.An amazing value.
