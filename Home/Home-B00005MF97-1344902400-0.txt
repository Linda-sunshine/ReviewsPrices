review/summary: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Itreview/text: This is hands down the best little chopping machine I've ever had. In fact..I'm buying 3 of them so I will never have to risk not having one. It's sturdy and lasts. It shops, grates, slices, pulses...two different speeds. It makes outstanding pesto. It grates hard cheeses in seconds. If you are looking for a handy chopper buy this chopper. It is worth every since penny. Durable, good quality, easy to use, easy to clean...I absolutely LOVE it.
