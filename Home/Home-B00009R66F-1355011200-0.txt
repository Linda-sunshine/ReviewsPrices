review/summary: Pet Owners Necessityreview/text: We use our cleaner all the time thanks to our two little dogs tracking soil inside through the pet door and for cleaning up ocassional &#34;accidents&#34; when they refuse to go outside because it's raining (hey, we live in Seattle - deal with it dogs!) we buy the cleaning solutions at Target (cheaper than paying to ship) and we heat up the water in the solution takn, as recommended. This little baby has been a lifesaver for us - and our pups!
