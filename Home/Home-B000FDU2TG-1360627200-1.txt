review/summary: Great Blenderreview/text: This blender has been everything I thought it would be. For the price, there's nothing better.It can be a little loud for 6:30 AM. However, it's so powerful that it takes half the time that it used to, which reduces sound also.I couldn't be happier with it, best bang for the buck without a doubt.
