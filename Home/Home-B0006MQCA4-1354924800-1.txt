review/summary: Great productreview/text: This dispenser (along with filters) do a great job of cleaning out the water & leave it tasting much better. Also, the dispenser holds a decent amount of water. The only problem I could see someone having is the water coming out too slowly as the water levels get low, as the filter only has a slight angle to it. But this has not been a very big problem for me, and if someone really wanted to fix it and have the water come out faster, they could easily put something under it to give it more of a tilt.
