review/summary: Adore Itreview/text: I bought the red version, and I've used it to do several dishes, the large pot of pot roast chili with those jalapenos and assorted peppers, and pot roast, and you can cook your chopped onions and celery right in the pot and keep adding foods. It looks beautiful on the stove top, and you can transfer it to the oven with the new knob provided. I LOVE IT.
