review/summary: OMG I have replaced so many belts I coulda bought an oreckreview/text: Did not buy at Amazon but trust me its this one. I had a Eureka Comfort Clean Oh! and really liked it but it fell down the stairs and was never the same. (I have children; you can't scare me). So I wanted an efficient cheap vacuum cleaner even though I hate vacuuming. Anyway this one good good reviews was like 65.00 so count me in.Where do I start? Ok suction is good when bag is clean but it doesn't do edges, an issue. I may have known that going in.My bad.The hose is ridiculous; hard to explain, its short and if you squeeze it it collapses. Not kidding. (I bought a replacement hose on Amazon for 14.00 that was allegedly reportedly 20 feet which I guess could be true if you tied each end to a car bumper and stretched it out by going in opposite directions.). The hose helped a bit. Ok.Wands fall apart, attachments don't stay attached. Its VERY VERY FLIMSY like a dollar store toy no joke. But that is not even the worst of it.The belt breaks about every other time I use it if not more. I swear I have replaced 20 belts in less than a year at like 3.50 a clip. Nuts nuts nuts.So writing this is cathartic. Bu BYE Hoover...you are going away, you hateful piece of rubbish! I need my serenity more than clean rugs today, I will deal with vac issue tomorrow!
