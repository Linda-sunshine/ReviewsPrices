review/summary: Finally, HOT COFFEE !review/text: I bought this stovetop percolator to use on my propane barbeque grill just incase the power goes off for another 14 days (Hurricane Sandy, Long Island) and I just tried it on my stove to make sure I knew how to use it.The coffee is so much better than my drip coffee-maker! I intend to use this new percolator on a daily basis! I made the coffee, then put my electric stove burner on low (2 setting) and even after an hour, the coffee was still hot and not too strong!I highly recommend this pot, especially if you have Amazon Prime, because I paid only $20.00 for it.I cannot say how thrilled I am ! I used the round filters, and bought the glass top.
