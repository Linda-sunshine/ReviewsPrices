review/summary: Chopper could be a little more handyreview/text: This is a good chopper for light uses. I'd honestly prefer something a little bigger. I don't really like how it's arranged with how the top is the mechanical housing, I'd like that reversed. If you have plans to use this for yourself and maybe another person I'd recommend it. If you are going to use it to prepare food for a family of 4 or a small group I'd go with something a little bigger.
