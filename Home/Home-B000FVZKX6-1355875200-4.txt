review/summary: Very soft sheets, great for winter!review/text: These sheets feel really cozy and soft. I bought a set of the white sheets a couple months ago and I love them so much I recently bought a second set so that they could be on my bed at all times this winter. I could see them being too heavy for summer but on winter nights they make getting into bed much more inviting than traditional sheets. I used my high quality sateen sheets recently and they felt cold and slippery by comparison even though I love them most of the year.
