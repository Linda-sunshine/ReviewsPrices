review/summary: Great choice of a juicer!review/text: After reading reviews and researching on which juicer will fit my needs, without a doubt I LOVE this machine. It's easy to use, easy clean up, POWERFUL piece of art! You won't regret it. I can put my whole fruits and vegetables in and it extracts everything down to microscopic size into the filter that extracts the waste. Advice, line the waste bin with a plastic grocery bag so that when you're all done just pop out the lid and pull out the trash bag and toss it away, simple no clean up or washing for the trash bin. I got this tip from another breville owner.
