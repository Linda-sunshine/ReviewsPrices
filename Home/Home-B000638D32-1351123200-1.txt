review/summary: Love it!review/text: This is the nicest knife I own. It's big, bigger than I expected it to be and it's really super sharp, so you need to be very careful. It took a little getting used to because of the size, but now I love it and use it every single day. It's so well made and feels really comfortable in my hand. It works for everything from chopping herbs to nuts. It makes me feel like a real chef when I use it!
