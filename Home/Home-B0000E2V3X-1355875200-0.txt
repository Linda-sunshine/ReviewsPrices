review/summary: Terrific Purchasereview/text: I've deployed this pan several times since purchasing in October. I've used both home-made and store-bought pizza dough and both are actually great. I personally prefer the home made so that I can limit the yeast and have a thinner crust .I preheat the oven to 500 degrees with the pan in the oven, placing the pan about 6 inches from the broiler. While this is all happening I assemble the pizza - recommending to go a bit lighter on the toppings to ensure that the top will cook prior to the bottom becoming too dark (the pan picks up a lot of heat). I use parchment paper to help slip the assembled pizza from the peel onto the super-hot pan but cornmeal works well (I just find that cornmeal burns fairly quickly and with this pan, you don't need the added crunch).Anyway, it's fun to watch the dough react to the immediate searing heat of the iron pan - bubbling edges and crisp browning. Going close to the broiler ensures toppings and cheese keep pace with the dough. In all, my pizzas are done in maybe 12 minutes - WATCH CLOSELY. The results are fantastic.Downside, I've never been able to complete a pizza without setting off my overly-sensitive smoke detector. The pan is well seasoned but I still get some smoke off the oiled finish as it preheats. Oh well, it's worth that small inconvenience.For those of you still buying prefab dough, maybe consider investing in a bread machine. Bread makers all have a dough cycle that will create phenomenal pizza dough in about 1.5 hours. Instant yeast can be found online at Amazon too. So fun and cost effective. But this pan is what makes the biggest difference and is a great purchase.
