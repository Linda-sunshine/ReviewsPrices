review/summary: Researched A LOT and am happy with this itemreview/text: I looked at humidifiers for hours. I have a VentasonicVenta Ultrasonic Humidifierin my bedroom which works well but is not big enough for my great room/kitchen large open room. This unit is not as quiet as the Ventasonic BUT is is pretty dang quiet on the lowest fan level and it distributes humidity quite well. We have it next to the couch and don't feel the need to turn it off while watching TV. It is putting out 3.5 gallons a day and keeping the humidity at about 45% while on low humidity/low fan. I have a humidistat in the center of the room. The area is about 400 sq. ft. I also have a Honeywell HEPAHoneywell 50250-S 99.97% Pure HEPA Round Air PurifierAir Cleaner and that is much louder than this humidifier. We do turn the air cleaner off to watch TV. Air quality and humidity are very important to me because I have two parrots. They need humidity and create dust. The primary drawback for me with this unit is that the water tanks (there are two) do not sit flat when you turn them upside down to fill them. Also, they are pretty heavy when full. I currently have a wrist injury so my husband's job is to flip them right side up from the sink and put the tanks back in the humidifier once they are full. I am also not thrilled this unit takes those big filters, but I am hoping I won't need to change it more than once a month. I am using water treatment every time I fill the tanks. Overall, I would definitely recommend this humidifier.
