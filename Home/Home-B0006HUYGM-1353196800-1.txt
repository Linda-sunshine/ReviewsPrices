review/summary: Lots of POWER-and rather small too!review/text: I wanted a handheld vac for my stairs. It had to plug into the wall (no batteries), and it needed a 1 1/4 inch hose for a crevice tool. This has all of the above, and great ratings, so I tried it. It is as wonderful as the reviews said I am glad I bought it. I found that it is so easy to use that I also use it to vacuum the area rug in my office.Redhead Meets Redneck: First DateDestiny
