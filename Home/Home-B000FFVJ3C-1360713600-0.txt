review/summary: Less than professionally madereview/text: I was excited yesterday to finally get my dehydrator. When I put my trays ( the ones that came with it )together, the inside was warped up so the power unit did not sit straight but tilted. I also bought two additional trays. They warped downward. Seriously needs more quality control at the cheap labor end of the manufacturing. I used my cutting board and a book to help straighten out. Hopefully by this weekend everything will sit straight enough to use without air leaking all over. Keep you updated.7:30 PM 2/13/13Cutting board didn't work. Turned on my dehydrator and set to 160 for an hour; all the trays are straight now.
