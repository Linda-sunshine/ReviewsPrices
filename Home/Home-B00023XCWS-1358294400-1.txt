review/summary: Does the job!review/text: Being in Afghanistan and wanting to make oatmeal or top ramen i couldn't be any happier with this product. Others similar to this cost upward 10$ more i paid 10$ for mine and it does the job. Heat water to boiling point in a matter of a couple minutes.Cons: Could of been a longer cord as it is only about 2 feet long or less. But i wont deduct any points for such because it sits close to an outlet and i just unplug it when i need to pour the water in another container.
