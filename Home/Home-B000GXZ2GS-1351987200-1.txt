review/summary: Compact, simple, effective, quick, easy to clean w/outstanding coffee resultsreview/text: This little device makes surprisingly awesome coffee. I was sceptical on the front end but have used it for over 30 days now and obviously love it for each reason listed in the title line above. Within our family, we've experimented and compared the AeroPress against our Cuisinart drip maker and have decided unanimously that the AeroPress delivers the best tasting coffee hands down.However, I believe the key to TOTAL satisfaction revolves around having an instant hot water dispenser. Without an instant hot water dispenser, you are left with the task of heating water to the recommended 175 degree temperature; which adds additional time to the preparation process. But the end result is the same.....excellent tasting, single-servings of coffee with quick, easy clean-up.
