review/summary: Great juicer!review/text: My husband and I are new to juicing. We began by borrowing a friend's (a very old model that was bought second hand) to make sure it was something we'd stick with before investing in a new juicer. We loved it, even with the out dated machine. I did a little research and chose this juicer based on it's amazon ratings and reviews and have not been disappointed. We are not experienced juicers and just wanted an easy to use, easy to clean machine that would produce efficient juice from the usual fruits and veggies and this juicer has exceeded our expectations. My husband is particularly happy with how easy it is to clean. I appreciate that the owners manual comes with recipes for the pulp to reduce waste. We are very happy with our investment in this juicer.
