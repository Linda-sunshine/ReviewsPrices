review/summary: Great product!review/text: I love my Misto Oil Sprayers. I use them to mist my griddle or frying pan at breakfast and my eggs and bacon or pancakes don't stick. I sometimes have to pump them several times depending on what I am misting, but it is worth it when the foods don't stick, yet the calories aren't as near as bad as they could be! Plus it allows me to get &#34;good&#34; oils into my diet.
