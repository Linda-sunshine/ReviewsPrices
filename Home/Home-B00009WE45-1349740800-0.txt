review/summary: Calibration does not workreview/text: I work in food processing and we are required by the FDA to calibrate our thermometers with a NIST calibration device that is accurate to a tenth of a degree. I bought 4 of these Taylor thermometers since they had the calibration screw on the front. The first 2 I put in the device came out spot on, but the third one was off by .5 degrees. When I attempted to calibrate it using the screws and instructions, nothing happened so I figured it was faulty. When I went to the fourth one and it was off, I tried to calibrate it and again, nothing changed. I went back to the first one and even though it was spot on, I tried to calibrate it and it went down when I turned it up, but then would not go back up no matter what way I turned it. I contacted Taylor and they sent me 4 new ones. I unfortunately got the same results of not being able to calibrate using the screw. So yes they maybe accurate to start but don't expect them to calibrate when they are off. I have always used Taylor dial thermometers in the past, but with this experience I am so disappointed in their product, I will start using a new brand.
