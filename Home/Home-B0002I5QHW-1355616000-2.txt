review/summary: Great for grinding meat and bones for my dogs!review/text: What a great little grinder! I have a French Bulldog and we feed him a raw food diet. I was looking for a good meat grinder to grind up the meat and bones and came across this little guy. It was super cheap but the reviews kept saying it was quite robust for its price and size. I decided to try it since it was about $25 and I couldn't be more pleased with it. It's all plastic except for the handle and blades which appear to be stainless steel. It can be completely broken down for cleaning which is a huge plus. I've been throwing it in the dishwasher for the past couple of months and it is still in great shape.In order for me to grind meat and bones I have to break the bones into smaller pieces with a pair of garden shears so it can be broken down by the grinder. It's a little labor intensive but you have to do that with most grinders. Don't think that this grinder sucks because you can't stuff half a chicken into it without it clogging. Put in some elbow grease and you will be quite impressed with what this little guy can do. The grinder also has a suction cup on the bottom which keeps it firmly planted to my kitchen counter even under intense work.All in all, for its price, it's a great grinder. It works great for meat and bones and if you aren't interested in grinding bones then it will work even better. I highly recommend it.*Update 1/08/13: So after a few months of grinding meat and bone for my dogs, my little grinder faltered. The blade broke and tore up the plastic piece it attaches to. I emailed customer service on the off-chance that they would replace the parts even though buying a new one wouldn't break the bank. I got a prompt email back and after a few exchanges (sent in pictures of broken pieces) she mailed me the replacement parts free of charge!So not only is this a great little grinder, but the customer service was excellent as well.
