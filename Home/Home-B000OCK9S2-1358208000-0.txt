review/summary: Awful - worst purchase I've ever made on Amazonreview/text: I bought this on a lightning deal during the holidays. I figured for $15, it would be a no-brainer. I was wrong. This will go down as my worst purchase that I've ever made on Amazon. (and I buy a lot). Where do I start? First, the background, it's impossible to see unless you're right on top of it. The black on blue with the angle resistant viewing makes it impossible to see unless you're exactly 1 foot away, and directly looking at it. Second, I can't find a way to change the sound that you wake up with. The manual doesn't show a way, and I couldn't find anything on it when googling it either. I tried the default "stream sound" to wake up with, and ended up oversleeping, because it was so repetitive, it didn't wake me up. I've never overslept with a radio - even on a low setting. Third, and this may be the worst aspect - I decided to just go ahead and use the radio to wake up with. I like the fact that it has a 10 minute snooze, and only lets you snooze 3 times - but that's where it ends. When you are in snooze mode, the radio is STILL ON! It is just muffled to a lower setting. So, in a quiet room, I can still hear the radio - even when I'm trying to get 10 more minutes of rest. Awful, awful, awful. Please don't waste your money.
