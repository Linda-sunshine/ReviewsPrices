review/summary: Best machinereview/text: First when the machine did not come right away, was told it was lost in transit, so had to reorder it. amazon sent the reorder within two days,which made me a bit happy. Once I found the machine to be easy to assembly and easy to use. It is a smooth heavy duty machine. I think this is the best machine I've had in years and I have had a few. Very impressive. I did research on this machine and found it to be less maintenance and very sturdy. So far I've used the machine at least 6 times and it worked perfect each time. This is a very good investment.
