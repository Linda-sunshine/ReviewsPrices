review/summary: Second Purchasereview/text: This is our second purchase of the Zoij. The first was bought in March 2005 and was still working when I bought this one. The only problem with the '05 was age and a stuck button. So, 7.5 years later this new Zoij seems identical to the first one; except for price: $50 in 2005, $87 today. We still prefer the carafe style, and if you pre-heat it with hot tap water, it will maintain hot coffee hot. Other nit-picky complaints I've read are easily solved: #4 coffee filters can be folded at the seams to fit the basket; yes, the &#34;cups&#34; appear to be smaller than some, but adjusting was no problem; overflows (only in my 2005 version) were solved by leaving the carafe lid &#34;open&#34; about 1/4 turn; I measured water temp at the &#34;arm&#34; over the basket, and it was about 170. We used the 2005 model three times a day, seven days a week with no problem that couldn't be solved. We coarse grind (in our grinder) our coffee and use about one heaping &#34;coffee measure&#34; per two &#34;cups&#34; for great, robust coffee! I apologize for all the &#34; &#34;, but these terms are not absolute values. Enjoy!
