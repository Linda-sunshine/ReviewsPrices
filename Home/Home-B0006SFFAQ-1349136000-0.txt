review/summary: OK Coffee makerreview/text: I bought the Cuisinart DCC-1200 coffee maker to replace my old Melitta Mill & Brew, (MEMB1B) the best coffee maker I've ever owned. This coffee maker is nothing special. I don't think it makes a great cup of coffee. In fact it's almost as good as my $9.99 Black & Decker one cup coffee maker, but much more expensive. I've had this coffee maker for just over a year and yesterday it stopped working. So, I called customer service. They told me to perform a deep cleaning with 6 cups vinegar and 6 cups water and then see if that runs through the machine. It didn't work. So, this morning I called them back. Without questions they said in 5-10 business days I should receive a new coffee maker and just send the old one back in the new packaging. Although I don't really like the coffee maker the customer service is fantastic. So I'm giving the coffee maker 3 stars for making an OK cup of coffee and the customer service 5 stars for (1) being in the US and (2) replacing the broken unit with absolutely no hassle.
