review/summary: Love this guyreview/text: I purchased this blender mixing soups after one explosive butternut squash incident with a standard blender. It works just as I would expect. It's also very handy for protein shakes and handles frozen berries easily and quickly. The bottom half of the blender pops off and goes right in the dishwasher, though it's also very easy to clean in the sink. We use it all the time and have recommended it to many friends.
