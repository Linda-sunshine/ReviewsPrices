review/summary: Poor quality colored plasticreview/text: The colored versions use a significantly lower quality plastic then the rest of the white brita products. Due to this, the pour flap wouldn't open, spilling water. Solved by just removing. The lid hasn't been improved in this model and comes off fairly easily compared to other models. I'm using this to replace my Brita oceania model which has poorly designed shape and top water reservoir (angled top). This model does have a great shape for fitting in the fridge.-G
