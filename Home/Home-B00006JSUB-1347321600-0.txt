review/summary: A++review/text: I've had my skillet for about two months now and have used it every single day that I have a meal at home. My only recommendation is that when you further season it (and you should!) use some sort of animal-based oil, as SOME not all, but SOME veggie oils will leave a sticky, gummy residue. Bacon grease works the best! Or good 'ol lard!Seriously though, totally worth it. If you take even halfway decent care of it, it'll last you a lifetime.
