review/summary: This size melts slower BUT not so easy to get out of tray?review/text: The title pretty much says it all.The cubes this tray produces are thicker in three dimensions that typical tray cubes so they last longer in liquid. However a typical tray drops it's cubes with a simple twist.This one even with the silicon wants a push on every cube from the bottom after a rinse in cool water to loosen a bit. At first I wondered if it was even practical to get them out it was so tough. Now I figured out that you have to push on each cube bottom hard and deep and twist. A little on the slow side but the larger cubes are worth the effort (maybe?).Smaller size, these trays are about half as long as regular trays, makes it easier to find a place in the freezer but you get less cubes per tray. All for the large size? Perhaps I would not buy if I knew then what I know now.
