review/summary: Best Pizza Pan EVER!!!review/text: I've been making pizza for years and have used many different pans/ stones along the way. Prior to the Lodge Pizza Pan, I used a baking stone and had fabulous results....but it broke, then my replacement broke.Since I had a number of Lodge pans I thought I'd give the pizza pan a try. OMG!! This thing is wonderful! The trick for crispy crust, yet chewy interior is to pre-heat the oven with the pan (550F or highest temp.) then throw your pizza on it. You will get perfect pizza every time with this pan. Basically no clean-up and very little upkeep. I highly suggest it!
