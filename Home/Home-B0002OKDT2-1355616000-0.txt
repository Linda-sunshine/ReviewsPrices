review/summary: Many years of great use!review/text: I've had this juicer for many years and made a number of fruit, vegetable, and grass juices. It's extremely easy to use and even easier to clean. This type of juicer is ideal because it can be used for any kind of fruit/vegetable/grass and doesn't heat the juice. The pulp is removed which can also be used with a dehydrator to create crackers and wraps. The high speed juicers tear the fruits/vegetables apart vs squeezing them like this juicer. Also, if you want to make your own wheat grass juice, you can only use this type of juicer. There are attachments that let you make baby food and other things than just juice. I've had many juicers and this has been the best.
