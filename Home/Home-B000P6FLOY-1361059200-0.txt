review/summary: Polder Digital In-Oven Thermometerreview/text: I can take the tempure on the yogurt, meats, etc. I was a little bit skeptical when i first read the reviews but the bad reviews turned out to be a fluke on the operator in my opinion. The person complaining about the thermometer not function properly with the yogurt does not know what she was talking about. This is a thermometer, not a yogurt maker.Good buy for the money. The only drawback that i can think of is the use of batteries but that is not a deal breaker for me. Would recommend it to anybody looking for an inexpensive thermomether.
