review/summary: It grinds, but not already grounded coffeereview/text: I can grind coffee beans to fine result. However, when I tried to grind some coarsely grounded coffee finer, it actually locked up and not even able to clean it by taking it apart. Whole core pieces are stuck together. Motor smoke and not longer turnning. This is disappointing. A burr grinder should be able to grin any coffee, bean or not bean.I have to send this one back, since it is useless now.
