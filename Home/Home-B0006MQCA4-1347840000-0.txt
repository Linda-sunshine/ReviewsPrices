review/summary: Makes it easier to stay hydrated!review/text: I am one of those people who has a hard time keeping up on my daily water intake. Honestly, I'd rather drink milk.I'm always freaked out of what's in the city tap water, and I don't like drinking from plastic bottles (plus, theyre an expensive habit). Having a Pur filter--fresh, clean water sitting on your counter or in your fridge--makes it a lot easier to stay hydrated.Buying a Pur filter has been a really good investment. I bought the dispenser, the filters, and went out to Fred Meyer & bought like 5 Aluminum re-usable bottles. It saves you so much money on plastic bottles. Plus, think of all the plastic you're saving from being thrown in a landfill!It makes the water taste better & cleaner. They give you little stickers to put on the top to remind yourself to change the filter at a certain time in the next 2 months (these easily peel off, doesn't leave residue on the lid).It's a great product, I would recommend it to anyone.
