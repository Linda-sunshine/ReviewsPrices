review/summary: Perfect grind every time.review/text: We order coffee from an old roaster in Pittsburgh and grind it each morning just prior to brewing. Our previous blade grinder provided everything from dust to whole beans left in the grinder. We now enjoy a perfectly-sized grind for our perc. A big plus is being able to put all 12 scoops of beans in the container at one time instead of two batches.Only negative is the static makes grounds cling to the unit..both inside and the ground receptacle. But we love it otherwise.
