review/summary: This is a great knife for the pricereview/text: If you ask most people, what's a good cheap knife, most will say there is no such thing. But, there is.This Chef knife is great, and for the price, it's way better than some more expensive brands. I have some cheap serrated knives that I received as a set, and the difference is night and day. The handle is kinda rubbery which adds some grip, and I even like the little plastic sleeve that it comes with. It makes chopping and dicing so much easier, for such a small cost.
