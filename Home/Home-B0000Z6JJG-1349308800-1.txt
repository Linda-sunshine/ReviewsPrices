review/summary: Can I give this more than 5 Stars!!review/text: Why doesn't everyone have one of these?? If I only ever grated fresh cheese and chopped salad ingredients, this would still be worth it's weight in gold. It makes quick-work of shredding cheese right before I need it. This is fantastic for those who have figured out why those bags of pre-shredded cheese have "extra" ingredients in them to prevent caking. Natural cheese is so much better and this little gadget makes it so easy. Clean-up is very easy also. This one comes out of my cabinet almost daily.
