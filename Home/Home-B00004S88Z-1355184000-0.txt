review/summary: Best canner I've ever ownedreview/text: This has got to be the best canner on the market .... and it's made in America. I thought all the clamps would be a pain but there's nothing to it and I like the fact that there's no gasket to leak or wear out. It's a little on the heavy side but does a great job.
