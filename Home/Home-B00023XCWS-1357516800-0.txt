review/summary: Good kettle. No "plastic" tastereview/text: We bought this kettle based on the reviews here. I had a coupon at Bed, Bath & Beyond, so I saved a couple dollars, but the reviews here were very valuable.We used a Bodum Model 5500 electric kettle everyday for many years, but it finally started to get a bit "iffy" in the connection to the base and would turn on seemingly at random. The base showed some signs of arcing, so it was time to replace it.This kettle was most likely made by the same company that made the Bodum. The design of the base and the kettle's connection to the base are almost identical. The only real difference we've noticed in this kettle is that the indicator for the "minimum water level required" is a bit higher than in the Bodum. It's not a big deal, and I'm sure if you put less water in - enough for 1 cup of tea, e.g. - it would be fine. The kettle heats the water very rapidly, as mentioned by other reviewers. There is an on-off switch with a light, and you can turn the kettle off before the cycle completes, if you wish. This is different than some of the new Bodums (Isis, I believe?)The one review that gave me doubts about buying this one was the comments about the "plastic" taste. I cycled 3 full kettles of water thru the unit - bringing each to a boil - before trying it with tea. Neither my wife nor I have ever detected a "plastic" taste.We've had the kettle for just over a week, using it several times a day with no issues, no complaints. Just a good feeling that we got a good deal on a great kettle. I was not paid to write this review, and if Proctor-Silex sends me a check, I will return it. Well, maybe not...
