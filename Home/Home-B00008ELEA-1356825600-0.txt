review/summary: Farberware FCP280 8-cup percolatorreview/text: This percolator is like the same model I had before--therefore I wanted another one. The thing that I noticed about this particular one that it is lighter in weight and the writing (cups) is harder for me to see while putting in the water.It does make good coffee .I just wish we could get more products made in the USA--they still are the best and we can employ more workers here. Also, I believe that our materials are far more superior.Esther West
