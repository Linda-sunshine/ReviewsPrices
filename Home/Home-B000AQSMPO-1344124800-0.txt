review/summary: It will inevitably breakreview/text: I've had my Keurig for about two years. It broke and I've tried everything. Scale has built up in the pump and now they are recommending you use filtered water. How about having a filter built in like a brita? No amount of descaling using vinegar has been able to get my Keurig working consistently. This product is designed so that there is no way to open it up to clean out scale that has built up inside of the machine. And of course, Keurig can do nothing but offer me the same model at a discount. I think for a $100+ coffee pot, it should work longer than two years.(I do not leave my machine on when I am not using it and make two cups a day at most. So I'd consider it lightly used.)
