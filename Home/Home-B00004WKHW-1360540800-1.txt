review/summary: I love this food processor!review/text: This is the second of these I have owned. My other one gave up after 10-12 years of strong use. Considering how well my old one worked, there was no question if I would buy another Cuisinart or not. It's great for chopping onions, green peppers, etc., but be careful because it works so fast it can turn the onions, etc., to soup. When this one wears out, I will definitely buy another of the same brand.
