review/summary: Tough to get the mix correctreview/text: We like our new Keurig system, but the coffee supplied with the system was waaayyyyy too strong for us. Sooo, we opted for the reuseable jnsert, and use our own brand. We are still trying to get that perfect cup of coffee first thing in the morning, but find that sometimes it's just a little too strong, and at other times it's just too weak. We continue to change the amount we use and are determined to get it right.we are sure that once we get the mix right, we'll love it. It's just taking longer than either of us thought it would.
