review/summary: Fabulous blender!review/text: I had a Black & Decker blender, but it was having problems blending my smoothies, which have frozen fruit in them. So my husband found this blender on Amazon and ordered it for me. It's wonderful, and has NO problem with my frozen fruit. I make several smoothies a week and haven't had a single problem yet. Love it!
