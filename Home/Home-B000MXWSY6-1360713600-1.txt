review/summary: Sony Clock Radioreview/text: The best feature of this clock is the button that allows me to choose how bright the display is. I like the least bright display. I have found the alarm on loud is very quiet. I have to set the other alarm on radio, if it is very important for me to wake up (such as an early plane departure).
