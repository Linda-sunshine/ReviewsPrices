review/summary: odor overpowered everythingreview/text: The minty smell was so strong that even after we removed from the room it stayed on the sheets and mattress for days. I ended up giving it away to just get it out of my house. The chocolate mint smell must be used to cover up whatever other bad chemical smell is used in manufacturing and I can only imagine what chemicals we were breathing in all night.
