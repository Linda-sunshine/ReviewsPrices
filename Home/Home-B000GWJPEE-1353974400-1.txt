review/summary: Not as good as other humidifiersreview/text: I bought this for my four-year-old Hello Kitty fan. She had another Crane humidifier when she was smaller (elephant) that worked well and still works for her little sister. This is not nearly the same quality. After a couple of months it died. No steam, just a lovely melted plastic smell. While this may be good if you are trying to finish off your family, it will not help finish off a head cold. I think the little night light in it may be part of a design flaw.I would recommend the elephant, and will be heading out to Target to get one this week.
