review/summary: Cuisinart Automatic Burr Mill never diesreview/text: I have the Cuisinart Automatic Burr Mill I don't think the model is the same but it looks just like this one. I have had it now 6 years and it is going strong never a problem. I do after a few refills of beans turn it upside down and tap the sides to any little bits of coffee grind and any little bits of coffee beans out. I am very happy with this it has grinded alot of coffee beans.
