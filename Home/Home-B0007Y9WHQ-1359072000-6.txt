review/summary: So far so good!review/text: Just arrived yesterday, used for first time tonight.First, tried a large sweet potato- a bit bulky and awkward, but most of the potato covered an entire cookie sheet in curls. Problem was that the potato shriveled up in the oven and came out more like a garnish than fries. No big deal, I'll try a regular potato next time, and a different blade for sweet potatoes.Next up was the zucchini, this was a breeze. I just slice up the cores for little pieces, to eat, or put into compost, or snack upon- don't know why this is such a big deal. Spirals were realllllly long, fun!Then a large carrot- deliberately purchased those jumbo-sized loose carrots for purposes of spiralizing. Again, rather easy and fun.Last, the cucumber. A bit wet toward the end but worked decently. Not as impressive with presentation, but that's to be expected.With some almond butter-sesame-ginger-agave-Tabasco sauce, this made a surprisingly satisfying meal about an hour ago. I keep waiting to be hungry again, but hasn't happened yet. And there's quite a bit leftover for another 2-3 bowls.For the price, it probably deserves 5 stars, but people might think that indicates "perfection." I can't attest to the durability just yet- will have to keep on using it. No problem!
