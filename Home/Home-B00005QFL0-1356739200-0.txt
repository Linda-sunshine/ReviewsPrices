review/summary: Out of the box, A WINNER Just a little complicatedreview/text: Can not comment on reliability as this is new. However the first basic white loaf came out GREAT. As an engineer I measured VERY carefully and followed the complicated directions. Now for a few small negatives. 1, I would have preferred an easier operator interface. You CAN NOT just take from the box and push buttons to make bread. You MUST read the directions very carefully. It is a very complex machine. 2, I would have preferred a small window on the lid to allow me to observe the baking progress. 3, I would have preferred a smaller form factor. BUT do NOT let these mild critisizements stop you from buying this machine. It is a winner and keeper for now.
