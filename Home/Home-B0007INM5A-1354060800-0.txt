review/summary: Tincture of Coffeereview/text: I finally succumbed to a single-cup machine, one that uses the Senseo pods. I had no interest in using those, and so bought the two-pack of Ecopad's filter. I crammed in as much coffee as possible, then could not believe the result. See-through! So, not only are they vastly overpriced, if you like a strong cup of coffee they are not for you. And, frankly, they are not that easy to fill. (I solved my dilemma but simply cutting down a #4 cone filter and using about 3 tablespoons of good coffee.)
