review/summary: Great Machinereview/text: I bought this for my wife who drinks coffee. She was using a machine that ground and brewed the coffee bean. It was also a great unit, however, she was throwing away 1/2 of a carafe of costly fresh ground and brewed coffee daily. Since using this machine, she gets a perfectly brewed cup of coffee whenever she wants one without brewing a whole pot!Even though the K-cups are a bit more spendy than whole beans the ability to brew a cup at a time consistently perfect alleviates waste and is costing less.The machine sounds are entertaining also, sort of like a fog horn.
