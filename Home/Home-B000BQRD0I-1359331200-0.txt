review/summary: good for a little whilereview/text: This thing worked great for a while. It steamed well, but it was very lightweight, easy to tip. My wife never liked it for that reason. After a little over a year, (and we do not use it much) the hose broke at the connection (plastic fitting). I actually repaired the hose but it was downhill after that. It would stop steaming , got very erratic. It's going in the trash.
