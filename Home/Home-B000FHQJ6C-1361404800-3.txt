review/summary: Worth $25, Not Morereview/text: This is essentially my 4th juicer.Started with a Jack Lalane Juicer (smallest one) and that worked. Clean up was terrible. Then started using a Vitamix, blending everything and then hand straining with a nut milk bag. Very fast, very smooth but messy green hands. I then got a deal on a Omega VRT 350 slow juicer. Great juicer, only problem is it takes a long time to make juicer. Probably 20 min to juice enough for 2 drinks, very hard when you're trying to juice fast.I got this HB Big Mouth on craigslist new for $25. Couldnt pass it up. I want to juice fast again and need a juicer thats quick.It makes quick and smooth drinks with some issues:- It wants to throw the produce back out of the shoot. I'm not sure if this is because it too shallow or what but I find myself tossing in produce and quickly using the pusher. It wont launch anything back at you but toss pieces in the air making a mess.- the pulp and lid dont seal completely and when juicing greens you can see pieces escape through these gaps, making a mess of the counter and area.- kind of loud- juice container is small. I use a bowl so I can juice enough for two 24oz shakers.I've tried my friends $140 Breville and these problems dont exist and that wasnt the top of the line Breville.For the $25 I paid I'm happy. I'll sell my Jack Lalane and break even. I wouldnt spend more than that. I'd look for a used Breville on ebay or Craigslist.If you're looking to juice fast and are in a hurry like everyone in the morning, you need a juicer thats fast and efficient. Don't worry about being able to store the juice for 3 days bull crap, you're going to drink it within hours.Now, if you have time and can juice the night before then the Omega is the way to go. That being said, the Omega with the finnest basket still doesnt make as smooth as juice as this guy.
