review/summary: Make great square cubes, but tray is a little flimsyreview/text: These work perfectly as advertised, and they make great perfect cubes. They can be tricky to fill, though. My freezer is all drawers (annoying, and not Tovolo's fault), but the flimsy trays make it easy to drip and spill while putting them in the freezer. This was a problem at first, but I've become accustomed to is, and love using this product.
