review/summary: Great Espressoreview/text: OK, so I wanted great espresso at home without having to pay a fortune for an espresso machine. This did the job very well. The espresso smells and tastes great. I did also buy some very good espresso grind coffee(Illy), so that may have something to do with it. The only drawback is that it is very hard to push the plunger down. I'm assuming that's because it is brand new, but I have to push down on the plunger with both hands and a good amount of pressure.
