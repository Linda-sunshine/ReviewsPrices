review/summary: I love this Juicer!review/text: This juicer is perfect. It is quiet and fast. I went from a small Hamilton Beach that took forever to cut, juice and clean up and was messy and loud. The Breville is puts the juice were it belongs and not all down the sides or on the counter. The wide mouth allows me to feed large portion and saves time not having to cut everything into small portions. I just love this product and would recommend to anyone looking for a good juicer.
