review/summary: perfection doesn't exist, but...review/text: these ice cube trays are bomb. that they actually make cubes is pretty cool. i was a little concerned that these trays are smaller than the standard ice trays. there's 1 less cube to these too. after making some ice it seems it doesn't matter. i didn't actually measure the volume of either cube, but these cubes by visual comparison appear to be larger than standard cubes. this combined w/the trays being smaller is a plus considering freezer space. the best part is removing the cubes. the old trays keep crack/breaking from being twisted to get the ice out. these trays only require a push on the back to get the cubes out. if you want it to be a little easier, run some warm/hot water on the back of the tray before ice removal.this is an awesome ice tray. i'll be getting a few more of these!
