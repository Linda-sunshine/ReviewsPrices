review/summary: A must-have if you are military member deploying!review/text: I'm currently deployed to XXX in Southwest Asia. The mattresses here are so thin that the springs stick into your back. After purchasing this cover, the mattress has become much more comfortable. This is the best 11 dollars I have ever spent and will recommend to all troops deploying here to purchase a mattress pad. As far as the drying, I have line-dryed the pad and have not had any problems.
