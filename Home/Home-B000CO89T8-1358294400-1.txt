review/summary: Satisfied customer.review/text: I received this today and immediately put it to use as my coffee had gotten cold. I reheated my coffee (a decision I made after reading other reviews before purchase) to a drinkable warm - a bit above luke warm. I am using a Mr. Coffee decorative (white with black flowers) ceramic mug, approximately 5 inches tall with a smaller base than rim. It has a removable plastic round top with a rubber stopper underneath and a twist closure to open and close a drink opening on top. Even leaving the top twisted open my coffee warmed to hotter than the original temperature and heated above that as I drank it. I also appreciate the long cord - approximately 36&#34;.The only possible con that I see is that after an hour of use the wooden table that it's sitting on is warm (not hot) directly underneath the warmer, so I may or may not opt to put something underneath of it in the future.I'm reviewing this item because I was a little apprehensive before I ordered because of some of the more negative reviews. I don't know if it would heat a cup of coffee to hot from cold, but I don't believe that is what this is designed for and I wouldn't expect it to. It did, however, keep my coffee at a perfect drinking temperature for me.
