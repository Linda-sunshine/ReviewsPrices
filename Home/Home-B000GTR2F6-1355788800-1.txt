review/summary: Very Goodreview/text: I love the Keurig. Fresh hot coffee, tea, hot cocoa every time. The only thing I would like to see is additional sizes in the coffee K cups I can buy.....and a better way to use my own coffee. The water runs through to fast to give it enough flavor when I try to use the Keurig holder.
