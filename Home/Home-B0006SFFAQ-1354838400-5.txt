review/summary: if you want the orangereview/text: We bought the coffee pot because it was first advertised as just orange. We actually wanted orange but when it came it was much more upscale than orange ....by a long shot. To me it's the same bronze color that they've chosen for Jeeps. Much more posh than we expected and puts the toaster to shame. As to how it works? We've had it about 2.5 weeks only - not long enough to say but carafe = no drips no spills.
