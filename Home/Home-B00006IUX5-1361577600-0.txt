review/summary: Cord unwinding and winding is not easyreview/text: I fear that eventually the cord is going to be torn apart each time I pull it out of the body and later wind it back. Right now I tried to put the grinder close to an AC outlet so I don't have to handle the cord often. I think the grinder does the job well, although the particle sizes it produced are uneven. Well worth the money spent!
