review/summary: Let me play my Mandolinereview/text: I love this thing! I slice and dice so much more quickly and efficiently. The only thing that gets annoying is when the final chunk gets stuck in the blade. It's difficult to get the guard to hold on to the small piece that remains after the rest has been sliced. I've sliced lemons, cucumbers, onions, limes, radishes, carrots, and potatoes. The list of possibilities for slicing is endless. I tried slicing a red delicious apple and the device couldn't handle it, :(. The mandoline also has some problems slicing small carrots. Overall, this device is great and I use it all the time. It saves time in the kitchen and allows even cuts for vegetables and fruits.
