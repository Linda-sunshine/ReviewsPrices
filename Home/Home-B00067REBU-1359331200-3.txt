review/summary: Awesome!review/text: I got this same exact bread machine about 10 years ago before it finally gave up & died. My family, including my extended family, was so devastated that I wouldn't be making my homemade bread anymore that I had to get another ASAP. I hate cooking but this is so easy & everyone loves my bread so much! I can throw it together & the machine does the work for me. I get rave reviews over my bread everywhere I take it & it literally takes me minutes to make- the bread nachine does the rest & takes a 2 lb loaf about 3 hours to complete. I love this machine & hope my new one lasts at least 10 years. I cannot praise this machine enough. (I did tweak the supplied recipes by adding more butter & sugar, etc.)
