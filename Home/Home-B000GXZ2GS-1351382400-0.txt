review/summary: This thing is awesome!review/text: The Aerobie Aeropress is my new favorite coffee maker. I was looking for something I could use at work that was easy and fast. This fits both of those categories. I work in a factory and I can't really leave out a plug in drip coffee pot because it would get dirt and particles in it. Before I found this, I was using a mini single cup drip-style coffee pot that I found at a local Vietnemese grocery store. It worked good, but would allow the occasional granual to pass through it's filter. The aerobie aeropress has the little paper filter in it, which works great. I also like my coffee pretty strong, and the aeropress is perfect for that. It's simple to use and really easy to clean, overall this thing is awesome.
