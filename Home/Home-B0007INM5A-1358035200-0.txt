review/summary: Greatest pods in the business!review/text: Got a Hamilton Beach pod brewer for the wife for Christmas and she became frustrated with both the price AND availability of commercial pods. Immediately ordered these and they have turned out to be the cat's meow for pod brewing. We not only will never need to buy pre-filled pods but, with our own coffee grinder, are enjoying all our favorite coffee blends at grocery store coffee prices thanks to these little reusable pods. They are easy to use, fit our brewer perfectly, are easy to wash and keep clean and seem to go forever. We are now both greatly enjoying the usefulness of our little pod brewer. Thank you, Amazon for a great deal!Addendum: Feb. 17, 2013To all you folks that complain about getting weak coffee out of these pods, you can't just use grocery store coffee that comes with a standard percolator or drip grind, the grind is too coarse for the water to get proper leaching out of that grind. You have to grind it finer to make it completely useable in these pods. We use a simple electric grinder that grinds about a cup of grounds at a time and grind it on high speed for about 30 seconds. We are now getting better coffee every time out of our maker than we were getting out of factory filled pods and are only using 1/4 teaspoon of coffee to do it. We are so happy with these pods that we have purchased 2 more sets just to have them ready in the future.
