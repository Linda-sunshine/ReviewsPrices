review/summary: Larryreview/text: I purchase the Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner as a replacement. It has worked just like it is suppose to...it does a good job of cleaning and removing excess water. I find I use the surge soap button probably more than I think I should. Overall considering price, I am very happy with this carpet cleaner and would recommend this product.
