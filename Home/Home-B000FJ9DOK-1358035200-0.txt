review/summary: Second one I have had. Only water bottle where mouthpiece is covered. Lid on this one does not pop up smoothly.review/text: I loved my first one of these which I purchased at a retail store. This was only place I could find a replacement (after I dropped the first one on the concrete and it started leaking). The mouthpiece cover should pop open when you push the button and this one catches. Does not affect the overall performance but I am disappointed that it does not work correctly.
