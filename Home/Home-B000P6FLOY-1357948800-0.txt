review/summary: Didn't Give Me Accurate Results a Few Timesreview/text: I always use thermometers for roasting beef or poultry to check for &#34;doneness&#34;. Before purchasing this product, I had a Martha Stewart digital thermometer that I used over 50 times until the metal probe broke and it worked every single time without issues. I tried this product a few times with a Chicken and a beef roast, and it would give me consistent lower readings, causing me to under cook my meal.
