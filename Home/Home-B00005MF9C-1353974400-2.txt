review/summary: So far so good.review/text: Some users seem to have problems with this coffeemaker. I like it fine. One reviewer even complained about it leaking brewed coffee. It seems pretty sturdy to me. No glass parts to break. Paper filters, #2, can easily be used if you don't like the permanent filter idea. I recommend it for those who want to brew one big cup.
