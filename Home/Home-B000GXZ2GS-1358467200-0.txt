review/summary: Buy of the decade!review/text: I can't think of a better purchase that I have made in the last 10 years that was so reasonable in price and produced as advertised.This little beauty produces some fine tasting concentrated coffee shots. Especially if you are keeping fresh beans (I store in a Vacu Vin) and grinding them with a decent grinder (I grind with a Capresso Infinity) right before you press. I would say its fun to use, because I still get excited to use it after 3 months. The quality of the shots it produces keeps me coming back. It will take a little bit to get your system down (get your grind setting right, getting the water to 175 deg, making sure you stir for 10 seconds before you press, wet the plunger, slow and steady press etc.). Sometimes I&#8217;m not thinking clearly early in the morning without my coffee&#8230; heh heh! It is not complicated to use. Overall, very happy with my Aerobie AeroPress.
