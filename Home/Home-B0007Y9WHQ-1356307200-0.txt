review/summary: Great for zucchini noodles!review/text: After going gluten free I missed spaghetti more than anything. The noodles this makes are great. I use about 2-3 zucchini's for two (big eaters) people and after slicing them up on this, Idrop them in boiling water for 3-4 minutes, then take out and immediately run cold cold water over them to stop the cooking. Then I pour the hot spaghetti sauce over them and it's a super quick and super easy gluten free meal that even my (very gluten loving) boyfriend considers one of his favorites! Everyone's happy!
