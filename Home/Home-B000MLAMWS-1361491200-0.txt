review/summary: Very Disappointingreview/text: There is an issue in the gearbox with this model mixer that kitchen aide refuses to fix for the customers.My wife and I own one of these mixers. In 5 years of owning it, it has needed to be repaired 4 times. It's the same part every time, no one will admit that there's an issue and if you do some diging on the net you'll find many others with the same problem. The cost of replacing this gear is around $100. We could have purchased a second mixer with the money we've spent repairing this thing already.It's recently broken that same gear again and I'm faced with buying a different brand mixer that won't accept any of the attachments my wife and I have (which, we have quite a few) or spending the money to replace this gear again knowing that I'm out another $100 and the problem still isn't fixed.Very disappointing.
