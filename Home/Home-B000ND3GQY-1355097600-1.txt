review/summary: Wok cooking is the BEST!review/text: I haven't had a wok to cook in for years so I was overjoyed when I received this wok and the Cuisinart Multi-clad set for my birthday (I know, seems like a strange present but when you're in the kitchen as much as I am it makes your life SO much easier to have excellent cookware!). I literally cook in this wok on average 4 days out of the week. I even learned to cook Thai cuisine because of it! It's performance is spectacular and it's so easy to clean and buff up back to super shiny (FYI Bar Keeper's Friend works the best of any scrub I've tried). I love the lid too! Even more convenience! You will not waste your money on this product!
