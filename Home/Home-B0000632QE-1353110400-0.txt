review/summary: Absolute waste of money.review/text: I bought this for my wife as a surprise. The surprise was that it was a piece of junk. The first one we got, and yes it was new, had bent blades, a broken ring, and the screws were crooked. I figured with all these great reviews it was a fluke.The manufacturer sent us another one. So the first was a fluke? No. We had similar issues with the second one straight from the factory. This one was however useable so we figured we would at least try it. The results are pathetic. Slicing an apple as a test dummy we tried all blades. The french fry like blade makes a sliver so thin I cannot think of a use for it. The straight cutting blade would work decently, but the screws stick up and essentially mutilate the sliced object.If you wrote a positive review for this, you have never cooked before.If you buy this, you will write a review very similar to this one.
