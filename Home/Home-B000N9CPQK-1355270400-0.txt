review/summary: PLEASANTLY SURPRISEDreview/text: Well, I was reviewing this since I decided to get one.There were so many diff. kinds and of course the price range& brands and etc inclined. So confused what to get as there were quite a few pros and cons regarding this matter. It was then the best seller product for HEPA and the cheapest and yet with good reviews that got my attention. Whats 50 bucks if you get good air and if breaks down after few months so be it, as to buy the other high end brands and still got broken, . I got the product yesterday, and turn it on TODAY on my daughters room who is suffering from Severe Asthma. After few mins, 7mins to be specific, after I vacuum and clean her room then plug it in shut the door, I came back to check, the smell of her room was just soooooo diff. The noise is tolerable just adjust it to 1 then its all good. I dont plan to use the IONIZER. I am more concern on the dust, pollen and etc thats bothering and hindering her breathing and often sneezing than the IONIZER option, nevertheless its cool coz u can shut it off.
