review/summary: GREAT machinereview/text: Being European "imports" we we're very unhappy with the American bread (Too fluffy, falvoured and not dense enough). We know that the situation has improved and that good quality bread can be bought in the US, but if you don't want to drive just for getting some bread, this machine is excellent. The build standard is very good and all metal. It's simple to use and makes excellent quality fresh breads every day. We use it for a family of 5 and the L or XL breads do suffice in size. Highly recommended!!!
