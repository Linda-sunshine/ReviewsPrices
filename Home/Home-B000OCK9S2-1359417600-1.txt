review/summary: Broke after 2 weeksreview/text: This clock/sound therapy machine is garbage. Don't waste your money. We bought it because it is supposed to be able to run on batteries. We live in Europe and regular sound machines are not common or available, so battery powered was very important to us. While in the US over the holidays we received the clock/sound machine and it worked for 2 weeks while we were in the US (plugged in to an electrical outlet). But once we put batteries in it, it worked for about a week then died. Replacing the batteries doesn't fix it. We also tried plugging it in with an European outlet adapter and it still doesn't work.
