review/summary: Great quality for the price, some learning curve requiredreview/text: This was a great &#34;beginner&#34; espresso machine for my family. It is messy if you don't use it right, so you have to learn, for instance, that it &#34;likes&#34; a fine grind and will leak if you try to pack a courser grind. The steamer nozzle also is set a bit low, so you have to either elevate the unit or use a smaller steamer container than you might otherwise want to use, otherwise you will be tilting the container a lot and making a mess. It does not have a separate steam chamber, so you do have to wait for it heat from &#34;brew&#34; to &#34;steam&#34; levels, but it doesn't take long. But once you figure out the idiosyncracies, it works like a charm.
