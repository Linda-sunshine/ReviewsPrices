review/summary: This is awesome!review/text: I have been using this like crazy once I figured out how to make it work. I have an older FoodSaver and the hose wasn't staying connected well. I tried all the different suggestions of other reviewers and none of them worked. I even called FoodSaver and they told me they thought my motor was old and tried to sell me a new one! (Very annoying!) I finally pushed the hose down where it connects to the Food Saver while I was sealing jars and it worked! Even though I had twisted the end of the hose on like instructed, it still wasn't getting a good connection. But now it works and I love it!
