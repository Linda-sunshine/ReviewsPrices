review/summary: Liked it until it broke todayreview/text: I bought this May 2012 and today it decided to stop working and the motor started smoking and melted. I have only had it for 3 months and I was not using this juicer on a daily basis just a few times a month. Sucks that I can't do anything about this, they should have some type of warranty or something, 3 months seems like a short period for it to break.
