review/summary: Saved me this winterreview/text: This thing is EXCELLENT. Such a great price point ($25 at the time of this review), and it really gets quite hot.400W or 800W settings, heats up quick and can keep a small room cozy.Only con is there is no fan, so it won't circulate heat well. Needs to be close to you our have a fan in the room to really spread the warmth.
