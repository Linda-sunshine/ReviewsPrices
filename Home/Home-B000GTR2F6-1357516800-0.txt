review/summary: Warningreview/text: I just tossed in the garbage my less than 2 year old Keurig Brewer. This is the second one I owned and the second one that didn't last for more than two years. I should have heeded the negitive reviews I read on Amazon. The good reviews are from people who haven't had one for a longer period of time. I agree the brewer makes it very convienent to make coffee but they are not reliable over the long run. The brewer should last much longer than the ones I owned considering the cost of these brewers. Customer service offered a discount on another brewer but they couldn't come close to the price Kohls Department Store offers If less that two years of service is acceptable to you then go ahead and buy one.
