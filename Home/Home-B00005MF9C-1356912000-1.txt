review/summary: Replacement for 4-cup coffee makerreview/text: So far; so good with this 1-cup coffee brewer & a fresh, hot cup of coffee every time. I'm saving money not having to use paper coffee filters anymore. However, it is much handier to remove grounds in a paper filter rather than dumping from the plastic reusable filter that comes with this product. That said, I can always try a paper filter inside the plastic one & additionally, it may eliminate the fine residue that is in the bottom of the mug. All in all, I would recommend this product to anyone who lives in a household where they're the only coffee drinker.
