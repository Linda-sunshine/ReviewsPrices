review/summary: Proctor Silex E1660BY Fresh Grind Coffee Grinder, Whitereview/text: I'm not using this for coffee but for spices and herbs and bread and cracker crumbs when I just need a bit. It is easily cleaned between grinding different spices and herbs with about 1/4 of a slice of bread. You can save those crumbs for later use. I also like the retractable cord. It retracts manually-you twist the top. It's much easier to store that way. It's quiet, smooth, easy to empty, and works quickly. It had free shipping when I got mine which made it even more attractive as it was cheaper in the first place.
