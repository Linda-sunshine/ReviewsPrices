review/summary: Very light...review/text: Infact I thought that there was a mistake because the box it was shipped in was so light.This is a great assisting heater... great for the bedrrom at night if you're like me and don't want to heat the whole house at night.It stands very solid on the floor and you won't have to worry about it dumping over too easy.Don't expect it to save you skin if there's a snow storm outside and it's the only thing you have but all in all I am very happy with it for what I use it for.
