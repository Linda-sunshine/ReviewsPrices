review/summary: Reasonably Efficientreview/text: I cook meat probably 4 times a week and was looking to save time cutting and grinding. I got this at a good price and think the positive reviews are mostly on target. Would have been nice to have a piece to mash the meat down a bit for tougher jobs (e.g., steak), and it was a bit unsettling using it for the first time and hearing what sounded like cracking plastic as it struggled to process fatty cubed steak. In fact, that is a warning; that it struggles to process anything that's not a fairly light job. I read that it was easy to clean, and that may be true compared to its competitors, but if you use it frequently it will still be a bit of a job. I guess I'll be grinding more at a time and just storing it to prevent frequent cleanings. I am a bit disappointed that I ended up spending more time setting up, grinding, resetting (as it struggled with fatty steak), grinding again, disassembling, cleaning and storing than I would have if I had just cut the meat as usual, as the whole point was to save time.Overall though, it gets the job done and I'll be using it regularly.
