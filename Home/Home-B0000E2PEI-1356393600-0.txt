review/summary: Worked great - for only 6 months!review/text: Gave this a 2 because, although at first it worked great, it quit working after 6 months. Changed the battery, tried resetting, you name it. Worse, the exact same model is available at Walmart, cheaper of course and no shipping charges. Would also be easier to return. While it worked, it worked great for the most part. Important not to move it around a lot or it resets but otherwise fine. There are just too many other products out there that are more reliable. And the &#34;lifetime warranty&#34; - again you have to pay for postage to mail it to them for either repair/replace. Think twice on this one.
