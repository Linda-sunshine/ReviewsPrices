review/summary: A fun and convenient kitchen gadgetreview/text: I wanted a dehydrator so my husband and I could dehydrate our own food and our dog's (home cooked) food for backpacking. We were looking for one that would dry foods evenly and quickly and be easy to clean. This meets our expectations. We've done dried apple slices, raspberries, basil, fruit rollups, and hops - no backpacking meals yet, but I expect that to go well.The food on the top trays does tend to dry a bit faster than the bottom trays but it isn't enough of a difference to make it inconvenient. The temperature knob is on the lid. In addition to marks for the actual temperatures, it tells you what temperature to use for different foods. The dehydrator is very easy to clean. Everything that comes into contact with the food can be cleaned because the heating element and power cord are on the lid. The base is smooth and easy to clean if anything drips down. The trays are as easy as they can be to clean.
