review/summary: Best pan and unbelievable pricereview/text: I am so happy to discover this brand name of cast iron. I am not surprised that everyone likes it as it is made of durable cast iron and cooks evenly. I have spent way too much on other non-stick that did not last for more than a year even though they have 5, 10 years or life time warranty. I thought that I did not know how to take care of them until I did some research and found out it is not me. This requires minimum cleaning and stays in great shape. I like the size and the light weight as well.
