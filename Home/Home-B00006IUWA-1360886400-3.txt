review/summary: Good item!review/text: So far works well, just what I wanted. Light weight, not heavy or clumbersome. Does blow the popcorn out rather forcefully, but not a real issue. Great for making carmel popcorn., or just for a late night snack, even have one at the cabin, for popcorn around the campfire.
