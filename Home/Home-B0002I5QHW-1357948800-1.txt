review/summary: Norpro Meat Grinderreview/text: I have a new found hobby in sausage making, and purchased the Norpro Grinder based on price. My expectations were low since it was so inexpensive. I use the Norpro Grinder to grind vegetables, pork and beef usually in 5-10lb increments. This grinder is an animal and a great value. The suction cup hold the unit firm, the unit assembles and washes up good. No wasted meat pockets within the unit. I am happy with this product.
