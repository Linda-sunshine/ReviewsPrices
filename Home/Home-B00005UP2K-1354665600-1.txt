review/summary: 1 Year Reviewreview/text: I got this mixer as a Christmas Gift last December so I have been using it for about a year now. This review is solely for the product as it was not bought from Amazon. The mixer still works just as well today as it did the first time I used it. I hand wash all the pieces and they have held up well. I have not had to buy any replacement parts. My bowl is glass and not metal and has no chips or defects. I keep my mixer on the counter because I think it is nice to look at and because it is so heavy it would be a pain to move constantly in and out of cupboards, but it still looks brand new. It has held up to daily wear and tear and weekly usage well. It was expensive, but I fully expect it to last me until I can hand it down to my daughter. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. If you have younger children who like to help cook I would recommend the metal bowl. I will be purchasing one as the glass bowl is too heavy for my daughter.
