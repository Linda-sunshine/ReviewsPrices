review/summary: grounds fly all over the place; broke within two monthsreview/text: I had an old version of this maker, which I would give 3 starts -- it ground the coffee, but it always made a mess. I swore, when it broke, I'd buy a different model. Alas, it broke when I had a house guest who kindly replaced it (!). This one got grounds all over the place; the coffee constantly clogged the chamber, requiring a lot of turning it upside down and spanking it -- which wastes a lot of coffee. Now, this one has broken -- after only 2 months.
