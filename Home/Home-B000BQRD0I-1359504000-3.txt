review/summary: Up and running in 30 minreview/text: This new steamer arrived yesterday at 3:30pm and by 4pm I was trying it on my first garment. Easy assembly from a clearly written users manual make this an easy task.After studying the choices at Amazon and reading some customer reviews for all I choose this one andnow my brief experience proves me right. My first garment was wrinkle free in minutes. So it performsas promised. This is a short term experiance but the unit appears to be engineered and made to last, so Iam expecting long term service from this purchase.One problem the fabric brush that snaps onto the head of the delivery hose falls off often so a call to theirCustomer Service, was further proof that my choice was right. a curious and knowledgeable agentin 5 minutes assuring me that a replacement part was on it's way to me. So this experience againvalidates my choice.If your looking for the less expensive Fabric Steamer I don't think this one will be disappointing.good Luck
