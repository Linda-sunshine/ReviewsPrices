review/summary: Very Disfuctionalreview/text: The lever that you pull down to begin toasting, doesn't stay down. It is impossible to toast unless you do this. You have to hold it down very hard to keep it down.Also, the rack on the inside is supposed to come out when you open the door, but it keeps slipping when ever the door of the oven is opened. You will end up burning your hand trying to get something out. Stay away from this product.Extremely bad quality!
