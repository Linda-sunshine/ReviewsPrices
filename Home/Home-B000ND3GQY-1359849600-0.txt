review/summary: Does the trick, but burns easilyreview/text: I love using a wok - I cook everything in it. I don't typically buy non-stick items just because of the way they cook, but I think it's a must with a high heat product like a wok. Cuisinart usually builds great products and I don't really think it's their fault that I give it three stars, but spend a little more to get a non-stick wok - easier to clean, season and take care of.
