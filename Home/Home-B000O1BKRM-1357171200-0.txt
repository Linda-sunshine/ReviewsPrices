review/summary: great trays for homemade baby foodreview/text: I made my own baby food theses trays were GREAT!! I would puree the vegies and freeze them in these then plae each cube in a fold type sandwhich bag and place all of them in a gallon size freezer bag (dated and labled). I really liked these because of the size they are 1 oz cubes (almost a perfect square). made it super easy to take out the right amount. would HIGHLY recommend ( I have to many moms I know) the only complait I have is I wish they had lids, I used the cling type universal covers (the ones that look like shower caps) worked well enough I would wash and reuse them also
