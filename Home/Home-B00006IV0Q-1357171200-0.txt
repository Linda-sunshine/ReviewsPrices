review/summary: Perfect coffee every timereview/text: Perfect coffee every time...except the first brew. I broke my last coffee pot in the sink and after looking through a ton of different Mr. Coffee pots I decided to look for the best reviewed coffee makers and stumbled upon this percolator. I had never seen or used one before but decided to risk the $30. I tried brewing the first pot with a filter and all I got was hot water so I tried it again without the filter and I have never looked back. It makes consistent coffee each time I use it an it works fine with the standard grinder I have at home. I returned the unit with all the bells and whistles we got as a gift for Christmas. Why mess with perfection.
