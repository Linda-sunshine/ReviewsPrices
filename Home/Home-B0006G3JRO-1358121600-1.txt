review/summary: This product deserves no starsreview/text: I bought this hand blender from macys after my braun blender died after 7 years. I was excited to buy a sleek looking stainless steel hand blender but this was a waste of money. Like all the 1 star reviews, after about 3 months the shaft begin to loosen and the plastic teeth fell apart, making the blender unusable. I went out and bought a Cuisinart Smartstick, bad mistake as well. That thing doesn't blend anything! The blades are dull, and unless you want something mixed, it is useless for purees and sauces. So now I'm done with cuisinart and I'm in search of a new brand. Too bad they stopped selling braun here, that was an amazing blender.
