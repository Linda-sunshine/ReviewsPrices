review/summary: Good for the pricereview/text: The first time I got this steamer, the little plastic ring that screws the hose onto the base crumbled into pieces when I tried to attach it. Amazon was awesome about sending me another one right away and arranging for me to send the broken one back hassle-free. But beware when you are putting it together to not tighten that ring too much.I've had the steamer itself for over a year now, and I have not used an iron since. It works really well and does what it's supposed to. Just be careful not to catch your finger or hand in the steam...ouch! If something is really really wrinkly and a thicker fabric, it is not too effective since you'd have to hold the steamer over the wrinkle forever, but for suits, pants, skirts, dresses, jeans, and shirts that have normal post-washing or wearing wrinkles it works great.Definitely not a top of the line steamer, it's still a bit flimsy, but for the price, it's a pretty good one that has been very useful to me for over a year now.
