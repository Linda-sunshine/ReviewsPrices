review/summary: Perk is the best!review/text: I always wondered why certain restaurants served coffee that was better than what I brewed at home. I spent lots of time trying different coffees, a Chemex coffee maker and a top of the line 14 cup Cuisinart coffee maker. Who would have thought the solution would be the lowly perk pot?Granted, the restaurants use big coffee urns, but the results can be duplicated with this little pot, so if you've been to a restaurant that somehow makes the most delicious coffee, soon you will be doing so at home :)Resign yourself to buying a glass top at the time of purchase. Just immediately throw away the plastic one... you're still saving money over a drip coffee maker. Also, wait till the pot cools down before you wash it, otherwise the glass top will break. Additional replacements can be found at your local Kohl's, and they're inexpensive.
