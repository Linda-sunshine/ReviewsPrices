review/summary: Very effectivereview/text: My wife has asthma, badly aggravated at the time by a thyroid problem, unknown to us. I tried this device only wiht the hope that it might make a difference. It did the first night and every night over the last 10 months. When she does not turn it on for any reason, she can feel the difference at night. We use it in a 20 x 20 bedroom, just start it up about 30 minutes before she goes to bed, run it all night, then shut it off in teh am when she gets up. It has a simple open cell foam filter and then a HEPA filter. We have to clean the foam filter every week, which is about a 5 minute job. The HEPA filter takes longer but it I think only has to be done every 2-4 weeks. For people with allergies (which my wife also has) or asthma, this is well worth a try as a solution. We have found it to be very effective. With a good night's sleep, she can tolerate the rest of the day without air flitration.
