review/summary: Better than I expectedreview/text: This is the first time I have used a food processor other than my juicer. I figured it would take a long time to chop and be difficult to clean. Wow, if you hold the button down for more than a few seconds you will end up with onion soup! I found this out the hard way. It is really amazing and fast. Plus I wiped out the food and put the top pieces in the dishwasher. Super easy. Really the only work is cutting your food down to be small enough to fit inside. I highly recommend.
