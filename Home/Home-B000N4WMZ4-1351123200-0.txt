review/summary: Can't live without it!review/text: I never knew I needed a dutch oven until I started learning to really cook from the Pioneer Woman. I bought this thinking the price was steep and have found myself using it constantly! I love the look of the dutch oven, it holds a 4-6lb roast without any trouble and cleans up very easily. The oven is durable, useful and stylish. The price is affordable next to its competitors and will pay for itself over time.
