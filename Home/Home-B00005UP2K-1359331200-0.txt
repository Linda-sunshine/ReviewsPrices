review/summary: Still mixes, but broken beyond adjustment after light usereview/text: I've had this only a few years, and used it occasionally. I do like it, but it has gotten to the point where I can either adjust it for the beater to not hit the bowl, or for it to lock the head, but not both. I have to assume that the mixer blade is sitting lower than it should due to some kind of problem in the innards, but there is no certified repair center in my state, and it will cost $57 to mail it to Kitchenaid and get a diagnostic and quote to repair. Oh well, at least it still mixes. But it won't lock. I've always thought the motor was underpowered, too. Anyway, I just want to add my two cents to the glowing reviews, as I don't feel I've abused this machine enough to warrant the poor alignment that I am seeing on it. And the head not locking is a major PITA.
