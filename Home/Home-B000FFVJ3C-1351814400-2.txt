review/summary: Nesco Dehydratorreview/text: Overall the Nesco DeHydrator was great. We dried a whole batch of Pears from our backyard and it tastes very good.I also made some Indian Ash Guard/ Rice Flour "jerky" that is amazing!A few "irritants" - First, There is no switch control on the unit. One has to unplug to stop the machine. Second, it will be nice if there was a way of viewing the trays thru' transparent window (glass?) , without having to open the lid.Last, not sure how much my electricity bill will be at the end of the month. It takes about 18 - 24 hours to get thru the drying process for a typical batch with multiple trays.
