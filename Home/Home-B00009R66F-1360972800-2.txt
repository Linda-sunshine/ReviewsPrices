review/summary: READ THE 1 STAR REVIEWS BEFORE YOU BUY!review/text: It was just about 6 months old with a low to moderate amount of use when it began to leak water all over the floor. It buckled up our newly refinished wood floors while sitting there before we realized what happened. Then plastic parts began to break off of it. I brought it to a friend of ours who is a repairman for vacuums and shampooers. He looked at what was broken and said it wasn't worth repairing. It did do a good job of cleaning the carpet. BUT it is ridiculously difficult to set it up for the hand/spot attachment. I think they took it to the dump or I would attempt to return it. Amazon is good about that. Leaking is a serious problem for a machine and all the plastic breaking on critical parts is cheap, un-fixable materials.
