review/summary: Love this SteamVac!review/text: I have three dogs. Although none of them shed, they do track dirt into the house every day. I use this SteamVac weekly and it makes a huge difference. I've had other steam vacuums before, and this one is the best. It's light enough to carry easily, makes it easy to use different attachments, and most of all, picks up dirt!!!
