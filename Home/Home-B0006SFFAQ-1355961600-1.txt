review/summary: Fire Hazardreview/text: Be careful! I have loved this coffee maker. Many reviews are written after 1 week of use, so, sure it's great at that point. It's nice looking and it makes good coffee... However, it did something really scary today (we have had it almost exactly 2 years). I smelled a burning smell while the coffee was brewing. I went in the kitchen to find smoke coming out of the machine and it smelled like burnt plastic. It looked like it was about to start a fire. I unplugged it and moved it to let it air out. My husband called Cuisinart and they are replacing it--which is nice, but I'm a little worried about this happening again. It's one thing for a coffee maker to stop working after a couple of years but this is dangerous. I guess we should proactively replace it before the 2-year mark or find out from Cuisinart whether they have changed anything to address this. I did a search on the reviews here on Amazon and found that if you put the word "smoking" or "fire hazard" in your search field you will get at least 40 reviews with this same story. I found them after the fact, luckily there was no fire.
