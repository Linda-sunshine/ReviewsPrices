review/summary: May not need the Le Creuset replacement knobreview/text: Love the pot. I bought the 6qt in red. The product picture shows the black plastic? knob, however mine arrived with a stainless steel Lodge knob so the Le Creuset L9403 replacement knob was not necessary.Le Creuset L9403-45 Stainless-Steel 2-Inch Replacement KnobI'd order the pot first and buy the replacement knob only if necessary.
