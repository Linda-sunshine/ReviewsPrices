review/summary: Works great!review/text: I really don't remember how I even discovered that this thing exists, but ever since I got my hands on one it has become a must have in my kitchen. I like that this is very easy to use, clean, and store (which happens to be on my kitchen counter because it's used so much). The blade it sharp and definitely takes away the tears when slicing onions, not to mention they come out evenly and perfectly.
