review/summary: Great tool for small vegetablesreview/text: I recently bought the mandolin and I have been having fun with it over the past few days. The main reason I bought it was to cut cabbage to uniform size to make saur kraut. Unfortunately, the device is too small and a normal size cabbage head has to be cut into approximately 8 pieces before it ready to shred. With a cabbage (and other larger or awkward shaped vegetables for that matter,) the mandolin's safety guard seems useless.Regarding the setup, if you attempt to follow the instructions, the setup looks difficult. However, I looked at the attachments included and quickly figured it out by tinkering with it. I actually think the device is fairly simple to use and easy to clean (I clean mine in the dishwasher.) I recommend the mandolin but be forewarned that although it can get through large jobs, I think it is better suited for small jobs.
