review/summary: Inconvenient to refill (not good for lazy person)review/text: I bought it last year and have used it for about 1 year. Overall the humidifier works OK. It is quiet ( this is my first humidifier, so I don't know whether it is quieter or nosier than other humidifiers). It is very small (1 gallon), so it only works for a small bedroom (about 18 square meter). The thing I don't like it is that it is very inconvenient to refill it: the inlet is at the bottom, so you need to hold it all the time when you refill it. 1 Gallon of water can only last for about one day, so it is not good for a lazy person.BTW, I used the filter for 1 year and never changed it. It still works well.
