review/summary: Great for Kale Chips!review/text: I bought this sprayer for use on lots of items, but especially on roasting vegetables and making Kale chips. I used to buy Olive Oil from PAM but this way I can use higher quality oil and not pay for extra cans.The Misto comes with short and easy directions, is easy to fill neatly and easy to pump and use. It's a perfect size and looks nice, too. Overall I am very happy with it.
