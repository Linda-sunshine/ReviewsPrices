review/summary: Pretty good for the price.review/text: I had an older Omega, which I liked, but it had an internal collection. It wasn't real easy to clean and I disliked the paper filters.This one is much easier to use, much quieter too. I like the large chute for using whole foods.The only slight negative for me, is the juice is a bit grainier than my Omega.That may not be an issue for most people, as I tend to be a picky eater.My niece has one, and she loves it.
