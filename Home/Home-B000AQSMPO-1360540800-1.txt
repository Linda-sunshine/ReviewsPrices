review/summary: Keurig is a great Product but still disappointed..review/text: the company I purchased this product from was great to work with.. they shipped it super fast.. so I cannot hold it against them.. Keurig is a remarkable company.. so I am very suprised when my B60 Keurig arrived and I gave it as a gift the giftee called me to inform me that they had a large lake on their counter top formed when they decided to have a cup of coffee.. decidedly I took the bottom of the Keurig off and one of the feeder rubber hoses had not been attached to the Pump.. so this was a quality control problem at the Keurig plant.. so I am disappointed.. I have purchased several Keurig makers and will continue to do so..I will purchase my next one from this company if that says anything about the company..
