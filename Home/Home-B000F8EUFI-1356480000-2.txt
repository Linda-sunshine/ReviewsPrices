review/summary: Nothing but a headachereview/text: Bought this Vacuum six months ago and just in its 2nd use the belt came off that runs the brushes. I thought it broke went to the vacuum store bought another belt. Put the old one back on and then it snapped, so I changed belts and continuing having to keep putting it back on. Figured I'd leave this review while I was on here looking for a new vacuum.
