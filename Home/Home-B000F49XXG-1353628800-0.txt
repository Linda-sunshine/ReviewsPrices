review/summary: Performs as Advertisedreview/text: Before purchasing this espresso maker, I read many of the reviews. In spite of some of the expressed dissatisfactions, I ordered it. My previous machine was a Breville, which was not a pump version, and produced unsatisfactory results. The Delongi has been in use for over six months, and I have made a couple of modifications to address design shortcomings:1. The issue with the frothing tube being unable to easily accommodate a 12" pitcher was solved by raising the height of the machine by setting it up on stacked, glued-together ceramic tiles, which I then placed on a thin piece of flexible plastic used to put under rugs so they don't slip. Machine raised; problem solved.2. The plastic frothing nozzle threads can easily be worn so steam escapes from the top. It was advised that the nozzle be removed after each use, but I didn't want to deal with the stripped threads at a later date. So after each use, I run a pitcher of clear water under the frother, turn it on, and let the water spit and froth up, cleaning the inside without having to remove said nozzle.3. I hardly ever have to heat it up beyond 5 min. or so, and it works great.4. Forget the cold milk thing. I'm crazy about half espresso/half milk. So I put the amount of water I want, right out of the tap, then add skim milk powder....mix it up and hit it with the steam. The forth is so dense it comes straight up over the side of the pitcher! You may not like it that stiff, but it's a suggestion for those who do.5. Try an Italian roast coffee....darker and sweeter. Mmmmmm.When this baby dies, I will replace it with the same machine. A lot of bang for the buck here. It's a great product.
