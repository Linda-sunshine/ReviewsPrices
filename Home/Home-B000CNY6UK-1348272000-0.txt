review/summary: Amazing coffee....pretty time consuming...review/text: First let me say, I gave this 4 stars only for the convenience factor, other than that this is a 5 star product. I had a Kuerig, which was super convenient but the coffee was not strong enough and pretty small servings. THEN I went to Italy and knew when I came back I was going to find something that would be delish instead of OK. This is what they used in the hotel and it was amazing, however it is a 20 minute process if you do it exactly as instructed (cold filtered water, heat on low). AND you have to really watch the pot to make sure to pull it off RIGHT WHEN ITS FINISHED or the coffee with have a burned sour taste. It seems like a little too much work for me so I'm going to get the $100 one that has a heat base and timer that shuts off when finished, also much faster brew time. But if you've got the time this is the cheapest way to get authentically delicious Italian style coffee. ENJOY
