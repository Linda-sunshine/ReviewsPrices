review/summary: difficult to usereview/text: Instructions with this thing are very terse. I had a hard time figuring out how to get the various blades out of the holder. I even looked on the website of the manufacturer but it was very little help.My first foray was trying to make French Fries. I thought I'd use the larger julienne blade. Had a large baking potato to cut up. The holder is a joke for large items. I had to cut the long, narrow potato in half to get it to fit up in the holder. That was OK, because sometimes the French Fries are too long. These were very short and thin. The holder is tiny, would hold an onion or something smaller. So I cooked the potatoes in the oven and they were delicious. They were more like shoestring potatoes.I'm wanting to make a dish which requires an eggplant be sliced horizontally into thin slices, and I don't know how I will be able to hold it (without losing my fingertips) with this wee little holder they sent. Overall, the plastic is cheap but the blades are very sharp. Also, the mandoline slides all over the place when you're trying to slice stuff on it. Maybe a little more expensive rig would be better. I suppose I'll keep it. Maybe I can figure out how to use it better.
