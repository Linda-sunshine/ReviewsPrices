review/summary: Parts melted after 6wksreview/text: I'm really disappointed that this juicer stopped working after 6 weeks. We use the juicer once per day and today it stopped producing juice. We discovered upon inspection that the piece holding the basket in place has melted. We now have no juice....and no juicer.
