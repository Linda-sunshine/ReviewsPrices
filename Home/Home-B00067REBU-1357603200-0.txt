review/summary: Bigger than life - OK I guess if you have ALOT of counter space!review/text: I don't know why this bread machine is HUGE but it is. Makes a decent loaf of bread though, and the price is right (it was on sale).I don't like the included recipes since they call for non-fat dry milk powder (like you'd have that laying around) - instead I use a Bread Machine Cookbook for recipes that use real milk instead. I found that the bread doesn't rise properly if you don't start out with room-temperature or warmer ingredients (especially the liquids, and eggs if you use them) - this is something they could explain a little better in the documentation (IMO).One lesson learned - read the dimensions in the product description! This item isProduct Dimensions: 19 x 13.5 x 14 inches ; 1 poundsShipping Weight: 19 poundsCompare that to the Oster (Oster CKSTBRTW20 2-Pound Expressbake Breadmaker, White)Product Dimensions: 13.8 x 13 x 14.1 inches ; 8 poundsShipping Weight: 14 pounds6 inches longer and 5 lbs heavier than the competition - no wonder it doesn't fit on my counter!
