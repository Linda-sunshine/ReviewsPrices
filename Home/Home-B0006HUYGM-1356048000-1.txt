review/summary: Nothing specialreview/text: Don't understand all the positive reviews. Compared to my old Shark vacuum of the same size, it's not any better suction-wise and seems less useful since it lacks a duster attachment. It clogs more quickly and loses suction. Maybe I've just been spoiled with good vacuums, but the only thing I've ever used that was less powerful than this was a cordless Dustbuster.
