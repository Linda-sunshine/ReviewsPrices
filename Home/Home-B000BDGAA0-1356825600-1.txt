review/summary: A bit firmer than expected...review/text: I bought this hoping it would be &#34;squishy&#34; which is what my son was looking for, it is much firmer than anticipated, especially when putting the enclosed cover on it. We replaced that with a king size pillowcase and it moves a bit more, but is still too firm for our preference.
