review/summary: Effective Humidifierreview/text: This is a nice mid-priced humidifier, and the owl design is adorable in my daughter's room. It's a small bedroom, so I can't comment how this unit would perform in a larger room, but it does a perfectly fine job in a bedroom. Also, the humidifier is relatively easy to clean, unlike others I've owned in the past. I empty out the water every couple of days and let it air dry. Be sure you can place it on an elevated, flat surface like a dresser (you don't want anything remotely cloth-like underneath it). I use those plastic/vinyl placemats for kids underneath it to protect the dresser's wood. Very pleased with our purchase.
