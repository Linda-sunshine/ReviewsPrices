review/summary: Overpriced but worth itreview/text: My expensive beautiful stainless espresso machine now collects dust in the garage, The Aeropress makes better espresso. Must use superfine grind, stir in 160 deg water for 10-15 seconds, then press for the best low-acid espresso ever. The paper disks can be rinsed and re-used (they dry quickly).
