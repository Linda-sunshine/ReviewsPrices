review/summary: Give me back my Cuisinart!!review/text: I had a Cuisinart for years and loved it. In August it stopped working which really disappointed me so I bought a different brand. Within a month I ordered another cuisinart because I was so dissatified with the other coffee maker I bought. I am most happy with my new Cuisinart as I knew I would be!! It is easy to use. The coffee is hot and stays hot, I love the adjustable temp feature. Plus, it is a very nice looking coffee maker.
