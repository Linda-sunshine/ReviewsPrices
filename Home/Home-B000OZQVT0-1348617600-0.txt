review/summary: Manufactured almost a year ago????review/text: My husband and I always use the Real Flame Gel Fuel for our fireplace. However last year we ordered from another website. This year, I found a great deal on Amazon so I went ahead and ordered. The package just arrived and the date stamped on the fuel gel lid is December 2011. Upon doing research online, this get should be used within a year of the manufacturing date for best results. It is September 2012 so why is this company sending out gel that was manufactured almost a year ago? The one we ordered last year from another website with decent prices was dated October 2011 which gave us plenty of time to use. It doesn't get cold here where we live until November/December. We are still going to use it and hope it still performs well even into 2013. However, I think we will be going back to the other website to order from now on.
