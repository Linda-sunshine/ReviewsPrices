review/summary: Hard to Measure Intangible Results, but Tastes Great!review/text: I've used these filters in a free-standing refrigerated container for one year. Of course, I switch the filters every 3-4 months. The water tastes great and I can't detect any chlorine or minerals. It's hard to really rate this filter since I can't measure the intangible, potential results on my health.
