review/summary: This is a fantastic bargain!review/text: Oh my goodness! This thing is such a bargain and cooks so well. First off let me address the quality. It's a fantastic piece with a great enameling and very sturdy. I have investigated the expensive European versions in stores, and cannot find a significant difference. Especially I cannot find a difference that would warrant spending 8 to 10 times as much for something that does the same thing. We have had this for 6 to 8 months and I've cooked many meals in it. It cooks so well! We have prepared cassoulet's as well as stews, and others. it heats evenly and cleaned up like a dream!Listen, if you have to have the name brand, go ahead and waste your money. I do not understand how someone can imagine that something like cast iron and enamel should cost that much! This is a quality product and I believe it'll bring me years of use to come. So what if it doesn't last for 50 years! What other products do I contemplate that kind of longevity out of anyways? And even if I do want something to last that long I could technically purchase four of these and change them out every 12 years and still pay half the price.
