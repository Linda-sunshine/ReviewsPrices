review/summary: Good little coffee pot for one personreview/text: This has been a good little coffee pot as I am the only coffee drinker in the family. I wanted something inexpensive that did not take up much counter space. I use it every day and it make exactly enough coffee for me when filled to the 4 cup (maximum) level. The basket is very small and I first had problems with the coffee grounds being forced over the filter and getting into the coffee or accidentally not ringing the filter just right with my coffee scoop. I have learned to be very careful when putting the coffee in and shake down the filter before I start it. I don't really pay attention to the clock, so I can't comment on that feature. I would like for the warmer to stay on a little longer as it turns itself off before I am complotely through the pot. I have to remember just to turn it off and back on if I want hot coffee from the pot for more that 30 minutes.
