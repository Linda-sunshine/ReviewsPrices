review/summary: It has spoiled mereview/text: I just ordered a second one for the camper. The coffee tastes so good! After using it for about 3 weeks, I brought a bunch of work home and decided to just make a full pot of coffee in a relatively new electric drip maker so I wouldn't have to stop working to make one cup at a time. I couldn't drink it, the flavor just wasn't present. And it had seemed just fine before I got this little gizmo. I like it much better than a French press because cleanup is so much easier.
