review/summary: Awesome slicerreview/text: I use this mandoline with a 12 quart metal bowl (purchased at a kitchen supply store). The bowl is deep and wide enough to hold the mandoline in place. The "V" shaped blades made slicing zucchini (from my garden)and apples (from family) a breeze. My family loved the healthy dehydrated fruit and veggie chips. It works great on overripe tomatoes, peaches and nectarines as well. My son is a cook and he uses the mandoline to speed up the prep work. Yes, the blades are super sharp and there have been two mishaps. These incidents are known as "not watching what you're doing" operator error. Never take your eyes off the blade when reaching for it or when it's in use. This isn't my first mandoline but it is by far the best one that I've used.
