review/summary: Works great!review/text: This wine bottle opener works really well. I was going to buy a regular manual one, but I realized my wife would still be calling me to open her wine bottles for her, so I decided to go this route instead. The ironic part is I am still opening her wine bottles b/c this thing is so fun to use!The only part I don't like is the size, I have my doubts that this thing needs to be as large as it actually is. Other than that I am happy with it.The included wine chiller is very nice!
