review/summary: It's okreview/text: I thought I would be wowed by the Breville since someone reccommended it to me and the reviews seemed pretty good over all. I already had a regular juicer by Krups, nothing fancy, but I lost the plunger. So I got this one and I can see exactly what some of the reviews said. If you put things like grapes in, it spits out of the whole before ou can get the plunger in, if you use the cup spout you can only fill half the glass because the wind blows the juice out all over the place. Also, I find a few slices of apple left after I juice. I do like the speed of it, different settings, and the juice pitcher. But I never had any of the messy problems with my cute little Krups juicer. If I find the plunger online for the Krups I may return the Breville.... Still deciding.
