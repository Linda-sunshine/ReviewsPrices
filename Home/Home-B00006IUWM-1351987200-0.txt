review/summary: Loving this gadget!review/text: I didn't realize how much I needed a knife sharpener until I tried my friend's - she had this model. I was sold as soon as I tried it! So, I purchased this sharpener and I'm absolutely loving it. I had no idea the difference a sharp knife makes! I had one of those sword-looking sharpeners previously and this one is SO much more effective. It gets the angle right and everything. With my old sharpener, there wasn't really a noticeable difference, so I rarely used it. But with this one, you *notice* the difference.This is one of my new favorite kitchen gadgets! Another new favorite? This book:30 Minute Meals Recipes includes Easy Dinner Recipes, Healthy Dinner Ideas and Simple Recipes that can be made in 30 Minutes or Less for Busy Moms, ... Discover 30 minute meals for busy families!I highly recommend both!
