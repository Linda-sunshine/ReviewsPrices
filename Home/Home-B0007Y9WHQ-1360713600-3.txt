review/summary: Practical, fun, and good quality!review/text: I bought the Tri-Blade to help me in my desire to add more raw foods to my diet. I'd tried making raw veggie pasta by cutting zucchini by hand, and it just wasn't - uh - cutting it. After I had a few recipes under my belt to justify the purchase, I got my Tri-Blade and I'm wondering now what took me so long! It totally changes the recipes and makes them look fabulous, not to mention fun enough to eat that my 6-year-old wants veggie pasta whenever I make it for myself. In fact, my whole family wants to eat my &#34;health food&#34; whenever I spiralize it. We've done sweet potatoes as well as zucchini and whatever else we can run through it. It's very easy to clean, and although it's made of plastic, it seems quite sturdy. I don't forsee any problems with it. The metal blades are very sharp, and I love having three different cuts. And did I mention it's fun??? Cutting veggies with this thing makes me feel like I'm playing. If you're considering getting one, I can tell you first hand that it's well worth the money. Not a contraption that will be forgotten in the pantry.
