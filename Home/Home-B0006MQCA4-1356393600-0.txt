review/summary: Hmm not so great..review/text: We have been using this for past 2 months. It worked great during that time. However during the last 2 weeks the water stays stagnant in the reservoir. The filter is dripping extremely slow or not at all. Not sure what happened. I wrote an email to the manufacturers and waiting for their reply. If I have to replace the filter then this seems ridiculously high price. I would not recommend it then. I have read similar issues with some other folks and tried all options out before writing this review but none has helped.
