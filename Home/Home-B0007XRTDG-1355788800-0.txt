review/summary: Best electric skillet ever!!!!review/text: I needed to replace my old skillet that had the removable pan. I was hesitant to go without that feature, but this unit is so superior!!! I love it. It is truly flat for sauteing in less oil. The pan is very thick which gives it great heat retention and very even heat.
