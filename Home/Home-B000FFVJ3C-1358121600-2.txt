review/summary: STOPPED WORKING AFTER 6 MONTHSreview/text: This product does a great job dehydrating chicken if you are making jerky for pets. I tried making jerky in the oven and not only did it take "forever" but the end results was not satisfactory. The quality of the jerky made in the Nesco if far superior. However, this machine failed to work after only 6 months of use. For everyones information, there is a one year warranty. First, you must call and get approval to return the product. If that happens, Nesco will request that you send the product to them, insured, and packaged securely through a service that provides tracking numbers. All expenses are your responsibility. It happened to cost me $22 for the return. If the unit can be fixed, it will take 3 weeks before you get your unit back. If it cannot be fixed, then will send you a new one. If you use the dehydrator frequently, I highly recommend that you purchase the top unit ($32) as a backup because eventually it will stop working. It's just a matter of time....
