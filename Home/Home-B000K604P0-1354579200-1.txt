review/summary: This is a good one...review/text: Apparently my son is too old for &#34;Lightning McQueen&#34; now so a new thermos was in order. I wanted an insulated stainless thermos that would not sweat, keeps the drink cold, and was slim enough for my son's lunch box. Happy to report this thermos always has ice left over the next morning when it is time to refill. This one is perfect and will hopefully last him thru college :)
