review/summary: My favoritereview/text: I use this daily. We have several types -- the standard press requires a coarse grinds or you end up with sludge in the bottom of the cup. This has a paper filter, so micro grinds work well. More surface area = more efficient flavor extraction, I feel. Fabulous design all around. I bought it through Liquid Planet Online -- they were great as well. Fast delivery. Had a piece missing, received it in 2 days with a pleasant customer experience.
