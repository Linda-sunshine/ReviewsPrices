review/summary: Good product but always breaks. Cheaply made...review/text: I purchased two of these through a local retailer. The first one broke at the handle where the button is and stopped working altogethe. It would start up and then turn off randomly so it could never complete a heating cycle. It lasted for 6 months to a year. The second one I got as a replacement broke at joint where the lid attaches to the top so it just falls off when pouring (unless you want to hold it in place and burn your hand periodically). Yesterday it started leaking between the black base and bottom of the glass. After hearing reviews of their customer service, I haven't bothered to complain about a replacement. I am looking for an alternative. I liked the product otherwise. It's a shame it's so cheaply or badly made.
