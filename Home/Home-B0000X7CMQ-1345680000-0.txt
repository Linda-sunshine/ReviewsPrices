review/summary: Avoid Zojirushireview/text: I've owned a couple of these coffeemakers over a period of several years (one at home, one at vacation cabin) and have put up with their many quirks because they make good coffee when they work. They also have a good thermal carafe, and no dreaded hot plate (a deal breaker for me in a coffee pot). The trouble is how often they let you down, and in a big way. Their basic problem is that they are very fussy about the set-up, and when things are not set up just right (i.e., the lid screwed on just right, the pot inserted with the spout at dead- center, the filter cone completely unclogged, the pot fully inserted into the machine) they fail to operate correctly. Now it wouldn't be so bad if they just just refused to drip. But no, the Zojirushi goes right ahead and drips the water into the grounds and then all over the counter-top and the floor. No doubt user error was involved, but no decent machine should be able to induce user error so easily. And how hard would it be to have it engineered so it simply refused to drip if the pot isn't squared off, rather than to go ahead and drip all over the floor? Finally, my machine simply refused to drip at all, and I am relieved. I can now go out and buy another automatic coffeemaker with a thermal carafe. And it won't be a Zojirushi.
