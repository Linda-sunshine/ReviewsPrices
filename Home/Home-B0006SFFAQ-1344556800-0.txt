review/summary: Very disappointed with the Qualityreview/text: Very disappointed with the quality of this coffee maker. It only lasted 12 months until it started to leak out the bottom all over our counter when brewing. Looks good and made good coffee while in operation, but they should be made to last 10 years! Thankfully Williams Sonoma gave me a credit and I am trying another brand.
