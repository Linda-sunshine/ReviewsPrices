review/summary: A really good bread makerreview/text: I wanted a really good bread maker and that is what I have in this unit. Only complaints - I liked being able to see the bread in process in my old bread maker. You can't do that with this unit. Once you close the lid that's it till you open it later for the surprise. I have run about a dozen loaves so far and the only one that didn't work was the whole wheat. I didn't have a kitchen scale for measuring yet so I think the fault lies with me. I appreciate the multiple selections on the unit. It's easy to program. Is it perfect? No. But it is a really good bread maker. Yes, I would recommend it. I have not used it for a long time so I don't know about it's endurance factor but hopefully it will live up to everything I have read about it.
