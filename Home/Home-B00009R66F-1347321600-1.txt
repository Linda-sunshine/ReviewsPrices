review/summary: Hoover never disappoints....review/text: This is the 3rd Hoover carpet cleaner I have owned in the last 20+ yrs...we have several pets so it gets a vigorous work out every couple weeks....it is fairly light weight and extremely simple in it's operation and clean up...it puts out a lot of water but the heated dry feature is amazing and the carpet drie in a third of the time compared to my old model.
