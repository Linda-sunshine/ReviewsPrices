review/summary: Great juicerreview/text: I purchased the Breville 1000 Watt juicer about 8 years ago. I juice fairly regularly, at times I drink entire quarts of green type juices DAILY. Carrots, beets, cabbage, parsley, celery, apples, ginger root, tumeric root, apples and more. Never once have had a problem after 8 years its going strong. Anyone asks me which juicer I have...I tell them to BUY THIS JUICER...wonderful product!
