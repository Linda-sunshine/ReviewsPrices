review/summary: Great and Convenient Blenderreview/text: I need a quick and convenient breakfast in the morning before I run off to class, and this nifty product does the trick. I usually mix milk, protein powder, and oatmeal, and all I have to do is press the button on the hand blender, and then twist off the detachable part, and wash it. I have not tried this product for heavier uses such as ice and things of that nature, but I'm sure it works just as well. Purchase this item for yourself, and as a gift.
