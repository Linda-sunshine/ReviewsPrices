review/summary: This Breville juicer is affordable, works great, and is an excellent investment toward healthy living ...review/text: If you've ever seen the movieFat, Sick, and Nearly Dead, you probably immediately put the Breville on your wish list. I saw the movie and on it went. No, I'm not fat, but have always tried to eat as healthy as possible. Although Joe Cross purchased a heavier duty Breville, this one definitely suits my needs for now and was affordable. Not much if anything to say negative about a product I carefully thought out before purchasing, but I'll set out a comparison "chart" of all the Brevilles so you can take a look. I snagged these from Breville. Cut, paste, and print them out for side-by-side comparison. I've also added a few books you might wish to take a look at.You don't just get a little pamphlet that is passed off as a user guide, you actually get something more in line with a book (English, Spanish, and French). It includes everything you need to know, especially tips on juicing and a trouble guide. It even includes several recipes under the categories fresh starts, vitamin boosters, liquid lunches, icy coolers, spirited juices, energy fuel, and fiber favorites. After using this juicer, the verdict? It's affordable, works great, and is an excellent investment toward healthy living.POPULAR JUICING BOOKS:The Big Book of Juices: More Than 400 Natural Blends for Health and Vitality Every DayThe Juicing BibleThe Big Book of Juices and Smoothies: 365 Natural Blends for Health and Vitality Every DayThe Healthy Green Drink Diet: Advice and Recipes to Energize, Alkalize, Lose Weight, and Feel GreatBREVILLE JUICERS:Compact Juice Fountain 700-Watt Juice Extractor (the juicer I purchased)Key feature: Compact design takes up less space, with all of the juicing capabilities of the other juicers.Type of juicer: CentrifugalMotor: 700 wattSpeed: 14,000rpmMaterials: Titanium cutting disc; stainless steel micromesh filter.Innovations: Centered dual knife blade assembly; 3" circular feed tube processes whole fruit; stabilizing knife.Breville Je98XL Juice Fountain Plus 850-Watt Juicing MachineKey feature: Die-cast juicer with soft fruit attachment and variable speed capabilityType of juicer: CentrifugalMotor: 1200 wattSpeed: 5 speeds ranging from 6,500rpm to 13,000rpmMaterials: Heavy grade die-cast metal body; titanium cutting disc; Stainless steel micromesh filter; Stainless steel puree disc.Innovations: Centered dual knife blade assembly; 3" circular feed tube processes whole fruit; stabilizing knife; second juice disc purees soft fruits for 100% fruit smoothies.Breville 800JEXL Juice Fountain Elite 1000-Watt Juice ExtractorKey feature: `Rolls Royce' of Juicers: die-cast metal matched wtih powerType of juicer: CentrifugalMotor: 1000 wattSpeed: Low speed of 6,500rpm, high speed of 13,000rpmMaterials: Heavy grade die-cast metal body; titanium cutting disc; stainless steel cutting disc; engineering grade polymers.Innovations: Centered dual knife blade assembly; 3" circular feed tube processes whole fruit; stabilizing knife; Dual high/low speed switch for hard or softer fruits and vegetables.Breville BJE510XL Juice Fountain Multi-Speed 900-Watt JuicerKey feature: Variable speeds maximize yield across variety of fruits.Type of juicer: CentrifugalMotor: 900 wattSpeed: 5 speeds ranging from 6,500rpm to 12,500rpmMaterials: Stainless steel body; stainless steel micromesh filter; stainless steel cutting disc; engineering grade polymers.Innovations: Centered dual knife blade assembly; 3" circular feed tube processes whole fruit; stabilizing knife; unique 5 speed smart juicing system maximizes juice yield according to softness and hardness.Breville BJS600XL Fountain Crush Masticating Slow JuicerKey feature: Makes thicker juices and yields more juice for leafy greens and wheatgrass than non-masticating juicers.Type of juicer: Masticating/slow juicerMotor: 240 wattSpeed: 80rpmMaterials: Painted premium plasticInnovations: Direction control; two step safety start; filter basket with auto-purifying; crushes and squeezes to make juice with nutrients and a little fiber for a thicker, smoother texture.Breville JE98XL Juice Fountain Plus 850-Watt Juice ExtractorKey feature: Great entry price point for Breville juicersType of juicer: CentrifugalMotor: 850 wattSpeed: Low speed of 6,500rpm, high speed of 12,000rpmMaterials: Heavy grade polymer body; stainless steel micromesh filter; stainless steel cutting disc.Innovations: Centered dual knife blade assembly; stabilizing knife; dual high/low speed switch for hard or softer fruits and vegetables.
