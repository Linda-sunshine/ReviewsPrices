review/summary: Does the job -- very little plasticreview/text: I chose this one because it has very little plastic -- body is all steel. The lid has some plastic parts lining the inside (why?!) so I took it off and use it without the lid. The downside is that with the lid off, it will not shut off when it reaches boiling. Also, it is NOT 8 cups -- 40 ounces is correct. If you're only boiling for one or two 12- or 16-oz mugs, it's fine.
