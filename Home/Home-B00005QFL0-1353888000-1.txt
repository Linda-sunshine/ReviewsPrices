review/summary: Love it. Much better than my previous Breadman breadmaker.review/text: Purchased the Panasonic even though it was double the price of the Breadman TR555LC which died on me. No regrets.PROS:- I like the yeast dispenser and the fact that I do not have to get my hands dirty by having to make a depression in the flour for the yeast.- The bread texture is much better. Identical to store purchased bread even though I approximate the contents- The hole left at the bottom by the blade is almost not noticeable unlike the Breadman.- Unit looks sturdier and has a steel housing compared to plastic on Breadman.- Baking pan has a good anti-stick coating and the bread just drops out at the end of the baking cycle. Had to struggle to get it out in my previous unit.- Like the fact that it comes with a measuring cup and spoon- Lots of recipesCONS:- Shape of the loaf. When I bake the XL size the height of the slice is almost twice the width. Not something that will fit in a lunch box.- The LCD display should be angled. It is hard to see the arrow.
