review/summary: Don't waste your money!review/text: It successfully made coffee for one week then broke. After over an hour on the phone with Keurig they sent me the replacement part to fix the machine. Two weeks later I received said replacement part. It proceeded to successfully brew two whole cups of coffee before experiencing the same issue. I will say that their customer service reps are very well mannered and trained....probably because of the large volume of calls they receive due to their piece of crap products!
