review/summary: I'm getting another one!review/text: I bought this for our basement office. Basements can get kind of musty and dusty, so its hard to sit there. I bought this and placed it there for a full night on high with the ionizer on and the next day you could tell the air was cleaner! Its so much easier to breathe. We are getting a lot more use out of our basement office thank to this air purifier. It can be a little noisy, but it doesn't really bother us. As suggested, we leave the air purifier on all the time. Its been about 2 months and so far, so good. Also LOVE the fact that there are no replacement filters needed. Just vacuum the filter clean.I'm getting another one for our kids' room.
