review/summary: Lingering quesitonreview/text: .Does anyone know if you can set the timer when cooker is on Simmer. Mine will not and Cuisinart doesn't seem to know either, which is amazing.Mine will work on simmer for an undetermined amount of time and then goes to keep warm.Quote from Cuisinart but not specific enough.* Simmer - This preset temperature allows you to cook liquids at a lower temperature. It is primarily used to finish cooking some items, i.e. to add ingredients to a risotto, sauce, or stew or to continue cooking process to achieve preferred textureI would LOVE to have an answer to this as I do love the cooker but this is a terrible situation.Since I got no answers from Cuisinart after them sending question to Corporate who sent it to marketing and never got back to me I took mine back but will buy another one if I can get an answer.Thanks so much.
