review/summary: Filter clogs and motor overheatsreview/text: With a clean filter the vacuum does a good job on hard floor and carpet. However, the fabric filter quickly plugs with dust. Suction at the floor decreases substantially as the filter clogs which also reduces air flow across the vacuum motor. Since air flow drops so low, the motor overheats within a few minutes. I can get the vacuum to work only by washing the filter with soap and water after every use. That's really too much work so I bought a Hoover bagless vacuum as a replacement. The last stick vacuum I had, before it fell apart due to old age, used the same type of filter system and worked fine. Oh well.
