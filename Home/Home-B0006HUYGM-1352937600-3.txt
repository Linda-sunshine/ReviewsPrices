review/summary: Okay, but not greatreview/text: I've had this little hand vac for a few months now. I've been using it regularly in an RV and I can honestly say, it's just okay. I'm in the market for a replacement. Why? Hair does not make it to the dirt cup, but rather gets wrapped around the brush and stays there until you cut it out. The dirt cup fills very quickly so even in my small space (maybe 100sqft of carpet), I have to dump the cup twice each time I vacuum. The filter gets nasty quickly too so it really needs to be washed at least every couple of uses. The filter that comes with the vacuum is washable, but having two (one to use while the other dries) would be helpful. Unlike some others, I haven't had an issue with the vac overheating, however, my space is very small so I'm not using the vac for any extended period of time. My advice? If you're looking for something better than a dust buster and plan to use it more than just an occasional clean-up in the car, spend a little more and get a better vac.
