review/summary: great product great pricereview/text: I live in a rental house in the cold Northeast where all the fireplaces were plugged by previous owners years ago. But my wife and I love sitting and watching a fire burn on cold nights. So what do we do? I had no idea. Then I found these Real Flame gel cans on Amazon. I ordered and received them within three business days. We tried the first one two nights ago and it worked like a charm. We set up some large stones in the fireplace and placed one of these in the middle of them. It burned brightly and large for a little over two hours. then last night we did the same but with two of the cans side by side and it was more than big enough to enjoy for the same two hours plus.And for the price of $67 that I paid (with free shipping) that comes out to $2.68 a can which. So even with two cans burning that is only $5.36 a fire. I would pay that much for firewood anyway unless I bought in bulk. And there is no cleanup. Just pick up the cans and put them in the recycle bin.
