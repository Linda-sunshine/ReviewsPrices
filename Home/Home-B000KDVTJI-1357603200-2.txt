review/summary: really goodreview/text: this thing works perfectly. heats water quickly. simple to use. not too expensive. shuts off when it's supposed to. you can set it on the counter without worrying that it will scorch the countertop.this is the only electric kettle i've ever tried (been rocking it for about a month now), so i can't speak to the quality vs other kettles. but, i think it works pretty great. i'd definitely get it again. i tried the kettle-on-the-oven route, and that was lame. this is easier.why 4 stars?- it would be great if you could elect to let it beep when it is finished. most of the time, i can hear the 'click' of the button in the next room when it shuts off, but not all of the time.- there's no easy way to fill this from a fridge. because the lid is attached, and you have the pouring lip in the front of the kettle, you can't use your filtered fridge water to fill it up because it won't fit in far enough. this is a pretty minor/petty complaint, as i just fill up my cup with water and pour it in the kettle (then i know exactly how much water to use as well). but still, it's something. this is going to be a problem for any kettle that has a lip/spout and doesn't have a lid that you can pop off.
