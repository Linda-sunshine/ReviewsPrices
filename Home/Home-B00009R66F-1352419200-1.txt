review/summary: Great all around productreview/text: no complaints so far. I have used the item about a dozen or so times in the last 6 months without issue.Like anything, read the instructions, understand them and have patience when you are exploring your new item.I have had zero issue with the item so far. It has amazed me on some stains I thought would never come out.Take your time cleaning up the mess, if it is liquid, extract it out first without using the spinning brush.Would recommend it!
