review/summary: Good suctionreview/text: Really good suction for a little vacuum. My only complaint is that it doesn't have a mounting bracket with it so that it could hang on the wall. I've had several of the battery operated small vacs before and they eventually had to have batteries replaced. I like that this is not a battery powered device.
