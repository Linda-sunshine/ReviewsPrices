review/summary: A monster of a small machinereview/text: I was looking for a small vacuum cleaner and was reading all the reviews. I was originally considering the Shark Navigator, but I did not want to spend that much. I came across the Dirt Devil and saw the price and thought wow. Yes, it is not very expensive and boy does it work. I was recently puppy sitting and decided to use it for the first time after they went home. I could not believe the amount of doggie hair it pulled out of the carpet and off the furniture. I also would like to thank the reviewer who included the right replacement filter and belts. If it had not been for that info I would surely have gotten the wrong items and been pissed. To finish up I would recommend this vacuum to anybody that does not have huge spaces to vacuum up. My house is not big and this one is perfect. The manual is well written and it is worth reading to find how everything comes apart and is stored. I especially like the fact that you can put the whole upper half flat to the floor to get under spaces that others won't get to. Housework is not one of my favorite activities, but this comes close to making a chore not so bad. It, also, does not take up that much space to store.
