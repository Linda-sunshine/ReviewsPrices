review/summary: Every day usereview/text: I had a couple of other models of electric skillets over the years, but this model is the best hands down. I use mine nearly every day and they seem to last two to three years before it feels like it needs replacing. Weird tip: The first few electric skillets I owned, I would use soap and water and clean them all over. Shortly after, I would see the familiar gunky buildup on the outside of the skillet. Later on I stopped using soap to clean the outside of the skillet - just water only. No more gunky buildup.
