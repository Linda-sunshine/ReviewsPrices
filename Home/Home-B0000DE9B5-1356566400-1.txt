review/summary: Mixed feelings.review/text: I really wanted to like this jug, but it couldn't withstand the cold temps in my fridge and cracked. I liked the design, and it worked fine until it cracked.I also have this http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VJQGHI/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_8 which is holding up much better, but it does not come with a lid :/If I had to choose all over again, I would choose the 96oz style setter pitcher, as it's been more reliable.
