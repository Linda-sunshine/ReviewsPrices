review/summary: Very disappointedreview/text: My sister got me the Jack LaLanne PJE juicer (http://www.amazon.com/Jack-LaLannes-PJEB-Juicer-Express/dp/B00472MGR2/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1358695056&sr=8-4&keywords=jack+lalanne+juicer) last year for my birthday. Once I'd proven to myself that I was for sure into juicing, I started dreaming about a high-end juicer and settled on this one. It is an attractive unit, but my pulp is no less and no drier than with the PJE and my juice is foamier. The RPMs on the Brevilles start at 6500; the PJE was 3600. The "5 speeds" on the 510XL Breville are a joke. There are two speeds: turbo and nuclear. You don't need to go over 3 for anything, not even beets. 6500 rpm is not low enough to handle soft fruits and delicate greens, my PJE handled those items much better. Just yesterday I juiced a half a bunch of kale and literally got 2 tablespoons of juice from the Breville. Swiss Chard and lettuces are the only greens the Breville can even remotely handle. Also, the chute is narrower than on my PJE and I have to cut even small apples in half. As far as cleanup goes, I think these two juicers are about a wash. There are less nooks and crannies on the PJE but the stainless and clear plastic on the Breville make cleaning easier.
