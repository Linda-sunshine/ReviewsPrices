review/summary: Works well and inexpensive.review/text: I bought this for the office so I wasn't constantly having to reheat my coffee cup. It works wonderfully. The plate keeps a hot cup hot. The plate actually gets hot enough almost like a coffee pot burner. If some coffee drips down the cup and I sit it on this plate it will sizzle a bit. An auto off would be nice but for $10 I can't complain. It's just that I left this thing on over night with a little coffee in the bottom and came in to the office the next morning with motor oil that I had to clean out.
