review/summary: Awesome when you first see/feel them... horrible as you wash them !!!!!!!!!review/text: When I first opened the package containing two pairs of these sheets, I thought i was a lottery winner! I thought they were the some awesome flannel sheets I had ever seen. They felt very thick, velvety soft and beyond words. However.... when laundered, the dryer lint trap is FILLLED TO THE BRIM with cotton. I am so angry I could spit. They care charging the price based upon 190 grams of cotton; however, if you loose half of it in the dryer, exactly what that &#34;H&#34; are we paying for ? Of course, when you loose all that cotton, the sheets are becoming thinner and thinner. I was hoping all the cotton in the lint trap would be from the newness... WRONG.... I've had these a couple months now and every single time they are laundered, I have a HUGEEEEE ball of cotton lost in the process. I AM NEW TO BUYING ON AMAZON.. I WISH I KNEW IF I COULD RETURN THESE TO THE MANUFACTURER OR TO AMAZON. CAN ANYBODY TELL ME IF THIS IS POSSIBLE ? I'm sorry to say that I WOULD NOT recommend these sheets based upon my experience.
