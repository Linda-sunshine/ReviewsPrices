review/summary: LOVE My Pyrex Cups!review/text: I make a lot of things that require reducing a liquid to a specific small amount, and these measuring cups are indispensable for that task since they're made from pyrex!! They've also been great for slowly incorporating ingredients while my stand mixer is going, the pour spout saves me from so many messes! I use them pretty much anytime I'm cooking or baking, half the time I'm not even using them for measuring! I have a feeling I'm going to be ordering more and more!Note about the quart size -- yes, your measurements will not be as accurate because of the wide diameter of the bowl -- it's a literal wider margin of error. It's always better to measure in smaller wet ingredient cups! Also, these measuring cups are for WET ingredients! Measure your dry ingredients in dry ingredient cups that you can level off with a knife.
