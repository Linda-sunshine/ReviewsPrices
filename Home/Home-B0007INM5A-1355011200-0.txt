review/summary: I Can't Make it Workreview/text: *sob*, I've tried every grind on my grinder, I've packed it, I've packed it less, I've not packed it, I've put it in both positions in My Hamilton Beach and the water still runs out of the machine. Anything that makes it into the cup looks like weak tea and I won't discuss the taste. No, don't ask me, I won't. I could have been knee deep in actual coffee pods for the amount of coffee I've wasted. I'm so disappointed.
