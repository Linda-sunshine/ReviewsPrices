review/summary: Good quality knife sharpenerreview/text: I like an electric knife sharpener as opposed to the stationary kind and this one does the job. The left side works well for rather dull blades and the right side is used to finely sharper knives that are already in good shape. I have been using this for almost a year and I have no complaints.
