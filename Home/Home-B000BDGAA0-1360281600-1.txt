review/summary: This pillow is an an answered prayreview/text: The reviews for this pillow were spot on with the quality of the pillow. It's the first pillow I've been able to use in years that hasn't left me with stiff shoulders, neck and a morning headache. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the fact that the pillow case that come with the pillow is to small, the zipper was defective, and if you put the pillow on the case they provide, it's rock hard and you couldn't possibly sleep on it. On top of that, the material the case is made from a rather rough material that wouldn't be conducive to a good night's sleep.I read the reviews, and was prepared for this issue. My regular pillow case on it and haven't had any problems with it at all. I would recommend this pillow to anyone.
