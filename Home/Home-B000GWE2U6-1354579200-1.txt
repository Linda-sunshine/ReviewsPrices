review/summary: This thing really works!review/text: This little monkey really does the job. It keeps the entire apartment (about 800 square feet size) cool. I can finally breath good in the dry winter. And I do not have chapped lips any more, which is really wonderful! My skin does not get dry often since I got this. Here is a list of pros and cons:Pros: 1. It looks CUTE.2. It does exactly what a humidifier does. MOST IMPORTANT!3. It operates fairly quite. It makes a little noise. But it is not hard to ignore.4. The installation is simple. The switch is easy to operate as well.5. It is extremely portable. Therefore, it is easy to refill the water.Cons: 1. The noise it makes. I said, it is not hard to ignore, but it still does have a little. And especially when the monkey does not have enough water left, you will hear the constant water dripping sound. (It kind of make you want to go to the bathroom when you hear it LOL)2. The manual said it can not be put on the surface of carpet or wood. (Not sure about the rationale behind that)3. It has a cheap plastic odor with it first. So lets hope it has a good quality and last for a fair amount of time.In sum, this humidifier does the job pretty well.
