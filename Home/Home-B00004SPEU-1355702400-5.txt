review/summary: so messyreview/text: makes a good fine grind if that is your brew of preference...but there really is no in between grind. I wish others had mentioned how messy this grinder can be when you open the canister to pour the grind. Also, quite a lot of the grind sticks to the bottom of the grinder if your beans happen to be the oilier kind.
