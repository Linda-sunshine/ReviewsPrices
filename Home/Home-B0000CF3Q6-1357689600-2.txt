review/summary: Best Coffee Everreview/text: When I ordered the moka express, I was really excited to try it (I had read so many great things) but was also a little worried it might let me down, since I had my hopes up so high. It has not disappointed! It makes, hands down, the best coffee I've ever had. After the first day, I put my old drip coffee maker up and will never use it again. This moka express is wonderful
