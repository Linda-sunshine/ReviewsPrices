review/summary: Worked very wellreview/text: I've seen these for years and wished I purchased it years ago. It was an inconvenience scooping cookie dough but never felt like this would be worth it. I was wrong. This makes making cookies fun. The size med is works well for 2-3 inch cookies depending on your recipe.
