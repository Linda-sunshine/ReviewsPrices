review/summary: Great Popperreview/text: I love this popper, I have had one for about 6 years and purchased 2 to give as gifts this Christmas the smiles were great. I think this is a great popper when you use as directed. I put everything in turn on the stove to med hi and in a few minutes I have great tasting popcorn. I thoroughly recommend it to people wanting great popcorn.
