review/summary: This is goodreview/text: This juicer performs as it should be and expected. I don't really find any fault to it. Left over juice in the bowl does not leak to the motor at all even I don't clean it right away. The pulp left turns out to be pretty dry by my standard so I guess it has pretty good juice extraction power. I juice directly to a drinking glass. As the spout is quite low so don't expect you can put a tall glass underneath. The spout is perpendicular so there isn't a lot of blow over juice when coming out but it does blow out the juice in the glass or whatever container when is juice is filling up close to top, the juice is rushing out with a lot of force perpendicularly. After you shut off the motor, you can tilt the bowl a bit to let the left over juice out. Since this is all in one, without a separate basket for the pulp, so you can't really keep juicing and juicing, well I guess even with the basket type you can't, or line the basket with a bag for easy clean up of the pulp. With this one the pulp accumulates inside of the outer bowl. You just need to scoop them out with the provided spatula, actually the handle of the brush. A bit of work but really no big deal. Overall I find this to be a good juicer.
