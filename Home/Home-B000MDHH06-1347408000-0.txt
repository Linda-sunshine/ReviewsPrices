review/summary: Ok for the price but messyreview/text: I bought mine through Best Buy. At the time, I think that was the cheapest price I found on-line. I'm new to juicing so I can't give a contrast and compare review. All I know is this particular model as it's my first juicer. For the money, I think this Breville is a good intro into juicing. However, as far as convenience is concerned, it's not very. I have stuff flying up out of the top every time I juice. And yes, I've read everyone's tips on how to avoid that but it hasn't worked for me. The place where the pulp goes has to be emptied out half way between my juicing because it fills up and falls back into the juicer. If I was to do it over again, I would at least buy the Breville model where the pulp is deposited in a container outside of the machine. Seems like it would be a lot less of a hassle. Since it is a hassle, I don't think I am juicing as much as I'd really like to. I've read also that the centrifugal juicers can compromise the fruit and vegetable's enzymes with the high RPMs. Probably not completely but I've got my eye on an Omega VRT 350 HD juicer next. Yes. It's almost 4 times more expensive than this model but it only processes the produce at 80 RPMs and is a masticating model which makes for more efficient pulp extraction and less waste (something I read about AFTER I spent the money on this model). Produce is not cheap and I would like to get the most out of the fruits and vegetables I'm juicing. The pulp coming out of this machine has large pieces of fruits and vegies in it and it's fairly wet. If you are trying to be cost conscious then I guess this is a good place to start but in the long run, it's wasteful.
