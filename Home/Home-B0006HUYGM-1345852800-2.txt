review/summary: Great machine but the cord wrap is annoyingreview/text: The power of this machine is very good, but the cord wrap is very, very horrible. It is a good idea but the execution is terrible. The groove is too shallow. It is still incredibly powerful so I gave it 4 stars. I still greatly recommend it for someone who would benefit from a corded handheld vacuum.
