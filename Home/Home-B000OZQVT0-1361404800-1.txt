review/summary: Light my Firereview/text: I bought a stand alone lil fire place and this is by far the best fuel I have found to use. It doesn't have any chemcial smell as long as it is done properly. By removing the paper (yes if you don't it will smell like burning paper but never actually catch it on fire) Shaking the can before opening it will make it last longer. If you do put it out and don't reshake ..you could smell a light fume very faint. But I have a good smeller. I have never had a headache from using it. This is my fourth case of it and I am sure I will order more. It crackles and really warms up a room. I only use one can per time because two would run me out with too much heat. Heating appx.400 sq.ft. AAA+ on this one folks.
