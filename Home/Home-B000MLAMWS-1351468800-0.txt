review/summary: KitchenAid Professional 600 Seriesreview/text: I've had the Professional 600 for about a month and have not yet put it through its paces mixing anything difficult. I've used it make mashed potatoes and a cake. I find it a bit cumbersome to stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl. I'm not crazy about the bowl lift design either. It's messy when it comes time to remove the wire whip. Frankly, my 38 year old hand mixer did just as well with a lot less fuss. This is a huge mixer. As one review mentioned, it does not fit on a countertop with wall cabinets at standard height above. I had to clear a space in a tall lower cabinet to store it. Any time I want to use it, I'll be lugging it out and hoisting it up onto the counter. I'm a little sad that I used my Amazon points and gift certificates to make this purchase. Nothing really wrong with the mixer, I just think it's way more than I really need.
