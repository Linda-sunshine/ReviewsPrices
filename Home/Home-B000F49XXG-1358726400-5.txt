review/summary: Meltdown...review/text: We ordered this product with great hopes of espressos and cappuccinos. I am happy to report that it did, for about 10 months. We have not had it for a year and it apparently has pumped it's last latte. About two months ago, the steamer started acting up and not passing any steam, though it was full of water and worked fine until then. To make sure it was fully primed, I ran the pump and it worked. I turned it back to steam and nothing happened. The next day I tried again and the same thing happened, only this time the little bit of steam that came through smelled like burning plastic/metal. Hoping this wouldn't effect my coffee, I gave it a go only to have to dump it out because it tasted like smoked plastic in a metal cup.Until this point it has worked great. I'm not sure what went wrong, but, I think we will return this one for the same De'Longhi model, since it suited our needs just fine.
