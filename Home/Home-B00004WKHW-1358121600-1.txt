review/summary: cute and easyreview/text: This is a very cute machine and works very well but seems to me to produce the same results as the smaller Cuisinart which uses the wand to activate the chopping function. It does not hold more food than the base of the wand chopper and chops very finely....in fact pulverizes vegetables unless one is very careful to quickly press and release the chop button.
