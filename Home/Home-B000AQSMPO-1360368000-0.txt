review/summary: Wondeful Machinereview/text: Prior to my purchase of my B60 Keurig, I read many reviews and watched various YouTube videos on fixing different issues with this product. I got mine today and setup per the instructions. Then again if you have read and watched some of the videos you pretty much know the routine. My first cup took just over a minute before it started to brew. After my first cup it only takes about 15 to 20 seconds to start brewing. I know it takes time to heat the water in the holding tank for the brewing cycle. The other reason is that the water has to saturate the K-cup before dispensing the coffee. I know the water is under pressure but it still takes time to fully get the grounds wet.This is my first single-cup coffee maker and I just like it. I waited until the prices came down before getting one. The price on this B60 was under $80 dollars. As I stated at the beginning of my review, I did a lot of reading and watching videos on this machine as well as other models that Keurig makes. There are basically three most popular models made. The B40, B60 and the B70. You could say the B60 is the middle of the road model. LCD and various other bells and whistles. The price on my model sold me. The B40 has no LCD and the cost prevented me from purchasing that model. The cheapest price I found on the B40 was $119 dollars. So I got the B60 for a great buy. I really like this B60 model. Well worth the price.
