review/summary: Excellent...until it rusted outreview/text: I was happy with this kettle until I noticed that it was leaking out of the bottom. On close inspection, I discovered that it had completely rusted out along the edge where the metal connects with the plastic. I have had it less than a year. If they replace it, I'll update my review.UPDATE (12/27/2012):I made one phone call, and it's being replaced and shipped out immediately. (Excellent customer service, Aroma!) Apparently Amazon got a bad batch that they were selling, but no longer. It's unfortunate and irresponsible of Amazon not to issue a recall when they knew about the defective batch. I'm increasing my review from 2 stars to 5 only because of the manufacturer's customer service and the quality of the produce up until it started leaking and rusting. I'll update it again if I find that it's not 5-star quality.
