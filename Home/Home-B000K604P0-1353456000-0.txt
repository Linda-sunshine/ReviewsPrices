review/summary: Fabulous!!review/text: I have had many travel bottles over the years. Several of them are the Thermos Nissan brand and I love them since keep my Lady Gray decaffeinated tea cold for hours and hours, but they weren't spill proof.I needed one bottle that wouldn't spill, really wouldn't spill and this one is it!! I've had mine for over a year and love it more the longer I own it. Truly worth every penny spent on it.. A wonderful purchase.
