review/summary: No Auto Shut-Off!review/text: Did a lot of research prior to purchasing this unit; generally speaking it makes good espresso, but it is very frustrating not to have an auto shut off - we have to sit and watch it or it will keep on brewing and you will either have a mess on your hands or some very weak coffee. It is finicky - it stopped working after a few months so we did a thorough cleaning - when reassembling the filter cap, be sure to screw on with sufficient tension or the filter will not work.
