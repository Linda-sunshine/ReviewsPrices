review/summary: Love my Keurigreview/text: My husband bought this for me for Christmas last year. When I opened it I thought oh great, another useless appliance to take up counter space. I couldn't have been more wrong! I have used it every day since I got it. My daughters have them too, and they love them. I just use it for coffee, but my son makes hot chocolate with it. There are dozens of drinks available-even hot apple cider! The cost of using k cups works out to about 50 cents a cup-cheaper than McDonalds. Now I am looking into reusable cups to make it even cheaper. All I can say is, if I had to give it up I would certainly miss it.
