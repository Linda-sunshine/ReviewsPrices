review/summary: It's A Coffee Potreview/text: Well, what can I say that hasn't already been said pro and con.I will say first of all, don't buy this coffee maker, it's way to expensive for the pros that you'll get.Does it make a drinkable cup of coffee, yes it does, but not to be compared to a press pot.The coffee does not stay hot near as long as they claim, maybe 20 minutes.The coffee does not taste the same after 20 minutes like they claim.I would not pay $75 to $100 dollars for this maker, maybe $30.Buy a Mr Coffee maker, it's just as good.Want the best cup of coffee, get a press pot, the only draw back is that you can't keep it fresh very long, and you can't make a lot of it at once.If it's just you and your significant other, get a 12 cup Bodum Press Pot, boil your water and get quality coffee beans and enjoy.Save your money on this maker, it's way over rated.
