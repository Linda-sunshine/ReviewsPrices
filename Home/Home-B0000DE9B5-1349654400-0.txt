review/summary: Excellent tea pitcherreview/text: I bought this because it's glass. I put iced tea in. Most pitchers are plastic and even knowing about the number system for plastics does not make me feel comfortable about what's in the plastic specially foreign made stuff. BPA is only part of it. This jug works great. Because it's square it takes up less space. It's 5 inches square and 7 inches tall. The handle sticks out about 1 1/2 inch. If there is anything weak about the design, it's the handle. I wish it were closed at bottom. As for thickness it's pretty thick and seems durable. I let the top sit loosely. It does rotate to fit snug, but that's a bother. You can't pour with the lid on. Not an issue for me.
