review/summary: Fits the Bormioli Rocco Gelo Glass Pitcher perfectly!review/text: I saw this in Lifehacker and decided to try it for my iced coffee. I bought the set of Bormioli Rocco Gelo Glass Pitchers also, the Aeropress fits perfectly in the top of the pitcher. I was a little in a hurry the first time and tried to put 4 scoops in at once. No--don't do that. Use two scoops, and then press it, then do 2 scoops again. So now I can make it before I go to bed and then in the morning it's cold, and I just have to put in some half and half, stevia, and ice and I'm good to go!
