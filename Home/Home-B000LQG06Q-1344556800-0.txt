review/summary: VERY COMFY!!review/text: THis topper is divine!! It feels just like a temprapudic mattress no lie and thats just laying it flat on the ground i can just imagine how wonderful its going to feel on my college bed. Very VERY good quality even though it has a funky smell and its 10 pounds its very comfrtoable and worth the money!! I just wished i would have gotten the 3 inch one for extra comfort but this is jsut as comfy its nice a sturdy yet enjoyable!
