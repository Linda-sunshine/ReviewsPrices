review/summary: Poor Qualityreview/text: The old Farberware percolators used to last a minimum of 10 years if not 20. However, their production quality has dropped dramatically, and so now you are lucky to get three years out of them. My most recent one just died after less than 3 years of use. It looks pretty and the stainless steal is of a good quality, but the electronics don't last. I am in a market for a new one now because this product broke and I guess it is time to try a new brand. I am tired of having to buy a new percolator every few years.
