review/summary: Repackaged item sent as new. Item was broken upon receipt.review/text: I have no complaints about the Presto Salad shooter, but the company that shipped it sent me a repackaged item that contained a part broken in three places. It almost looked like somebody ordered a new one just for the attachment ring (which was the part that broke on my old salad shooter) and just switched out the broken part for the new one and returned it. Poor quality assurance on the company's part. I was very disappointed. I have reordered a new one through WalMart. I love having a salad shooter during the holidays. It makes grating carrots and cheese a breeze.
