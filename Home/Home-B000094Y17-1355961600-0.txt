review/summary: Works well, no lid problemreview/text: This is my first Brita fileter and I've read a lot of the reviews here about how the lid comes off or the filter detaches, well I can gladly say that mine was fine. The lid is a little lose but it never came off when I pour. The filter sits firmly in it's place and so far I don't have any problems with spilling. The water tastes fine, but I don't have anything else to compare it to other than bottled water. The timer is really just a gimmick. It's not based on the volume poured and just reminds you to change the filter in two months, plus you can't replace the battery. Not a huge deal. Overall good buy.
