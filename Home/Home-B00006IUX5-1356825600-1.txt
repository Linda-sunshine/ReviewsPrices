review/summary: This is the best ever!review/text: Guys, if you are looking for a cheap coffee grinder, look no further. I had this product for more than 3 years... I grind up my beans from Starbucks and run it through the coffee machine, and it tastes exactly like the coffee made at the store. One advice, if you want a full size 12 cup of coffee carafe, run the coffee grinder full of beans twice and add it to the filter. I am the only one drinking coffee, sometimes my daughter helps herself. I just use half of the carafe and one coffee grinder full of beans, and it tastes wonderful. Adding a paper filter helps keeps the bitterness out.
