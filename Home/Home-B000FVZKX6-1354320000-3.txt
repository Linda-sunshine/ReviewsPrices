review/summary: So far, I love them!review/text: First, let me say, normally I would not/could not pay this much for bed sheets. It simply isn't in our budget. I had been given two gift certificates for Amazon last year and I used them both toward the purchase of these sheets about two months ago. I rarely spend money on myself and I labored on what I wanted to use the certificates for. Finally, as the weather cooled this fall, and I crawled into my bed with very old, very smooth, cotton, ice cold sheets, it hit me. &#34;I need flannel sheets!&#34; I'm glad, also, that I was able to read the reviews from others. I had originally planned to purchase the 160-Gram version of these sheets. However, reading the reviews changed my mind.These sheets DID shed lint, seems I remember a review or two stating they didn't. However, they did shed much less than I had expected. I washed them two or three times before placing them on my bed. They, of course, shed less and less with each washing. I have a pillow top King mattress and the sheets provide ample pockets to fit well. The top sheet is just as generous on size and the pillowcases are longer than my king-sized pillows. They feel WONDERFUL and I no longer dread crawling into a COLD bed. Thus far, they haven't piled up like other flannel sheets I have owned in the past. They are nice and heavyweight and feel like they will last many years.I am completely satisfied with this purchase at this point.
