review/summary: Don't Buy Itreview/text: I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY ANYONE COULD WRITE A POSITIVE REVIEW FOR THIS ITEM. A SIMPLE UNFROZEN STAUFFER'S FRENCH BREAD PIZZA SLICE TOOK 25 MINUTES JUST TO WARM UP! THE TECHNOLOGY BEHIND THIS THING IS COMPLETELY ILLOGICAL. THE PIZZA IS SUBJECT TO HEAT ONLY 15% OF THE TIME BECAUSE IT ROTATES INTO THE OPEN AIR CONTINUOUSLY AND IS THEREFORE NATURALLY COOLING OFF 85% OF THE TIME!!!! THE DUAL OR LOWER SETTINGS MAKE NO DIFFERENCE. COOKING A FROZEN PIZZA TOOK UPWARDS OF 1 HOUR AND STILL CAME OUT LUKEWARM!!!BY THE TIME YOU GET FINISHED WAITING FOR THIS THING TO DO ITS JOB IF AT ALL YOU COULD HAVE ORDERED AND RECEIVED A DELIVERY FROM DOMINOS.
