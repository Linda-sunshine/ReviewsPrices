review/summary: Wonderful Breadmakerreview/text: I received this breadmaker for a Christmas present and have used it a minimum of once a week since. It was purchased to replace my original one because that one was simply too small for some of the recipes I make. The bread comes out great. Have only used one recipe from the booklet that came with the machine, because I rely mostly on my favorites to make my bread. I usually only make dough in the breadmaker because I like the traditional shape of the loaves rather than the shape of the machines pan. Anyone would be happy with this machine - it's very easy to use.
