review/summary: Leaky, but good servicereview/text: We were given this off our wedding registry in the summer of 2011. After using it about 6 months it started to leak out of the bottom. We are a lazy couple and dealt with wiping off the base unit and countertop after each use, until one day the rubber gasket that sat under the blades came lose and got blended into our blueberry smoothies. Not a fun way to find out you can't have breakfast when you're on your way to work and find rubber chunks in it. A quick call to Kitchenaid, spoke to a lovely woman with a southern accent, and a new jar is on the way at no cost to us. We will see how long the replacement jar lasts, but I believe that the replacement jar comes with a 1 year warranty as well.
