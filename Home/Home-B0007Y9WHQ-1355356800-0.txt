review/summary: Plastic handle split within monthsreview/text: I have been barely using this slicer (less than once a week) and already the plastic handle, which is absolutely essential to slicing the vegetables, is now unusable. I cannot even turn the handle correctly or cut anything. I was wondering if I could get a replacement as I am no longer satisfied.
