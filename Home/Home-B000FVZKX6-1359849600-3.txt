review/summary: Soft & Cozyreview/text: My ex-boyfriend bought these flannel sheets a couple of years ago and we both really liked them. So when he asked me to move out, the first thing I did was order the exact same sheets in a another color. I washed them once before using and as expected the lint catcher was full after being in the dryer. Tonight was my first night sleeping on them and so very glad I got them!!!
