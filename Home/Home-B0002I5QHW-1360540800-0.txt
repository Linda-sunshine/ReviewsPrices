review/summary: Works greatreview/text: We use it to ground pork primarily and it works great. We do freeze the pork a little and then cut into small pieces before grounding. Because it is mostly plastic, no rust and easy to clean. I am glad that I did not spend a fortune on the electric models. No more costly ground pork from local grocery stores.
