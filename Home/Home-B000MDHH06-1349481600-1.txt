review/summary: Just what I was looking forreview/text: Incredible power, somewhat messy at times but it gets easier once you really start to use it frequently. I did a 15 day juice fast and it was amazing. Only fruits and veggies and I feel great. This product works great. I found that most fruit I would rather juice the pulp again just to get more out but that was just my preference. The pulp really does end up dry. I found celery, melon, spinach to be staples for good juicing.I would recommend this product to anyone.
