review/summary: Worst decision EVER!review/text: In 2010, my fianc&eacute; bought this for me as a birthday present. I was very excited because I had heard such great things about it, and I hate the taste of coffee that has been "warming". I thought, "wonderful! Fresh tasting coffee with every cup!". The first time I used it I was somewhat disappointed with the K-cup flavor, it was a little weak for me, even on the small cup setting. I began using the re-useable K-cup and grinding my own beans, this helped the flavor a bit but it still seemed weak. As this was a gift, a very generous one at 140$ + dollars, I did not want to return it, so I decided to make the best of things. After a few uses, and I mean a few like less than 5, I got the dreaded "de-scale" message on my little blue screen. Not sure what this meant, I went online and discovered I was already being directed to clean out the pot. In my mind, this seemed a little strange since I had not had it for very long. But a procured the vinegar any way and got to work, still unswayed by what still appeared as such an extravagant gift. Well, this became a once a week ritual very quickly. Two to four cups brewed, descale machine, 4-6 cups brewed, descale machine. I did more research, thinking this is ridiculous. Maybe I have hard water, was one internet suggestion, use filtered water. I then procured a brita and used only filtered water. DESCALE DESCALE DESCALE still again and again. Less than 2yrs after receiving this, I will NEVER buy one again. Not only is the flavor disappointing, unless you enjoy coffee that resembles chamomile tea, but the thing never worked to its expectations. Ignore the hype and buy a french press.
