review/summary: Works perfectlyreview/text: I don't know what to say other than works perfectly. So much more convenient than dealing with paper filters and the coffee tastes great with no discernible change from filters. The one difference I noticed from the description is this has screens on the bottom too and is not solid as description stated. Actually, I think it is better that it is screened all the way around as well as on the bottom. Allows the coffee to drip through freely.
