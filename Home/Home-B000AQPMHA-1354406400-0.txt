review/summary: Delightful!review/text: We were introduced to the Keurig line of brewers in a doctor's office of all places. My husband went on and on about it for so long that I finally bought him one. We've been hooked ever since. We're on our second brewer (we gave the first one away to charity - it still worked) when a family member bought him another one for his birthday.All in all - a delightful part of our mornings!
