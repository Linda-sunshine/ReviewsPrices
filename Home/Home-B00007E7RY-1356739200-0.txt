review/summary: Clean, fresh air...review/text: We bought this just before we got a bird. We hoped to reduce the bird's dander with this unit and it worked. I liked how well it worked in our family and bought one for each of our bedrooms. Although it is loud, even at the lowest speed, it works great. I wake up breathing easily from my nose when I run this at night in my bedroom. My nose is stuffy if I don't use it.
