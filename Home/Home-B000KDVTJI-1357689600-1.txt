review/summary: Great kettlereview/text: If you need hot water in a hurry, ths is great. I use it for full immersion coffee and I have no complaints. It will heat a quart of water quicker than I can in a saucepan on the stove and much quicker and in the mocrowave. It will shut off automatically when the water boils.
