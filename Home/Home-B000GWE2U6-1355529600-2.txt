review/summary: Soaking wet.review/text: I like the fine mist and how quiet this humidifier is, but holy cow- it gets the carpet soaking wet, and everything around it very wet... I have to lay a towel underneath it to protect my floor, or table or whatever its on. I've never had this problem with other humidifiers- I think its becuase the mist doesnt shoot high up into the air. It just slowly flows out so it just lands on the floor. But it is very quiet and the mist is very fine.
