review/summary: great!review/text: This is my first ever immersion blender and I'm in love! This thing is perfect for blending soups and sauces, and for making smoothies. It breaks through and blends frozen fruit with no problem at all, and can blend through a huge pot (8 quarts) of roasted veggies in just a couple of minutes. Clean up is really easy, too, with the business end coming off with a click. I have pretty small hands, and this blender is a good fit for me. I've only had it for a couple of weeks, but I'm already using it more than my blender. I don't have any idea how well it will hold up, but I'll be sure to update the review if I have any problems.
