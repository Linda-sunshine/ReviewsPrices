review/summary: Great Bread Makerreview/text: Homemade bread is a childhood love of mine but I don't have the patience to make it myself. This bread maker is excellent to help me out! I love that I can choose the darkness of the loaf and I can delay the start time so it's nice and hot when I come home at the end of the day.
