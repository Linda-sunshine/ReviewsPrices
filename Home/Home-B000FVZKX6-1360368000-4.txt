review/summary: So Soft!review/text: I have another set of Pinzon flannel sheets purchased about 2 years ago that have held up well, are still soft with minimal pilling. So I purchased another set of Pinzon flannels. Sizing is as described. Standard pillow cases need to be wider for today's pillows. These are the softest sheets I've found for a very reasonable price.
