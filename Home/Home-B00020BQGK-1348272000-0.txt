review/summary: Great Stick Vacreview/text: I purchased the Hoover Flair based on the reviews here and on a couple of other sites. Most Stick Vacs seem to be underpowered and don't do a good job, but in my experience the Hoover Flair is perfect. I have a very small apartment and no pets, with a mix of tight-pile area rugs and hardwood floors. The Flair has plenty of suction for both the rugs and bare floors (and an easy switch on the handle to alternate between settings for each). It's easy to clean, takes up minimal space in the closet, and maneuvers easily under and around furniture. I probably wouldn't recommend it for heavy cleaning or a large carpeted floor area, but for my needs it works great! I wasn't expecting much after reading so many negative reviews about Stick Vacs in general, but I've been really pleased by the ease of use and its power. And the value for the money is super!
