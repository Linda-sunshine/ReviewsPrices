review/summary: Rust on the rim...review/text: Upon very first use, there were several parts of the rim which started to rust. The rust, in combination with the steam, would then drip back into the pot...Not sure how safe it is to eat the rust, so I have only used this one time. Sad, because the pot in itself is very beautiful and a great size!
