review/summary: Love this juicer!review/text: This is a great juicer! Works like a champ, easy to clean and haven't found anything that it won't juice. I got the larger model for my daughter and she loves it as she juices for 2 people. I like the way her's shoots the pulp out the side into a container...it just depends on space and how much you juice at a time. I would investigate both!
