review/summary: VERY easy to clean, doesn't stickreview/text: This is an excellent waffle maker! It is really easy to clean and we have never had a waffle stick. It is pretty quick, too. This morning each waffle only took about 5 minutes to cook. I was also surprised at how delicious the &#34;Weekend Waffle&#34; recipe is... crispy, not too sweet, and yields about 5 waffles.
