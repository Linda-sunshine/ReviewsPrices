review/summary: Digital advantage? I think not!review/text: I am flabbergasted at the vast number of positive reviews of this product. This iron failed for me after less than two years of VERY light use. When I most recently hauled it out of the cupboard to use it, the LCD display lit up with a blue background, but otherwise, the display was blank. I needed to iron a shirt, so I didn't give up immediately, but proceed to try and work around the failure. I actually managed to get the iron to heat up and produce steam (briefly). When I was about half-way done with my task, the iron decided to turn itself off, and that was the end of it; try as I might, I couldn't get it to function again.I am a computer person (a software developer), so I have an appreciation for technology. But I can also see when technology is overused or used inappropriately, such as designing a heat-sensitive microprocessor into a heat-producing device. I have come to realize that I do not need my iron to beep at me, and I do not need it to have a digital display. What I need from an iron is very simple: I need it to heat up, produce steam, and be reliable. This iron is NOT RELIABLE. I was disheartened when I looked to Amazon product reviews to help me decide which iron to try next, because this one received far and away more reviews than any other, and they are predominantly positive. I'm not buying those opinions, and I'm not buying another Black & Decker iron, either! I chose a T-Fal model, which did not receive as many reviews, but those it did receive were largely positive. The model I chose does not have a digital display, and it has a simple dial to select fabric settings, etc. If it beeps at me occasionally, I can live with that, so long as it keeps working, which this Black & Decker piece of @#*& absolutely could not do. Be warned!
