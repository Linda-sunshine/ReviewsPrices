review/summary: QUIT WORKING AFTER THREE WEEKSreview/text: This is a great size coffee maker, as I don't like to drink too much coffee, but this is the worst coffee maker ever. After only three weeks of normal usage (1 pot per day) the item began to leak uncontrollably. The water leaked when you poured it in, and then it leaked when you took the carafe out to pour your coffee. Then the leaking coffee would un-safely splatter all over the bottom heat plate. Do not buy, trust me.
