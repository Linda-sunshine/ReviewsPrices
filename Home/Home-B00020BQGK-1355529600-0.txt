review/summary: Hoover Flair Bagless Upright Stick Vacuum with Power Nozzlereview/text: Height of unit is awkward for my operating it even though I am only 5' tall! What does a person of medium or tall stature do to use it effectively. I purchased it to replace a fading hand held vacuum. I should have purchased another hand held for the convenience.
