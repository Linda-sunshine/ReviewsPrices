review/summary: Great machine!!review/text: This is a great machine, at a great value!! Within a few uses, I was already making espresso and lattes better then Starbucks!! It is very user friendly and very easy with clean up. It does not come with a milk frothing pitcher, espresso measuring cup, nor seperate tamper (the machine has one of sorts, but it is very difficult if not impossible to get an even and firm press of your espresso). It is very easy and affordable to buy these items on amazon. We bought the milk frothing pitcher ((Update International EP-12 Stainless Steel Frothing Pitcher, 12-Ounce) (the larger size will not fit under frothing wand)), espresso measuring cup (Rattleware 3-Ounce RW Logo Shot Pitcher, Glass), and tamper (concept art 51mm).These tools may seem frilly, but they make a huge difference in the espresso you pull and the lattes you create! For some reason it was near impossible to find out that the tamper basket size was 51mm even through calling the company. The plastic tamper that is a part of the machine is inadequate and unruly to say the least. But do not shy away from this machine! It is truly a gem!! Get the right tools to go with it though! I have and I will continue to recommend this product to others!!
