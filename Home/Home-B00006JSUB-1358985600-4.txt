review/summary: User Errorreview/text: I love the idea of cast iron skillets, especially when I see them used in cookbooks, but maybe it's because I'm not Southern, but I can't seem to maintain a cast iron skillet, pre-seasoned or not. You have to keep it oiled often and even the tiniest drop of water will cause rust. Once something rusts, I get way too nervous to even consider using it. If you are up for the challenge of maintaining, I think it looks very nice and heats well, especially on a bbq or gas flame.
