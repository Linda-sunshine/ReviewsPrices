review/summary: 3 stars might be a tad generousreview/text: I purchased three of these penguins in Nov 2012 hoping to keep the humidity in my home at a decent level and the static electricity at a minimum. They seem to be doing that despite the fact that none of my units has evaporated a single, 1-gal tank in a 24 hour period--the description says it will put out 2.1 gal/day.However, I've already had to return two units for defects. The first one was spitting water out between the base and where the tank rests on it and left a huge puddle on my hardwood floor. Another unit simply broke...the light turned off and it just died.When they work, they work. However, if you're purchasing several (they're only rated for 250 sq ft) to keep several rooms at a decent humidity, expect to return a couple. You'll also need to refill each one daily, but expect that with any humidifier.
