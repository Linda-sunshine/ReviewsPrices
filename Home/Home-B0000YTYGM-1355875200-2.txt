review/summary: Great idea for better tasting coffeereview/text: Being a coffee drinker for over 30 years, I've seen a lot of coffee machines come and go. While most made pretty decent coffee for the first cup or so, after sitting on the hot plate for a short while, the coffee starts to taste burnt, gets a greyish color when you add creamer, and just flat out loses that &#34;fresh brewed&#34; taste.That's why we tried this &#34;carafe&#34; style coffee maker. Since it doesn't continue to &#34;cook&#34; the flavor and life out of the coffee, every cup is like fresh brewed coffee. So far we love it. Two hours after brewing, coffee taste just a good as the first cup. And we like the fact that the machine shuts off right after brewing...no more unnecessary power consumption or potentially unsafe power usage. Very pleased so far.
