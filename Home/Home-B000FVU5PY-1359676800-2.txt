review/summary: Bright White ; with two large stains, scratchy, wrinkled messreview/text: So I decided to gamble! I bought queen size white set. The fitted sheet has eleastic around the circumfrence of the sheet. They are generous pillow cases, generous top sheet and the fine decorative stitching is nice. I opened them up and shook them from the box packaging- not as scratchy as I thought they woul be. There was no chemical smell on the I,found two large stains the color of bran muffin. It didn't feel soiled just stained. I was determined to keep these sheets! I sprayed the stain with Krud Kutter(amazing stuff) leg soak for 15 minutes, through in 2 cups of Epsom Salt ( I have a front loader), I put the settings on soak for 2 hours! I figure Epsom Salt will cure anything- I used normal dose of fabric softener, as more is not better. The stains are out, they are dry,,wrinkle free. I notified amazon of the poor quality control in the Pinzon factory that is owned by Amazon and made in China. So I gave it this rating, do to all the hassle I had to go through.Feb 7, 2013--I'm lower it to a one star. I washed the sheets on cold water (delicate), dried on delicate and still came out wrinkled-better but still wrinkled. I put them on my bed and Im gutting it out until the last day where if I return them I will. Scratchy but heavy.
