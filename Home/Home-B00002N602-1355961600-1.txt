review/summary: Works great...review/text: I've used a 6-qt. aluminum pressure cooker for years. It finally bit the dust so I decided to try a stainless steel cooker. This one is taller, but not as wide, as my previous cooker. However, it is plenty big to hold a 3-4 pound chicken or roast, which is what I usually cook in it. So far I really like it - and no problems yet with hardware rusting like I've read in a few reviews. I would recommend this one to anyone who needs a not-too-big pressure cooker!
