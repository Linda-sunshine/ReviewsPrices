review/summary: Great Burr Grinder for the Pricereview/text: I have to admit I purchased this grinder after much debate. I recently have become obsessed with coffee craftsmanship and was willing to spend much more on a grinder than $89.99; but reluctantly I decided to go with the Capresso Infinity Grinder due to the local availability of the item. I'm glad I did.I typically only use a french press for making coffee and I also needed a burr grinder that can produce consistently even sized coarse grains for the New Orleans style Blue Bottle iced coffee that I make occassionally. Upon first use I have to say that I was very impressed with the consistency of the grind, the low-noise emission, and the low grind speed which prevents overheating the grind and affecting the aroma. If you are looking for a sub-$100 burr grinder I would highly recommend you purchase the Capresso Infinity. Of course you can a lot better grinders at higher price points but in terms of quality of the grind I would go no lower than this model.Pros:* Easy to use/clean* Simple design* Consistent grind* Wide spectrum of grind sizesCons:* Produces a lot of static electricity which will blow coffee grinds everywhere (unless you get the brushed aluminum 3-pronged plug model which I have read is better at grounding the static electricity).* Somewhat awkward method of turning off the grinding mechanism by turning the bean carafe* Looks cheap
