review/summary: Not What It Used To Be.review/text: My first farberware coffee maker lasted about 25 years - great product. The second one lasted about 10 years - not bad. The third one lasted less than three years. In an attempt to contact the company directly, I have had no response. The product cannot be repaired and this must be the company plan to sell more coffee makers. Stay away from this product. Now if I could find someone who makes a quality percolator.
