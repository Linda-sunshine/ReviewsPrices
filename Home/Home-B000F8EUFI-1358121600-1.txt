review/summary: It sucks.review/text: Sorry, had to say it, but at least it's sucking the way I want it too. Vacuum has good suction and is fairly light weight. The canister does fill up rather quickly, but emptying it isn't difficult. It the first time I used a bagless vacuum and am happy with my purchase.
