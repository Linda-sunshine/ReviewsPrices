review/summary: Excellent quality for the price!review/text: Didn't know what to expect - usually buy the hundred dollar covers but we've had an economic crisis mirroring the rest of the country. So have to admit I had low expectations, but it fits the mattress with room to spare, although I do NOT have a pillow top I do have a foam mattress cover added on top that is about 2 inches high. This covers it easily plus some. It's soft, but sturdy and very nicely quilted. I'm so glad I bought this.
