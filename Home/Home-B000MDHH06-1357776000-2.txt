review/summary: Affordable Healthreview/text: Glad I got the juicer. Very powerful and takes care of fruits like lemons without peeling. Clean up is pretty easy too. Juice container seems to have an internal crack in it, but it doesn't leak at all.It's a lot quieter than I thought it would be.I got this juicer because I am new to juicing and this was the best affordable unit I found.
