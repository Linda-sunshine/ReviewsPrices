review/summary: Finally have the right tool!review/text: I had a small food processor, like $20 from target or something, and I struggled with it for a couple of years before I finally decided to break down and buy the fancy one. And I'm glad I did! Its so easy to make hummus, all I do is dump all the ingredients in and turn it on! Its also very easy to chop or shred veggies. I like all the different attachments/disks to do different jobs too.
