review/summary: Coffee Press or Tank?review/text: This press is great. I take a press places where other coffee pots aren't practical. We don't have power in hunting camp, and I never liked the coffee from stove top percs. My old press (don't remember the brand) was OK, but the sieve broke off from the plunger handle due to a weak design. This press is a much sturdier design, and I look forward to using it often. I doubt I will ever have to replace this one.
