review/summary: Absolutely Horriblereview/text: Puffs of powder and dust spit out the front of the vacuum as I vacuumed my living room carpet with carpet fresh powder. The unit did not guide straight over the carpet and suction was at a minimum. After using the vacuum for a few minutes, reread the manual to make sure I wasn't missing something then tried again. Same results. Therefore I packed it back into it's box and returned it. I purchased a unit from another vacuum company.What a little dirt devil indeed.I do not recommend.
