review/summary: Good and ' VERY ' Affordable Vacuumreview/text: This is the 3rd one of these vacuums I have purchased , not because they stop working or anything like that But because the first 2 still work very well and I have a 3 floor house and wanted one for each floor !! I am elderly and did not want to carry a vacuum up & down steps and these vacs are so affordable I could purchase one for each floor ! They are also very powerful and almost take off on their own to clean the floors ! Maybe they are not the best available but for me and my money they do the job very well ! My son has another well known brand of vac which costs 3x as much and does not clean any better than this Hoover and it is also more difficult for me to use than this Hoover is !
