review/summary: Bought as a gift because I read all the positive reviews.review/text: Bought as a christmas gift for my brother who is getting into coffee. Thought it would be nice since he doesn't have any sort of &#34;espresso machine&#34; Well we get it and decide to test it out.Instructions mention to preheat for 15 min then also mention to wait 30 min... so 45 min for 2oz of espresso.. that's a lot, so we wait 15 min fun 5 pulls through machine as it explains to do to &#34;clean&#34; it.. We do that, then refill the tank.. wait 15 min grind good coffee with our Breville Smart Grinder (which is great) pour tamp try to pull a shot.. nothing happens except vibrating so hard the espresso glass could fall off.. take out portafilter it's just a soupy mess rinse repeat a few times same results, we keep raising the grind as we go, so finally we are on the highest setting for espresso grind, we barely tamp and pull a shot that actually eventually came out, took a drink, it's not hot and very sour.. so we wait 15 min.. water temp is 150 degrees.. We kept testing it and it would never get over 150 degrees.. Returning for something else.I know everyone says spending this money is gonna get you crap.. I would expect paying $100 for this small machine would get us at least a couple drinkable shots but no...also Ergonomically this machine is bad.. Steam wand is way to short and close to the counter.. and also you can't fit anything under the portafilter except shot glasses... this machine is a fail.. if it could pull decent temperature we could have looked passed the flaws.
