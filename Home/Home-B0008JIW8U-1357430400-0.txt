review/summary: Stopped working on the first day!review/text: I am really disappointed with the quality of this coffeemaker. The machine worked only once and then stopped working. The brewing light (green light) comes on for half a second when I press the 'On' button and then goes off. I have let it cool down and unplugged it but it didn't help. My old Mr Coffee machine still works fine after many years!
