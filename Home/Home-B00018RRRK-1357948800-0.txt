review/summary: Does the jobreview/text: We love freshly ground coffee and this definitely does the job. The ability adjust the coarseness is the best feature. The draw back is how messy it is. You will get coffee grounds on your counter when using it. The grounds build up around the opening and in the corners, even when freshly cleaned. My husband hates this grinder but I am ok with it because I am a little more patient when scooping out the grounds. I use a spoon and am careful, other wise it is a huge mess. BOTTOM LINE - It works but will make a huge mess.
