review/summary: A Quick and Easy Way to Brew Loose Tea, BUT.....review/text: I drink a lot of hot Japanese loose leaf Green Tea. A couple of months ago I was introduced to the Ingenuitea Teapot by a friend and I just had to have one, ordering it within the hour. I love it! It's the easiest way to brew your tea...it's a bit easier than using a French Press, which is what I was using, and this is easier to clean. If you brew a lot of loose leaf tea, you really need to purchase one of these. Having said that, I will offer a word of caution with this plastic pot. Three days ago, my wife came home from a business trip with a box of loose leaf Market Spice tea; Cinnamon & Orange. After one infusion, the inside of the teapot...and the inside of the lid.... are permanently etched. I dumped out the tea leaves and rinsed out the remaining leaves before hand washing it, and noticed the inside was mottled-looking and very cloudy....it just looks nasty!! I can only guess that it was a bad reaction between the plastic and either the oils or citrus from the artificial flavorings in the tea....I'm not a big flavored tea drinker as it is, but my wife brought it home for me and so I had to try it. The lid never came in contact with the liquid, but the inside of the lid is also etched, apparently from the vapor. I'm now wondering if I should even be drinking this tea!! I used a kitchen Dobie pad to see if anything would come off but it didn't even phase the coating...and the smell of the tea is also infused in the plastic. I made Green tea tonight and that cinnamon-orange flavor is in my tea. I have just ordered another unit because I really like this teapot, but this new one will definitely be dedicated to my Green Tea. THIS INGENUITEA TEAPOT WILL BE THE BEST LITTLE TEA INFUSER YOU'LL EVER OWN.
