review/summary: So useful!review/text: I love these plastic caps for the Ball canning jars. I use the jars for storage, both dry and refrigerated, and these plastic caps are so much easier to use than the canning lids and rings for this purpose. They are a nice thick plastic and screw on easily. They seem to create a pretty tight seal, though I don't think they are watertight. If you can find them at the big box stores, they'll probably be cheaper, but I live in a small-ish town and I can't find them anywhere, so I buy them here.
