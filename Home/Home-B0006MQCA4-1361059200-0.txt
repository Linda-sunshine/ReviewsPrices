review/summary: Great!review/text: Fits perfectly in our fridge, makes our nasty tasting faucet water taste like bottled water. There's four people in my house who use it so we do have to fill it every other day/every day the majority of the time. One uses it for her coffee maker.. that might make a difference! Love itt.
