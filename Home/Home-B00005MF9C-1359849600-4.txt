review/summary: Stop working after a monthreview/text: It was great in the beginning. Then about a month after using it everyday it just stop brewing. I read reviews in other places and it appears that there is a small percentage of these do this..... I jot to be the one of them. Black and Decker is standing behind their product and will be replacing it. We have to send back the plug piece and pay $7.00 for them to ship the replacement..... don't really like this.
