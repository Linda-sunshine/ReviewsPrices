review/summary: Leaen how to use itreview/text: I have had this oven/toaster for years and it is great if you learn how to use it. I frequently use it to bake frozen biscuits. I found out it works great if you don't preheat it. I put the biscuits in, set the oven at 350 and the biscuits come out perfectly in 20 minutes. I set it on about 250 to reheat pizza slices without preheating and it doesn't burn. It does frozen french fries better if preheated. Frozen rolls will burn unless it is preheated. I don't know why rolls are different from biscuits but they are. The small size works well for one or two people.I just recommended it to a 77 year old widower friend who has never had either a toaster or toaster oven.
