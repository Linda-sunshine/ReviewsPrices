review/summary: Best small appliance I've invested in in yearsreview/text: This easy-to-clean, simple to use blender is sending my conventional blender to the back of the storage closet. I hated when my protein shakes had globs of unmixed powder - no more! It makes a smoothy or a margarita with no fuss and no muss. I blend the drinks in my own tall glassware/plasticware without having to use the beaker (which IS helpful if measuring exact amounts).Buy it; you'll love it.
