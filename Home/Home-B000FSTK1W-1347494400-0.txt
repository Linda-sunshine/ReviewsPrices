review/summary: Works wellreview/text: I bought two of these. It works well as long as the product is installed according to instructions. The one I installed in a tile shower has done its job, holding quite a bit of weight with shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, soap, and facial cleanser. I installed the second one in a one-piece tub/shower but didn't realize that the place where I installed it had a slight bend in the shower wall. The point of contact between the caddy and the wall was not completely flush and the caddy ended up falling off.
