review/summary: Best coffee everreview/text: A friend had purchased this and I was amazed at how good the coffee tasted. She then ordered one for me and I'm thrilled. At first I had a little difficulty following the instructions -- I'm klutzy but after a little practice I have no problem. You can have espresso or add water for a regular cup or milk. It's very easy to clean -- just plunge the coffee grounds into the garbage disposal and rinse off. I would recommend to anyone who loves coffee. I have purchased one for sister and think she'll love it.
