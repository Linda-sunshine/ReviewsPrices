review/summary: Works Greatreview/text: I bought this to go with my Delonghi EC155 espresso machine. It works great, but just a little too small to fit perfectly. I gave it 4 stars since it looks a little cheap in person. I only clean it will warm water because I'm afraid the finish will come off. I've used this exclusively with my machine and have had perfect shots every time.
