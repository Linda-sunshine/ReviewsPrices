review/summary: Very Happy With This Coffee Makerreview/text: I received this coffee maker from my children for Christmas. This was the first gift that they were able to go out on their own and purchase by themselves, so they were very excited to give it to me, which made it that much sweeter. I mentioned that I wanted one, but I had no idea that they would do this!Pros1. This machine holds quite a bit of water and can stay on all day.2. If you buy a K cup filter (I recommend the Solofill cup), you can make tea with loose tea leaves, and brew your favorite coffee (I like Community Coffee Medium. K cups are not available at this time, but I emailed them and they said they would be out in the Spring of 2013! Yippee!).3. You can make a cup of hot water too. I can't find sugar free cocoa in K cups, so I'm glad I can just make hot water and add my cocoa.4. You can program it to turn on / turn off for the hours you're at home.5. I can drink tea, hubby can have coffee, and the kids can have cider. It's great for making a variety of hot drinks one cup at a time!6. I was able to brew a cup of hot tea, added some cold water and ice, and viola! Iced tea!Cons1. The K cups are EXPENSIVE! They average .50-$1.00 per cup. I keep a variety around for funsies, but I'm mainly using the Solofill for my coffee (I'm stuck on Community Coffee anyway), and my loose leaf teas (which I love).2. While it's brewing, it's kind of noisy.3. The cup measurements are rather small. I use the largest button for a regular sized mug.4. My Community Coffee (using the Solofill cup) is a bit weaker than usual. I'm looking forward to their new K cup.
