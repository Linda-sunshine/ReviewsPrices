review/summary: Regret buyingreview/text: Bought this with high hopes.I do not understand all the positive reviews. At least, what I received does not feel like memory foam at all. It feels like regular sponge which springs back after you press your hand on it. I waited too long to test it out. It had very strong minty odor when I received it. I left open it in a room in the basement to air out. Took more than a month to loose the smell. When I tried to use it, it did not feel like memory foam I have seen at friends homes. Then I tried basic pressing hand test. I press it and let my hand go, foam springs back to original shape immedately. Feels like regular sponge.I have a suspicion, they may not be shipping the same item to everybody. But, it is too late to return. I will swallow the loss.
