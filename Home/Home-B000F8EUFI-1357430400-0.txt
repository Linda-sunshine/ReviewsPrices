review/summary: I LOVE this vacuum!!!review/text: OMG! This is one of the best vacuums that I have ever owned. It is so lightweight that going up and down stairs is not inconvenient at all. Easy to use, easy to clean after using. The price was so reasonable that I was afraid I would not be getting a great product--WRONG!! I use it both on thick carpet and on hardwood floors. It's almost gross how much stuff it pulls out of the carpets :) -- much better than the full-sized dinosaur that I was using before. Shipped quick.
