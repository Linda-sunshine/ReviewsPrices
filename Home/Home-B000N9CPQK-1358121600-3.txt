review/summary: Gets louder the longer it's onreview/text: I was happy with it the first time we used it. Low speed was very quiet, for the first few days. Compact size that fit on a shelf. However, before too long it got llouder. It starts whisper quiet, but after a few hours it's too loud and we had to turn up the tv. High setting is like a loud hair dryer, by the way. I'm feeling too lazy to return it because of its cheap price, but we have to turn it on when we pollute the air, then in a little while, turn it off again. Rats. It works pretty quickly to clean the air even in a big room.
