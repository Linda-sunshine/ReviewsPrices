review/summary: Can't choose sounds for alarmreview/text: The soothing sounds for going to sleep are nice and work well; you can choose the amount of time (up to 90 min) that you want the sound to play before it turns off. Unfortunately, the alarm is not as good. You can choose between radio, buzzer, and sound, but the only sound that will play for the alarm is the default running stream! Bummer, because that is not a sound that will wake you up. I was looking for an alarm with a gentler sound to wake up to than a radio or buzzer, but this isn't it. I don't understand why they would not allow you to choose the alarm sound. Disappointed.
