review/summary: T-FAILreview/text: I was very pleased with this pan the first few times I used. It was heavy duty, and as advertised, "non-stick". Now, after a few months of light use, the pan has warped, and the middle of the pan is no longer flat, but has risen about 1/8th of an inch. Food no longer cooks evenly, and any liquid/oil pools to the edge of the pan, leaving the center dry. Save your money.
