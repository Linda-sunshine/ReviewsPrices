review/summary: Perfect - Exactly what we needed!review/text: We wanted to be able to brew some of our loose leaf teas without all the hassle and this fit the bill. A bit cheaper than the teavana version and from what I can tell it works perfectly.Was a bit skeptical about it leaking on the counter after the tea is dispensed in your mug but that has not been an issue. Its a simple device but it works great!
