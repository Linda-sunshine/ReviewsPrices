review/summary: It works for a little whilereview/text: It's a decent machine for the price. Unfortunately, I feel like I've outgrown the machine rather quickly (this is my first espresso machine.)It's FALLING apart though. I make several drinks a day and it's lasted about a year. Unfortunately, the housing that holds the espresso cup in place is falling apart causing me to forcefully hold the espresso wand in place so that it doesn't come loose and leak water/grounds into my coffee.PASS ON THIS MACHINE. If you plan on having an "investment" in an espresso machine pass on this model. You'll burn through the machine in no time.
