review/summary: Works great with the Hoover C1404 Elite Lightweight Commercial Upright Vacuumreview/text: I bought this at the same time as my new Hoover Elite Commercial, which is light, powerful, and made in the USA, but lacks a hose. So I bought this Eureka to do furniture, baseboards, cracks, and carpeted stairs. It is perfect for all of these applications. This hand vac is especially great for young kids...now THEY can vacuum the steps.I much prefer owning these two lightweight vacs that excel at their specialized tasks over owning one clunky all-purpose vacuum with so-so performance. Plus, I'm happy with my purchases, though I have only owned them for a couple of weeks. I'll update if either fail.
