review/summary: good for carpetsreview/text: This vacuum works well on carpet. If you have a combination solid flooring and carpet, you should know that on wood floors, it will pick up dust but not larger items, such as fir needles from a Christmas tree. It will simply scatter them around causing one to go over the same floor multiple times. And there is no setting for floor or carpet.
