review/summary: Great Popperreview/text: Love this popper! Pops all but a few kernels and makes a good size bowl. I use Orville Rendenbacher's Original. My last hot air popper threw popcorn and un-popped kernels all over the counter and floor and didn't pop half the corn. This one actually AIMS the popped corn into the bowl. At the end a few stray pieces may fly, but that's no big deal. I've only had this a few weeks so I can't comment on how long it lasts. I hope a while.
