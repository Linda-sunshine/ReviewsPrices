review/summary: Expensive & Wastefulreview/text: We were given one as a Christmas present. We like strong coffee, and none of the cups that came with the present will make a strong cup. I'm noticing that these things are in the $120 range, which is sad to see. A $20 coffee maker with a pound of Starbuck's coffee from Target will make you a better cup.Just don't give in to this ridiculous trend. I rate it a 1 star not because it fails to operate but because it is expensive on the front end and to operate, is bad for the environment, and does not make a satisfactory cup of coffee.
