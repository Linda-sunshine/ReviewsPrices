review/summary: Really a nice vacuumreview/text: This was one of my better buys. The vacuum is light weight, and really picks up. I love to empty it and see all the dirt and dog hair it picked up. Never had a bag less vacuum before and I'm 66. Wish I had not waited so long and price was a big plus. The price was the reason I bought it. Very satisfied
