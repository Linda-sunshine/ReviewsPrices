review/summary: Great waffle makerreview/text: After going without a waffle maker for many years when our old one died, we have finally found a super little machine. It makes wonderful waffles, fluffy inside and a little crisp outside. They never stick either. I have tried a couple of recipes but like the basic waffle recipe in the owners booklet. Of course, pecan or walnut waffles are a family favorite just like my adorable mother-in-law used to make. Another super feature is that itCuisinart WMR-CA Round Classic Waffle Makerstores upright with the cord wrapped around which is very helpful. Now I can whip up waffles for my husband and me or the kids and grand kids at a moments notice! Love it!
