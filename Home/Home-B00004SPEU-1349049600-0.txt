review/summary: Great little machine!review/text: I ordered this based on the reviews and the price. For the amount I paid for it, this is a powerful little coffee grinder. It is easy to use and does the job.The only reasons for the one-star deduction are: 1. It gives off a slight odor when you hold the grinding button down for more than a couple of seconds. I don't notice this if I just pulse on and off. 2. The capacity - if you make coffee for multiple people in the morning, you would probably have to grind beans in batches. I need to grind about 6-8 spoonfuls of beans per day, which it handles just fine.
