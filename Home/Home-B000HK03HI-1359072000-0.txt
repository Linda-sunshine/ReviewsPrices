review/summary: I love this can opener!review/text: I really do adore this can opener. I feel like it does most of the work for me. The second it snaps into place I immediately do not have to apply as much pressure to the handles and the turning is soooooo easy! I have to say out of the million can openers I have owned in my life, this one far out weighs the rest.
