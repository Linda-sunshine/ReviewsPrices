review/summary: Excellent and comfortable.review/text: These were bought sight unseen and I and my wife were PLEASANTLY surprised. Great quality, super comfortable and hold up very well with washing. It was more than I originally wanted to pay for bedding at the time, but NOW understand the quality that came with the price and the reviews were very helpful. I did buy several sets and colors, not a problem with any of them.If you want to sleep well and be warm, these things are like sleep aids.Enjoy!
