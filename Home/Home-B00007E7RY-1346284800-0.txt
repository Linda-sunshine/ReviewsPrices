review/summary: Excellent purifier -- accurately describedreview/text: I was nervous when I ordered this, given the comments about other people getting units that weren't the -S model... but I went online and found out that the -S model is the same as the -N model, which made it what I was after. And the unit I received was exactly that: -S. Set-up was incredibly simple, the pre-filter is easy to put on the permanent filter, and my wife's sleep is already hugely improved. I have nothing but praise for the air purifier and its effectiveness. If Amazon would stop "reviewing" it, I'd order a second one for my parents.
