review/summary: light and okay for the pricereview/text: its a okay vacuum cleaner and oviously good for what we pay for. you'll probably need to frequently buy lots of filters.For $60 its not bad as a second lighter vacuum cleaner but it requires more maintenance than your more expensive cleaners; for e.g. filter, change of belts etc..
