review/summary: Fantastic Coffee Every Timereview/text: We have had Presto Coffee Maker for almost 20 years. Finally, the 20 year old one bit the dust. So ordered 2 more-one for home and one for office. Perked coffee is always better and stronger than drip. Not only a great product, but a great investment. Looking at 20 years, this product cost average is about $2 per year. Highly recommend!!!!!
