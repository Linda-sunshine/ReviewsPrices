review/summary: I LOVE my Breville!!!review/text: I purchased this juicer, which I considered &#34;lower end&#34; at the time, because I wasn't quite sure I was sold on juicing. Well, it's been 2 wks that I've been using my Breville Compact and I am surprised to say I LOVE both the machine and juicing!!!Though at first I thought I was settling for this juicer, I'm really happy with my decision. I didn't truly understand how much cutting and such was required with the masticating juicers. Apparently, hard seeds need to be removed as do rinds and anything else that can cause damage to the auger. Not so with the Breville, I throw everything in there. This may not seem like a huge issue, but I've noticed that after thoroughly washing my veggies and cutting off anything that I don't want making my juice bitter, I don't have the patience for more cutting. I think if I had to add that additional step into the pre- and post-juicing clean-up routine, I might use my juicer less. Considering that I'm using it 2x/day, that would be a huge loss nutritionally.I haven't experienced any leaks, pulpy juices, problems greens, or wet pulp. In fact, the only negative I can think of with this machine is the fact that the pulp is contained inside the machine. If I do decide to upgrade, I would likely go with a pulp-expelling machine so I can juice more before cleaning the machine.
