review/summary: Computer Chairreview/text: So I went to cnet.com to look at reviews for good computer chairs and they recommended this one. The last one I bought was pleather, and all it did was shed black plastic bits everywhere. I've had this chair for a couple months, and it still looks new, is comfortable and the casters roll great on hard wood floors. Money well spent.
