review/summary: Griddle riddle: What could expand your middle?review/text: Answer: Pancakes and French Toast in big batches. All your batches will be big using this griddle. Not only pancakes and French Toast, but bacon, fried eggs, sausage. All the breakfast stuff I formerly cooked in itty bitty pans so slowly that my guests were known to sneak out to breakfast and get back before I got everyone fed in batches. No more. We all can all eat together now. I just give each miscreant family member a look that says, "I'm watching you!" as I deftly transfer the stacks of pancakes to a pre-warmed platter. So, do it! Buy this griddle and keep your family all together and away from "egg mcmuffins" and such. You'll be glad you did. I know I am.
