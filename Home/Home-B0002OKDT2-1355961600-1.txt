review/summary: Not the Best Juicer Builtreview/text: If you are in a hurry, this is not the machine you want to purchase. The attachments are cheaply built with thin plastic; and, I just hope that it doesn't break before I get my value from the money I paid to Amazon. The juicer waist is not as dry as they should be....and I am not going to push the scrapes through to get more juice. The motor is quite, but the plastic attachment makes noise when it turns. It also doesn't hold stiff in the machine housing and cycles in an up and down motion as it turns. As cheap of an attachment it is, I would fear placing any downward pressure on the food items as I loaded them into the machine will snap off the Auger/drum assembly
