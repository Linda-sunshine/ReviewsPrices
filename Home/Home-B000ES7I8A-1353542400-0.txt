review/summary: Hamilton Beach Cool Touch Cordless Electric Kettlereview/text: The kettle looks good and works well. The 8 cup size may seem a bit small for a household that uses a lot of hot water at one time. With just one user, it is plenty and more efficient. The cool touch is a bit misleading. While the outside is not hot enough to burn you if you brush against it accidentally, (measures 101d F with a child's thermometer) it is not "cool" as in room temperature. However, you can place your hand on it and hold it there and not get burned.
