review/summary: Good electric wine bottle openerreview/text: I have been using this wine bottle opener for about 6 months now. It works flawlessly and it holds it's charge. My wife likes it so much, she has purchased 2 more as gifts for family. So, it does what is says it does... it removes the cork (natural and/or synthetic ones) and when reversed, it discharges the cork with the touch of a button.
