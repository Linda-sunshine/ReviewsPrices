review/summary: Krups coffee grinder is a beastreview/text: I bought this and the comparable Hamilton model because they both had good reviews. I have to say I dont use this for coffee. I take a lot of big pills and have a hard time taking them so I wanted something powerful enough to grind them into a power so I can mix with a shake. The hamilton barely even touched the the pills but the Krups was GREAT. It turned it in to a fine powder. If it can do this to the horse pills that I take then I can only imagine what it could do to anything else, a must buy. I would pay more for it. I bought this in 2009 and its still going strong
