review/summary: Great for cookie dough, but horrible for ice creamreview/text: I've been using the 2 teaspoon size scoop for a couple years now for cookies - the small scoop makes cookies that are small enough that I can grab a few without feeling like I've just overindulged. It's been working great, even with cold chocolate chip cookie dough.Today, however, I tried to use it to scoop ice cream to put into some profiteroles. The ice cream was too cold and twisted and warped the dough release arm completely by the third scoop. Definitely do not use it for anything too cold/grabby, it'll break the scooper pretty easily.
