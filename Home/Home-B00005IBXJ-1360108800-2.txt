review/summary: perfect every timereview/text: We waited to review this product after almost a year or so of use. We love this little machine. We live in a small apt. so turning on the oven in the summer was costly and heated up the living space too much. This is quick and cooks very evenly. We tried cookies once and they came out ok, but we probably wont use it for that again. Pizza's are perfect every time since you control how crip the crust is. Does flat bread perfectly as well. There is good distance from the top heating element to allow for some thick chicken legs. We like to do garlic bread for pasta on this since its so fast and only cooks the top. Toquitos, burritos, french fries, nuggets, and everything else we have tried have come out crisp, quickly, and cooked through without problems. Solid design, although, we wish it had a handle. We store it in a cabinet and it is extremely awkward to move unfortunately. Cleaning isn't bad, but the teflon on the pan scratches super easily, but thats normal. Dont be afraid to spray non-stick on it first. Great lasting design.
