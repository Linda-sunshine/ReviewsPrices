review/summary: Juicer was good, customer service is notreview/text: I've been able to juice with this three times so far (wheatgrass only), and those three times were great. Certainly better than the previous juicer I tried. At the end of my 3rd juicing session, the screen broke. I contacted Omega via email for warranty replacement, and never heard anything. When I called them, I experienced "longer than normal hold times" before I finally got to a human that told me yes, my replacement order was in the system (thanks for telling me!) and that the screens were backordered and expected "next week". It's now two weeks later, and I still don't have a screen. I called again, and after three calls where I was hung up on as I was being connected (didn't sound like a connection problem; it sounded like a person picking up, then hanging up, a handset), I was told that the screens are still backordered and expected "next week". I have now been without the juicer almost as long as I was able to use it.
