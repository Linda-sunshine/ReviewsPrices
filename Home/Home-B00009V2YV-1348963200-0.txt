review/summary: Nice, but not perfect.review/text: I really like my weather radio. We don't watch cable or network television so this has been really handy with keeping us informed of the weather in our area. We had a few issues with hail in my area during pop-up storms over the summer. Since this radio would alert us when there was a new watch or warning we were able to use it to gauge when we needed to put the cars in the garage. According to what I have read it also will give us warnings related to the nuclear power plant (which is about 10 miles away). We felt it was essential in our area where we are also sometimes affected by hurricanes.I like the fact that you can program certain warnings and also put in more than one weather "area code." You can obtain those from NOAA's website.I liked it so much I purchased my mother one for her birthday. The only complaint I have is that you don't get a message or warning with a "special weather statement" and unfortunately it seems like NOAA is doing more of those than watches and warnings lately.
