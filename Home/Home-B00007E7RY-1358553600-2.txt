review/summary: Lets clear the Airreview/text: Cleans the air as it claims it would, however the fan will sporadically shut off when in the high position, I think it is a safety function. Does not do it on low. Not an issue in the small room I am in, but may be an issue in a larger room. But for me I am happy.
