review/summary: Great vacuum for the money paidreview/text: I purchased this particular vacuum after reviewing quite a few other ones due to its positive reviews and price. I didn't want to spend a lot as I was reluctantly replacing a more expensive vacuum that had stopped working. This vacuum has great suction which is exactly what I was looking for due to having 3 cats. The hose does feel cheap like other reviews pointed out and can get crimped but when it is fully extended I have few issues overall. I love that this vacuum is light weight and easy to carry-unlike my previous clunkier vacuum.
