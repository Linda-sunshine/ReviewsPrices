review/summary: Favorite tool when making cookies/cupcakesreview/text: The more I've gotten into baking, the more I've turned into a slight perfectionist. I love the ability to make my cookies very uniform in size, so that they cookie very uniformly. Hence I got a cookie scoop.I have had both the medium and large scoop for a year now, and they are working great still. The squeeze action works great, and I've had no problems with cookie dough not releasing properly. I will sometimes use the large scoop to load cupcake/muffin batter into the pan. It's important for those to be uniformly filled! I have never used either scoop for ice cream though. I have another specific ice cream scoop (doesn't have a squeeze mechanism).These scoops can be a bit tricky to clean if you let dough harden in them (as in dont wash/rinse out immediately), so I'll soak them a bit to loosen the dough or use my dishwasher. Most of the time I rinse out the dough right after use, so I can then clean by hand later. Overall good clean up.
