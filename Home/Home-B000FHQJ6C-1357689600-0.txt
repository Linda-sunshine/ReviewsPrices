review/summary: Use It 2x/day LOVE this Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Juice Extractor 67650! *new to juicingreview/text: After shopping around (new to juicing) I ordered the 67650 from Amazon.com with free s&h.; Reviews & feedback on amazon and demos on youtube were helpful but I am hooked now and I experiment with different fruits & veges TWICE/day. After juicing, I am able to disassemble, clean/dry and assemble this juicer in a matter of 3minutes! The brush provided to scrub clean the metal part is helpful and I always use plastic bag (for convenience) inside of the larger container that catches pulp. I am extremely happy with this purchase.***UPDATE***Well here we are exactly one month to the date of ordering BIG MOUTH Hamilton Beach juicer 67650 has FAILED.Turned switch from off to on and "nothing".Apparently motor has failed. Thank goodness I paid the $6.99 for Canopy 2yr protection plan. I should receive replacement in 7-10 business days. ;^/
