review/summary: Came incomplete, failed after 5 months, did not work wellreview/text: We called to order a gold mesh basket, and were told that we should have gotten one with the unit. Customer service was very pleasant and efficient in sending us one, but nowhere in the documentation received would we have known that we should have gotten one.Initial brew time was 25 min, extending to 35 min. It was very loud, and would frequently wake me on automatic cycle.Died after four months of occasional more than once a day use. This is the second Cuisinart that has suffered a death in childhood. Apparently the design is bad. Searching for solutions on the net, it seems that any little bit of grounds will clog the water delivery tube causing the device to overheat and blow a fuse. This is not customer reparable. Grounds can be expected to occasionally overflow, so the design allows for breakdown in normal use.Not worth sending back as Cuisinart expects customer to pay shipping both ways, which would probably come out to ~$25 on a $100 item. Further there was no guarantee that Cuisinart would decide the problem was theirs, and they warned that if they decided we caused the problem, we would have to pay for repair as well.We must say that the carafe was quite good at keeping the coffee warm.We decided that Cuisinart is not a worthy coffee maker company, and to switch brands.
