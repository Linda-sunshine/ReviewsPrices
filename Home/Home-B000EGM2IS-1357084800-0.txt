review/summary: How did I live without it?review/text: This is a hot water dispenser. You pour water into the top, plug it in, push the start button, and about 45 seconds later, it dispenses hot water into a cup below. It works great and is far faster and easier than microwaving or boiling water.My only complaint is one that I have read elsewhere in these reviews: I wish that it was slightly taller so that it could accommodate taller glasses. But, it's not a huge deal, and I still give the product 5-stars.
