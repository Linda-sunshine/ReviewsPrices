review/summary: Great coffeemakerreview/text: This coffeemaker is great...I love it's simplicity. It keeps coffee hot for hours! I have made the mistake of leaving the thermal plug in the lid after cleaning and during brewing the coffee went everywhere but in the pot. I wish it was foolproof but not. Other than my error it is working wonderfully!
