review/summary: nice coffee makerreview/text: I received this coffee maker about 2 and 1/2 years ago as a wedding present and it's still working well today. I agree with other reviewers that the height is a little bothersome as I do end up pulling it out from underneath my cabinets to fill it every morning, but I really don't even think about it anymore -- not a big deal. I haven't used all of the functions, but I like the 1-4 cup extra hot setting since I'm usually only making coffee for myself. Mostly just wanted to chime in since it seems some other people were having problems with defective machines. Mine gets daily use and still works just as well as the day I got it. Also still think it looks nice on the counter :)
