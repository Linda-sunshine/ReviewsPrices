review/summary: Hoover sweeperreview/text: Sweeper is performing as well as my previous Hoover. Price was excellent and quality is good. Shipping was fast. The only thing I do not like is where the cord is attached to the sweeper. I have used a twister to attach cord to the place where cord winds around the top holder so I do not run over the cord. Strange design but sweeper does an excellent job!
