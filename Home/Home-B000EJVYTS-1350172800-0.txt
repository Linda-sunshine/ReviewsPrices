review/summary: 3 yrs later - just OKreview/text: I bought 2 of these cans almost 3 yrs ago. I still have them but I'm looking to replace them.Pros: you can use your own trash bags, they hold a good amount of trash, I like the look of the slim design.Cons: the ring inside that allows the bags not to show works well if you never overstuff. If you want to push down the trash to fit more in, then the bag comes off the rim. We stopped using the rims a couple of months after we got the cans. The outside is impossible to keep clean - fingerprints and smudges abound. The touchless mechanism is nice except that they open whenever anyone (including the dog) walks past them, which is annoying. We didn't replace the batteries when they died, and now just lift the lid with our hands. The lid is a little flimsy - part of the plastic broke off quite a while ago, probably because one of the kids or friends tried to shove something big in that pushed the open lid back too far. Paper plates don't fit well - you have to angle them in or fold them.
