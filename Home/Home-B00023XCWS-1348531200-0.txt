review/summary: defective productreview/text: I ordered this Silex electric kettle Dec 2011. It stopped working in Sept. 2012, less than 10 months old. The cost to replace it under their warranty was 2/3 of the original cost. I probably will never buy a Proctor Silex product again. It did work fine when it was working but a 10 month life is not acceptable.
