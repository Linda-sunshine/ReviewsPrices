review/summary: LOVE ITreview/text: We just used it camping, and I must say, it is a quality product and very much worth the twenty bucks it sells for. It is very well made, and I had no problems with the plastic top piece that everyone seems to complain about. I also got thePerma-Brew 3 Year Re-useable Coffee Filter, Diskand it works very well and fits inside the basket and helps reduce grinds in your coffee.My only gripe is not having enough experience using this, so I don't really know proper grind size and length of percolating time to yield the best cup of coffee. I like strong coffee, so I filled the basket with about a medium grind and let it percolate for 20 minutes (in retrospect, I probably should have used a finer grind). The coffee came out delicious, but I found it wasn't really strong enough for my taste, so I'll have to figure out how to make it more to my liking. One concern is really the length of time it takes from start to finish - a good 20 to 30 minutes. It's perfect for camping, but I don't think I have the patience to use it at home when I have a perfectly good drip coffee maker at home.
