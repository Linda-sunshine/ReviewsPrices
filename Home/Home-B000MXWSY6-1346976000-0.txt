review/summary: Great little clock radio!review/text: I love this little clock radio. I needed a small clock that would fit on my small bedside table and the size is perfect. It is very easy to use. I like that there are dual alarms, I don't have to worry about remembering to set the alarm for my husband after I get up. The radio brings in my station very clearly. My old clock/radio didn't get very good reception. Great value!
