review/summary: new perkreview/text: I finally had to break down and buy a new percolator, mine was over 30 years old. I can only hope this one lasts as long. I do like that it has all stainless parts, no plastic. I wish it had the glass perk top but that is just fine. It works grate and the coffee is the best. I debated between another perc or to switch to a Keurig, but I hate the waste of those little cups.
