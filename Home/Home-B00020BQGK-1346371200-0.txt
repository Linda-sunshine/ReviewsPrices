review/summary: Terrific Itemreview/text: A great small vacuum! It is great for quick pick up that the full size vacuum was always used for. It does a great job on low pile carpet, kitchen clean ups, hardwood floors. It is great to be able to switch from floor cleaning to carpet cleaning. It is easy to clean out the dirt cup. The cord is a reasonable length, it is quiet. It is just a great purchase for the price. I would recommend this product.
