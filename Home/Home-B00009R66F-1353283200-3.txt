review/summary: Dries Fast!review/text: I purchased this machine on sale at Walmart for $129.00. I have always before rented the rug doctor before buying this one. This one cleaned better and was dry MUCH faster! I was walking around on the carpet in a couple of hours without my socks getting wet! My dinning room has light beige carpet and shows drips from spilled liquids and any other accident quite easily. I went over 2 years without cleaning it and it was looking horrible! Today, I decided to invest in my own machine before the holidays and am so glad I did! Now I can keep up with cleaning without the major hassle of renting a heavy machine. 5 STARS!
