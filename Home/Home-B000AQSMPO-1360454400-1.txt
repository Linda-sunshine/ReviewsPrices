review/summary: 3.5 years of Keurig experiencereview/text: We have now owned two Keurigs. We bought our first one three and a half years ago. It worked great for two years. And then over the course of a week or two everything seemed to be going wrong until it just would not brew coffee. We bought another one. that one made it about a year and a half before the same thing happened. If you like the ease and convenience of single cup brewing you had better have a back up coffee maker. We are now using our $30 Mr Coffee. It has always worked. Be warned that these Keurig machines are for the most part a $150 disposable coffee maker. We will not buy another one.
