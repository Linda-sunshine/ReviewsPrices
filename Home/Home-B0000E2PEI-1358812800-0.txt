review/summary: Very Accuratereview/text: Having this scale has helped me keep a detailed track on my weight. I was fighting to lose my excess weight when I was in high school because I was a cheerleader. I didn't want to stray from my weight limit and revert back to my chubby grade school years. This scale is accurate in that in just approximately 2 seconds after you have gotten into it. The accuracy and detail that it has could not surmount to any weighing scale that I had ever had.I highly recommend this one.
