review/summary: simple and helpful!review/text: I had read all the reviews before purchasing this item and am very happy with what I got. I used it mainly for grinding pork and beef. Yes, you need to let the meat freeze a little bit but i have no problem of grinding them. My 8 year-old loves to help me.
