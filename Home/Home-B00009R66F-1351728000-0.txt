review/summary: mom of 4review/text: I bought this becaus I have 4 kids and needed an easy reliable cleaning tool. Well, as a Hoover fan, I was sorely dissappointed in this product. From the first time I used it I thought it would be great. The next 4 times over a 2 year period I couldn't get it to work. I followed all instructions and suction, or other problems always persisted. It is not user friendly and I would never recommend this product to anyone. I finally just smashed it to bits out of frustration and threw it in the garbage. Good riddence.
