review/summary: Just Follow The Directions and You'll Enjoy Owning Thisreview/text: This powerful easy - to - use - and - store product is terrific. I thicken soups right in the pot. I make smoothies in a plastic receptacle. It is imperative that you read the directions. It takes a light touch to use it. S-l-o-w-l-y raising it up and down without hitting the bottom of the receptacle you're using will give you the results you want and need. I'm a big Cuisinart fan. Don't know if this was made in China or USA. It's easy to disassemble for cleaning and reassemble as well.
