review/summary: All-around best pressure cooker/cannerreview/text: This is a quality product. Talking about it isn't the same as using one to learn for one's self what a quality product can do. Read the instructions, and follow the directions. I've used other pressure cooker/canners, but the All American pressure cooker/canner is the best I've found and had the pleasure to use. That's why I didn't hesitate to buy one as a gift for a young family.
