review/summary: Great for making chicken treats for dogsreview/text: I bought this product to avoid buying chicken treats made in China. Works great and costs me pennies on the dollar of purchasing chicken treats made in the USA. Took a few batches to perfect my end result. I am definately pleased with the performance of this dehydrator. Will probably get creative someday and dehydrate some people treats, too, but I have probably already tripled my purchase price in savings by making the chicken treats with this dehydrator.
