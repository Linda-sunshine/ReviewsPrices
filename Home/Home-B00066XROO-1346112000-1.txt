review/summary: Highly recommendedreview/text: Easy to clean, lots of surface to cook on. Heats evenly, within reason. Only wish it has a longer cord (not a big deal). Very happy with my purchase.***After about three months of use. We love it. Some reviewers noted some inconsistency with heating around the surface of griddle, and the only thing I can figure is that they were cooking on the griddle when it was warming up. You will always have hot spots at the elements areas until it has time to dissipate. This griddle comes with my highest recommendation.
