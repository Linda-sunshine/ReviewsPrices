review/summary: The COOLEST toaster that I have ever owned!!!!!!review/text: I ordered this to replace a toaster oven that I had picked up at Lowe's. I am so glad, I read the review and wasn't quiet sure how this would arrive. Man o man, THIS IS THE BEST TOASTER WE HAVE EVER OWNED HANDS DOWN!!! We are big bagel eaters at our house and I love the dual toasting capabilities. I read others say that the toasting is uneven and have to say that we have never experienced that, it is a great buy and looks cool too!!
