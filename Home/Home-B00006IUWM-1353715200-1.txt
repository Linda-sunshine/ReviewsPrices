review/summary: Worth the moneyreview/text: Works pretty good and quick. Gets knives usefully sharp, but after sharpening according to instructions I gave each of my knives a couple of quick passes with a manual sharpener that did both edges at once as the Presto usually left burrs on one side or the other.
