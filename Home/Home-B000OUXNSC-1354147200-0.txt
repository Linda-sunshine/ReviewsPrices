review/summary: Great item for pricereview/text: Love this mattress cover. Its rich and made of good material. Its sides are a good quality elastic that will not shrink or fall apart in the dryer. Its very soft and cozy. I think for the 16.00 spent, its a fabulous bargain. I compared to others at Kohl's and Ross, and nothing was found under 40 dollars for my cal king mattress.
