review/summary: Nearly perfect but died very quicklyreview/text: If this kettle hadn't died so quickly, I'd strongly recommend it.Love the fact that it's all stainless steel so there's no plastic in contact with the water (research shows this is important for health reasons, due to leaching of toxins from plastic into water, especially at high temperatures).Also, the double vacuum walls of the kettle are a great feature that i wish were on every electric kettle, as they serve two valuable functions: keeping the water inside hotter for longer, while keeping the outside of the kettle cool to the touch.Unfortunately, the kettle suddenly stopped working (with no warning or obvious symptoms) after about 6 months of use over an 18-month period, which is unacceptable.
