review/summary: Brita Pitcher-updatereview/text: Looks good in my fridge. Water comes out looking clear and clean. Tastes great, and very refreshing, much more tasty than bottled water.Update:I had to update this. The cover does not close securely when full. It tends to fall off while pouring, if not held down.
