review/summary: Great coffee pot!review/text: We've had cuisinart coffee pot since the late 90's. Others never gave us hot coffee in the morning so we actually bought it cause it looked heavy duty. With age and alot of use over the years the switch is going on it so time for a new one and this brand I will again purchase! To our surprise colors available. Thats cool. But what I really want to state is, I love the timer. Great to get up in the morning and simply pour yourself a cup of coffee not having to wait. Setting it up is simple. Just pour the water with its cover you have no spillage then set up your coffe in the basket and set it on if you use auto.
