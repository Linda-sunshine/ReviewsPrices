review/summary: iTouchless Automatic Trash Canreview/text: We owned a prior model for the last 3 years. When the lid hinge finally wore out, I did not hesitate to order this model. The shape of the can has changed, and the ring around the top has been improved upon, making it easier to change bags. Nice change! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the motion sensor is not as sensitive as the old model, and you have to get closer to the can and in a specific "zone" to activate the lid. I like the old model sensor in that respect. Overall, it gets a lot of use, is durable, easy to clean, and the bags are easy to change. Definitely a "buy" in my opinion.
