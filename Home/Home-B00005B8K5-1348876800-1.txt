review/summary: The lids don't fitreview/text: I have not had these long, have not used them for anything but freezing so far and after reading the reviews I won't be using them for anything but freezing and storage.But even then I found it was very difficult to get the lids on. Finally I ran a lid under hot water, then quickly dried it and was able to get the lid on the container but otherwise they would not fit.I wonder if these are even made in the US.
