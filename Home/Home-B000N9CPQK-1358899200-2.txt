review/summary: I like it.review/text: Been living with this for a couple months now and I'm finally ready to report back. It gets the air pretty clean. I've run it almost nonstop and still haven't gotten a change filter light but I have vacuumed it out to remove large dust and particles. My only complaint is that the low setting is too loud to sleep in the same room with. Unless you're the type of person that enjoys a fan or other white noise it will become bothersome. Also, the ionizing is a complete joke, but all ionizing filters are so I won't knock it down for that.I'm not sure if I would buy this again. For the price range it's good but I think I might like something quieter with a carbon filter in the future.
