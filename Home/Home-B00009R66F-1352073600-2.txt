review/summary: Just okay.review/text: This carpet cleaner did not wow me. It is pretty hard to get the thing put together to even use. My husband even had a hard time. The directions for assembly are TERRIBLE. When we finally figured out where everything goes (only really by guessing)we tested a spot on the carpet. It looks pretty good and clean. I would spot treat before using this on some of the heavy stains.
