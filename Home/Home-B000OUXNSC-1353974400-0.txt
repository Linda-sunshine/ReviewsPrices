review/summary: It ripped!review/text: We bought these for our children's bunk beds. After the 2nd wash, this mattress pad started ripping/shredding/disintegrating. I'm not actually sure what exactly happened. It was intact before washing and then totally disintegrated! Gross, gross - and a disappointing waste of money! Don't buy it!!
