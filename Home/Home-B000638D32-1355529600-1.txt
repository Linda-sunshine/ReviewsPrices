review/summary: Great Knife!review/text: This is the best knife I have ever used. I am a professional cook and have used everything from the most expensive to the downright awful standard company provided knives. This one maintains its' edge. It's comfortable in my hand for long periods and mass production. The very best feature may be the slip resistant handle. I bought this to use at work and now I'm buying another one for home use.
