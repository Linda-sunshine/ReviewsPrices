review/summary: the best pressure cooker!review/text: I have been using the pressure cooker for 2 years. It works great! Save time and money--it only takes 4 mins to cook 5-6 large whole potatoes that I used to make mashed potatoes, and 6 mins to make beef stew! Just one thing-- it's good for big families, but a little big for a 2-person family.
