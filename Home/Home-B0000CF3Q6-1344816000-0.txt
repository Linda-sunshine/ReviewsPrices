review/summary: Not normally a coffee drinker.review/text: I've never been that much into coffee, but I think that instant is for emergencies/backpacking only. I needed something small for my house, and luckily my brother suggested this little beauty. Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store; everything that I needed in an espresso maker. The price is also reasonable, and with how sturdy it feels I can't imagine needing to replace this maker for a long time.
