review/summary: Perfect for a small familyreview/text: I used to use a Rubbermaid plastic water jug for water, but the water started tasting off. I decided to switch to glass because it doesn't leech into the water and it pours more easily. This jug has been one of my best purchases ever. It may be small for a family bigger than 4, but you can always look for larger or buy a second.The lid takes some getting used to and the directions are not the best. All you have to do to seal the jug is place the lid on the jug, hold the grippy edge of the lid and turn the center handle of the lid. This will tighten the lid around the rubber seal. You can check the seal by lightly tugging on the lid to see if it is loose. Sometimes you have to really loosen the outer part before tightening. I have not had trouble after 6 months of use. Love it!
