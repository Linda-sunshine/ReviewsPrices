review/summary: Queen Size Sheetsreview/text: I purchased queen size bed sheets with two pillow cases. The sheets fit fine and they wash well.The pillow cases are about an inch or so too narrow.It's a very tight squeeze to fit the queen size pillows into the cases. That's why I rated them with 4 stars.
