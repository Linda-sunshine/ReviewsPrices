review/summary: Great Breadmakerreview/text: Really enjoyed this bread maker. Just a couple tips - remove loaf from pan as soon as it is done to avoid a thick, hard crust. Don't make any mistakes programming the cooking cycle; these can be difficult or impossible to correct, even after unplugging the unit. However these are small issues. Overall very pleased with this bread maker.
