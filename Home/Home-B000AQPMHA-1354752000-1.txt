review/summary: you will be replacing this machine every yearreview/text: We have had to replace this unit 7 times in the last 5 years, they all have the same problem. One day it will give you a half cup. You will think you pushed the wrong button, but that's not the problem. The units pump will run and run, and take forever to pour the half cup of coffee. I would have gone back to a regular coffee machine if it wasn't for the several hundred dollar collection of K cups I own. Keurig: Isn't it time to fix this problem and stop abusing your customers to increase your bottom line?
