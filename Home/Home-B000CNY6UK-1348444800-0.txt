review/summary: My daily-dosage of caffeine has never been so well attended.review/text: I'm an experienced coffee drinker. I met Bialetti espresso machines in Cosenza, Italy, while I was abroad and visiting a friend. She introduced me to this particular Italian way of making coffee and boy, believe me, if you're a coffee lover too you need one of these! The coolest part of this product is its durability, portability, and fidelity in taste. If there's one thing coffee lovers like myself like is fidelity of taste. Most metal apparatus spoil the taste of coffee--not this little machine. It'll provide you with the taste you need and the energy boost you've been looking for, always keeping the refined taste of the coffee brand you bought.
