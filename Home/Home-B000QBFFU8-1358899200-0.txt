review/summary: One of my best purchasesreview/text: Juicer came in a huge box. That's because I had to open two amazon packages to get to the manufacture box. This item was safely packaged for delivery.I bought the juicer to up my vegetable and fruit intake. And it worked. During my first week, I juiced every single day. 2 months later, I would say I juice about 3 times a week. So did the juicer help with upping my veggie intake? Absolutely!!Great vegetables to juice include Kale, celery, spinach, mustard, beets and parsley. My favorite fruits to juice are pineapples, apples, pears and kiwi.Juicer works great. No complaints.
