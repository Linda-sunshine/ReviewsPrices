review/summary: great for my kitchenreview/text: I have needed a food processor for years and have always trusted the Cuisinart brand to provide high quality products. So when I finally decided which one I wanted, I looked at all the brands, but hands down Cuisinart had the best reviews. I wanted one with a dough hook attachment but it seems they are not made any more, so I settled on this one. It has a dough blade, which I tested out on cookie dough first thing. Maybe I am not used to using a food processor for making dough but I was disappointed at how often I had to open it up and scrape the dough from the sides back onto the blade. I doubt that would be necessary if there was a dough hook attachment. But for the price, this one does great for everything else I need it for. Guacamole turned out pureed though, I have to practice on that.
