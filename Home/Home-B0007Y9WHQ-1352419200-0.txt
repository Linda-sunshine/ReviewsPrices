review/summary: Great Product!review/text: I first received this with no paperwork and then was very disappointed to find out the blade was not slicing my zucchini properly to make noodles. They were coming out in 1 inch chops instead of long noodles. I exchanged it and when I received my second one there was paperwork, the blades had plastic seals on them and everything worked properly. Apparently I was sent someone's reject the first time so make sure you check your packaging to make sure all is there with the paperwork.The device itself is great! Slices the food effortlessness and quickly. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to eat healthier!
