review/summary: A little worried based on some reviews....but more than meets expectationsreview/text: I was a little worried upon reading some reviews about this product but after purchasing and using this I can honestly say it more than meets expectations. For the price I would be shocked if there is another product out there that can beat this. Some reviewers are complaining about the mug having a plastic coating inside but for this price you probably cant even purchase a good mug by itself. To me it does not make sense to complain about something as if you spent $200 and you are dissapointed. I am sure that B&D can make improvements somehow, but again for under $20 there is no other product that can beat this. I find it very unlikely that someone would be dissapointed if they purchased this.
