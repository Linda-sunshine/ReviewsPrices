review/summary: Very very soft and comfortablereview/text: We purchased this product to use on a sleeper-sofa acquired from Free-cycle. The sofa was from a family that had four kids and was, as they say, much loved. The mattress on the sleeper part was completely shot, you could all but feel the springs through it. We decided to get this mattress cover to put over it for when we have guests over. Our guests have loved it. They've all made comments about sinking into it and not rolling over... it is really cushy. It does have a very interesting vanilla-mint scent to it, but that has faded over the time we've owned it. Our biggest struggled with it is figuring out a way to roll it back up for storage in our urban two-bedroom apartment, as it can be very bulky. Otherwise, we are quite glad we purchased it.
