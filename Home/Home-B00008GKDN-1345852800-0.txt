review/summary: excellent crepe panreview/text: I have been using this pan for making crepes for about 3 years. I cook on a gas range and the heavy cast iron really evens out the heat no matter what setting I use. The seasoned surface with a very thin coating of walnut oil easily releases the crepes. Unfortunately I am trying to make crepes without egg yolks and now they are sticking. I may have to cave and get a non-stick pan! I still give the Lodge pan 5 stars.
