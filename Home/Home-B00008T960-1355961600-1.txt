review/summary: P E R F E C Treview/text: Use it for cookies, pork chops, chicken, fish, you name it. Does exactly what it should by helping to cook evenly. Use it with a Nordic sheet pan and never fails. Followed another poster's suggestion of storing in an empty paper towel roll to protect. Works like a charm. Easy to clean! Just keep the sharp knives away.
