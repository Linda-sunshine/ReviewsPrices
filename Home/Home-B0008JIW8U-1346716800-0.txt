review/summary: best little coffee makerreview/text: This is the best little coffee maker I have found. It makes 2 mugs full, just right for my morning joe. It is small and doesn't take up much room on the counter either. I use it on a timer so my coffee is ready when my alarm goes off. Coffee turns out very tasty and has no plastic'y tastes. Thank you Mr Coffee, for a good coffee maker!!! I would recommend to a friend. My husband wants one for himself too.
