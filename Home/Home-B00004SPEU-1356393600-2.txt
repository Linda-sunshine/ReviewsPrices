review/summary: Very Robust Fine Grinderreview/text: I grind coffee at home, and I grind it very fine because I drink it Armenian/Greek style - concentrated and boiled in a small coffee pot, thus it has to be fine ground. I have tried many grinders, and this one is the finest. During grinding I shake it so that the ground coffee doesn't stick to the walls and gets ground to a fine condition. Any other grinder will probably break in month.
