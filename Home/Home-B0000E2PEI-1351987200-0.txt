review/summary: Accurate and Consistent Scalereview/text: This scale has been great thus far. It looks stylish and the weights have been accurate and consistent. I did the trick of weighing myself and then grabbing a 5 pound weight to weigh myself again. It passed that test, so I was pleased. I also like that fact that the Taylor 7506 scale displays the weight down to two tenths instead of just half pound increments.
