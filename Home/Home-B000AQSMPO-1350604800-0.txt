review/summary: quit working 18 months after purchasereview/text: I enjoyed my brewer- while it worked. I did not use it much the first year bc I was pregnant. Now I make 2 cups a day. Problem is- it just died. Will not turn on at all. I emailed Customer service and they never got back to me- then I called and it was one of those call centers. She told me it was my fault for not descaling every 3 months. I have descaled it- just not every 3 months bc we use filtered water. So does not last long and customer service is lacking. For the price it should last longer than 18 months.
