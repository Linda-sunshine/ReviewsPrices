review/summary: 8 month reviewreview/text: I purchased this product along with other coffee making items in April 2012, and now its Jan 2013. Still going strong, and my lattes like or better than what I can order at Starbucks.Here's my poor man's espresso set up, I paid a total of $120$20 Coffee grinder:KRUPS 203-42 Electric Spice and Coffee Grinder with Stainless Steel?blades,?Black$80 Espresso maker: THIS De'Longhi EC155$15 12oz Milk frothing cup:KRUPS XS5012 12 Ounce Stainless Steel Milk Frothing Pitcher,?Silver$5 5oz Espresso cup:Update International BC-5 Stainless Steel Bell Creamer, 5-Ounce, 2-3/8-InchThis month I was concerned with the espresso maker. It was only dripping (or sometimes not at all) and a 2.5oz shot would take 60 seconds! I tried to clean and unclog the porta-filters. I removed and cleaned the filter by the boiler. I even twice tried to descale the machine using a 1:1 distilled vinegar and water solution, making sure I give it 15 minutes before flushing out the solution. Even after spending a couple of hours doing this, the machine refused to cooperate.Finally, I sucked it up and went to bed-bath-beyond and bought a brand-name descalerDurgol Swiss Espresso Special Decalcifier, 2-Pack 4.2 fluid ounce Bottles. The instructions were to dump the 4.2oz with 4.2oz water in the tank and run that through the machine. I was quite pessimistic initially! However, this actually worked! I had to flush 4-5 tanks of water through the machine to completely flush the solution out. I'm now writing this review after pulling a perfectly timed 25-second shot on my newly restored EC155.I remember when I initially bought the machine that it was quite loud, and I was happy that with use the thing quieted down a bit with use. However, I noticed that after descaling the machine is now as loud as it was new! Bummer!So... I guarantee this machine will stop working if not maintained properly. I'm amazed that the thing kept working for 8 months without any maintenance. I wholeheartedly recommend the durgol descaler to restore your EC155 to full working order!
