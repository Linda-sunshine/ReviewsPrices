review/summary: Awesome product but...review/text: Hey I love this item, but they should put what I am about to say on the directions. When this humidifier gets dust in it, it makes A LOT of noise compared to when it is brand new. Please store this item in a plastic bag when not using! It will keep the dust away and make this humidifier last a lot longer. I've used this for a few seasons, but I need to buy a new one because of this issue. I have the Hello Kitty model.
