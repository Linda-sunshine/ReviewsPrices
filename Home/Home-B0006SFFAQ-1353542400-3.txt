review/summary: Not to Fond of this One!review/text: I am not too fond of this coffee pot. I like the fact it's programmable and has auto-shut off. But it steams up and ruins cabinets. We had it for less than a year and it took FOREVER to brew making the coffee bitter as well as it wouldn't brew the whole pot; filling it up to over the 12 mark and it would brew the 10 mark the rest went up in steam! The $5 coffee pot we got from Wal*Mart the day after Thanksgiving has lasted better!
