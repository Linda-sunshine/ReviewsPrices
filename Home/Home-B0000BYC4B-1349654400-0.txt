review/summary: Ball Mouth Plastic Storage Caps/Jarden #1440036010 Ball Plastic Canning Jar Cap, Set of 8review/text: Works fine and does the job. I use these plastic lids to store juice in the fridge and it keeps a nice seal that won't corrode like the metal lids. To find out more about juicing and the benefits I suggest watching Dan the Life Regenerator on youtube. I continue to learn alot from him and got the links and suggestions for everything I have needed to get healthier which lead me to buy the lids for my mason jars so I can store my juice safely in the fridge for up to 48 hours..
