review/summary: Kept its shape for only 1 year.review/text: I was very happy with the look, with how the kettle worked until one year has passed after I purchased it. I noticed after the first couple month that the kettle would start up by itself if the water level is too low. So I took a habit of unplugging it. But after one year of use, the main blue bottom came off and the top of the kettle started chipping off showing the cheap plastic underneath. So now I am looking for a different one. Would love to get a Brown brand, but just seems to be impossible to get it in USA. This is the only brand that never failed me or my friends.
