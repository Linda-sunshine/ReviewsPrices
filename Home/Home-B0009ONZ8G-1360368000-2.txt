review/summary: It does good job on cleaning.review/text: It has great suction and really picks up the dog hair. The downfall is that the cord is short, so you have to chance outlets alot. Also the hose is short and not very fexible and when using it with the attachments, it tends to come lose easy. I would probably not buy this model again.
