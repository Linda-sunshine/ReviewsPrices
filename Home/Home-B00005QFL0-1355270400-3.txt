review/summary: Very pleased with this machinereview/text: I have had and been quite satisfied with several bread machines over the years from different brands including cuisanart and breadman, but this is my first Panasonic. Following instructions about how to get the bake settings correct is a little confusing to start but its a short learning curve and you'll be making delicious breads in no time. It seems to be quieter than other machines I've had which is a plus.
