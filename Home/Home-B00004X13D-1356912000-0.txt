review/summary: Giftreview/text: I bought this as a gift. I am sure the recipient will be pleased. I have the exact same waffle baker. We only use it on occasion, a couple/few times a month. It took us only one batch of mix to figure out how we liked to pour the dough so the waffle would come out to our liking. I use a light cooking spray and have never had trouble removing the waffles. We do not make anything fancy, just the standard box biscuit mix and sometimes some chocolate chips.
