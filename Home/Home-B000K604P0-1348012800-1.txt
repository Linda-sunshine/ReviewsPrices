review/summary: thermos nissan jmw500p6 16 ozreview/text: this is the greatest. after looking for years to replace my aladdin coffee mug with one equally good, finally saw this one in the hands of my friend. found out where she got it, and went immediately to the source. i use this every day. it keeps the coffee super hot, and i assume it keeps cold just as well, therefore just bought a second for my daughter to take her water to school. totally leak proof-i have even tossed it in a bag while full! fits in my car's mug holder, unlike many i've tried! looks good too. the only possible flaw is that when you flip the top up, it can get in the way, but you adapt by turning it. it's worth it to have a top that is attached. i also just bought the "bottle brush" that amazon recommends, as i can see that i will want it to get the mug clean, and i know it will be useful in general. it shipped for free too, which is a requirement for my on-line purchases. if i were generous enough i would buy a dozen and give them to all my friends as gifts. wonder if there is a volume discount??
