review/summary: good for the pricereview/text: I bought this to replace my 4 cup GE coffee pot whose top cracked and came apart. I only drink about 1 cup a day and didn't want to spend $40-$100 dollars on one of the more popular machines where the reviews seemed mixed. I've had this B&D coffeemaker for a week and its been great. When I took it out of the box I used a vinegar/water mix to clean it, then ran plain water through it about 5 times. No plastic taste, or anything. It may drip a little onto the base when you remove the cup or clean the filter but most coffee makers drip some anyway. My only complaint is the top of the travel cup. It fits fine but I feel like I dribble too much when I drink with it, maybe its just me. Not a big problem, I just don't use it. All in all, this product is worth what I paid for it. Even if it breaks next week I will feel I got my money's worth.
