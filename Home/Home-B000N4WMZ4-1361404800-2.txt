review/summary: Lodge Color Dutch Oven, Island Spice Red, 6-Quartreview/text: I always wanted a good quality Dutch oven, and when this was on sale for $40 I bought it and used it the next day after it was delivered. Couldn't bring myself to spend &#34;that much&#34; on the more expensive French brand. Made a beautiful beef stew in it, something I looked forward to cooking. It washes well, and looks pretty on the stove. I am looking forward to using it more.
