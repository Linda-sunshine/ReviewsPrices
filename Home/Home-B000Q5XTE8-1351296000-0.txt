review/summary: Great chairreview/text: I'm not a chair expert. I've always used stable chairs with no wheels or adjustable components, but I wanted something different to sit on so I got this. Construction is simple. It took me many tries (if only I could have a professional properly angle it according to my body) but I finally got a good height and angle that was comfortable. The only thing I don't like are the arm rests. They're wobbly by nature and there's not much tightening you can do to fix that. They don't move once your arms are rested on them though. The seat is comfy although it does get dirty easily (but can be cleaned easily). The mesh back is okay. I'm not a particular fan, but for this price they're good. After a few months I noticed that when I sat back with enough pressure, it would go back a little more and make a noise. Do heed the advice of the manufacturer. Tighten all the nuts and bolts every few months even if you are light. Once I tightened a few different bolts it was wonderful again. Completely stable.I recommend it.
