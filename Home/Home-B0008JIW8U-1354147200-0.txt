review/summary: I need coffeereview/text: I need coffee when I wake up and this inexpensive programmable coffeemaker makes it for me.I hand grind the beans before bed, put in a little extra, wake up to the smell of coffee, stagger in to the kitchen, poor myself a cup, and the world brightens for me and becomes a wonderful place.Read up on cafestol. Cafestol (not caffeine) is a chemical in coffee that causes raises cholesterol. Paper filters remove cafestol, so I use a drip maker like this with a paper filter, except on occasions when I treat myself to French Press or espresso.But this is a good, if inexpensive, coffee maker, and will get you up..
