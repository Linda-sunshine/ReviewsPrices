review/summary: Great machine, until it broke - just two years old.review/text: Hello bread makers - The Sunbeam was a great little machine, until last week. For two years, I made bread two - three times a week, sometimes baking it in the machine but mostly using it to knead the dough which I then finished by hand and baked in the oven. It was my first bread maker and I really loved it. Then last week, it started on some new dough and in less than a minute, it was all over. The kneading paddle had stopped turning. The steel bolt attaching the paddle to the gear shaft had worn away the aluminum collar - too much play when turning.So here I am back checking Amazon reviews to try a different machine.
