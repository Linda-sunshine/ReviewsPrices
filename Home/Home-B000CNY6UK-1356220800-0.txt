review/summary: I can't emphasize enough how much I love this Espreso Maker!review/text: I bought this product in hopes to make great espresso at home as well as avoid spending so much money buying my daily espresso machiato. Now, not only am I saving but also making BETTER espresso than I bought out every morning.It's extremely simple to use and even easier to clean. I'd imagine the long-term maintenance is little to none compared to the automatic versions.I am so happy with this purchase. :)
