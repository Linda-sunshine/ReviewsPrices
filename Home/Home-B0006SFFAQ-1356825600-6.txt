review/summary: Disappointed with Coffee Makerreview/text: Upon the arrival of this Brew Central 12 cup Programmable Coffeemaker to our house we realized 1) it was too tall to fit on our hutch cabinet and still be able to be filled with water without being pulled out from under a shelf and 2)the water gauge is inside a small black chamber within the appliance and impossible to read without looking down inside. We started to question the overall design of this appliance. WHile the hutch cabinet problem might be unique to our house, certainly the lack of common sense on the placement of the water gauge is a major objection any consumer would have. We've put up with this for several years and now the brew cycle doesn't work. I was never so glad to be retiring a kitchen appliance but it vexes me no end about the basic design flaws. Not that I really care, but it also bothers me that apparently the failure to brew correctly can't be repaired. I've search the internet for websites offering solutions and the best I can figure is that a plastic tube inside has cracked, allowing about half the water to leak out on to the counter during the brewing process. We end up with a very wet counter and half as much coffee as we planned on and the coffee that reaches the carafe is double strenght. Another design problem is that when lifting the lid in the middle of brewing, even when turning the machine off, the hot water spits out right in your face because the tubing routes the water through the underside of the lid. Surely this is a safety hazzard. I'm going back to Mr. Coffee or a French press pot.
