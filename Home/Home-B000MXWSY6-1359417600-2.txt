review/summary: Great little clockreview/text: This doesn't have the sound quality of a bigger clock radio, but since I use it only for waking, that doesn't bother me. It also has a little feature with the snooze that I LOVE. The snooze alarm will give you 10 extra minutes, but you can hit it repeatedly to give you 20 or 30, etc. Great for mornings that you may want a little extra time, but don't want to keep waking up every 10 'minutes.
