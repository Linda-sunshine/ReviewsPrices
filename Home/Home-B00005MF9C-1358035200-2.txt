review/summary: Great product for the pricereview/text: This one cup coffee maker is efficient at making coffee or heating water. It is a well-made product and good as a countertop appliance. With a few caveats, I can honestly recommend this item. I set it up on the kitchen counter at night with water and a tea bag, then flick it on in the morning for a quick jolt of caffeine when I feed the cat. What it is not is small or quiet. I had hoped to use this at work, but it is too loud and steamy. It isn't much smaller than a full sized coffee maker. It also does not keep the cup hot once it is brewed.
