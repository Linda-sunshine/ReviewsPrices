review/summary: My dependable friend!review/text: I received this as a gift a year and a half ago and stumbled upon it on Amazon browsing other Thermos products, and I had to share my good word.I am an herbal tea drinker, drinking mostly loose leaf teas and some tea bags, or blending the two. I love that I can drop my leaves into the cup, screw on the infuser as a strainer, and pour in the hot water. After a year and a half of usage, many falls onto various surfaces, a drop from my car roof onto the concrete (classic left my cup on the roof and started to drive) it continues to seal perfectly, and although I've chipped the bottom plastic, it also continues to stand perfectly on a flat surface. The durability and quality of this product is unmatched.I sometimes joke that it works too well. Sealing in boiling hot water will keep it boiling hot (or nearly) for hours. I have to leave the top unscrewed for a while before I can sip at it. But I honestly prefer this to tumblers that loose their heat quickly. If I want to drink it more quickly after initial brewing time, I simply pour it into a mug. For this, I wish this came with a cup top, but I can see that adding to the hassle of having more things to screw and unscrew.I almost wish it was a little bit bigger, perhaps 16 ounces, as I really do only get one cup of tea. Most of the time, my herbs are good for a refill of water before I desire a fresh pinch of herbs. It's a bit heavy for its size, but that heaviness provides technology that I appreciate.
