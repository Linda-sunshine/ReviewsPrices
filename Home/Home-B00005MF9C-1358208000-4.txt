review/summary: This is a really good coffee maker although poorly designedreview/text: I was too hasty in judging this unit and have upgraded my review from 1 star to 4 stars.Why?Well, I was understandably upset when the little plastic attachment between the lid and the "showerhead" broke the first time I unsnapped it to clean it, as recommended in the instruction manual before first use.However, upon inspecting it later I realized that this did not render the unit unusable as I had initially thought.Okay... So while I am returning it, since it broke before first use, I decided that since it was broke they can't resell it, so I may as well see how it makes coffee.I set it up for a cup of coffee and I found that:a) it makes the coffee very quickly - perhaps too quickly, I thoughtb) it makes the coffee plenty hot (some had said it did not)c) the coffee tasted very good!While I am displeased that the showerhead is connected to the lid with a very small and easily breakable piece of plastic and thus it did break the first time I unsnapped it to clean the lid as instructed, I have to admit this thing does make a good cup of coffee.Furthermore it takes up less space than most any other electric coffee maker I have seen.It has no heating pad so you don't have to worry about forgetting to turn it off - it just makes one cup at a time.The one downside is that this can only make about 15 oz of coffee as it holds only 16oz of water. I like to drink 16 oz so with this unit I have to drink an oz. less than I would prefer. No big deal but worth mentioning.Honestly I do like this coffee maker and will probably buy one to use for when I'm in a hurry.When I am not in a hurry I have decided to use a Hario type pour-through system which takes more time to make BUT makes a much better cup of coffee AND is BPA and phthalate etc free as the water and coffee do not come into contact with any plastic.But for a quick cup when I'm in a hurry, this little unit will do.I took one star off for the crummy manufacturing/design which causes the lid to become detached from the showerhead so easily. The fact that you can still use the coffee maker after this breaks and the fact that it makes a good and quick cup of coffee made me rate it 4 stars.
