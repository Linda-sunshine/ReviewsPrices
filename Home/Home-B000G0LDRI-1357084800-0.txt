review/summary: Keep searchingreview/text: Good controls, rapid output when needed. If I had to do it over again I'd get one that is less noisy. This vibrates and rattles too much. Also would get one that I can pour a pitcher of water into the top of the tank instead of constantly lugging these two tanks to the sink and turning them upside down to fill them. They need a refill everyday as they are doing the whole house. And while I'm at it, I would like one with a humidity reading. I purchased a guage for $5. I didn't think I'd mind the design of the humidifier, but again, if I did it over, I'd get one that blends in more with the furniture.
