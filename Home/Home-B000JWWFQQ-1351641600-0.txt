review/summary: nice qualityreview/text: My wife and I are very pleased with the Renaissance 600 thread count Sateen King Set. The sheets are very comfortable and after washing they seem to be durable. We are happy with both the Ivory and the Cafe sets. They are heavier than I thought they would be but, are still soft and comfortable.
