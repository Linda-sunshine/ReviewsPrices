review/summary: Making perfect rice since 2007review/text: A friend and I were talking last night about rice cookers and I was telling her about this, my beloved 3-cup Zojirushi, so I looked it up in my order history and decided that after nearly 5 years, it was time to write a review. I love this rice cooker and it has traveled many places with me. I initially bought it because I made a lot of brown rice and really, most standard rice cookers don't cook brown rice very well. It takes longer and more water to make brown vs. white rice and will often get burned in other rice cookers. The rice comes out fragrant and perfect every time with nothing burnt sticking to the bottom. I have also used this cooker to cook quinoa with great success as well, and many type of rice. It also plays a little song at the beginning and end which is pretty darn cute. I don't think you can go wrong with this purchase and it is certainly worth the investment if you make rice even occasionally. A couple of other bonuses are the retractable power cord and the carrying handle. You can also program it to start cooking your rice at a certain time so that it will be ready when you get home. To cook rice well, it does take a while. It can take 90 minutes to do a cup of brown rice. But that has never bothered me... so worth it. Buy good quality, organic rice and be amazed. It's better than most rice you'd get at restaurants.
