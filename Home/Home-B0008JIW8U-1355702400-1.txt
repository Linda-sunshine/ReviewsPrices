review/summary: Replacing Similarreview/text: I bought this to replace a similar unit. The old one worked well for a long time, but I pulled loose one of the inside tubes trying to clean it. It worked well for years. I like the new one better. The display isn't as bright as the old one, which is a good thing. Makes good drip coffee and pretty quickly.
