review/summary: Previous Swing-A-Way owner; The Zyliss is a sturdy, high quality can openerreview/text: I swore by Swing-A-Way can openers for years because it was the only one I could purchase in a store that would last. I tried Ecko, Farberware, various store brands but they all slipped on the can and some would never cut the entire lid without missing some areas. My Swing-A-Way (which I still have) would occasionally miss some areas but the cutting wheel eventually wore out. But even the Swing-A-Way would consistently miss cutting some lids, esp on today's thin-metaled cans.I looked at the reviews here and to be quite frank, I was very skeptical because the Zyliss is primarily made of plastic and you could easily get the impression that it's cheap and will break. I took the chance and purchase on any way and I'm very glad I did. The cutter is the best I've ever used on any can opener and using the Zylis, while at first seems counter-intuitive and awkward, actually makes sense and I got quickly acclimated to its operation.The magnet at the end is very strong but I find I don't use it unless a cut lid sinks into a can and don't want to &#34;shred&#34; my fingers trying to fish it out. The magnet serves well in such situations but sometimes even it won't work and you need to use a butter knife or perhaps fork.I can easily recommend this can opener as I actually find it a joy to use and it does what it's supposed to do--open cans!
