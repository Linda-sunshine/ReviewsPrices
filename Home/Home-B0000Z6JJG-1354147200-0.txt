review/summary: Bigger is not betterreview/text: We bought this when our standard size salad shooter finally broke. We had hoped this 'Pro' model would fuction like the standard size, but be sturdier and made better. We were wrong. The 'Pro' model is the same plastic quality as the standard model, just bigger. In this case 'Bigger' is 'Worse'. It takes more room to store the tool; it is noiser, and, being bigger, there is more room in the shredder and the shredder feed for whatever you are shredding to get stuck, and hence, wasted. On the noise side, it is in the category of 'power tool' - not as loud as a skilsaw, but louder than a sabre saw, for example. This is a tool I regret buying and I will replace it soon - even before it breaks.
