review/summary: Just what I had hoped forreview/text: My previous food processor was a Black and Decker and it was not suitable in many ways. I've had this processor for a few weeks and have given it a real work out. I've made several pie crusts, chopped lots of veggies, chopped ham for ham salad, sliced cucumbers. It cleans very well in the dishwasher. Its also quiet. I'm anxious to try bread dough next!
