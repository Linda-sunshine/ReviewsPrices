review/summary: Dirty Water Tank Faultreview/text: I've owned several steam cleaners in my lifetime - with kids and dogs - it's a must. Pass this one by folks! The machine worked fine on the first cleaning but I like to go over it with just water to get the soap up - that attracts dirt if you don't rinse. The second time - the suction didn't work at all. I called Hoover and found out that the Dirty Water Tank has a glitch in it - if it's not placed properly into the holder, it prevents all suction. I spoke to three customer service reps who tried to make sure that the tank was inserted properly. There is one way for the tank to go in and the lid to the tank was secure - it still didn't work - meanwhile, my hallway carpet was destroyed - I soaked the water up with towels but the carpets need to be replaced before mold starts. If we weren't in the middle of a blizzard, I'd go to the store where I purchased it and would buy another make/model - but we're stuck in for a couple of days.In speaking with the Hoover people, they wanted me to return the machine to them, they would replace it with the same thing (no thanks, I've had enough nightmare for one day) and then test the machine there. So - who would do the testing - Hoover? Really? Well, we all know how that test would turn out.My attitude is that if you have to wonder each time you steam whether or not your machine will work - forgetaboutit. There is clearly a functional issue with this machine - if a Hoover rep told me about the glitch - it's an ongoing problem. Cleaning wise -the first time I ran it - underwhelmed. Move on.
