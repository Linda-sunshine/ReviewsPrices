review/summary: This is a wonderful water filter!review/text: I bought two of these because as a family of six, we drink a lot of water. The taste of the water is noticeably different right away upon being filtered. I was used to tap water and water filtered through an in-line refrigerator and never realized water could taste better than what I was used to.The filtered water tastes "soft" if there was ever a description. It is hard to describe, but it tastes healthy and pure. I am SO THANKFUL that we found this water filter and would buy it again 100x over.I definitely recommend buying at least one, if not two. Having two makes it so there is always one that has enough for drinking while the other is filtering the water. It is not super slow like some people describe, unless they're comparing it to a "click on the faucet" immediate water filter that still allows the water to pour out with force. When I read those reviews stating the slow filter time, I was expecting an hour or so to pass. That's not the case!! It does take some time, but that's why you should buy two! :)
