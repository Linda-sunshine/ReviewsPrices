review/summary: Stopped working after a monthreview/text: I bought this machine in July and it stopped working in August. It has always produced watery tasting coffee and now in the last week it's only giving us a small amount of coffee before it stops. It was making very loud sounds today and wouldn't brew until I turned it on and off several times. I only use filtered water and bought the additional filter that goes inside the water tank on the unit. I will be returning my unit today. I read many reviews online of people saying their Keurig only lasted a year. Mine didn't make it that long! I had much better luck with my inexpensive Mr. Coffee oddly enough. I guess you don't always get what you pay for in this instance.
