review/summary: Greatreview/text: I always read the reviews to see what others say, so I will add a very short comment. It works great and it holds the rice to keep it warm without drying out or scorching. Replaced a $60 rice cooker with this one and am not sorry. I can't believe that you won't be happy if you buy it. Don't do like I did and try to save money and buy a cheaper cooker, or like me, you will end up settling for less that perfect, way less, or spending the money for the cheaper one and the good one. Hope this helps you as so many reviewers helped me decide. Spend the extra, buy it, use it, be happy with it.
