review/summary: Greatreview/text: I juice, and in order to take freash veg/fruit juices with me to work etc. I vacuum seal it in wide mouth mason jars. It's essential to get the air out in order to preserve the freshness of the juices. Great way to juice in advance and store (refrigerated) for a few days at a time.
