review/summary: This thing has tons of powerreview/text: Bought this because of all the great reviews and the cheap price. It may look cheap and not real fancy, but it gets all the dirt! It just fills and fills bags full of dirt and dust. I have had more expensive vacs and honesty for price this cannot be beat. It is still working great after several years and still dims the light when it is turns on ( very powerful ).
