review/summary: Great Little Rice Cookerreview/text: I truly enjoy this rick cooker. Who knew you should wash your rice before you cooked it? I love the settings for the different kinds of rice and I have found that adding a little olive oil to the rice enhances the consistency. I will be playing around with this for a long time into the future:)
