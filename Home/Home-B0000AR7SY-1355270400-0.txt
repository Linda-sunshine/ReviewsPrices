review/summary: Never knew home brewed coffee could taste this goodreview/text: I had a friend recommend getting a burr grinder telling me that it makes all the difference in how the coffee tastes. They were right! Being able to get a consistant and even grind on my coffee allows me to have every cup of coffee taste amazing.I have had no problems with the grinder and the timer allows me to grind only the amount of beans I need, no more stale coffee grounds! I would definitely recommend this.
