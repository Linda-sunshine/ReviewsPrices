review/summary: Where have you been all my life?review/text: Seriously, I cannot believe this is my first food processor. I love to cook, and this makes cooking 100 times more fun! I don't think I can every buy canned/jarred pizza sauce or spaghetti sauce again. I also now buy just the blocks of cheese and grate my own (it takes seconds!). My husband made me an omelet last weekend and I asked what he did differently this time. It was the cheese! Food tastes so much better!
