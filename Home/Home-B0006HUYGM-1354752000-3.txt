review/summary: Good suction on hardwood floorsreview/text: ...but horrible on rugs or upholstery. I have many rugs in my house that I often need to sweep. This vacuum simply pushes it back in forth in clumps (dog hair); doesn't pick it up. Same for my micro suede couch. Works great for small messes on my hardwood floors, but clogs fast (very hairy dog) and needs emptied before I'm actually done. Not a horrible vacuum, just didn't really work in the ways I hoped it would.
