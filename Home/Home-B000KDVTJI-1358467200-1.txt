review/summary: Works perfectlyreview/text: Two nit-picks about this item. For one, I'm using it to brew coffee and I need hot water that's 165 degrees. Had I known this before I bought the Kettle, I would have opted for one with a thermostat. Secondly, the lid must be closed tightly and not slightly ajar in order for the automatic cut off to kick in.
