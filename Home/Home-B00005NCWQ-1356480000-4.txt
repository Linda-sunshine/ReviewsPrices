review/summary: Stainless Steel Percolatorreview/text: I love this Percolator, because of the strong construction. If my electric goes off I can still have my coffee, on my natural gas stove. The weather patterns are unpredictable. Who go without their joy of coffee. I been drinking it since 2 years old. thanks for a great product. It does not pick up the metal taste! Martha
