review/summary: Works just finereview/text: I was hungry for a waffle and so I had to have this. Its not overly sturdy but then again its not a commercial product (however I am not having the best of luck with other Cuisinart products lately so am holding my breath on this one). Initially the non-stick surface was anything but however after a few waffles it seems to be work just fine. For the price its perfect but my suspicions related to recent Cuisinart quality has me thinking it will end up being replaced sooner than I'd like. For the sort term, enjoy waffles on a lazy weekend morning.
