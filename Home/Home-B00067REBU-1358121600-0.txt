review/summary: Good deal for the price I paid.review/text: First thing I ordered this and it was sent via Fedex SmartPost not good. Took a long time for the bread maker to get here and when it finally did on the tracker it still said it was in another city. The metal sheet that lines the inside of the bread maker is not flush to the walls of the bread maker along the seam. It is bowed out but it does not seem to affect the bread maker so far. The loaf pan after two loafs I noticed that the non stick surface was scrached. I have only used a damp sponge to wipe down the inside of the pan. I am not sure why there are scratch surfaces in the pan but again it has not affected the bread that I have made so far. I have made a fresh loaf everyday for two weeks and have only had one loaf that did not come out well.I recommend that you read up on how to make bread so that you can make the adjustments to EVERY recipe that you use. The basic white 2 lbs. loaf recipe that is in the instruction book worked just fine for me. I have to add 1 Tablespoon of water for each cup of flour in order to get the dough just right. I found a lot of information out there, just hang in there the basic is a good one to start with. NOTE: Not all flour is the same, i have to add Gluten to my flour to get a good rise and texture when i am using a bargain flour but flavor is still good.I read some place that you should bake a loaf for 2 weeks straight and by the time you get to your 14th loaf you will have it down. So far this has proven correct, I have already gotten my favorite recipes in my memory and can just throw it all together in no time. Have fun your house is going to smell like heaven. I uploaded a picture of my basic white loaf, light settings and a Poppyseed bread as well. Have Fun and Enjoy.
