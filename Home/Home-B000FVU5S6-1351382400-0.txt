review/summary: Comfortable, but easily stainedreview/text: These sheets are nice to sleep on I guess, but after two months the "smokey blue" has turned to pink in several places. As far as I know, I don't sweat more than average, and this isn't an issue I've had with other sheets. Perhaps other colors are better dyed, but I would recommend avoiding these.
