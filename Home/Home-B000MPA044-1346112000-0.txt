review/summary: My favorite kitchen appliance ever!review/text: I have never written a review before, but I love this appliance. For those that love the taste of slow cooked meals while doing it much faster, easier and keeping the nutrients locked in, this is for you. If you have trouble with the seal like others have complained about, just remove the seal, rub a little cooking oil on both sides, re-attach and you should be good to go.
