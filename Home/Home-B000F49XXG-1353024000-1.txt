review/summary: Two years after purchasereview/text: The machine worked really well for about 2 months, and then it stopped producing forma. Sometimes coffee flew out perfectly, but other times it dripped a drop every couple minutes. Coffee tasted very bitter when it happened. I thought something maybe clogged, so I run diluted vinegar through the machine for a few times. It started working again for 2-3 months, and then it stopped steaming. Steam came on for couple seconds and then nothing. I tried to warm it up longer, run diluted vinegar again, but nothing worked. The steam sometime came on miraculously, so I can get my frosted milk. Otherwise I will have to warm up the milk in the microwave. On top of that, the coffee tasted awful. So I started going to Starbucks again, and only once a while I try the machine again in hope that another miracle would happen. Now the machine is out of warranty. I don't think Delonghi could do anything anyway, and their service response is very slow. I waited 3 months for a water tank replacement. I don't know if I should be happy with the purchase for the perfect 2 months experience of home-made espresso.
