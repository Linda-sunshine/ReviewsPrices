review/summary: Worst Lasting Sheets I Have Ever Hadreview/text: I thought they looked good and mine felt OK. The problem I had is that they only lasted a little over a year. There were tears in the fitted sheet and the pillow cases were coming out at the seams. I have never had this problem with sheets before. Even really cheap ones. They usually last longer than I want them. These are obviously poorly made.
