review/summary: Cheaply Made - Broke after 3 monthsreview/text: I bought this bread machine in October 2012 and by early Jan 2013, the machine would not knead properly. The motor seem has problems turning, and we could smell the heat and burnt from the motor during the kneading.We only made bread with this machine about 5 times each month, and we cleaned it thoroughly after every use. We generally used bread machine to mix, knead, and rise the dough but not bake it. We'd shape the dough and bake the bread ourselves.The bad part about buying all these gadgets online these days is that you don't have an easy way to complain to the manufacture and can't easily change the parts, or fix. Very upsetting.
