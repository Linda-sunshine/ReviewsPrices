review/summary: Crane Elephant humidifier leaksreview/text: Condensation accumulates in the top of the elephants trunk and dribbles down the front of the unit. The last two nights it has soaked a hand towel to the point that I had to wring it out in the morning. Before that, it would leave a puddle of water on my dresser.Produces a very good amount of humidity and is relatively quiet.Don't recommend this model, the elephant.
