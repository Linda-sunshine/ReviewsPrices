review/summary: I love my Lodge skillet.review/text: If you have never used cast iron for cooking before or have bought into the &#34;it's too hard to use/take of&#34; horror stories, I strongly suggest you give this skillet a try. Yes, the cleaning and care is different from &#34;normal&#34; pans, but it's not hard once you get used to it. I went with Lodge, because I own two of their Dutch ovens, which I love. The quality of Lodge has never disappointed and the price is right (though I don't know why the lid to this pan costs more than the pan itself). Searing steaks, making gravy or cooking eggs is a breeze and the taste of the food is so much better. Once you've gotten use to cooking with it (check out Youtube to help speed up the learning curve) you will wish you had bought one sooner.
