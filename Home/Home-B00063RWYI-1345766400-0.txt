review/summary: A Great Sizereview/text: I purchased this dutch oven after being given Lodge's Combo Cooker for Christmas.I love that cast iron is the greenest cookware out there. The non-stick aspect is a definite plus.This dutch oven is hefty; I have definitely gained some muscle hefting this around the kitchen! But the size is great for soups and stews, and it is perfect for making popcorn! It gets a real workout every winter when I make corn chowder. I can't wait to take it camping, too!I cook for two, but we like to have leftovers. I think the 5 qt. would be too small for a lot of things I cook. If you are on the fence about size, get the 7 qt. You'll use it. Unless you have back problems, then the weight might get you...
