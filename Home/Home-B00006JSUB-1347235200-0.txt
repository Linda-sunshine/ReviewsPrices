review/summary: Great Pan!!!review/text: I love the size and the weight of this skillet, however since I have never had pre-seasoned cast iron I am not sure if its normal that after it was washed once it looked dried out. I seasoned it myself and hope that helps. The price and the fact that it is USA made is the main reason that I will always stick with Lodge, the quality is good and if I have to season often as with normal cast iron, it will not bother me. But I Never use soap and I hand dry immediately so I will buy more. It's a great value and definitely worth my money.
