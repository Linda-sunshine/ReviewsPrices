review/summary: Fairly accuratereview/text: I originally chose this product because Consumer Reports gave it its highest rating and I can see why. The scale is sleak in design and light weight. Very Trendy too. You really knows which scale is telling the truth. One morning I got on the scale before I went to the gym (all dressed out too). Then, when I got to the gym I weighed myself on their medical scale. It was the same. My wife did the same and it too was the same. If I am truely within a pound or two of my actual weight from what the scale tells me, I'm happy. I would reccomend this scale. Consumer Reports got this one right.
