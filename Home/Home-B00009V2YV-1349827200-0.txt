review/summary: Every home should have onereview/text: Great radio to have. It comes with an AC adapter, and it works well on batteries -- takes 4 AA batteries. Display is backlit. S.A.M.E county codes are easy to program. My weather station is about 30 miles away and the reception is decent. FM reception is great. AM reception is not-so-great. Siren is loud for a small speaker. I did not opt for the visible alarm but now considering purchasing one. There is an interface for an external antennae.Some of the event codes are:Avalanche watch/warningBiological hazard warningBoil water warningBlizzard warningChild abduction emergencyCivil danger warningCivil emergency messageCoastal flood watch/warningContagious disease warningContaminated water warningContaminated water warningDam watch/breakDust storm warningEarthquake warningEvacuation watchImmediate evacuationFood contamination warningFlood statement/watch/warningFire warningFreeze warningHurricane statement/watch/warningHazardous materials warningHigh wind watch/warningIceberg warningLocal area emergency advisoryLaw enforcement warningLand slide warningNuclear power plant warningPower outage advisoryRadiological hazard warningSpecial marine statement/warningShelter in-place warningSever thunderstorm watch/warningSever weather statementTornado watch/warningTropical storm watch/warningTsunami watch/warningVolcano warningWild fire watch/warningWinter storm watch/warningUnrecognized emergency advisory/statement/warning911 telephone outage emergencyAnd a bunch of periodic test signalsYou can enable or disable any of these events.Pros: Durable, easy to use, good receptionCons: Only has memory to set 3 FM stations
