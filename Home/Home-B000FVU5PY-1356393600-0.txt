review/summary: Beautifulreview/text: Great price, beautiful finish, and perfect size - what more could I possibly ask for?These Pinzon 400 thread count queen size sheets in maize are elegant. The top stitching is understated. I like that these are made for extra tall mattresses, we have a tall queen mattress with a memory foam topper, and the fitted sheet is perfect. Right out of the bag, these do have a lot of sizing on them, they are not super soft. After a few washings, they soften up and are cuddly wonderful.I was afraid these might have a shiny fake silk satin finish. Instead they are like most other standard cotton sheets, smooth but not shiny. The maize color is not yellow at all; it is a warm beige color.These are excellent sheets at a good price.
