review/summary: Mineral deposits give it a short lifereview/text: It is cheap, boils water fast, but does not last. After a couple months, the auto-shutoff feature stopped working. At age 6 months, I have stopped using it due to unsafe mineral deposits on the heating element that are shed into the boiling water as visible particles. The flaw in the design is that the heating element is exposed to the water.
