review/summary: Great Valuereview/text: The 5 Star rating doesn't mean this is the best hand held ever, but it is has definitely delivered everything I would want. It is very easy to clean. The suction is excellent. The feature of being able to use the rotating brushes does a great job with grabbing the hairs from my dogs bed. Using the wand is perfect for the bugs in the corner that my vacuum misses and those tight spots in my car. Overall an excellent value.
