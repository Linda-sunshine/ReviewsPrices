review/summary: Okay, lasted about 29 monthsreview/text: They definitely do not make these like they used to. Loud, tended to leave behind lots of dust and particles. Flimsy, cheap, and plastic feeling. Tended to run hot if I vacuumed more than 10 minutes. After a couple of years it quit sucking, made a horrible sound, and died. I wish they made something more solid and longer lasting. I cannot recommend this particular vacuum cleaner. Not happy at all. The price was right though. Okay product if you only expect it to last 2 years and do not vacuum consistently for more than 10 minutes.
