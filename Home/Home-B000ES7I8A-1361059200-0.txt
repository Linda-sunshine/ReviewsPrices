review/summary: Auto shut-off died after a week.review/text: I had an Aroma model which leaked water.I bought this model because it does not leak.After a week, the auto shut-off stopped working.Catch-22 !!!If it doesn't go bad leaking water, something else does...I really don't understand how these companies screw up over and over again.After all, you can't blame China all the time.In addition, the pour spout is a "disaster in design".It over-spills and may cause burns.I challenge the CEO of Hamilton Beach to respond to these two issues.Enough is enough...We will not buy products any more until you explain.
