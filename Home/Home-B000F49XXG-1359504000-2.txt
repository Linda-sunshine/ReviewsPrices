review/summary: Jumpy Messreview/text: I'm no newbie to espresso machines. This thing was crazy. It vibrated so badly trying to make a simple espresso shot that it would jiggle the cup off the platform. I've never seen anything like it. Either the machine is too light, or I received a lemon. I'm sending it back. Don't waste your time.
