review/summary: convenient, powerful, and affordablereview/text: love this little thing! was replacing another compact steamer that bit the dust after 8 months of every day use. works well for the price. be sure not to fill it up over the max line or water will come out. doesn't hold much but i found that the steam goes a long way. i use it to get wrinkles out out of exercise clothing and dress shirts. heats up fast and the steam comes out strong. requires maybe 2 passes to smooth everything out. i live in a small apartment and hate ironing, so this is perfect!
