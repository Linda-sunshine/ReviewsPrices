review/summary: Love love love these sheets!review/text: We absolutely LOVE these flannel sheets. They are super soft and warm. I got this set as a Christmas gift, and I will be buying myself another set. The fitted sheet is slightly large for our mattress, so sometimes it leaves a wrinkle/crease across the bed that is hard to smooth out, but curling up in these cozy warm sheets is more than worth it! My old flannel sheets (different brand) feel like sandpaper now, in comparison... :-)
