review/summary: Save your moneyreview/text: I bought this vacuum in September, it started out pretty decently. However, very poor suction after just a few months and it broke. I have hardwood floors and a few oriental area rugs that need the vacuuming, so it was not purchased for anything heavy duty to begin with. Buy something else, you'll regret it otherwise.
