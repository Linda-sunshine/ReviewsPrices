review/summary: This scale is great for brewers!review/text: I purchased this scale to weigh out dried malt extracts, hops and other ingredients to my home brews. It works very well and I like the fact it swicthes from grams or ounces. I like that you can place a container on it and then with a press of a button re-zero it to measure the goods. sometimes when you have a bowl on the weighing surface, you have to look at the digital screen on an angle and it can be hard to read but if you know the right way to look at it, no big deal. For the price, it's a great little tool that I use on each and every home brew I create.
