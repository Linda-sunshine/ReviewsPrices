review/summary: terrible customer servicereview/text: Okay, so first I get a machine with a broken lid. Call customer service, they say I have to send back original lid at my expense. Get the replacement lid. Guess what, it doesn't fit. Call customer service she said I obviously am doing something wrong. I tell her I am not an idiot and I know when something doesn't fit. She says she'll send me another one. I say why, if this one doesn't fit why will the next one. Said I obviously need a top and bottom that match. She say oh, maybe you have a BPA free bottom. So we check and sure enough I do. So she says she'll send me a BPA free lid. And I should get it in 10 days, Great, Christmas will be here and gone before I get to use this machine. She said she would schedule a UPS pick up of lid number 2. They have yet to get it, it's just sitting on my front porch, waiting for someone to come along and steal it. Merry Christmas.
