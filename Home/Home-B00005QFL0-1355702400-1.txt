review/summary: We were replacing a older bread machine and this one serves it's purpose!review/text: My husband and I have not bought bread in 2 years since getting our first bread machine (a 10+ year old hand-me-down). When that one finally called it quits we both started searching for the one that would best fit our needs. Oddly enough, searching separately we both came up with this same machine.It makes larger loaves than our last one and has easy to read and understand instructions. So far the paddle hasn't stuck inside the loaf of bread. I've even had luck using recipes from my last machine in this one. (It does have some odd measurements for flour, i.e. 11/16 of a cup?).The only small complaints we have are smaller loaves aren't as 'pretty' as the larger loaves, probably because they're not as heavy so they don't fall to the bottom of the pan completely. And the machine seems to be louder with the less wieght of small loaves. Neither of these problems really bothers us.
