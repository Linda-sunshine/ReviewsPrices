review/summary: Do not waste your moneyreview/text: Bought this with excitement, but realized when I opened it to use of course after the return window expired, that the handle turns but the screen inside is stripped. Therefore it won't hold any vegetables to slice, at all. I recommend not buying this, or if you are going to buy something like this get it at Costco where they have an open window of return on all products.
