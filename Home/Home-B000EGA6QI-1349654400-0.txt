review/summary: Cheap Plastic Gears Strippedreview/text: I ironically posted a very favorable review just a few days ago...but, this morning I was using the blender to make a smoothie and had the (brilliant, I thought) idea to throw a few dried blueberries in it. Well the blueberries jammed the blade and stripped out the cheap cheap cheap plastic gears, making the blender totally useless. Blueberries!!!???Shame on you, Cuisinart! I will never buy another one of your products.I am now researching better immersion blenders. I believe I will purchase the Milallegro 9090 (about $70 on Amazon)...apparently it is recommended by Consumer Reports.I was stupid to waste my money on Cusinart's "Smart Stick"!
