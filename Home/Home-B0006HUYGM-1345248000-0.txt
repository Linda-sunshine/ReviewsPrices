review/summary: Horrible!!review/text: This is a TERRIBLE vaccum!! I seriously don't understand how anyone could give it a good review! Crazy! When vacuuming it's sucking up a GREAT amount, it is very powerful, BUT HALF OF IT COMES OUT THE BACK!!!! It blows it right back out the back. I was vaccuming my entry rug, which was sooo dirty and then I looked behind me and the hardwood behind me was COVERED in a layer of dust!! Then I felt behind the vacuum and felt it coming out. It wasn't anything that wasn't put together right, it's just how it's made. I don't know how anyone could possibly use this vacuum! It took me longer to clean up the mess it made then it took to vacuum the rug. haha DO NOT BUY THIS! But, amazon is awesome and I returned it the next day and didn't have to pay return shipping or anything. Just went the the process of requesting a return on amazon, and ups picked it up at my door the next day with the prepaid label. Easy as pie. :) So Amazon is a YES BUT Eureka Hand Held Vac a big NO!
