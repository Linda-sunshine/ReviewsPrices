review/summary: I like it, but-------------review/text: worked perfectly for about 20 straight k-cups. the first time I used my own coffee and the my-cup the cup filled to less than half full and was undrinkable due to the fact that the cup was full of grounds. can't use the system not until i order new filters for the unit. never intended to use only the expensive k-cups,----so this my be a big problem if not resolved.
