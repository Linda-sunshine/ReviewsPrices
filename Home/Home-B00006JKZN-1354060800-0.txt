review/summary: not as thick as I would likereview/text: It's very easy to use but you have to remember that it doesn't come with the ready beep noise. What we end up doing is to just stay around and stare at the light, when it turns from red to green quietly we would know it's ready. The other down side is that the waffles actually came out to be quite thin. We had to fold it up to make it look nice.
