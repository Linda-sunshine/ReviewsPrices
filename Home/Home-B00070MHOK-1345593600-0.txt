review/summary: Stay away ! This steamer is dangerous !review/text: I was initially excited about this little steamer, when I purchased it from Amazon, about 8 months ago. It's nice looking, simple to use and did the job it claims to do. One needs to be cautious about overfilling past the max line as it will spit out boiling water and that is made clear in the instructions. Anyways, I used this steamer perhaps a little over a half dozen times since and each time carefully packed it back into it's original box. The last time I used it, water leaked out the sides of the unit and it threw the circuit breaker. My service tech curiosity led me to take the unit apart to find that the internal water reservoir is made of a hard plastic that had cracked at the bottom, perhaps from excessive heat, and water leaked into the wiring to the heater underneath causing a short that could cause a fire or one getting electrocuted. I was the only one who used this steamer and it hasn't been dropped. Needless to say, this steamer is ready for the trash after a very short life.
