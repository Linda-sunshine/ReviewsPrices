review/summary: Great little pot!review/text: This is my second Cuisinart 12 cup thermal pot and I love it! The only reason its my second is the first one got destroyed in Hurricane Sandy :( This was the first thing I replaced after the storm! It keeps your coffee hot for hours without burning it. The pot can go right onto the table and there were times I forgot to clean it out and it was still pretty hot the next day! Would buy again and again!
