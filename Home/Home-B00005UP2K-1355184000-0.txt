review/summary: Super cookie mixerreview/text: This beats mixing cookies by hand! Does a great job fast. This is the second year we've used it for Christmas cookies. This year my husband's sister came to help. She was impressed. We whipped up sugar cakes, sandtarts, sugar cookies, chocolate chips, gingerbread, & jam thumbprints all in one day & had time to bake them! I love my mixer.
