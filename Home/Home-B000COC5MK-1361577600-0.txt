review/summary: Loving It!review/text: When I first saw this wine opener I thought that it was going to be just another useless gadget but it has made my wine opening experiences that much better (as funny as it sounds). It works perfect even on those plastic corks and the foil cutter is an added bonus. I love the way this looks on my counter and when you are charging the wine opener it has a pretty blue light on the top.I love showing The Oster Wine Opener off instead of opening the wine in the kitchen I make more of a show and people always ask about it. I love this wine opener and it looks more expensive than it actually it, so if you want to buy one for yourself or as a wedding gift, or housewarming gift you can&#8217;t go wrong with this. I love this and it makes wine opening less of a task and more of a pleasure.
