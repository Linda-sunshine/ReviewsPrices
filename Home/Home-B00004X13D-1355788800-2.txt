review/summary: Okay with Sprayreview/text: I have only made waffles twice so far. The first time I sprayed it with cooking spray (the directions said to do it the first time you used it) and they were fine. Since it didn't say to keep doing it, I didn't spray the second time and they stuck. I think it will be ok, but I will again use the cooking spray.The good news is that the waffles were light and fluffy with deep indents, just like I like them.
