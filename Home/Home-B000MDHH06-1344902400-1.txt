review/summary: GREAT JUICER, Easy to use and cleanreview/text: This is my 2nd Juicer, and with Juicers you totally get what you pay for. My old model was a Waring pro and it was very hard to clean, and most times I had to clean in the middle of juicing just one glass because the basket would be filled.This juicer is much more effective and makes more juice, as well as being big enough to juice more veggies in one round. I am VERY VERY pleased with this juicer and wish I had saved myself the time and trouble years ago by spending the extra cash.It is VERY easy to clean and use! Highly recommend!
