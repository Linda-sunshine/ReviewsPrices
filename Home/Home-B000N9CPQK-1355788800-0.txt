review/summary: problems with unit and Amazonreview/text: Defective. I had to send it back to the manufacturer after they recommended that I return it to Amazon. Amazon did not respond to my request, so Kaz (Honeywell) accepted return. I still haven't received a replacement, and it cost me $11.88 in return postage. This was a replacement for the exact same model I've had for 4 years which was just too dirty to clean up. My original worked just fine. worked just fine. I really liked it.
