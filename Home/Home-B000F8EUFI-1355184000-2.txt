review/summary: Compact, lightweight, perfect for stairways and area rugsreview/text: I got sick of lugging my big vacuum down the stairs so I got this to keep downstairs to vacuum my living room area rug. Because it's small and light, I tend to use it more frequently (everyday). The cord clip on the top/handle doesn't work at all, no biggie though. Can't complain because the price was right.
