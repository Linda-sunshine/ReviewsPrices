review/summary: Cuisinart Waffle Maker Failurereview/text: After just over a year the hinge broke through ordinary usage. Since it makes excellent waffles I bought another one but if that one fails in a short time I will not buy a third one. Since the warranty requires that I pay $10 up front for shipping and handling with no assurance Cuisinart would repair the waffle maker or send me another one I will not risk the $10.
