review/summary: Nice, clean, does the job wellreview/text: I bought this for my wife. It arrived almost 2 weeks ago and she started using it immediately. It's quiet, the grind is consistent, and there's been absolutely no mess when she pulls the collector box out. And she loves the coffee made with the ground beans. It's quite a step up from the cheapo grinder this replaced.
