review/summary: Great Productreview/text: I'm not a coffee drinker but my wife is and I got this for her. I make her coffee in the morning and she can't wait for me to use this to make it for her. To give you an idea of how much better this is for making a good cup of coffee, she commented on how good her coffee was that morning and that I must have used a different brand of coffee that what she normally used in her drip coffee maker. She said the coffee from the drip maker using that brand was barely drinkable. I had used the same brand coffee that morning in the Aeropress and she loved it.I also took this to work to let a friend try it. He normally uses a french press and he proclaimed this made better coffee than his french press. Being a bit of a coffee snob, he was surprised by the results.
