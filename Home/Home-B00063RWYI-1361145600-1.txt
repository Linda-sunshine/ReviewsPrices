review/summary: great for breadreview/text: I bought this for baking bread - although the recipes called for 4 quart pot. So far I've had very good luck. I know I could use this for lots of other things, but will keep it just for the bread. I have other Lodge products so bought this for the name and wasn't disappointed.
