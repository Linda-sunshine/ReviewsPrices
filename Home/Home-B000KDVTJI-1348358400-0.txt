review/summary: Gamblereview/text: So, I have to say, we had this kettle for about 3 years and it was fantastic. Relatively cheap, but well performing, ergonomic and reliable.But it broke. So I just order the same kettle again. It is hard to come by now, especially locally, because Aroma has newer model. That model sucks, btw, because lid does not open as far as for this one, does not switch off, when you lift kettle (big safety failure) and last, control light is ... blue. Blue!? Give me a break with all that blue crap. Heating means red, so please, stay with red.So far first kettle failed out of the box. It did not even turned on. So I asked for replacement. Second kettle started to leak in about 2 days. So I asked for replacement, again (my last shot). Looks like new kettles has much worse quality control then in the old ones. It is gamble.
