review/summary: Perfect for what I need.review/text: I needed a scale that I wasn't going to use very often, but could get the job done when ever I needed it. First, I'll say you can't go wrong with $6 and free shipping. It also came a day early then it was scheduled. After opening, I did the penny trick and it weighed .1g over what it should have been. I believe you can recalibrate that, but if not, this scale comes with a 5 year warranty which is good. It's small, the screen is easy to read. All and all a good deal if you just need something quick and small.
