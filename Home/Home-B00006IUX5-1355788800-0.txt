review/summary: Good dealreview/text: I bought this partly based on reviews, so here's one from me. The one thing some had a problem with was the size and amount you can grind. I agree with the folks who actually like that, since you shouldn't grind all your beans at once in order to keep freshness. The fresher the better for taste, so I like only grinding enough for one use. I like the lid too. Also, the most inexpensive one you can buy and it's good quality. Good things my child.
