review/summary: Put a lid on it!review/text: These little plastic lids are handy! Word of advice: make sure you select the correct size of lids you want ie wide mouth or standard. I don't do a lot of canning but like to use 1/2 pint wide mouths for some refrigerator items ie sauces, dressings or oatmeal. Easy to clean and easy to use. These lids are super cheap and make life simpler.
