review/summary: Great item to have and to give as a giftreview/text: I really like this little coffee maker--love the built-in filter, and love the convenience of not only making coffee; but teas or just warm water for a cup of lemon and honey. It is so easy to clean and pack in a suitcase.You will NOT go wrong on this one. For about five years now I've been using mine almost every day, it still works great!
