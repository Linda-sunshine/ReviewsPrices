review/summary: Works well...BUTreview/text: I've had this for about 6 weeks now and I like it BUT a few issues i've had:1. you have to wait 5-10 minutes to warm up which is annoying at times2. there are 2 different attachments you can use for espresso (either for 1 shot or 2 shots) the attachment for 2 shots works fine, but the one for 1 shot doesn't and it keeps leaking so I can only use the 2 shot attachment even if I only want 1 shot of espresso.3. Steams milk well.Overall small size, makes good espresso.
