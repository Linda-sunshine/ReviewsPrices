review/summary: Poor Quality and Poor Customer Servicereview/text: Although this popper is inexpensive, it is not worth the money.As with the other reviews, the popcorn flies all over and the kernels are hot. This is dangerous.2. The melting of the butter over the hot air does not work well. Often only a small portion of the butter is melted.3. After just one year of moderate use ( 2-3 times a week with only one batch) the popper no longer had the strength to blow out most of the popcorn resulting in burning of the kernels.4. there is no on or off switch5. I called Presto customer service on 11/6/2012 explain about the lack of air to push out all of the popped kernels. I was told that since it was just over a year that they would still replace it.6. I sent it on 11/7/2012 to the warehouse in MS at my expense.7. On or about 12/23/2012 they finally returned the popper and it was MY old popper. No explanation. No idea that it was really mine- until I spoke with the rep.8. On 12/28/2012 I called customer service.a. they confirmed it was my old popper. that is had been tested by the engineers and it was fine.How can I tell this was really done. And because I did not know the name of the rep that talked to me on the 6th of Nov ( just as I did not know the name of the rep I was currently talking too), the implication was I was lying. Additionally I was challenged that I was being rude( which I was not---never raised my voice, called any one names)I have NO idea who has touched my machine, how healthy they were(interior cannot be really cleaned), what were their qualifications. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told they had left and would call me after New Years.I do not recommend the manufacturer let alone the product. It took them over 7 weeks to test and return a pop corn popper... and then I still have my old one that does not work.
