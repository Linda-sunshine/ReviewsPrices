review/summary: Some of the filters leak carbonreview/text: I bought this pack to replace a 2 month old filter (like it asks you to). I soaked my first filter in water for fifteen minutes, made two full pitchers and dumped both out. When I filled it up again, and took a sip, it tasted absolutely horrible. So I repeated the process of filling it up all the way and dumping it FIFTEEN times. Despite my persistence, the taste did not go away.I ended up throwing the first one away and using the second one. At first I had the same issues, however over time it went away.Two stars because the second one worked, but If I wanted to taste carbon I'd head out west, get oil fracking rigs on my property, and drink the groundwater raw. Or I would use these filters. Definitely disappointed.
