review/summary: Comfyreview/text: It's a solid memory foam mattress. But I would have liked a thicker one. Like 4 - 6 in, instead of 2 in. It's definitely a mattress topper like the title of the product says, so be careful if you're going to try to use this as a mattress instead of just a topper. Otherwise it's great.
