I am not sure if i got defective piece.before using this, i have used my mom's old juicer which used to give very very dry pulp..This juicer is giving me pulp which is very moist and you can press it to get more drops of juice.. not sure if it is the case of my particular unit or with this juicer itself.I am using oranges, apples , pomegranates.. with same result..Any suggestions?
