review/summary: CHEAP plastic- did not last 3 monthsreview/text: Well the return window expired so I'm stuck with this overpriced piece of junk. Both tanks have cracked- it flooded my floor causing hundreds of dollars of damage and when it did work was so loud that you couldn't hear much else. Please since I've already wasted my money take this review and buy something else- the plastic is so cheap. I thought since the price was higher and it was a Honeywell product I could expect more- this is the worst purchase ever. Bought it on 10/31/12 and not even 3 months later and it is going in the garbage - disappointing and my last purchase of this brand.
