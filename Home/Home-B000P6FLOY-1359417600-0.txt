review/summary: Worth every pennyreview/text: I bought this on the recommendation of Tim Ferriss. I have no complaints at all. I use it every time I cook meat or poultry. No more guessing whether something is done. Works great in the oven and on the grill. Great product. I like that I can enter the target temp and it will beep when the temp is reached. Probe is easy to clean and the magnet is very practical for mounting the thermometer in convenient locations. I highly recommend this product.
