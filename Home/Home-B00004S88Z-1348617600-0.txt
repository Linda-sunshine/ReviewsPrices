review/summary: Its everything thry say!review/text: Boutht All American 21.5 qt canner in August. The metal to metal seal was appealing. No running all over town to find a seal like I remember when I was a kid. This bad boy ought last a life time. We canned 60 qts of beans right out of the box. The seal works every time, just snug the wing nuts and youre there. The lid usually poped lose removing the wing nuts. I did rub vaselene around the contact area on the lid. Not sure you would have to but probably did make slipping the lid off a little easier. All the parts were included and shipping was quick. Great canner PLUS its made in America. Would buy again and would definitely reccomend to anyone wanting a quality canner that will be there for you many years to come.
