review/summary: Gorgeous feel, thick, but Chamois is dark TAN.review/text: First: The "chamois" is a darker tan. Not light and creamy "chamois".Second: Don't forgot they are in the washing machine, thinking you have a white wash going in, and bleach goes in by mistake.. they end up bubble gum pink.Third: That's why I'm ordering another set. Bubblegum Pink is not what I need.Finally,the sheets are wonderful. I was so pleasantly surprised when I opened the bag and felt them. The quality is great, and I will be ordering more, in other soft colors. I looked online for awhile to find quality flannel.. most places were way over $100 for a set, without the greatest of ratings.Leave it to Amazon to have a great product, with real (in most cases) reviews. Perfect!
