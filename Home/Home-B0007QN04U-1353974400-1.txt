review/summary: Love it - I just hope it lastsreview/text: I received the KA Pro 550 HD (available at Costco) for Christmas last year. I loved it and used it weekly to make bread and pizza and made cookies and cupcakes several times a month. Unfortunately, in October it started making a strange noise when kneading dough so I returned it. Costco graciously refunded my money. I contemplated getting the Artisan mixer, but after toying with it at the store, it just seemed so dinky and the tilt felt awkward and unnatural compared to the bowl lift. In the end, I decided on the Pro 600.I've had this mixer for a few months and use it several times a week. Overall, I'm very happy with my mixer; although, I do prefer the 5.5qt bowl that came with my Pro 550. Sometimes the 6qt bowl is just too much, especially when only making one loaf of bread. I have the 3qt bowl and combi whip attachment on my Christmas list, but it won't be useful for making bread dough. Oh we'll.Overall, I love my mixer as its pretty much the exact same as my previous mixer, just with a larger bowl and no strange noises so far. Even the gorgeous pearl metallic color is the same. I am hoping that this machine lasts longer than my previous mixer. Right now, the machine is 5 stars, but I'm docking a star as I haven't had it long enough to rate it's durability. I also think that KA should offer a longer warranty...at least 3 years. It's not like I'm buying a $50 mixer, for goodness sake. A 1 year warranty doesn't say much, but I'm a sucker and have convinced myself that my kitchen is a much better place with a KA mixer in it. I would recommend this mixer, but I'd be a little weary and realistic about its durability. Also, do not pay full price!
