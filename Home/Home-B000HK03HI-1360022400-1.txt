review/summary: Bought as a giftreview/text: I bought this can opener as a gift for my parents to replace their terrible, worn out, cheap one.I have to say, it's a really great product so far. My mom has arthritis in her hands and hated using the old can opener but she finds this one very easy and comfortable to use.
