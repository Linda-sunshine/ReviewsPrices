review/summary: Love these potsreview/text: Love these pots!We haven't had them long but so far they've worked great. They are well made and cook very evenly and aren't too bad about sticking though you do have to watch food a little more closely then with a nonstick pot (don't cook on high high its unnecessary). Love that I can toss them in the dishwasher but if you don't like to do that they are very easy to hand wash as well. They did not keep the shiny new look past first use but it doesn't affect their use.The only thing I don't like is that the handles on the lids are not heat resistant so they get pretty hot if you leave stuff covered. Other then that they were totally worth it.
