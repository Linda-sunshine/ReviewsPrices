review/summary: Fantastic Bed Topper!review/text: My husband and I have an extra firm bed, about a year and a half old. To be specific it is the Bellagio at Home by Serta. Good bed, very firm and supportive, but it can be too supportive!For about 6 months now I have been exploring memory foam toppers, and have been nervous about density, thickness, etc. I read reviews all the time. The firmness of the bed has started to affect my sleep so I decided to make a decision. I am SO glad I opted for this topper.My research (www dot sleeplikethedead dot com/memory-foam-toppers dot html)led me to lean toward a two inch topper. After reading the reviews about this one, I was excited. Honestly I thought the reviewer who said it smelled like mint chocolate chip was sarcastic, but no. There is NO chemical smell, and it DOES smell like mint chocolate chip ice cream. Such a plus!It inflated on the bed, and made the bed up the same night, just using an old matress pad to cover it. Easy as pie!Comfort is EXCELLENT! The squish factor is good, just enough, and still allows our mattress to provide support but comfortably! We can move on the bed without feeling restricted or confined by too much memory foam. I do not notice too much heat retention, and I like to be cool when I sleep. The ventilation seems quite good.I highly recommend this 2-inch topper to make a too firm mattress MUCH more comfortable.
