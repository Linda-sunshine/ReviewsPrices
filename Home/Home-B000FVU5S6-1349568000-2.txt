review/summary: Lasted over 4 years, a new world of comfort!review/text: I bought these sheets nearly five years ago, when I returned from living abroad. Until a few months ago, they were my ONLY sheets, used every day. Finally the fitted bottom sheet developed a split in a heavy wear spot, and I need to replace it. So I looked to the tag on them and found Springmaid. Sure enough, Amazon still has them (exclusive) and though they are a lot more expensive (I paid $40) they remain one of the few honestly Egyptian cotton sheets with decent LEGITIMATE threadcount.I've gotten a couple other sets recently, and while one was good quality (if a bit stiff) the rest I've come across were just junk trying to pose as quality. For example, calling it Egyptian cotton LUXURY or QUALITY(but not actually made of Egyptian cotton) and several other "clever" word-plays. In short, I highly recommend them and, while I balk at the price increase (and at buying a set to replace one sheet) they're well worth the money.
