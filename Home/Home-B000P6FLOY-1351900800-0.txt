review/summary: This thing broke in less than 2 monthsreview/text: Pretty crappy thing to say the least.. 2 months and DEAD... I was using this to check on the temp of my oven and it was working fine and then Poof... DEAD As you would expect the chance to return this or get a replacement is past... another reason not to order things with amazon.com
