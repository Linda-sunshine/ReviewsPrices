review/summary: My very first juicer!review/text: I have only had it for a week now, but I've been juicing every day. I admit, I am a very inexperienced juicer; however, this juicer does exactly what it's supposed to do. I find it easy to clean, and I don't have any mess flying out the top like others have said. Well... maybe I would except that I use the stopper/plunger/pusher thingy to cover the hole right away after I drop something down in there, so nothing flies out. I have been juicing apples, cucumbers, carrots, lemons, spinach, kale, collards, parsley, cilantro, beets, mustard leaves (blech! won't use that again), and ginger. Everything has been successfully juiced.I have never juiced before, so I can't say whether this Breville is better or worse than other juicers, but I can say that I like it a lot and if you're new to juicing like I am, this seems like a great machine to own -not pricey, easy to clean, well-built, attractive, and a great juice extractor.As I said, I've only had it for a week and everything has been great; however, I will definitely re-visit this review if something goes wrong in the future.
