review/summary: Best Coffee maker I've ever owned!review/text: I really like coffee, but had never had an expensive coffee maker. I was looking for something that was affordable but high quality, which is why I went with the DCC-1200. It is amazing and the coffee is so smooth! The 1- to 4-Cup feature (when making less than 5 cups) works great since I rarely make more than 4 cups, and basically &#8216;double heats&#8217; the water, which ensures my little pot will be just as hot as a full pot of coffee.I've never had a carafe that didn't piss me off; that didn't spill water no matter how careful I was--until now! Not sure how that was designed, but it is perfect! There's also a filtration option which is really nice, and the permanent filter works great and saves me money! All in all, this was the best choice I could have made, and would definitely recommend it to anyone!
