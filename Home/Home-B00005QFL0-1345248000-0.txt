review/summary: A good investmentreview/text: This was not my first bread maker. After the disappointing performance of my first one, I was surprised that I was actually willing to spend the money again but, I'm very glad that I did. This machine does a great job, even here at 5000ft elevation. How cool to put something like a Bob's Red Mill bread mix in the machine as I leave for the gym in the morning to return to the wonderful smell of fresh baking bread. If you are a bread lover..and a little miffed at paying $5.00 or more for a loaf of tasteless bread, this may be the right solution for you,too.!!! One note if you're an old hand at bread makers...this machine reverses the order in which you add the ingredients, so make note of that.
