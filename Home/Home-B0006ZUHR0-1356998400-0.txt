review/summary: Great ironreview/text: I recently killed my Rowenta by dropping it on the ground. Reviews of irons led me to this being thefavorite of many. I love that you can just pour water right in to the iron without having the opening back uplike my Rowenta. It also steams very well and the water seems to last much longer than my previous iron.Irons great. Does spit a little, but I really think they all do anyway. Very pleased with my choice and you can't beatthe price.
