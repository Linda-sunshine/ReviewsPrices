review/summary: Ermahgerd I lerve this jercer!review/text: Got this juicer today. Went to the grocery store, picked up some produce, and started juicing. It was easy to set up, easy to juice, and easy to tear down and clean. So easy in fact, I juiced once in the afternoon and again in the evening. That's saying a lot since I'm never very motivated to prepare anything that requires immediate clean-up twice in one day. Oh and you do need to clean up immediately after to prevent shmutz from drying and juice from staining the parts (unless you like that sorta thing).This "compact" unit is actually pretty substantial, and it appears to be made of quality materials. It extracted quite a bit of juice from the stuffs I threw in there. I was able to fill the cup that came with it to the top with 2 carrots, 2 celery, 1 cucumber, 1 apple, 1 beet, and 1 jalapeno. I think that's pretty good. The entire process is pretty mess-free if you're mindful of covering the tube as soon as you put your ingredients in.I read some reviews saying that the pulp was too moist. I'm not sure what people expect from this type of juicer, but I bet they also think their laundry should be dry after it goes through the spin cycle. Anyhoo.. I don't mind the amount of moisture in the pulp, and although I haven't used any yet, I think it would probably taste pretty good mixed in with some pasta or in a soup.
