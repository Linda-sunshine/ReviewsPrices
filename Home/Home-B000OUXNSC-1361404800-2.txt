review/summary: Love it....Just wash and air dry....Duh!review/text: This is the second one I've purchased! I bought one for my bed and loved it so much that I bought one for my son! I see all the reviews that say this melts in the dryer so I just washed mine and let it air dry! It was perfect! I love the material on the sides, it's this cool sleek stretchy material that seems quite strong to me! My son and I both have pillowtop mattresses that are quite thick and this covers with no problem. I think it helps sheets stay on the mattress better and I have never felt that it generates heats like one reviewer commented. I've told everyone about this mattress cover and it is an awesome price when you can catch it marked down!
