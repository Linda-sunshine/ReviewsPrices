review/summary: I have used this grinder for 30 yearsreview/text: I know there are more expensive grinders and I know that there are different types of grinders. This one has been a perfect little performer for the last 30 years for me. I give this as a gift to friends who drink coffee but have not discovered the joy of fresh ground coffee.The reason I choose these grinders, they are built to last! They do an excellent job grinding coffee and spices too. They are very simply designed and easy to clean. You cannot possibly go wrong getting this product.Krups makes a very fine product.
