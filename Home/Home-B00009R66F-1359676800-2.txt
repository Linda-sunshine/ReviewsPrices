review/summary: Great Value, Don't Expect Miraclesreview/text: I'm tired of paying hundreds of dollars to send out my rugs for cleaning, so I decided to try out a home carpet cleaner. I settled on the Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge, F5914-900, because it had the best reviews and cost less than a single carpet cleaning, so I didn't have much to lose. It definitely lifts dirt, which you can see when you use it and when you empty the water. But on a variety of rugs, it didn't work any miracles, leaving behind stains (even with pretreatment). Nonetheless, I'm happy with the purchase and will continue to use it for regular carpet maintenance. As a bonus, it's a nice mop replacement for kitchen and bathroom floors, leaving them fairly dry afterwards (although I wish I could lower the brushes more to get into the grout). They also need to change the name, as this model doesn't use steam at all.
