review/summary: Love love lovereview/text: I have purchased the Mr. Coffee Keurig previous to this and did not like it at all.This is so much better. Although to fill a travel size mug I still need to hit the small tea cup option and the large option, but I don't have to keep refilling the water tank. I also have to keep the drip tray out for travel sized mugs.Love the temperature option. I like my coffee super hot because by the time I drink it in my classroom, it gets much cooler.Timer off control is great. Coffee taste great.
