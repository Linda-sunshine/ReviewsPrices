review/summary: It came super fast!review/text: I ordered my chair the day before president's day and It arrived that Monday. I was shocked. I was a little nervous when i tried to put this chair together. The instructions only provided my with pictures but no words. I was trying to install the wheels but i did not realize that i just had to push down hard enough until they slid in. To make sure that I was doing it right I had to look online for instructions. I did not find this model on the Lorell site. I had to use directions for a similar model. The directions provided the pictures but words also. Once I put my chair together. I was proud and I sat in it and it was comfy! I have no complaints so far.
