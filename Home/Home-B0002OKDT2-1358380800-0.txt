review/summary: Easy clean up compared to my orbital juicerreview/text: I have an orbital juicer which has been sitting in the closet. Too much hassle to clean. This one sits on my kitchen counter and gets used almost daily. It comes apart quickly/easily and you rinse the parts out in seconds. It works on leafy greens too, where the orbital does not. We've also made fresh spagetti with it, which was good. Nothing like fresh squeezed orange juice in the morning!
