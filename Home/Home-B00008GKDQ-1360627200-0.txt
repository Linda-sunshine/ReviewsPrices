review/summary: It's a Big Honkin' Piece of Metal!review/text: So, when I'm not using it to fry eggs or pancakes it doubles as a ramp for my motorcycle to get up the front steps... Okay, so my wife would kill me if I used it for the latter-- but it COULD be used for a motorcycle ramp. The thing is that solid and durable! I've never bought any Lodge product I haven't been happy with. If you like things that last (and you need a motorcycle loading ramp) get this griddle!
