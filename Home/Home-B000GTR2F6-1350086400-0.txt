review/summary: Love the easiness of using this potreview/text: I'd been thinking of getting one for years, but my husband wouldn't let me. Too expensive, he said. We'll this one was reasonably priced on Amazon and I know I deserve it! So we now own a wonderful Keurig B70 Platinum Brewing System - otherwise known as a coffee pot.It's perfect for empty nesters who only need a cup to get going in the morning, or those folks looking for their afternoon burst of energy! The choice of coffees today is amazing as well (our favorites are Green Mountain and Donut Shop).I would recommend this to all the Boomers I know!
