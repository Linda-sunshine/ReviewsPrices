review/summary: Don't waste your moneyreview/text: This is a piece of cr*#. What was supposed to be the most relaxing bath ever ended up being a wet exercise in frustration just trying to get this thing to work. The suction cups are taller than the inner lip, which therefore can't reach the surface it's supposed to seal. so the water leaks right through. Seriously. Do yourself a favor. Try another one.
