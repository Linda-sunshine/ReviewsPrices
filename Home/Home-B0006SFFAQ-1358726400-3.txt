review/summary: Coffee is great, the carafe is lame.review/text: Everything about this coffee making is great and user friendly. EXCEPT the carafe. When it comes time to pour your brew the thing is leaky and always drips coffee. I don't know if I got a leaky, defective pot or what, but I just pour my coffee over the sink now to save the mess.
