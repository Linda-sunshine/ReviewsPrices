review/summary: Great gift, great product.review/text: While my mother in law was staying with us recently she admired our Misto olive oil sprayer which we had received as a gift. As a way of thanking her for helping us out during her stay and with our newborn son we purchased this two pack for her.The product is great because you can use your own olive oil or even spicy oil or blended oils and just pump it up (sort of like a Super Soaker) and use in place of pam or other non-stick spray.
