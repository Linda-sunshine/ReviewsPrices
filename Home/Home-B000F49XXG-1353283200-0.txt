review/summary: Great espresso machine for the moneyreview/text: This machine makes very good, strong espresso. The longer you preheat, the stronger your espresso will be. You also want to use very fine ground beans and tamp well. I am the only coffee drinker in my household, so it is perfect for me! The milk frother works just fine for my purposes.
