review/summary: Ridiculously big!!review/text: I love T-fal pans - they are durable, quality products. However, I was shocked to see how big this pan turned out to be in comparison to the 12" T-fal I saw in Walmart. I suppose 'Professional' pans are big!!Needless to say I returned it because I couldn't have a pan covering half of the adjacent burner on my stove!Regardless, if size isn't a problem I recommend - go for it. T-Fal doesn't disappoint (I bought the one from Walmart and it's been great).
