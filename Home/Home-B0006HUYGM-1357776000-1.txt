review/summary: Light Weight Easy to Use on Stairs and to Clean the Carreview/text: My wife requested this for Christmas so she could clean the furniture in the basement where out cats live. She is particularly pleased with it as am I. I have always found it difficult to clean stairs with a regular vacuum because of the size and weight and balancing a regular full size vacuum on the stairs, but this is the perfect size for such a task. It is easy to maneuver and is ideal for the car as well.
