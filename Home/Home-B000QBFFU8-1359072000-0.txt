review/summary: Awesome Juicer!review/text: I've had this for nearly three months now and am extremely happy with this juicer. I regularly juice kale, spinach, celery, cucumbers, cabbage, carrots, apples, pears, blood oranges and ginger. The juice output seems fine to me and the pulp is always dry enough that I feel I am getting max liquid extraction. I agree with other reviews that the level 5 speed is really not necessary, I do most of my juicing at 2 or 3, only occasionally at 4.Cleanup is a breeze if done right away, usually just rinsing is required (with a faucet sprayer); I run through dishwasher maybe once a week. The included scrub brush does a great job cleaning the basket, maybe 30 seconds of good scrubbing gets out all the tougher green bits. And the finish is just beautiful, like other Breville appliances, and I am happy to leave it out on the counter. It's made juicing far easier than I had ever imagined and I am very happy with my investment every day.
