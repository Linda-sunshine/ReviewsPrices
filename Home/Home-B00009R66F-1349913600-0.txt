review/summary: Unit leaksreview/text: The SteamVac carpet cleaner has great suction but after a few months the unit leaks. Not just a few drops....the complete tank empties onto the floor/carpet! After receiving three replacements from Amazon, I gave up and bought a different brand. Very disappointed.
