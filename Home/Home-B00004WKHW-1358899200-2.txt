review/summary: Cuisinart has terrible customer servicereview/text: I purchased this product and after only a few months the plastic bowls developed a long crack, causing liquids to leak out. The unit continued to operate, although it was very messy. A week ago, the top cover piece that latches and locks into place (also made of plastic), snapped apart - making the until unusable. I contacted Cuisinart's customer service through email. I explained that I was a loyal Cuisinart customer and asked for a replacement bowl and lid. I explained that the rest of the unit was in working order. Customer service replied telling me that I could replace the bowl for 17.00 and lid for 8.99, plus taxes and shipping and handling! I replied that I would not be purchasing another Cuisinart product. From now on, I'll purchase from the lesser known companies for 1/3 to 1/2 the price. If the item only last a year, I'm no worse off than buying from Cuisinart.
