review/summary: My great, new Cuisinart Coffee Maker!review/text: I love the coffee maker! After the first few times that I emptied the coffee pot, I found grounds in the bottom of the carafe after I drank all of the coffee. I must have put some heaping teaspoons of the coffee into the gold mesh basket.Now I am using level teaspoons and I don't have any grounds in the bottom of the carafe. Yippee!My quest now is to find a really delicious tasting coffee. I was using a Market Basket Hazelnut variety which is a brand made my supermaket, Giant Eagle. I am now using Starbucks Columbian Coffee and I like it better than the Market Basket brand. I have to try a few different types of coffee.
