review/summary: Love it!review/text: This thing is awesome! It is so much more cost effective than the k cup systems, which I admit I really wanted but I'm not so serious about coffee that I can justify the expense. The reusable filter makes it easy to use your own coffee, and I recently found out if you throw a tea bag in there it brews the perfect cup of tea. The cup it comes with is kind of cheap, but you can easily replace it. I put it in the dish washer and now there is water inside it, that I cannot get out. Overall I would highly recommend this product.
