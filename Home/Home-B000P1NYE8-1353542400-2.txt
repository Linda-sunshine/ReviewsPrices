review/summary: Digital Pocket Scalereview/text: I got this little hobby scale to weigh various specimens, from mineral to vegetable this little scale has worked great. I also love the fact that it uses standard batteries instead of those annoying (and expensive) coin cell batteries. After quite a season of working it out with camping and hiking this year it is still working just perfectly, and does not seem to need any calibration yet (good thing too, I don't have a 500g weight to calibrate it with). For the price it has been a real workhorse...
