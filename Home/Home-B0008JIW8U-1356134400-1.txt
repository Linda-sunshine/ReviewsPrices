review/summary: Disappointing.....review/text: Purchased this small size maker so I didn't have to stop on the way to work in the morning. Does the job as I can set the timer at night and make my travel mug quick when I'm running out the door.Unfortunately the plastic top was not made big enough to fit on the outer edge of the pot rim. So after a few uses it has now flexed down into the pot and doesn't push up on the spring enough to let the coffee run into the pot below.In short... the coffee maker &#34;blows up&#34;, all the water stays in the filter/coffee part of the machine and flows back into the main reservoir. So now you get a big mess of grounds and coffee water all inside the machine and nothing in the pot.I just saw a full size one with a timer for $16 on sale at the local department store so I think I'm just going to get a replacement and toss this one.Sorry to say ..... it's junk until they fix the lid for the pot.
