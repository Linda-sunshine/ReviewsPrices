review/summary: This wok is designed for an electric cook top, not ideal for gas cook topsreview/text: This is a big wok (to me, anyway), and my older wok has no top, so I like that. I have several recipes that call for you to cover the wok and simmer for some period of time, and I could never use them with my older wok.It's heavy enough to stand up to lots of use and maybe a bit of ab-use, but it's definitely not in a class with cast iron woks. The flat bottom (about the size of an average burner on an electric cook top) is clad with a second thickness of metal to provide more even heat distribution across the bottom, but the sides are single thickness so if you use this on a gas cook top with the fire turned up high (as I do when stir-frying in a wok), the sides will burn. The stir-fry comes out fine, but there's always a thin layer of burned-on food where-ever the fire was the hottest. This makes clean up pretty tedious, I usually have to use a metal scouring pad and of course this compromises the aesthetic appeal of the inside surface.The outside surface is highly polished, but it discolors from the gas flame and there's no way to remove the discoloration without ruining the polish, so if you use this on a gas cook top, you just have to learn to live with the discoloration.
