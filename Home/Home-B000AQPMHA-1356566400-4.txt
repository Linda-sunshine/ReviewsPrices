review/summary: Love my Keurigreview/text: This was a replacement for another Keurig I had for several years that finally went to sleep forever, I thought. I gave it to my housekeeper, and she told me she took it home, cleaned it, and it works fine! So don't throw your Keurig out until you give it a good cleaning! Can't remember what it was like not to have this great coffee maker.
