review/summary: EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE.review/text: This is my second digital pressure cooker and is the best ever. It takes only a few minutes to get the heat up to pressure temperature and works exactly the way the users manual states. It is well worth the money. I use it frequently and highly recommend it.
