review/summary: Great cook ware, for a while!review/text: I bought this exact set some years back and thought I had purchased the last set of pots and pans I would ever need, couldn't have been more wrong, two of my pans are beginning to buckle on the bottom, the aluminium disc built inside is warping my pans badly, I have a wagner cast iron skillet that God only knows how old really is, I should be able to make the same statement about these cuisinart pans but can't! So not worth all that money spent when cheap pots and pans may not work quite as these when these are new, but cheap pans still work, I don't blame amazon as they are strictly logistics, cuisinart should do a way better job for the money, yes its true that heat destroys things, but one would think that cuisinart would've taken into account that people would use them on a hot burner, that is why a person buys pots and pans in the first place, to cook with them, well "DUH", sorry cuisinart, your product is not as good as you claim it to be!
