review/summary: Fantastic pizza pan, griddle, etcreview/text: Great pizza pan, and works as a large griddle. I really like the handles on it, it is easy to lift with thick oven mitts. I'm so glad I got this as Christmas present! It makes a great pan for baking biscuits, cookies, pancakes, large amounts of bacon, chinese green onion pancakes (these are like naan, bing), it's really really worth the money.
