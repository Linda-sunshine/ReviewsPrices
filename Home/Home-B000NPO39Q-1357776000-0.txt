review/summary: PERFECT ADDITION TO OUR WILLOW TREE NATIVITY!review/text: The only thing that my wife specifically requested for Christmas were the two Willow Tree Angels for her Nativity. I had to order them one at a time and one came from a third party, but she was thrilled to get them on Christmas Morning. While most of our other Christmas decorations come down sometime in January, my wife leaves her Willow Tree Nativity up all year. This was definitely a great addition to it.
