review/summary: crap is too high a rating for Cusinart engineeringreview/text: Yes, I avoided all the bad ratings for this and bought it. My bad. It was less expensive a the local bed/bath store, so I didn't buy from trusty Amazon this time.Again, a piece of crap gives too much credit to the Cusinart customer design team.1. I'm over 40, that means I'll never be able to direct the water in the rediculously hard to aim for water compartment, and impossible to read without a flashlight and 2x readers "fill gage". I admit I do get a thrill every morning wondering if my coffee will be weak or strong, and the opportunity to wipe up the counter.2. I just had to jerry-rig a way to make coffee now that the 1.5 cent tab that holds the coffee funnel in place broke off (after 6 months of ownership). The machine happily overflows if the funnel is not firmly set in place. My $80 coffee make has just been rendered useless by poor engineering (that it appears has not been tampered with since at least 2005). &lt;&lt; you'll find this little tab at the bottom of the basket/funnel next to where the coffee comes out.I just saw the local cost-company showcasing this on their shelves. Buyer beware, where ever you might buy this.And yes, I could go fight this with Cusinart and try to get a new part or get my money back. But really - this is coffee machine. My toaster and my blender can work without tinkering, why can Cusinart fix their design problem? I don't remember having any problems with my 12 year old no-brand maker - right up until the on/off button broke.
