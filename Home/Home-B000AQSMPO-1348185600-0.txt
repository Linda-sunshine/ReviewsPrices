review/summary: If you get error of "Prime", please request for exchangereview/text: I bought one from Kohl's using the 30% off coupon in July.I began to have the problem of "prime" from the second or third day. I use it very lightly, about 1 or 2 cups per day. So I contacted the customer service and the guy instructed me to send back the cup holder as evidence of purchase. A new machine was shipped at no cost. The new machine has been working well. I only have had 2 "Prime" so far and very easily fixed by adding more water. The reason for the "Prime" might be the low level of water in the tank. Keeping the water above certain level may prevent the problem to happen. If you search the website, you can find some tricks for "prime".Though prime is a problem for the machine, if you have the problem at a daily base, something must be wrong with the machine and you need to contact the customer service to get a new one.By the way, I also bought a My Kcup and it works well with my own ground coffee.
