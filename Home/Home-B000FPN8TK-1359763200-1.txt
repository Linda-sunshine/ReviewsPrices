review/summary: Reasonable product with too many annoyancesreview/text: Reasonable product with annoyances.Cleaning:I don't have a dishwasher and I disagree with the other reviewers that it is easy to clean. I actually find it difficult and cumbersome to clean. Tea-bits really attach to the filter and without a toothbrush or something similar it's not getting clean.It is also difficult to dry making me uncomfortable knowing it is moist/wet for extended times.Spills:Cleaning is annoying but far worse are the accidental spills.The device has a stand/plate that will collect drops while it is resting. Unfortunately it is incredibly poorly designed.The device will not sit properly in the center of the stand as it is slightly bulging upwards. This results in the teapot always leaning one way or the other even when seated properly.End result is that on numerous occasions I or my wife have seated the teapot on the stand and as it looks 'normal' tilting sideways leave it .... not noticing that the lever is resting on the sidewall of the stand resulting in free flowing tea and then the kitchen is flooded... AGAIN.The product could be OK but the Cons just really get to me and give it a generous 2/5. Really feel like giving it a 1/5 but that might be a bit to drastic.
