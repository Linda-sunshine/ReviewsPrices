review/summary: Massivereview/text: I have only used this once, and it functions as promised. Beware, if you are new to canning, this thing is massive and nearly impossible to lift when filled with more than 3 liters of water. I recommend going to a store to get an idea for which size canner you actually need. Then, come back to Amazon and take advantage of their great pricing! This canner is designed for large jobs, making it great for personal or gift giving projects.
