review/summary: Low consumption dehumidifierreview/text: I have been using this dehumidifier in a gun cabinet. It is more that adequate for keeping humidity down. I went from 70-75% humidity at peak times to less than 40%. The cabinet does get a little warmer with this dehumidifier running all the time but by only a few degrees. The best thing is that this unit draws very little power. I tested it a while back and I think it was about 15 watt. Very good unit that I would highly recommend.
