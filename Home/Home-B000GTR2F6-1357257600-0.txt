review/summary: Excellent product and pricereview/text: After trying the B60 during Christmas and wanting to purchase one of these for over a year I finally took the plunge. I was able to purchase the B70 through Amazon for what the B60 was being sold for in retail stores. Arrived in great condition and nothing was damaged in shipment. Set up was easy with the included instructions. Rinsed the water contained, ran a couple hot water rinses through the system (per the instructions) and I was ready to go!The water container has nice blue LED lights that give a backlight so you can see the level in dark conditions. I believe the water container is 72oz therefore you do not have to refill it too often. They do recommend either filtered water or bottled water though. I would assume that if you use the included filter that tap water would be fine too.This comes with 5 nice brew sizes, auto on and off feature to save energy, a sleep mode, along with the ability to add a water filter, also has brew temp settings. Comes with 12 variety pack of K-Cups too!Pros: Easy instructions, set up, customization settings, and awesome variety of K-Pods to choose from.Cons: You are on your own to figure out which brew size is best for your taste. I like my coffee strong, therefore if I brew a travel mug, I would probably brew two smalls instead of one brew of the 11.5 oz travel mugThis is a great machine, K-Cups are available everywhere now in so many varieties. You cannot go wrong with this purchase.
