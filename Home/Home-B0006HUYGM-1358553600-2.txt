review/summary: Great suction!review/text: I liked this little vac so much that I bought another. I use one in the area where I keep the litter boxes. I picks up everything from any surface. I use the other for the car and for spot cleaning in the house. I especially like that the roller brush can be turned on and off. The powerful suction makes any job easy and that was the one feature I was really looking for in a handheld vac. I've gone through way too many of the rechargeable battery vacs that never hold a charge. This Eureka vac is easy to use, easy to empty, has a long electrical cord, ships fast, and is worth every penny of the reasonable price.
