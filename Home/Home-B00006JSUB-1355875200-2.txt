review/summary: Not really Pre-Seasonedreview/text: The finish inside this skillet is fairly rough. I wish that this company would do something about that. Back in the day, these skillets were almost polished. Because of this rough finish, I had to season the skillet to about ten times to get it to work properly (fry an egg without sticking). The term &#34;Pre-Seasoned &#34; is a myth and you need to spend a lot of time getting your skillet ready.
