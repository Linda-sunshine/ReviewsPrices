review/summary: awesome cookerreview/text: LOVE this cooker...have used it five times now and every thing comes out amazing and fast!!!Its a must have for very busy family. I WASN'T SURE ABOUT 4 QT OR 6 QT..but am happy with the four quart..you can cook a max of 3 lbs meat and boy is it tender.One thing is it arrives with you having to attach the handles...no problem..very easy..just beware there are washers with it..don't lose them like I did...bottom line..love the size and the product!
