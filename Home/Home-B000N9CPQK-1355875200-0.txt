review/summary: 6 Hours In. NOTICIBLE difference in air quality!!!review/text: I have only had this item for a day now and have been using for only 6 hours or so but the air quality is &#34;cleaner&#34;. My wife and I smoke indoors, we have 3 cats, 3 dogs, and live in a farming area that kicks dust into the air CONSTANTLY!!! I wash my car, NEXT DAY there is a layer of dust/silt/dirt settled. This item is long overdue. I did purchase 3 different purifiers, this one is first to arrive so I cannot compare it to any other systems. It is loud on max speed setting but that is too much for my smaller bedroom(10x15), low works just fine and is background noise I barely notice unless I want to. I hope to add to this review later when the other two systems arrive.if you want this product but are &#34;worried&#34; don't be. It does what it's made to do!
