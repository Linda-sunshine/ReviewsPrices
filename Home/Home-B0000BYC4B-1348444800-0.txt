review/summary: Lunch time-saver!review/text: These jar lids are fantastic! I was thrilled to see they fit my wide-mouth jars perfectly and there's no leakage. Used them to bring a broth-based soup to work and wasn't afraid of spills. They're fast and easy to clean. I got them very quickly and had several co-workers comment on how great it is I use the mason jars for my lunches. Whether making salads or soups they make packing lunch a breeze (and green my lunch too!).
