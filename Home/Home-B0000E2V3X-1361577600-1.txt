review/summary: Cast iron Pizza Panreview/text: I love this pan I heated it as I was cutting up my stuff for the pizza. Then when I was ready ,I put corn corn meal on the pan then then pizza dough and all my ingredients ,Cooked it and ,the Pizza was great! My problem with using anything other than a pizza pan is that you can't make your pizza in or on it then cook , This pan you can and it great!!!
