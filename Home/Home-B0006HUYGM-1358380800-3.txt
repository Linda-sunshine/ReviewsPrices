review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: This product is a little on the heavy side. The suction on this vacuum is average at best. I have a cat and needed it to vacuum up around the litter box and I use pine litter so it is very light no reason for it not to do the job. I used it for stairs and again I have to swipe the stairs many times because the suction just isn't there. I do not recommend this product.
