review/summary: Cheapreview/text: I bought this product for two purposes, to grind meat and make pasta. The grinding of the meat was ok, minus having to constantly clear out the blades, because they would become jammed with meat that it wouldn't push out. The second day I had the product I decided to my demise to make pasta. Once I was through about half of my dough, the piece that connects to the handle broke, rendering the entire device useless. My recommendation is to buy a meat grinder that does not have cheap plastic to form a vital function of the machine. This machine worked for meat, but couldn't push out dough. Do not buy this item, invest in a better product.
