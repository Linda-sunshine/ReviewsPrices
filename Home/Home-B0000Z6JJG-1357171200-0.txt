review/summary: Great for saving time!review/text: This is great for slicing and shredding vegetables and cheese. It saves lots of time. The feeder tube is decent size so that cutting items down to fit is fairly minimal. The only thing I've had any problem with is onions. It is kind of hit and miss...if they are juicy soft onions, it is a problem, otherwise it's fine.
