review/summary: loudest purifier everreview/text: Not sure if i got the defect product or what, this purifier is extremely loud and it whistles. The whistling noise becomes louder and stronger when it's set on the lowest level. I'm fine with the white noises (have 3 purifiers at home currently - the type that needs to replace the filters) but i just can't stand the sharp whistling. I tried for one night and it drove me nuts, so i had to return it. The return process with Amazon was wonderful. I didn't even have to take it to the UPS store. Amazon had UPS picked it up from my home. Love Amazon!
