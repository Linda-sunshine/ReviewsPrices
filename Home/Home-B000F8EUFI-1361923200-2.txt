review/summary: Not Impressed- spend the extra moneyreview/text: Bought this vac in Dec based on the reviews. First time- worked great. Second time, belt broke. Waited for a LONG time for replacement belts to be shipped. First one broke. Second one is still going. It has now totally lost suction. My advice is to hang onto the box so you can return it. I guess I got what I paid for.
