review/summary: Outstanding Customer servicereview/text: I bought this mirror in February 2012. On 12/27 the bulbs quit working. I called Jerdon and faxed copy of Amazon invoice to them, and today I received a new mirror! You might say the bulbs should have lasted longer, but the warranty was &#34;No questions asked&#34;
