review/summary: Great deal!!!review/text: Great price compared to other sites. I use 3 cans nestled behind some larger decorative rock lined with quartz (I don't much care for the look of fake ceramic logs). Puts out a little heat, enough to take the chill out of the air even though it was only 49 degrees outside. The flames jumped and crackled like a wood fire much more than I was expecting. I will be buying again.
