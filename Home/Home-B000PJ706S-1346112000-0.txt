review/summary: Not bad, but better safer models available on Amazonreview/text: I was a bit cautious about buying this kettle after reading reviews about the bad after taste and poor quality. I owned this for a while and I must say the unit I got is pretty decent. I do agree there is plastic sealant around the heater element however I never experienced after taste anytime during use. I find that design feature flawed as after prolonged use the plastic seal can deteriorate causing a leak and harmful plastic can be consumed. The force is applied on the hinge even a bit it could damage the mechanism as it feels very flimsy and customers have experienced the lid falling apart on many occasions. A more durable plastic seal should have been used than the cheap rubber cover to close the hinge mechanism. A much better kettle which I also own is the "Toastess TGK486 Cordless Glass Kettle, Gray", it also looks awesome, metal plate at the bottom, easy to clean, no plastic contamination and cheaper than the Capresso. Toastess heats up really fast as well and its fun to watch the water boil. The Toastess was out of stock which is why I ended up buying the Capresso.
