review/summary: Great tasting hot coffeereview/text: My old trusty Cuisinart Grind and Brew coffee maker had finally worn out and just wasn't making hot enough coffee anymore so I had been in search of a new thermal carafe machine. I grind my own beans with a burr grinder which is much better than the grinder on the Cuisinart but I loved the thermal carafe. I thought I would try the Zojirushi based upon the reviews from intelligent coffee drinkers. This machine brews a good tasting hot pot of coffee and looks good on the counter. I like the design of the carafe with the ability to seal the lid between pours to keep more heat in. Yes the the lid sticks a bit when trying to open the first time after a brew just put a towel over the top to help open it up and don't really tighten it down again. I'm happy with my purchase so far.
