review/summary: Good bargain, size & safetyreview/text: Just over $10, this small size kettle in my room with a Brita pitcher is perfect for relaxation tea, coffee and soups!The kettle saved my trip to kitchen and waiting time for boiling.It took 2.5 minutes to boil 1/3 liter (min) and 6.5 mins for 1 liter (max).With automatic shut-off feature, I do not need to hang around the Gas Range and I feel safe and at ease with this kettle :)
