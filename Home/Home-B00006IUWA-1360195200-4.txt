review/summary: Warning!! Does Not Pop Hulless, Small Kernal Popcorn!!!review/text: Buyer beware, the Presto 04820 Poplite Hot Air Popper does not pop hulless, small kernal, gourmet popcorn. It spits the Hulless, Small Kernal Popcorn out of the popper immediately after plugging it in. However, it did a nice job on the regular, grocery store variety of Orville Redenbacher's Brand. That being said, I bought this hot air popper to have a healthier snack to eat. My intentions were to buy non gmo, hulless, gourmet popcorn, and use this popper to pop it. Then, I'd be eating the healthier non gmo corn, and not using any oil to prepare it. Plus, I wouldn't have popcorn hulls sticking in my gums and throat.However, I did figure-out a workaround. I wadded up several paper towels, loosely. Then, I held onto the paper towel ball with a long pair of tongs. I used the tongs to insert the paper towel ball deeply into the chute, making sure the paper towel ball did not get too close to the hole where the hot air is piped-out. It worked!!! This forced the small kernals to stay in the hot air chamber long enough to get heated enough to pop. Once the hot air area is full of popped popcorn, you can remove the paper towel ball, and place a deep bowl under the chute. I tried popping my hulless popcorn in a pan, but it came out greasy and tough, but it came out much fluffier and tender using the method I just described in the hot air popper! I haven't read any of the other reviews to see if anyone else has discovered this flaw. I'm contemplating keeping it as I've found this workaround. Has anyone else found a simpler workaround?
