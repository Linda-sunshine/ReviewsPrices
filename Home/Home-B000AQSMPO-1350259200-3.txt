review/summary: Great Coffee Machine!!!!review/text: So you can't brew a full pot. So what. What you get instead is a perfectly brewed cup, every single time, made at your convenience in just a few seconds. And you can mix-up the flavors easily too. If you are debating whether or not to purchase go ahead and buy it. I did, and I've never enjoyed tossing my old coffee machine more.....I buy a bunch up K-Cups at Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks and the coffee tastes just as good out of the Keurig. If you love coffee, and depend on it in the mornings, like I do, buy this machine.
