review/summary: Fails after a few monthsreview/text: I really wanted to like this product as it is very cute and quiet however, I have gone through 3 of them in 2 years. We bought one initially in 2010 and sparingly used it the first year. Then I had a baby and we used it daily. The output was fantastic until a few months of nightly use and it started making a noise and intermittently quit working. We were able to turn it on and off a bunch of times to get it on. Had to do this every night. One day while I was carrying it full and the flimsy piece of plastic broke. The reservoir cracked and that was the end of that one. I bought another one because I loved how quiet it was and how much mist it put out (when it worked). The new one had half the output as the first one so we sent it back thinking it was a dud. I also noticed the second one's mechanism that makes the humidity had also been changed since the original. It was a different size, and color, and was a different piece of plastic. The replacement had the same issue. Barely puts out anything even on high. I didn't request a refund in time so we were stuck with it. It has been four months and now this one has intermittently stopped work. It makes a loud vibrating sound and does not put out mist. Too bad ...could have been such a good product.
