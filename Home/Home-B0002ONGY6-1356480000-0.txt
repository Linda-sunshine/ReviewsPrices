review/summary: Thought they would suck, but they're goodreview/text: Bought these at the last minute because we were able to get a cal king from a friend, and had parents visiting for the holidays. THey worked out great, though I can't speak to whether or not they hold up int he long run. They found them to be comfortable, however, and they do seem sturdily constructed. I wouldn't call them ultra luxury--I have some lower thread count sheets that cost 10x as much that out of the box were much more luxurious, but these are good--nothin' wrong with them, they don't feel cheap.
