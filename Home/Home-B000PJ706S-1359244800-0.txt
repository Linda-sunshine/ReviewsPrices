review/summary: it's okay...review/text: Looked and worked beautifully and flawlessly since I got it in October 2011 and yesterday it died. Blue light switch won't turn on, no boiling... just like that. I used this to boil water only, 2-3 times a day for tea. The handle with the chrome attached to the black part became a little loose from regular use. Other than that, I had no other problem. I've checked reviews from other websites and seems this product's lifespan is more than or less than 1 year. If you've got the budget to spend $60 annually for this kettle, this is the best of its kind. As for me, I'll probably buy again if the price drops. Meanwhile I'll keep looking and most likely get something else.
