review/summary: AMAZING!!!review/text: I have only used it twice, and it's amazing. Completely leak proof! I can shake it upside down and not one drop will come out. It says on the box that it keeps drinks hot for 8 hours- but my coffee has been hot for 12 hours! At one point, 6 hours after I made it, I had to add cold water because it was still too hot to make it. I think that if yours leaks then you might have received a defective one. It's easy to use with one hand, now I can't drive yet but I'm getting my license soon (I'm only 16!). I can say that it fits in all the cars my family has. There's an option clasp/hook that keeps the cap closed in case you were to push on the button. I keep it in my backpack all the time and am not worried about it spilling. With one push of the button, the lid snaps open. The small hole allows not too much hot liquid to come out. The lid shuts with a bit of pressure, but still easily. It feels like the perfect size in my hand. Since I've only had it for a short time,I can't exactly give any long-term effects. I'll be sure to update this review if anything goes wrong!The only thing that I don't like about it is that when you press the button and the lid flings open, some coffee on the lid may fly off somewhere. This can be avoided by holding the lid when opening it, to slow down the process.P.S. I got this thermos as a gift. My teachers are amazed that my coffee is still hot at the end of the school day.
