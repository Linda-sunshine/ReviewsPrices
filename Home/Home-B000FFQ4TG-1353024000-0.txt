review/summary: For a Bunn, I am disappointedreview/text: I have had a Bunn for many years now, and my old unit (probably 20 years old), finally gave out. I bought this model, and it holds up to Bunn's quality of coffee, yet the burner part of it is horrible. It is uneven, the pot doesn't sit right on it, and it doesn't keep it hot. As I said ... very disappointed for $100 coffee pot!
