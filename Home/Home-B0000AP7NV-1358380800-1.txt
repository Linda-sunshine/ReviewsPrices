review/summary: Perfect pitcher for small places.review/text: I have a small dorm sized fridge that does not offer ample room for food and drinks. So I purchased this pitcher for its slim design and its perfect. I don't drink water all day but I enjoy not having to refill it every time I do pour myself a glass of water.It lives up to its claims and provides tasty, clean, drinking water at a great price without taking up a lot of space in the fridge.
