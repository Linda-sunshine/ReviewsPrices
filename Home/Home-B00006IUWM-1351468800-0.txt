review/summary: Nice Sharpenerreview/text: I checked a number of reviews for knife sharpeners and chose the Presto. The unit itself was larger than I was expecting. The documentation warned of sparks, I was not sure what to expect. I previously tried another manual sharpener on a few of the knives and dulled them more. The instructions were simple. The process took just a few minutes per knife. I am impressed with how quickly the unit was able to return a decent edge to these knives. I would recommend this unit.
