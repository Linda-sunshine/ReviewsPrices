review/summary: Really usefulreview/text: Here's the thing about cast iron cookware: you have to get over fat phobia. The whole "fat will make your heart explode" thing was never supported by scientific evidence and gets less tenable as more research rolls in. Cast iron went out of style when fat went out of style and it's coming back as we realize that the convention wisdom is simply wrong. In order to cook properly with cast iron, you need to use butter, bacon grease, lard, coconut oil, etc.; i.e., oils high in saturated fat. If you are willing to do that, and care for them properly (no soap, season them from time to time) then they are great. Food doesn't stick to them, cleanup is easy, and cooking is a pleasure. This Lodge pan is inexpensive, high quality, and the right size for a wide range of cooking uses. Highly recommended.
