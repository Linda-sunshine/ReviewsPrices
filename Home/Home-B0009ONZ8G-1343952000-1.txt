review/summary: Best Hoover I ever owned.review/text: I recieved my Hoover in good time. The instructions for putting it together were clear and concise. It has great power and does a terrific job on my old carpets. I have had a couple of other Hoover vacuums, and this is the Best one I ever used. It is light weight, and for someone with a bad back and arthritic knees, that is important. I love that I can use it on stairs with ease. The powerfull suction picks up everything.
