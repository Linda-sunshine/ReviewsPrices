review/summary: Bought for a friend.review/text: I bought this as a gift for a friend who had moved to another state. Her daughter had seen a video being close to death because of poor diet and turning your life around with juicing. My friend was no way fat, she was a slender lanky person, but whenever she got a cold it took alot out of her. She needed to get her vitamins up and work on her immunity. Due to excitement from her daughter and my willingness to make sure she was happy and her wanting to commit to juicing in the new year I bought her this and had it shipped. It arrived just in time as both her and her daughter were getting the flu. She made plenty of juice and she also was a great cook and made plenty of healing soup on her own and in the end it helped. She was very thankful to of had the juicer. She said the parts fit will into the dishwasher except the top part but that can rinse. It was easy in operation and worked great. Sadly my friend past away in a car accident just before the new year, so she did not get into her juice only phase, although her daughter will presumably still get some use.
