review/summary: Powerful!review/text: this is great, it's suction is more than enough to vacuum our couch and cloth-covered chairs. I like to vacuum them every couple of months because dust that we NEVER SEE builds up and causes such furniture to get grimy and we never atrribute it to dust. But if you keep furniture dusted they look amazingly fresh after a lot of time. I used to pull out the big vacuum. We had a Dirt Devil but it was too wieldy for me (I hear the newer ones are better).
