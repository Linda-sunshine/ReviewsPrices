review/summary: Severe reservations- works great until it breaksreview/text: I received this bread machine for Christmas 2011. It was my first bread machine, and I was really excited. There is a learning curve. The first loaf- the one in the manual- wasn't great- being extremely crumby, and with an overdone crust- but it was edible. After trying out different recipes, I was sold. I've made English muffins, bagels, and countless varieties of both whole wheat and white breads.Things to be aware of:1)The loaf sizes as baked in the machine are huge, and more square than anything. I elected to just use the dough cycle, and then use a regular loaf pan in the oven.2)This machine vibrates ALOT! In fact, despite repeatedly shoving it back on the counter, it vibrated six inches forward, and *off* my counter. The lid cracked, but it still works. I devised a way to strap it to my counter, and continued on.3) Expect this machine to break.First it started squeaking horribly, about three months into use. My husband took it apart, replaced a bearing, and re-greased everything.Then he had to re-grease it again three months later.Then, last month, the dough pan started to bang into the side of the machine, as it vibrated. My husband again disassembled it, and replaced the gaskets underneath the dough pan with plastic spacers cut from cool whip containers.With this last diagnostic, he also said the motor is about shot.So. With repairs, this thing has lasted about 200 loaves, though its now on its last legs.I love using a bread machine, even one as faulty as this, and it does work wonderfully until it breaks. If you plan to only use this machine once in a great while, it would definitely suit your needs.But, as I make some form of bread every day, I plan to get a Zojirushi to replace it when it finally bites the dust.
