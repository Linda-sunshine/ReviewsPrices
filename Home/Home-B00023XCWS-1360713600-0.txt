review/summary: I like it but.....review/text: It is a great buy for the money but.... if only the cord has to be unpluged to move the pitcher ... the one I had before came off the element and could be filled without unplugging.... also there were no instructions as to how to attach the filter... and so I had to full with that for a few minutes.... otherwise I would give it 5 stars.
