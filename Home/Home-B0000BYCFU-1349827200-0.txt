review/summary: AWESOME--but you must buy regulator separatelyreview/text: This is a great canner. However, you must buy the regulator to actually use it. I have glass cooktop and the heat cycles on & off. The 15 pound weight that comes with it only works if your elevation requires 15 pounds. I had to buy the 3 piece regulator in order to 'make' a 10 pound weight. You will hate this product without the regulator. This is the only canner for glass cooktop stoves. The bottom underneath has a round circle of metal the exact size as my large burner & the 'rest' of the pot kinda hangs over the burner circle without touching so you will not ruin the glass top. again....YOU MUST HAVE THE REGULATOR. ignore Presto. they say not to use it but you cannot keep the pressure right without the regulator which you buy separately. It should be included.
