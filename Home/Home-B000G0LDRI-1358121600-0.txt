review/summary: PRETTY GOODreview/text: After years of sinus problems and since winter was coming on and we burn wood in our fireplace which dries out the air even more, not to mention living in a drought I thought I'd try a bigger humidifier. This one so far has operated very well. Been using about the past month or so and love the large tanks. Is a little loud but guess it has to make some noise. I would have rated 5 but since relatively new still not sure about the overall durability. Plus it blows cool air... would have loved a warm air setting which I thought it had but my mistake I'm sure. Makes the room very cool so on a cold night pretty chilly. It does the job though on adding water to the air and so far no drips or anything on my hardwood floors.
