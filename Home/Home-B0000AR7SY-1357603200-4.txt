review/summary: Good valuereview/text: The grinder works very well. I use a auto drip brewer with a gold filter. I set the grind to the course side of the drip indicator and get very uniform grind with little sediment. The unit is much quieter than the cuisinart I replaced, also there is very little static, which was a big problem with the cuisinart. I have made about 30 pots of coffee so far with no problems.
