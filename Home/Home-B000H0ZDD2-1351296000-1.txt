review/summary: It works finereview/text: I have this unit sitting on the nightstand next to the bed and it's completely silent so I don't know what these other yahoo's are talking about. I can't even tell there's a fan in it. The unit moves a fair amount of air for the size but not really enough to handle a full room. It should work fine in my closet once I get a power receptacle installed in there. After having it running for only an hour I saw about 1/8" of water in the container. It's been running for two days and the container is about 1/4 full now. I'll be buying another one for the other closet after I see how well this one holds up. So far so good. I removed a star for being a bit too pricey.
