review/summary: A complete and fair reviewreview/text: This space heater has worked flawlessly for the past 2 years. It has never malfunctioned, is pretty durable, and I plan to use it until it quits working. I may have been lucky with the unit I purchased, but it's dependable and I would definetly purchase again. I've read other reviews on Amazon that state Consumer Reports says that it's a safety risk? That is complete and utter nonsense. As long as you use your brain with this heater, and do not store clothes on it or try to have sex with it or anything else, you'll be perfectly fine. If your stupid enough to put any combustible material infront of any space heater, maybe you deserve to lose your house and belongings. If your thinking about purchasing this unit, know this, it has been an awesome purchase for me...
