review/summary: Seems goodreview/text: I've only used this maybe a dozen times, and it's worked great for each application. (Creaming soups in the pan, making a smoothie, etc.)However, I'm a little worried about the cheap plastic piece Cuisinart used for the gear. Is it going to break soon???Many reviewers (and comments on reviews) have shown this to be a problem. :/Bummed I didn't see all the color options before I bought this in silver/grey. I so would have loved this in the turquoise! Oh well.
