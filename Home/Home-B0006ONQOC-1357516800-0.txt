review/summary: Great tasting ice cream!review/text: This Cuisinart Ice-30BC was the hit over Christmas. Bought it for my 12 yr old grandson & I believe after a few times he will be able to make ice cream on his own! We keep the included bowl in the freezer & chill our ingredients, takes about 20-25 minutes & you are ready to eat great what-ever flavored ice cream you desire! He looked up the recipe for birthday cake ice cream after having it at Coldstone Creamery! We all loved it, also made butter pecan before he had to go back home which also was very tasty. It is not as hard as ice cream out of your freezer but more than soft serve! He will be trying many different recipes I'm sure! We loved it. Bowl removes from machine so clean up is a snap. Don't forget to place it back in freezer for next time! We also did not think it was overly loud. We ate dinner while it ran in the background. I would recommend this to all!
