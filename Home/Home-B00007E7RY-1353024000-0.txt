review/summary: Move HUGE amount of air per $, not permanent HEPAreview/text: Best bang for the buck air purifiers, It moves a bunch of air per dollar. Is it the quietest at Max 61.6dba? No, but Medium 55.9 dba and low 48.6 dba still move more air than these smaller slim units though. I run mine on max in an unoccupied room and leave the door open for circulation. The lower settings seem to be fine for room conversations and television. As of November 2012, this item ships without a permanent HEPA. I was always skeptical of the effectiveness of a permanent filter and am willing to pay for a brand new filter every few months anyway. I have 2 of these units now. I gave 4 stars, but it is a 5 star value. I would only give 5 to a unit that moves as much air but is quieter. You probably need one of those high end units for $800 to accomplish that.
