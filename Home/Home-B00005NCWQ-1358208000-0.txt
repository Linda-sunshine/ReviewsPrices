review/summary: 2 design flawsreview/text: On the plus side, it looks better than the picture. It's beautiful! The problem is the inside of the top is curled in, forming a lip that not al the water can get out of, so when you try to dump it, there's always a little water left inside. The pour spout is small and does not have a natural drain construction, so the water cannot all get out that way either. Bottom line is you have to leave it out and disassembled for it to eventually dry. If you have room for that, you're gonna love it.
