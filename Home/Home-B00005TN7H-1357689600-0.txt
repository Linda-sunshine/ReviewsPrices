review/summary: Works as describedreview/text: IF you have a FoodSaver with the accessory hose AND some glass jars that will fit this adapter AND you don't want to keep paying for plastic pouches that are only going to take your money on a ride to the landfill, then you NEED this and the regular mouth jar sealer.It takes about 10 seconds, start to finish, to seal a jar. This will reduce the amount of oxygen in the jar and thus retard spoilage by several months.Combined with a good quality dehydrator (I use an Excaliber, but there are others of similar quality) and readily available glass jars, you can pre-cook / dry / store meals well in advance that will require only re-hydration and warming to prepare.
