review/summary: HOT Waterreview/text: This is great for quick hot water needs - tea, cup of soup, hot cocoa, etc. It's also a waste of water to run the sink until the water gets hot for washing counters or wetting washrags to wash up the kids' faces and things. I heat a few cups of water in a flash and get the job done without having to waste 3 minutes and 3 gallons of water!!
