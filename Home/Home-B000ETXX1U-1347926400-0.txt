review/summary: like sleeping on a hill.review/text: We had a lot of hope for this product and couldn't imagine why it wouldn't work out. Took it on our trip, set it up and everything seemed to be fine until my husband and I went to bed. We were constantly fighting to stay in the bed because there was a huge bump/mound in the middle which kept making us roll off either side of the bed. I just couldn't see paying the obscene amount of money AeroBed wants, but maybe that's why they are so expensive. However, paying close to eighty bucks for this one is pretty obscene since I have no idea who could sleep on it. We tried increasing the air, decreasing the air and nothing worked. Really wish I could take this money and apply it toward an AeroBed. Back to our little camping air mattress that we have to keep pumping air in, but at least we can stay ON the bed.
