review/summary: Not so good!review/text: Well, I got a new coffee maker and they &#34;suggested&#34; the permanenet filter.. So I ordered two (one for reserve).It looks nice and it's handy but.. frankly, the holes in the filter are too big. They don't look big but they let the water thru to quickly and my coffee comes out pretty weak. I compared the taste with the paper filter and with the permanent filter a few times and paper blows it away! I love good coffe and don't like the permanent filter at all. However, it is handy to strain small amounts of veggies at supper time :-)
