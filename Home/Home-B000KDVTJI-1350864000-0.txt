review/summary: Does a decent job, but does not turn off automaticallyreview/text: I bought this kettle instead of a plastic one because I did not want hot water boiling in plastic. However, I was disappointed that this kettle does not automatically turn off and will boil forever if you're not watching it. And as another reviewer noted, keep this out of reach from little fingers as the exterior does become VERY hot. Otherwise, seems to work as described.
