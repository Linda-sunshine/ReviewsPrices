review/summary: Sufficient but LOUDreview/text: I recently purchased this model. This little model is sufficient when it comes to cleaning my small bedroom but LORD is it LOUD.It also has a high-pitched shrill when you place it on low or medium setting. I like that there is a permanent filter and an ionizer in such a small machine but there must be some way you can quiet the motor.
