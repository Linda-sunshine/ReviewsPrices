review/summary: Good for the greensreview/text: I've owned this juicer for about 6 weeks now and have juiced fruits in it and many many vegetables and it has juiced everything that I've fed into it albeit not all with the same effeciency. If you are looking for a juicer to juice leafy greens this is your machine. It will eat through kale, lettuce, spinach with a vengence. The pulp is dry and the juice is good. This machine also shines with harder root vegetables as well like carrots.Where it struggles is with softer fruits and vegetables. I juice a lot of cucumber, however if I don't push through the occasional celery stalk it will start to back up. The same thing occurs with softer fruits. I did try juicing some oranges in it, which it did juice. However I would have been better off cutting the oranges in half and squeezing them into a glass! If you push through some more fibrous stuff while you are juicing the softer fruits and vegetables you won't have any problems.One last thing. This juicer does produce a good amount of pulp. It comes with a strainer which I use while I am juicing. However, because of this it does slow down the process a bit when it becomes clogged. I do though because I don't like much pulp in my vegetable juice. On the plus side it doesn't produce much foam.Regarding setting up and cleaning, it takes very little time. I can have it set up and juicing in under a 30 seconds. While it takes me around 5-7 minutes to clean everything after I have finished.All in all I am very happy with the machine. It seems very sturdy and solidly built and comes with that 10 year warranty which brings a bit of consumer confidence to the table.
