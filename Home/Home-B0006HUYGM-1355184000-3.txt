review/summary: Powerful & Perfect for Small Jobs!review/text: This is a super powerful little vacuum! It's awesome for around baseboards and I even use it on small area rugs when I don't feel like lugging out the big vacuum. I really use this all over the house- in bathrooms, on stairs, on countertops in the kitchen if there are a lot of crumbs. You will not regret purchasing this vacuum & you can't beat the price!
