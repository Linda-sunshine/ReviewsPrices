review/summary: Great Wafflemaker!review/text: Got this three weeks ago and have been making waffles every weekend since then. Makes crispy waffles and the waffles come out cleanly. I just brush the griddle with a little canola oil before making each waffle. Found that seven minutes was just right amount of time to make each waffle.
