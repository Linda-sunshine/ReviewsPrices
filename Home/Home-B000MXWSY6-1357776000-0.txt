review/summary: Pretty solidreview/text: Very durable, doesn't feel cheap. I'm liking it so far and I've had it for a couple month. The radio is passable, but nothing to turn your head at. It's an old school dial for different radio stations, so it can be hard to find your favorite radio stations. Everything else is set up pretty well, and the buzzer alarm is efficient enough to wake up my hard sleeping self. I would definitely recommend this for it's price.
