review/summary: SIMPLY THE BEST!review/text: I have 2 of these blenders in brushed chrome.My first one I took down to my house in Brazil.I have a second and newer one here in America.I originally bought it to mix my protein powder with water. (It clumps if I don't.)I'm vegetarian and I need my protein on a daily basis.The newer version is much better since you can unhook the blades from the body unit to clean it.It's sturdy and super powerful and loaded with possibilities in the kitchen.Turns out my husband became a fan too. He uses it for a myriad of things in his cooking.One hell of a blender!
