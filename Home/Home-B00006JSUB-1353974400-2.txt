review/summary: Forgiving to cast iron novicesreview/text: I had never used cast iron before, but I heard it was great for anemics and people that want to avoid the chemicals in nonstick pans. I have overcooked things in it, washed it incorrectly, and generally made every mistake in the book at some point. Every time I re-season it looks as good as new.When I first received it, I washed the pre-seasoning off and re-seasoned it with with grapeseed oil. Then I cooked fatty meats in it for the first several times I used it. I made sure to preheat it to avoid sticking. When I got some burnt on food, I scraped it off and washed it as normal. I should have cleaned the pan by boiling some water in it to loosen the remaining food. The soap had removed the seasoning, but the pan was fine and was easy to season again.It is a healthy choice and helps support American jobs.
