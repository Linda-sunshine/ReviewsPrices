review/summary: Not what I expectedreview/text: I originally ordered this as somewhat of a replacement to an old Honeywell tower fan/air purifier. The unit had stopped working and I just wanted something small and not too expensive to move the air around a bit and filter some dust. Easy, yeah?Upon opening the box, this unit looked solid. Plugged it in, turned it on and it played for me the song of its people: CLACK CLACK CLACK... This product was assembled poorly/something crucial was missed during the Quality Assurance steps. I ended up taking it apart to see what was wrong. Turns out some of the internal wires were touching the moving fan blades. This was creating the loud &#34;clacking&#34; type of sound when the product was turned on.Let me reiterate: internal wires were touching somewhat high-speed fan blades.Once I taped the wires together using black electric tape and secured them to the interior of the device, away from moving parts, the product worked, but was exceptionally loud for its size.I recommend this product to:- headache lovers- potential fire hazard collectors- tinkerers with some money to burn- someone conducting a study on horrible QA practices.tl;dr - I had to fix a brand new item for it to work properly. horrible. not worth it.
