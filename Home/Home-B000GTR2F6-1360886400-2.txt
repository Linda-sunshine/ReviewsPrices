review/summary: Model upgraded by Keurig to B75review/text: The Keurig B70 Platinum Brewing System I got yesterday came with a note in the box saying Keurig had upgrade it to Model B75, which now INCLUDES the Keurig Water Filter Starter Kit. So, if you planning on using the water filter kit, you no longer have to order it. Use the money instead to order some replacement filters.... Amazon, as always, was very helpful in getting me a return for the filter kit I no longer needed, but I had to call them - this situation isn't covered using their website's "Return" process.
