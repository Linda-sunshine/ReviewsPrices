review/summary: Rip Off - they're all cloggedreview/text: This really makes me angry. These filters are like flushing money down the toilet. Only the very top filter holes work or else they are used with a lousy refurbish job. I tolerated the first one far too long, then put in a new one and it didn't work after about two fills. I still have one left but can assume by the first two that it's useless too. Now I cannot return them because it's been too long since I purchased.My advice: buy your filters from a bricks and mortar store where you can be assured they're new!
