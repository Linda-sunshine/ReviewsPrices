review/summary: Nine great weeks then it started leaking...review/text: There are so many positive reviews on this kettle, I thought it would be fool proof. Such was not the case for me. I've loved this kettle up until a few days ago when I realized that water was leaking out the bottom of the handle and collecting around the electrical base. Amazon's policy states it can't replace or return the item after four weeks. It's been about nine weeks. Electric kettles should last longer than that, no? And Amazon should stand behind their products. Period.
