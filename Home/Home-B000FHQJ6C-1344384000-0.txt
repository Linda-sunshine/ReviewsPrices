review/summary: Pooped Outreview/text: I bought this product in April 2012 and as of August 2012 it no longer works. The motor will not turn properly to grind the fruit and veggies. I am very disappointed. Also, it states that you can fit whole fruits in the "Big Mouth" and that is untrue. I have had to cut my apples in fours to place them in and I do not buy large apples. You get what you pay for and it's probably better to purchase one of the more expensive well-known juicers out there!
