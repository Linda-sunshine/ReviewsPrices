review/summary: Quality dual alarm!review/text: As usual, Amazon comes through with a great value on this alarm. I don't use the radio at all. The alarm wakes me without too loud a ringer. i need two alarms to wake up a few hours after I go to sleep to check my blood sugar (diabetic) and to wake up in the morning. Everything I would expect is featured on this unit.
