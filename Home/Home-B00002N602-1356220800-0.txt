review/summary: My favorite kitchen appliancereview/text: This is my first pressure cooker, after doing some research, I bought it, and so happy I did. I've been using for few weeks now for daily cooking (chicken, fish, clams, meat etc..)- It's easy to use. Make sure to follow the instruction, especially for the first time use.- Easy to clean.- Cut my daily times needed to cook!! --&#62; chicken in 8 mins?? Wish I knew this product earlier.- Good price for the qualityReally recommended for everyone!
