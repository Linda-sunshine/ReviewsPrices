review/summary: Great for stairs.review/text: My husband and I have two kitty's one is long haired. Needless to say we have stairs that kitty likes to lay on and leaves his hair on. When this happens I just whip out my Eureka and in 5 min. my stair way is clean once more and the bonus...my back isn't hurting from lugging the full size sweeper up and down the stairs.
