review/summary: Most comfortable memory foam ever!review/text: Unfortunately, I've had four spine surgeries. Because of those surgeries and my continuous chronic pain, I've been searching high and low for the right bed. Well, I found the perfect memory foam bed for me, but I wanted just a little more &#34;plush&#34; feeling, which this topper provides. Honestly, I was expecting it to be pretty cheap feeling for the price and smell terrible like memory foam does, but when I received it, I found it to be the highest quality feeling and density foam I've ever felt, and boy, it honestly smelled SO good. It's infused with green tea to remove the horrible foam smell, which will fade with time. I wish it wouldn't. Well, maybe it's better now that I think of it as I'd like to eat my memory foam topper it smells so good. Don't hesitate. Buy it. Trust me. I don't say that unless I mean it. It's worth every penny.
