review/summary: Great humidifierreview/text: Just added number four (two penguins and two elephants). Before these, tried warm mist and wick humidifiers. These seem to be the best choice so far without spending $300+ on whole house humidifier (with installation). These are cool, quiet, portable, and reasonably priced. Going through the models over the years, Crane company is making definitive design improvements.
