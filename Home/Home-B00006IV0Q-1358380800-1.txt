review/summary: Presto 6 Cup Percolatorreview/text: Overall I really like the percolator. The exterior is great looking and it brews a good cup of coffee. I would rate it a 5, except for the basket and cover. These two pieces have a cheap look and feel - it is hard to believe they are stainless steel. The coffee pot is quite tall and narrow making it a little move difficult to put in the coffee than if it were bigger in circumference. I use a filter in the basket and the coffee has a good taste and it is hot.El
