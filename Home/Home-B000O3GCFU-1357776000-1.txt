review/summary: Great for preschoolreview/text: Our 2 daughters use these for preschool. I've had other Foogo products in the past which have missed the mark. No problems with the Foogo Thermos, it works great. We put hot things in the Thermos, then inside an insulated bag. A few hours later everything is still warm. It's great to have the option of giving the girls some warm soups and things for lunch.My only negative is that I've noticed that water can get trapped in the pink plastic base. I turn it upside down to let it drip out but I feel that some is still stuck in there. Not sure if this would cause any moldy issues under the base. Not even sure if it would be an issue or not.
