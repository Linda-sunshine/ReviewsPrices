review/summary: SOOOO SOFT!!!review/text: These are so soft I actually told my husband after slipping into them for the first time that they felt like the inside of a teddy bear... There was some slight pilling after the first few washes but it has definitely decreased each time. It doesn't really bug me especially since they are just so soft!!! I will definitely be ordering more in the future! Order and enjoy!!
