review/summary: Love it, made a great gift!review/text: This is the first immersion blender we have ever owned and we are in love with it. I purchased it as a gift for my fiance. He uses it to create blended soups and sauces in a jiffy. It's super easy to use and a breeze to clean. As soon as we are done blending, we wash the bottom half, dry it and put the whole rig back in the cabinet. I bought it last year and it's still going strong, no issues. Would definitely purchase again.
