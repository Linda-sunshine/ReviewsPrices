review/summary: Nice kettle!review/text: I have owned this kettle for several months and give it a very high recommendation. we used it at least two times a day and it works perfectly. it is a little hot as it contains boiling water. but it won't hurt if you were careful and keep it out reach of children. I like the fact that almost all of the material which the water contacts is stainless steel except the sight tube .It boils water very very quickly! There is also a power-indicator light and water-level indicator gauge which are both handy, what made me most satisfied is the auto shut-off function ,once the water comes to a boil,it shut off automatically !
