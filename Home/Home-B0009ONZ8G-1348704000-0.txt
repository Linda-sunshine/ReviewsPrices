review/summary: Not greatreview/text: This vacuum has a hose that fits into a hole when not in use. To keep it in the hole, I have to really push it in otherwise it pops out while I am vacuuming. Pushing it in makes it very difficult to pull out when I need it. This is a very bad design. The hose also came smashed but amazon gave me a partial refund. The vacuum is made of plastic and seems cheap. We'll see how long it lasts.
