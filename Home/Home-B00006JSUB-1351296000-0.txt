review/summary: good for cast ironreview/text: This is the first cast iron pan I have purchased. I bought it to replace one of my non-stick pans when it started peeling it's non-stick coating, but I'm finding that this pan mostly sits in my cabinet because I don't feel like hefting it out or cleaning it properly. I think it's good for a cast iron pan, but if I had it to do over again I would buy another non-stick of some kind instead. I have used it a few times...I like being able to put it straight into the oven from the stove top, and it cleans pretty well but certainly not as well as a non-stick pan.
