review/summary: Does it's jobreview/text: This item works just fine. It is supposed to hold 20 ties, but for thicker ties I would suggest you only fit 10 (1 tie on every other hook), unless you don't mind cramming them on there. For the price this was a steal (it was about a dollar). It saves space and gives my closet a more organized look.
