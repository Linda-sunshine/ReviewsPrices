review/summary: returningreview/text: Bought this set from the Costco liking price/ to feature, however:- serious issue with the uneven bottom for the largest skillet after using just few times(for sure the problem is with the skillet since I have ceramic burner);- issue with sticking: difficult to clean;- also cut my finger deep while washing the pan against it's sharp and narrow edge.Very disappointed and returning after 3 mos of use.
