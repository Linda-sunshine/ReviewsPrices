review/summary: it delivers!review/text: What I likedIt makes super Belgian waffles. The first time I used it I brushed with oil and forgot to oil again for the next two waffles, but they all popped out by just lifting with my fingers. I didn't find the handle so hot I needed a pot holder. Using the company's "weekend waffles" recipe I timed them to 5 minutes and they all came out fluffy on the inside and evenly crispy on the outside. The guide suggests 3/4 cup of batter but I found that it needed a bit more to make a waffle without holes in one of the quarters. It wiped out easily since nothing stuck to it. I liked the upright storage.What I didn't likeThe downside for me is that the light isn't bright enough in my bright kitchen to see without shading it with my hand. Also, because the light goes off in about 3 minutes and there is no settings knob, I need to set a timer for my preferred 5 minutes. The cord is too short -- barely long enough to stretch from the counter to the plug directly above, below the upper cabinets. Since the taut cord got in the way of the open lid, I had to put a box under the waffle maker.
