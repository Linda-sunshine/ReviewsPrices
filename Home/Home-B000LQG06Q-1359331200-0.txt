review/summary: Can't sleep without itreview/text: We have a king size bed that is drooping in the middle a little bit. I bought this as a christmas gift for my girlfriend and now I don't think we can live without it. Feels like we're floating when we're laying it. Obviously with this much foam it requires a little extra effort to get in and out of bed but it's worth it.
