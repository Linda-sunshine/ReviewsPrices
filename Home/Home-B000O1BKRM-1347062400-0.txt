review/summary: Holds odor of foodreview/text: I bought these to freeze portions of my son's baby food and cubes of pesto. I love the shape of the cubes and how easy they are to pop out, but hate that the material holds onto the smell of garlic or other pungent smells. I tried soaking them in white vinegar and freezing water, etc to remove the odors, but nothing works.
