review/summary: Carmenreview/text: Works great! I'm not a baker, but this makes it easy. I used it to bake a meatloaf and nothing stuck! I baked meatballs on it and they browned evenly and slid right off. I made oven fried chicken on it and it was crunch, brown, and slid right off! It fits perfectly in my Corning ware roaster. It's a winner!!!
