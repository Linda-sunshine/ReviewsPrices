review/summary: Giving It Another Tryreview/text: I got a Keurig about 3 years ago. It died after two years. I was devastated. This was the best coffee maker I had ever had! I hedged on buying another one and over the past year have tried two other coffeemakers. The first one was a Hamilton-Beach that leaked and had an awkward bucket for water. The one I have now is a Cuisinart which works great, but I end up wasting more coffee because some days we don't drink as much as we make, plus I hate the measuring of the coffee and water. And then there is the time it takes to brew, on rushed mornings I would just forget it and buy it on my way to work. My Keurig had me spoiled.So today, I broke down and ordered a new one. I am hoping that this one lasts longer. I am the only person I know that has ever had a problem, so I am will to give it another try. Hoping my last one was just a fluke and I am looking forward to my morning cup of coffee at home again!
