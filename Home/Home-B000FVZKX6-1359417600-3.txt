review/summary: Love thesereview/text: I have owned many sets of flannel sheets. Use to buy landsend on sale but they don't seem to have the sales they use to have. The quality doesn't seem to be what it once was. I started looking elsewhere and found these. I am not fussy about the colors and bought cream. I washed them before using them and cleaned the drier vent about 3 times. I have had no problem with pilling. I have probably washed them 4 or 5 times and they are great. No complaints at all except I do wish the pillow cases where a little wider.
