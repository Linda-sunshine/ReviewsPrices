review/summary: Good looking ice makes drink more appealingreview/text: I've only gone through the trays twice, but I already love these cubes. They are bigger than normal cubes and seem to stay frozen a lot longer. More importantly (for me and I'd assume most people looking at these) they look great. Theres something about perfect ice that makes a glass of iced tea just look better.A lot of people have commented on the off flavor that these can provide. I agree in that when I received my package they didn't smell the freshest. They definitely had some kind of lubricant from the manufacturing process on them. I rinsed them with blue dawn and then let them soak with some dilute vinegar solution (roughly 1:10 vinegar:water). I used apple cider vinegar because its what I had on hand. After a 10 minute soak and a quick rinse the tray had no discernible off odor and the cubes came out tasting like regular ice.I'd also heard that the cubes were difficult to remove, but I didn't have quite that experience. They don't fall out of the tray like an old school plastic tray, but I think thats done on purpose a bit. If you're going to take the time to make perfectly shaped cubes would you want to let them tumble out and chip corners off? A little push up on the bottom of each cube gets it out far enough that I can grab it and lift it out and the mold snaps right back to shape. It does take a second or two to remove each cube but that adds up to maybe 45 seconds for the entire tray? In short is not that big of a hassle.Overall I'd say these are as close to perfect as you're going to get especially if you fixate on making pretty drinks. The cubes are not only functional, but look amazing and to me thats well worth a quick vinegar rinse and a few extra seconds to take them out of the tray.
