review/summary: Why did I wait so long?review/text: I have 3 handheld vacs. All 3 are basically worthless. I have been eyeing this vac for a while because of the reviews. I finally decided to order.This is the best handheld vac. It has more sucking power than my other 3 combined. The brush motor is powerful. The super long cord is great. The detachable hose is nice but a bit short. The filter is easily removed, cleaned and replaced. Yes, as some reviewers noted, it is a bit heavy but I attribute the weight being related to the quality build.I got the mini accessory kit and it makes a big difference. The Walmart price for the mini kit is 2.5x the Amazon price, almost $13. I also purchased 2 extra filters. I suggest the filters made for the unit, not the knockoff brand. Mine fit perfectly.I regret waiting so long to purchase this item. Unless it breaks down in the next 6 months, this will be one of my top 10 best purchases from Amazon. Now I can remove my ShopVac from the kitchen.
