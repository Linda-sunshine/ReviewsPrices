review/summary: Simple but effectivereview/text: I bought this two years ago for my dorm room and I have been using it since. It is perfect for a dorm room (and doesn't set off smoke alarms, for any freshmen who have the same worry that I did), and if you're creative you learn how many meals you can really make with boiling water when you don't have access to a kitchen.It's easy to clean residue by boiling diluted vinegar in a well-aerated area. I do this a few times a year.
