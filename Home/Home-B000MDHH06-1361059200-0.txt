review/summary: Great juicerreview/text: It's a great juicer. We use it all the time and love it. The only drawback is if you put the blade in the dishwasher, it turns it a dark brown color. Also, with other juicers you can put a bag to catch the fiber for easy clean-up. This one it's not possible. It's still super easy to clean though and very powerful. Once you get used to a juicing routine, it's great!
