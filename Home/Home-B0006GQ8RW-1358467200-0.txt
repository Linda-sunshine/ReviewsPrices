review/summary: Brita 42432 Replacement Filters,4 packreview/text: If you are buying replacement filters ,you really already know how good these work. These filters would make swamp water taste good...but I use mine in Louisiana where the city water ,while safe to drink, has been used by all the people up-stream and I feel better PLUS the water tastes so much better with my Brita Pitcher and these replacement filters.I even gave one to my good friend Bubba,who drinks water dipped from the lake...and with this filter ,he says ,the water tastes good and he doesn't get bugs or sticks in his teeth. Now that is a good thing.
