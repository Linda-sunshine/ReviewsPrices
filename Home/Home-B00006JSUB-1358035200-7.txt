review/summary: What a great idea....an iron skillet.review/text: Gee....all things seem to come back in style and this is a great example of one that should. Well seasoned, I put a little oil in it, let it heat up and made a whole breakfast from potatoes, grilled tomatoes and of course eggs. It worked great, no sticking, potatoes turned nice and brown, eggs perfect all on medium heat.Then the test.....clean up. Took a damp dish rag and wiped it out, No muss no fuss. Added a little oil to coat it again while still warm and it was ready for the next breakfast. Now 40 breakfasts later....each better than the next.I just love it and do not have to worry about non-stick coating health hazards.Just to show you new is not always better. With proper care this should last a lifetime or three.Do your self a favor and get one. Great price and value. Just remember do as the direction state, Do not wash in the dishwater or soak in the sink. Clean immediately after cooking and just coat with a little oil for the next one.
