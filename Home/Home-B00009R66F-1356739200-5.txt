review/summary: Great purchase for a great price!review/text: So far I've used this twice and it does really well at cleaning up! I had pet stains on my apartment carpet that I was convinced would need some pretty heavy duty stuff to get out. One of the stains I literally saw being sucked up as I was moving over it for the wet swipe. I also had some darker spots that I guess were a combination of pet issues and dirt and they came right up.The canisters are a little small and you do have to refil and empty often, but it's not so ridiculous that I'm going to send it back by any means. It's a 'non-professional' carpet cleaner...I didn't expect huge capacity magic, but I'm very pleased with this cleaner.
