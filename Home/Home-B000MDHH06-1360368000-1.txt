review/summary: LOVE ITreview/text: Great juicer... first juicer i bought and its super easy to clean low watts so its very easy to use with a converter (im stationed in Germany) it has a good size feeding tube so u dont have to do a lot of chopping half apples go in fine. Best part is the cleaning is super easy and its a great juicer.
