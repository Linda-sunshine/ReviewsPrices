review/summary: Looking forward to getting into bedreview/text: Bed is a good place to be when you're tired, sick or just need to take a break from the world. These sheets add to the allure of wanting to jump into bed. I'm sooooooo comfortable in these sheets. They keep me warm and snuggley :-) I would buy again and will probably collect a couple of other colors. Only time will tell how long they last. I recommend the buy despite not knowing the longevity. Surely they will last a few years and for this price it's worth it to have these a few winter seasons.
