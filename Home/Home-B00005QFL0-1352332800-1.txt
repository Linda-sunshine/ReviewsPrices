review/summary: Great purchase!review/text: I purchased this bread maker so that I could make my own gluten free bread. It is awesome! Very easy to use and clean. There are no gluten free recipes in the enclosed recipe booklet but I have used the mixes and then a mix of my own. Works great either way. Has several settings to use and it is easy to switch between them. Excellent product.
