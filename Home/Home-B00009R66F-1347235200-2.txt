review/summary: Got the job done!review/text: I ordered the Hoover SteamVac after our new dog had accidents on just about every area rug in the house. It worked well, although I found it necessary to flip the rugs over and clean both sides before the stain and odor problem became unnoticable. The only downside, besides the fact that the dirty water container does need frequent emptying as others have mentioned, is that the Hoover SteamVac sucks up the ends of the smaller, lighter rugs, making it necessary for fasten the ends down (my husband stood on the ends)in order to clean the entire rug from end to end. I would imagine this to be true with any push steamvac cleaner, so it's not a problem particular to this model, just something to be aware of if you plan to clean smaller, thinner rugs.
