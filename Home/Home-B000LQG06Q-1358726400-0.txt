review/summary: Just as I remembered it.review/text: Bought one in 2010 for another bed. Loved it. Haven't had it for the last 7 months. Just bought another one and I can't believe I waited so long! The only difference (and reason it didn't get 5 stars) is that this one has a very potent minty smell. I had it outside for at least 6 hours before I put it on the bed, but every time I shift, I can smell it. I sure hope it fades soon. Otherwise, it seems the same as the other. Highly recommended.
