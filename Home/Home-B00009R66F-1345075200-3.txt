review/summary: Hoover does not stand by their 1 year warranty.review/text: In fairness to Hoover their SteamVac Carpet Cleaner works well if you follow their directions. What I did not expect was to find out the weight of the machine relies on a very small piece of plastic to disengage the foot locking peddle. The second time that I used mySteamVac the weight of the machine snapped off the plastic stop that is part of the body of the unit. Hoover asked for a photograph which was provided and they said they would not honor that broken part as part of the warranty. They gave me a phone number to contact an outside repair facility to purchase a new main body for the cleaner. The part is not available on the Hoover web site. The weight of the machine when it is loaded with the liquid cleaner is considerably more than the part that locks the handle in the upright position. Bottom line be VERY carful when you use the cleaner so as not to put pressure on that small part.
