review/summary: fabulous valuereview/text: Once you've slept on high quality sheets, you never want to go back. Over the years I've paid hundreds for sets and considered them worth every penny, as they grew softer, silkier, and cooler with every wash. When I saw this set, I thought it might be too good to be true, especially given the widely contrasting reviews. Personally, I was thrilled with the sheets after the very first wash. Now, I've had them almost a year, and I love them even more. They're wonderfully indulgent and soothing to slip into at night or for a nap. They really do get better with every wash. They're very durable - I see no thin spots and have had no pilling whatsoever. Though this set is still in great condition, I'm considering buying another set to stash away just in case these stop being available on Amazon.
