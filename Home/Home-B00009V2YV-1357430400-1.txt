review/summary: Works wellreview/text: It's ability to block alerts that do not affect me was the primary reason I upgraded from my old unit. No more getting awakened with alerts for things that will never happen in my neighborhood. (flood watches mostly).A few cons: 1. The clock is not very accurate and has to be set forward 2-3 minutes a month. 2. There is no indication whether you are or are not on AC power. If the plug gets knocked out for any reason, you won't know it until you get the low battery warning when it is almost dead. 3. Weather tuner is OK but FM radio tuner is mediocre. Stronger stations will clobber weaker ones as much as 300 kHz in either direction.
