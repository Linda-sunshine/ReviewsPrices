review/summary: degraded quality in almost any way you review itreview/text: I see all of these glowing reviews and I'm shocked.- The water reservoir is a small 3 square inch triangle at the back of the machine. I've managed to pour most of my water into it, at 5:30 AM, but it it takes some concentration- Speaking of which, I once spilled water into my ground beans and saw it start to drip onto the hot plate. Why you ask? The cone that holds the basket doesn't seal well (it sits through gravity, it is not fastened in anyway), so water leaks through it even during brew- The water goes in the back, so I have to pull the darn thing waayyy out from under cabinets to fill it (the cabinets block the lid from opening all the way)- The hot plate is too hot and degrades the coffee substantially after 50 minutes- The hot water isn't hot enough at the brew point, so the coffee just sucks (nothing like diluting it further through the water leakage)- The basket is big enough for a mid-western coffee drinker. If you brew 12 cups of coffee with a few tablespoons, you'll be OK, but if you actually brew strong coffee, you have to remove the basket and use paper filters to fit enough grinds in. Even then, I can only brew 6 cups at a time (I'm a Philz coffee lover, and in a pinch I'll suffer with Peets)- The lid leaks water when you open it - all the time- The lid gets caked with ground coffee, and this leaks into the water reservoir- Because of the above, the water filter clogs quicklyThe maker itself is attractive and has all of the bells and whistles. It's just too bad it's all style and no substance. If you don't drink a lot of coffee, but entertain a lot, and need something nice sitting on your counter, you found what you're looking for. If you're an elitist snob, who lives according to Ditka, "coffee is the lifeblood that fuels the dreams of champions" (see Kicking and Screaming), then this coffee maker is a shameless rip off. I'm so put off by it, I won't buy another Cuisinart product ever (thankfully I already have thee food processor, so I can stick to this)
