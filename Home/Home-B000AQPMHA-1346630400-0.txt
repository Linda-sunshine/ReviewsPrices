review/summary: Love this coffee maker!review/text: We received a Keurig for our wedding and we absolutely love it and so does all of our house guests! My husband's younger brother went off to college and we surprised him with this as a graduation/going away gift. He loved it! Highly recommend to anyone who loves good coffee, teas, iced tea or iced coffee. Only drawback is that the k-cups are pricey, so if you drink a half a pot or pot of coffee a day, this isn't the machine for you - it would cost a small fortune. For us, we fill up a to-go cup in the morning, and we are set. It's fast, easy, no clean up, and you get to have a variety of coffee or teas at a moment's notice.
