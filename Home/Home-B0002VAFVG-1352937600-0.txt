review/summary: Fantastic Breville, I upgraded to the 1000 Wattreview/text: I had one of the $159.00 models for 7 years it was okay, got to the point I could only load one carrot at a time, it was just too much for it. So I bought the expensive high grade version and I'm very please. It's motor is powerful, it has two settings, low for herbs to extract more from them, and high for the bulkier items. I really enjoy the off button and the ever convenient finger holed plug. If I can attach photos I will, I'm not seeing that option here yet, let me explore. I also bought "Aquasana" bottles from amazon, they have an airtight lid so I can juice ahead and put it in the refrigerator. The clean up on this model is even easier then and lower priced plastic models because the stainless steel rinses off so nicely. Only takes seconds in the sink with the spray nozzle. Thank-You Breville. So Very Much for making my juicing experience so easy. And kudos to Amazon for Prime delivery! So FAST! I highly recommend this model. I did read all the reviews. But purchased anyway and I'm so happy I did. Well I tried to upload a photo hoping I could get it in where the video upload is, but no way. I have a wonderful photo of all the juice and the aquasana bottles all filled up. Sorry.
