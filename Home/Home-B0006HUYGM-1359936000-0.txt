review/summary: okay for the pricereview/text: i've got this because of high rating, but it didn't meet my expectation. The suction is good and the collected dusts can be easily removed, but it's got weak edge and it can not do what cordless smaller area hand held vacuum cleaners can do. I did not get the cordless because the cordless is too weak or expensive or the batteries die too short. it's heavier than other hand held and cord really is on the way to use in your car...
