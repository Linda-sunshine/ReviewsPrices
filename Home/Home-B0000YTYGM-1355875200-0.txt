review/summary: Broken switch in 6 monthsreview/text: Today is December 19 and this coffee maker arrived June 11- almost exactly 6 months. Now the on-off switch appears to be broken and one must stand by it to keep turning it back on in order to get a full pot of coffee. Need a new one and it won't be THIS one! We liked it while it worked!
