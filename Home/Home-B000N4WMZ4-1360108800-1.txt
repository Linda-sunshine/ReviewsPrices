review/summary: Love thisreview/text: enameled cast iron should be in everyone's kitchen. This arrived perfectly wrapped against chipping. The blue is beautiful. The heavy, even heat of this is what's great. It cleans up easily, too. I now have this 6-qt and a 3 qt. That's all I need. The price is very reasonable for this type of cookware. Lodge is made in USA, too.
