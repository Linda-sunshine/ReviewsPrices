review/summary: BEWARE OF STATIC ELACTRICITYreview/text: The product is good and as described by many other customers, it feels perfect on bed. The pillow can curl around my head to maximize the contact area and there is no pain after sleep.The only problem is, as I just discovered a few days ago, the pillow causes static electricity. I think you can see sparkles at night if you scrub it. I know static electricity is not good for human body, so I am not sure if I should use it anymore.I hope the producer can give an evaluation on the effect of the static electricity the pillow causes on human health. Before that, I won't recommend this product.
