review/summary: good little humidifierreview/text: I bought this for many reasons. I love Hello Kitty, good price and good ratings on this brand of humidifiers. Ive been using it now for about 3 days and runs so quiet! I dont even notice it in my room. It also has a built in night light on the humidifier that lights up the pink tank perfectly and isnt overly bright!. The vapor comes out of her ears and everything breaks down pretty easily for refilling or cleaning :). Im 25 year old female and love this product and would recommend it.
