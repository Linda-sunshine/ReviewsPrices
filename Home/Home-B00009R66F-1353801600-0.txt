review/summary: Great for a whilereview/text: This is great product while it works. I bought it on Amazon. Arrived fine. But everything is plastic and pieces and parts starting breaking within the first 6 months. I've had it about a year now and the the plastic piece that connects the brush to the machine broke off. Now $30+ for a part. The brushes are fine but will not turn without the small piece of plastic that goes from the brush to the machine. Definitely not built to last long. I've only used it about 10 times.I had a Bissel for years before and think I'll go back. Got the Hoover for the mult-attachments.Donna H
