review/summary: What a cast iron pan should be.review/text: The only reason I didn't give this thing 5 stars is because 1) it doesn't come with the lid and 2) I noticed that it doesn't tend to diffuse heat very well. Obviously, it's not an all clad copper core pan, but I would have expected pancakes to at least cook up more evenly than they did. Eggs are great in it. Couldn't wait to make chicken pot pie in it. All in all, I'm extremely happy with it. It's solid, well made and it does perform well.
