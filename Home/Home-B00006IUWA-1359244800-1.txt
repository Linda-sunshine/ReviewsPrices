review/summary: Loving it!review/text: We've tried several popcorn makers and this one is definitely the one to get. It's very sturdy and makes great popcorn. There are decent amount of kernels left when it's done but overall it's very quality built and produces a good yield. The kids enjoy watching it pop as well. Can't miss on this one.
