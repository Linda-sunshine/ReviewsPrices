review/summary: Pizzazz is right!review/text: I had wanted this since it first came out years ago but kept pulling back. Finally got it & I must say it's everything & more than I'd hoped for. I absolutely adore pizza, all kinds. Frozen are obviously the easiest & often the most economical, but they lack what you want from a really good pizza. With this oven I get the crust just the way I want it & I always add extra cheese. In a regular oven it's very difficult to get the crust & the extra cheese cooked right. This does it effortlessly. Made the best home cooked pizza with a ready made crust & tons of toppings & cheese, it was superb!Haven't ordered a pizza since I got this several months ago, it'll be a long time before I do. Already paid for itself. Clean up is really easy & cools down quickly for storage. Would recommend it for any & all pizza lovers.
