review/summary: DON'T buy this mattress!!!!review/text: I bought this mattress after I read hundreds of reviews on consumer reports and amazon reviews. I ignored the bad reviews of deflation because of the overwhelming amount of good reviews. I've been using this mattress for 7 days before I can go back to my hometown to get my ACTUAL bed and low a behold, I come home to a massive LEAK and HOLE in the SEAM!!! This product is seriously defective!! A hole in the seam! Come on! You spend $100 thinking you'll get something that will last, and it should!! Seriously please don't buy this product. Just imagine having to get up every 3 hours to reinflate it because you wake up with your butt on the ground. There is definitely a better, probably cheaper mattress out there that actually holds up.
