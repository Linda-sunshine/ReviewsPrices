review/summary: Easy new way to prep my veggiesreview/text: The World Cuisine spiralizer has become my favorite kitchen tool. Veggie preparation has never been easier. I am a Celiac, so pasta is not an option. I use it to cut cucumbers for salads, zuccini for "spaghetti" (season it, but just heat it a little - the texture is great!), yellow squash to briefly saute, etc. Tonight I am going to try baking sweet potato "noodles".The handle is a bit useless, but for the most part, the design is functional and cleaned very easily. I LOVE it!
