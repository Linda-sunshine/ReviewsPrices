review/summary: Who sells queen size sheets with only regular size pillow cases? Pinzon. That's who.review/text: These sheets are wonderful. They are heavy duty and completely comfortable. But with no option to buy actual queen size pillow cases (I have never seen queen sheet sets with only standard size pillow cases before), its 4 stars from me. The cases that come with the sheets are almost long enough, but not quite. add 6" of length to each pillowcase and you would have a genuine 5 star product. The king size sheets come with king size pillow cases...It is a shame the company has not rectified this after 6+ years of making them and seeing the reviews.
