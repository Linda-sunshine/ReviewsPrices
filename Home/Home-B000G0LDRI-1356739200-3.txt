review/summary: Extremely LOUD!review/text: I don't understand why it's called QuietCare when in fact it is so loud that in a downstairs location I can hear it running in an upstairs bedroom with a TV on. Forget it if you think your going to place this anywhere near your bed. It sounds like a huge old box fan running. If it were not for the horrible loud noise I would have kept it. I am returning to amazon and will keep looking for a quiet humidifier.
