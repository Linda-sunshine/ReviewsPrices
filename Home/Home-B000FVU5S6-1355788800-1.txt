review/summary: Horribly scratchy fabricreview/text: I've washed these sheets more than 10 times and they are only now tolerably unscratchy. At first the smell of the sheets is quite overwhelming (2-3 washes to get rid of) but then trying to sleep on the sheets is a nightmare. After 10 washes and a significant amount of fabric softener, they are at least usable, though I still find myself waking up on the couch after a restless night in these sheets.
