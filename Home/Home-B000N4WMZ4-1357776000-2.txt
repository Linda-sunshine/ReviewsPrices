review/summary: Great Dutch Oven!review/text: I have a cast iron Dutch Oven and prefer this over that one immensely! The cast iron is too heavy and not nice to look at. This red one is an attractive piece of equipment, it's super sturdy and does a great job with equally distributing heat. It holds a decent amount of food as well (prepared a big batch of chili in this recently and it was perfect). The Dutch Oven is also a breeze to clean as well! Highly recommend.
