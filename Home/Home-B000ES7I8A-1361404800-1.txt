review/summary: With a caveatreview/text: I bought this kettle in 2007 from a big box store when I moved here from the UK. I love it and it still works as well as it did 6 years ago. No fuss, no muss.However, when I ordered this item for my SIL this holiday season, hers was one of the cursed kettles that spills everywhere when she pours it with the lid closed. We had to return it to Amazon (a very easy and pain-free endeavor). Obviously there has been a slight design change between 2007 and 2012 such that these kettles now spill when water is poured with the lid closed. I have no such problem with mine. I am speculating here, but it may be due to a small, sharp pouring lip on mine that the more recent ones lack.
