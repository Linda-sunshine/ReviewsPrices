review/summary: As expected, a superlative Cooker/Cannerreview/text: I have no hesitation in giving this pressure cooker all the stars. You might be tempted to drop one because it is heavy, requires manual clamping and perhaps does not have some of the gee whizz functions; it doesn't have a logic board. You would be wrong to do so. This piece of equipment does what it says it will do, does what we intend it to do, does what it needs to do and does it all in superlative fashion.It is solid, feels like it will last forever, works as it should, has the ring of quality yet, it is simple, wouldn't be easily broken, doesn't have added idle things for looks, has multiple levels of safety, has no consumables but replacement components are readily available and still it looks great.A glance at some other pressure cooker canners show that the price of this is a little higher but then look at the price of some of the smart looking electronic small consumer pressure cookers (which cannot be tasked in the way this can) and you will find prices actually higher, some much higher. This is seems good value to me.Had better put a rider on all this. I have only had the All American 921 for a few weeks and only used it for 6 batches of jams, sauces and pickles along with a few trial pressure cooking exercises but that does not deter me from giving it a rave review. In each of those exercises it worked exactly as expected with terrific result that I know will be consistent. If you keep an eye on this AND the clock while it is working the result will be right.Not normally a strong supporter of the 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' approach and while not suggesting that there have not been changes through the life of this product, it certainly is a good advertisement for staying close to what you do well.
