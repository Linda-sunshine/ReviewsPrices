review/summary: Worth the price at $80review/text: Great gift for Christmas coming up for any college dorm ( the twin version of course). This mattress pad came in a big, brown box, wrapped in plastic very tightly. After rolling it out on my air mattress, the smell of peppermint was everywhere! Sadly, after about a week of use, the smell disapated. Anyways, after streching it slightly the corners overlayed nicely in the mattress surface and after a couple months of use, it's still the same as the first day I used it. If it's still worth $80 and you could use one of these, I'd suggest it for you.
