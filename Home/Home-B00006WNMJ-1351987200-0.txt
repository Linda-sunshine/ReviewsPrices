review/summary: Been using for three yearsreview/text: I switch the kitchen sink one every three months (its just me here) and bathroom one every six. Love not having any chlorine smell in the water and it tastes great. Read reviews on other filters and they said that the plastic housing breaks, well never had any problem with the Culligan. The only thing they could do to make this product better is to make the filters recyclable!
