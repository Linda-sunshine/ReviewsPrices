review/summary: You will need to label the dialreview/text: This heater is lightweight but not so light that I am concerned about it tipping over. It gives a great focused heat to warm up one person while watching TV or using the computer. The dial does not have markings that you can see from the front. We fixed this with Sharpies: black for the arrow mark on the heater and the off marks on the dial, red for 800 and green for 400. I would recommend this because it is otherwise hard to know if the heater is really off and we had it on by mistake for three days while we were gone.
