review/summary: Light weight vacumereview/text: Bought this on line. It looks bigger in the picture than it really is. When I first opened it, I was a bit dissapointed. However, this little vacuum is quite the &#34;sucker&#34;! It cleans really well and can get under almost anything! It is light weight and the bagless feature is the best! I would definitely recommend it!
