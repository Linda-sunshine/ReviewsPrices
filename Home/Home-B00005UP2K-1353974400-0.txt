review/summary: Every woman's dreamreview/text: After many years of watching my wife drooling over this machine I finally got this for her for Christmas. This is almost a work of art it's so well built. It's very heavy, well made, and should be a part of any kitchen. My wife loves to cook and make cakes, pies, bread, you name it. She almost went into shock on Christmas morning when she opened this. She uses it several times a week and has put it through it's paces. To my knowledge you don't need to purchase anything additional to use this mixer. If you want the best of the best then this is it. If our house was on fire she would grab our son first and this mixer next. She loves it!
