review/summary: Great Humidifierreview/text: This our 3rd humidifier for our daughters room. It is by far the best one yet. It has an easy fill tank that lasts at least 2 nights. It does not require a filter so it seems easier to keep clean. We have been using for about 2 months and have not noticed any of the white film that occurs with some of the humidifiers. I would highly recommend this for a child's room.
