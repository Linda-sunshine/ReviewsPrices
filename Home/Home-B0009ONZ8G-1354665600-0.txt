review/summary: Buying different vacuum after only 1.5 yearsreview/text: I usually own vacuums for about 15 years on average. This one I'm getting rid of after 1.5 years. I hate it. The brushes continue to spin when using the hand tools and it put a hole in my rug. The cord doesn't stay locked in the channel up the back of the vacuum, so it effectively attaches at the base of the vacuum and I continually run over the cord. The hose is short. I spent the money for the separate extra long hose, but the vacuum tips over whenever I use it because it is too heavy for the vacuum. This vacuum is cheap and it has alot of suction power, but I can't say much else positive about it.
