review/summary: They've Downgraded the Product!!review/text: These used to say they filtered out cryptosporidia & giardia as advertised, but the package now says you should not use them in microbiologically unsafe water. Maybe they just changed the packaging in a CYA maneuver, but you can't advertise one thing on Amazon and another on the front of the box. Stand behind your product!
