review/summary: Good Machine for the Pricereview/text: I don't make bread with complicated recipes, so this machine serves my purpose. I have had the machine for about 6 years, and I bake bread once a week. The only complaint I have is the short life of the bread pan. After 2-3 years of baking at the above rate, the shaft started to seize up. I got it turning each time using force. Eventually the paddle started scraping the bottom of the pan, causing some black-looking pan material to appear in the bread. Not good. So if you are willing to order a new pan (~$30 incl. shipping) after about 2 years, this machine is for you. Maybe other brands have a similar pan life - I don't know.
