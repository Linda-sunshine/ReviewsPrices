review/summary: Awesome!review/text: This mattress topper is awesome! My wife and I were headed to an internship for the summer and could only take what we could fit in our car, which meant we would sleep on a air bed for 3 months. With that in mind I knew I had to get a topper that would make it bearable. This made it, wait for it......awesome! It made a crappy air bed into a nice bed. We slept on it for 3 months and now we are back to our real bed I missed the air bed. So I ended up just putting this on our bed even though our bed has a pillow top. So I gave it 5 stars because it makes bad things awesome and good things awesome.It did have a faint smell when we first got it but it didn't last very long and I never noticed it through sheets. The size is perfect, and the comfort level is great. It never makes you hot like some memory foam can. If you are hesitant because it is memory foam don't be. I was too, because memory foam doesn't seem to let you move to much and I like to move when I sleep. But this is not confining at all. I think I covered it all. The price is reasonable. So if you have a crappy bed... Make it Awesome!
