review/summary: Very pleased with this product!review/text: I worked in restaurants and have used professional grade mandolines that were only slightly better than this unit and cost three times as much. Using the guide is mandatory! Clean up is easy, if you use a toothbrush to get around the blades. If you are going to cut hard vegetables, like carrots, cut into 2" lengths first and you should have no problem. I've only had it a month, but I've used it a half dozen times and expect many years of service!
