review/summary: Perfect for in-pot mixingreview/text: I bought this immersion blender after watching a video demonstrating the blending of vegetables in a large soup pot. Having previously poured my soups into a free-standing blender 3 cups at a time and dealing with the mess and inconvenience of pouring hot liquids into this blender again and again, I was enthusiastically looking forward to using the Cuisinart SmartStick right in the pot. I have used it only once, so I cannot comment on how well this hand blender will hold up over time, but, wow, did it ever do the job, easily blending the chunks of vegetables in the pot. The blender does seem very sturdy to me and the chrome finish is attractive. I highly recommend this blender.
