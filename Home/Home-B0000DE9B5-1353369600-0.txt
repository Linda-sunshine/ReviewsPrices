review/summary: Excellent Glass Picture and Exactly What I Neededreview/text: I bought this glass jug to store water at room temperature during the winter. I've found that I feel colder when I drink cold water during the winter. So, I have my PUR pitcher in the fridge and pour filtered water into this pitcher that I keep on my counter. It's perfect for what I needed. Some of the other reviews had some issues with the handle, but it works fine for me. The airtight sealing cap is great as well.
