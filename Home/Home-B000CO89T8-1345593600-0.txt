review/summary: Works perfectly as described and Incredible Valuereview/text: I use this product every single day at work. I don't like to chug my coffee generally and it takes me as long as two hours to finish my first cup in the morning. Inevitably I'd have to resort to microwaving the mug to get the coffee hot again. With this warmer I never have to worry about it and my coffee stays at a drinkable temperature indefinitely. For $10 you cannot go wrong with this product. Highly highly highly recommended!
