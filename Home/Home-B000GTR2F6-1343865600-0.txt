review/summary: Worked for a year....and quitreview/text: So, I spent $170 on a fancy Keurig coffee machine and started spending about $7 a week on K-Cups. I loved the ease and convenience and the fact that I didn't have to measure out coffee grounds every morning and then wash a coffee pot and filter assembly. It was really easy and effortless to drink a cup of coffee every morning before work. Yes, Keurig's are expensive, yes K-Cups are expensive no matter where you buy them but let me repeat - I LOVED THIS MACHINE and never regretted the money I spent. So, imagine my shock and dismay when I came into my kitchen at 5 am on a Monday morning to find my Keurig is no longer brewing. The lights are on and nobody is home. I cleaned everything out, turned it off, unplugged it...nada. Now yes, I have used this machine, on average, 5 days a week for 14 months. That's alot of use but I also paid ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLARS for the machine, I filled it only with bottled spring water and I don't want to know how much I have spent on K Cups. It's dead...it's not working and I'm disappointed beyond belief. I've had Mr. Coffee machines that lasted for 15 years and still worked when I replaced them, just because it was time or there was new technology. All I can say is, think before you buy. You will love it, provided you accept that you are paying for the ease and convenience. You will be upset if it simply stops working a year after you bought it and sadly, that seems to be rather common. I have to seriously consider going back to a $20 Mr. Coffee and just dealing with spending 3-4 minutes every day washing out the pot and filter. I don't know if I can shell out the money again to buy one knowing that I run the risk of it dying on me a year or even two or three years later.
