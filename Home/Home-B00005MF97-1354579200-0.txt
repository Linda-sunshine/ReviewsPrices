review/summary: smaller than I neededreview/text: I had a lot of green tomatoes to chop and my really old food processor wasn't equal to the job. I hoped this would do the job, but it's evidently designed for small jobs. I should have gotten a manual food grinder for what I was doing. I use it now to make small batches of salsa or to chop onions and mushrooms for scrambled eggs.
