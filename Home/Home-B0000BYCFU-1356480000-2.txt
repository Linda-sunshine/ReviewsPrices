review/summary: Works great!review/text: First off: if you want to be a hard core canner, this product is not for you. I say this simply because the fact that it is not made here in the U.S., that is why I gave it 4 stars Otherwise, if you are looking for something to can some things from the garden in a timely manner, buy it. I used it today and it worked great!
