review/summary: zucchini spaghettireview/text: We bought this to try making spaghetti from zucchini and it works! It slides around a little on the counter top even with the suction cups and pushing with the one hand and turning with the other while the machine slides is a little challenging but I'm not making tons of "spaghetti." We love it. Haven't tried too many other things -- I did do some carrots and it was more challenging than something softer.
