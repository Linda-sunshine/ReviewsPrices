review/summary: Consumer Reports told us to buy this.review/text: My wife was looking for a vacuum that worked well with pet hair. Consumer reports rated this one as great for pet hair. It's no Kirby, but for the price, it is a powerful vacuum. Just make sure to flip it over, get some scissors, and cut any long hairs off the spinny part with the bristles, otherwise it slows it down. Can't beat this vacuum for the price. We paid 70 or 80ish for it.
