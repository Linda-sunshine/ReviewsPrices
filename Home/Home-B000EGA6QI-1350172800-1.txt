review/summary: SO easy to clean, SUPER handy!review/text: Being a new mom, I needed something quick and easy. THIS BABY IS IT!Super fast set up, use and clean up! It took me 1/16th of the time it normally does to make my baby food!Cleaning it was as easy as detaching and running it under the faucet...then I was up and running and blending the next batch.Love this tool... I am now excited to use it to make dips for the grown ups!Only drawback-which really isn't one for me... it really only makes food into a puree. Don't expect a variety of speeds and cut sizes.
