review/summary: A lot of defectsreview/text: What a worst product!I bought this product two weeks ago and got it quickly. After I boiled water, I find a lot of water leak to the base. First, I thought it might be due to some water drop in outside when I fill water . So I clean the water and this item with dry cloth. A few minutes, the water came out so I knew it is a leak. Then I requested a replacement. The replacement item also came quickly. I fill the water and leave it for a few minutes. This new one is also a leak one. How luck I were, get two, but both them leak water.Is this my bad luck? or Is this product a bad quality??(Leak water in bottom of it can cause electric shock, very dangerous)
