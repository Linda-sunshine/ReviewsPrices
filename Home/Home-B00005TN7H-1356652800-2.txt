review/summary: Works with Weston 2300review/text: I purchased the both the regular mouth and wide mouth along with the accessory hose to use with the Weston 2300. I have no issues with either and am very happy with both. We have been using these for about a year now, without failure, for storing deyhdrated foods in the jars.
