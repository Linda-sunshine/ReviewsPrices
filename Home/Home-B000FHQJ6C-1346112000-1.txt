review/summary: Have had this for over 4yrs, AWESOME juicer for the price!review/text: I bought this over 4yrs ago here on AMAZON, used it 2yrs everyday, stored it, and I am using it again...Still works like new..This is a very easy to clean juicer, 2 min tops.. The key to getting most all the juice out of your produce is to slowly push it down the food shute to the blades, go slowly.. And obviously not putting pits of plum and such in it, I also take the skin off of my pineapple. I make a carrot, romaine, apple, (with lil ginger or mint) drink and it works awesome for these items...I wouldn't recommended using bananas, in this as it will clog the blade/strainer(I use bananas with 2 handfuls of spinach, milk, scoop protein powder,& lil peanut butter) for a healthy, delicious smoothie. But for your greens (Kale, Romaine,Spinach) and harder,fibrous veggies & fruits(pineapple, carrots, apples, cucumbers, celery, etc.) this juicer is FABULOUS! This is a good, solid/sturdy juicer, at a price most anyone can afford...I love it!!!!
