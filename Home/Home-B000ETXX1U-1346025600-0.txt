review/summary: Bam!review/text: After a couple months of moderate use, it kersploded. It was just me on the bed. I am of average weight, I wasn't jumping or standing on it, it wasn't even very full of air. I repositioned myself, it went pop, now I have a lumpy child-sized bed. This is not a small hole that can be patched. It is a catastrophic rupture.Edit: It's still under warranty, so I called customer support. Wait time was less than a minute, and it sounds like getting a replacement should not be too difficult. The customer support representative sent me an email while I was on the phone, so I have a personal contact--much better than some anonymous support@company address. Will update further when the replacement has been received.
