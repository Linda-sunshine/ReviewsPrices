review/summary: GOOD OLD FASHIONED COOKINGreview/text: First the delivery was prompt..thank you Amazon..Being an iron skillet, it is heavy..but with the extra loop, it makes it easier to move, etc.. They say no soap, and I have a 12 inch that looks like new....I use a scotchbrite scrub sponge to wash it in dawn, and rinse it really, really well...then put it on the stove and heat the pan to hot...turn off burner, and pore a little vegetable oil in the pan, and take a paper towel and make sure you cover bottom and inside sides with this oil. Just let it sit on stove till has cooled...it is again pre-seasoned and ready for use. The heat completely dries the pan out, to prevent rust...and it keeps the pan looking like new.Once you have tasted fried chicken done in a iron pan with 'shortening' not oil....you will never use anything else to cook chicken, except maybe a deep frier...I LOVE IT!
