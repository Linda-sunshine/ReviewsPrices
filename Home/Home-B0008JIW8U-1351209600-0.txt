review/summary: Inexpensive and does what it saysreview/text: I've had this for about a week. It does exactly what it says and is well worth the price. I find that filters work better than the washable basket; they also make cleaning easier.The only down side is 4 'cups' means 20 ounces not 32 ounces. They consider each cup to be five ounces. It does make enough coffee for two people to have one cup each.Making tea using 2 tea bags in the basket works fine too.The timed brewing works perfectly, the auto shutoff works, I've detected no bad chemical odors or tastes.
