review/summary: A Hand Vacuum That Sucks (The Good Way!)review/text: I have gone through my share of handheld rechargeable vacuums that seem to barely get the spot you are trying to clean up before the battery goes dead within the first year. I decided after reading other reviews to give this a one a shot. I am glad I did.The power is intense. I have used it to pick everything up from crumbs and play-doh from our kitchen floor to spilled cereal on our carpets. It handles it all.For a plug in vacuum, the plug actually works well and wraps up very easily. Less pain I think than trying to mount and charge normal handhelds.It is a little on the heavy side, my wife complains when she has to use it, but admits it does a great job.The hose detaches and has a nice crevice tool built in that is a really nice feature. The way it is mounted keeps it from falling off which I hate on normal vacuums.I would definitely recommend this to anyone as long as weight is not an issue.
