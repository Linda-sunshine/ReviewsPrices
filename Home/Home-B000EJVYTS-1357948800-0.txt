review/summary: After a year and a half I feel it's about time to write a review.review/text: My main reason for purchasing this can was to keep our messy dog out of the trash can. It does a wonderfull job of that while still making it easy for us to throw things away.Personally I would skip the power adaptor and just use batteries, ours has been using the same duracells we put in over a year and a half ago and its still going strong.We have not experienced any of the gear related failures that other reviewers have noted. Our can is located in the kitchen so it does get used on average 5-10 times per day. For the price and convenience I will buy another one if and when this one fails.
