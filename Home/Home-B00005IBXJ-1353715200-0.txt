review/summary: Love it!review/text: We have an expensive KitchenAide dual regular/convection oven. The Pizzazz does pizza and pizza rolls better than it does, and of course much quicker since you're not waiting for the oven to heat up. We have had it for about 5 years now and still use it a lot. When you have young kids it comes in real handy for quick snacks too, the kids don't even like pizza rolls from the microwave.
