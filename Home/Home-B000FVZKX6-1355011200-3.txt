review/summary: Good quality flannel, cheap cutsreview/text: I suspect many of those raving about these have never bought decent quality flannel sheets before and are comparing these to the typical low-quality dept store sheets. I've been using Lands End 6 oz flannel for many years, so I'm probably a bit spoiled. Nonetheless, here's my assessment of these sheets:Good quality flannel -- comparable to Lands End's 6 oz flannel.Cheap cuts -- particularly the standard pillow cases -- they are basically useless. These claim to be only an inch smaller in each dimension than the Lands End pillow cases, but the Lands End measurement is just for the *case* portion, not the "cuff". So, in reality, the Lands End cases are a good 6 inches longer in total.Another annoying thing about these is they only come in sets. For my queen bed, I usually buy a queen fitted sheet and a king flat. Can't do that here.On the surface these seem like a bargain, costing a little less than half what a Lands End 6 oz flannel set would cost but, for me, considering that the cases are useless and the flat sheet is smaller than I'd like, all I really got was a fitted sheet, so it ends up basically costing the same. In the future, I'll likely just stick with Lands End unless they start selling these pieces individually.
