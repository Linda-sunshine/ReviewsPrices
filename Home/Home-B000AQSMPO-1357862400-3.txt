review/summary: makes pathetic coffeereview/text: Had a strong plastic 'fake' taste to everything it brewed. It took about 50 large cups of water-flushes and 3 vinegar rinses to finally make it start brewing 'acceptable' tasting coffee. Then after all that, it does what it is supposed to, which is brew an underwhelming cup of coffee at 50 cents per disposable coffee cartridge.Medium is about maximum size you should brew, large is just water.After 48 k-cups plus the samplers, I have sold it to my coworker who wanted it for his desk for 1/3rd the price. Good riddance.
