review/summary: Excellent coffee only requires a bit of musclereview/text: The AeroPress is a fast way to get an espresso or Americano in your home kitchen without spending a lot of bucks. The AeroPress is super simple to use: you put the coffee and water in the device and let them steep for a bit, then you press down on the plunger (hence the &#34;Press&#34; in the name). I try to be patient with the pressing process. Heat some water in the microwave and that's it.The result tastes great and the cleanup is super easy and quick. Much better and easier on the cleanup than the Mukka pot that I own.
