review/summary: Timer now features on/off switchreview/text: Model 362-90. This meat thermometer is accurate to about 1 - 2 degrees F by my tests using boiling water and ice water. The probe wire is 43 inches long. The display has magnetic feet, which probably should not be used to attach it to any part of a stove which is hot to the touch. Used according to directions, the unit should be durable enough. The instructions warn against several improper uses, such as on a barbecue grill or to measure oven temperature. (Oops. That was how I intended to use it. Glad I read the instructions first.) Other cautions include not using the probe in a microwave oven or immersing the probe wire in water.Note that the essentially similar model 362-86Polder Original Cooking All-In-One Timer/Thermometerhas a white display rather than grey and does not include a clip for attaching the probe to the edge of a pot (and is priced about a buck and a half less). It would have been nice if the unit had been packaged in a reusable box rather than a gorilla-proof plastic clamshell. I store mine in a quart-sized kitchen bag.
