review/summary: Sucksreview/text: I have to use a ton of coffee to make it any good. Or I turn it on with just water and the lid open and let it run till it makes constant noise. Then I add coffee and let it work. I guess the water doesn't get very hot so the coffee comes out weak. Also the lid flexes when the coffee maker is on and it opens while brewing. All in all STAY AWAY
