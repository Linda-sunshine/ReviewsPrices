review/summary: Does what it's supposed toreview/text: Other than the totally and completely misleading name of the unit, I like it a lot. There is no steam involved at any point in the use of this appliance. BUT, it does a very good job of scrubbing, sucking, and drying, which is what I expected when I purchased the unit. I knew going in that it was patently NOT a steam unit, but with good hot water, a strong solution of carpet detergent, and a power source, it cleans very well indeed. I suspect that with stubborn stains it's only as good as the solution you put into it. The user should read the instructions as misuse or ineptitude can lead to problems. On one run, I failed to secure the top of the dirty water compartment and the way I realized this was that the brushes would not rotate. It took me a couple minutes to figure that one out. But as long as everything is tightly closed, the machine operates very well. The carpets I've used it on look cleaner than they have in years. It is NOT a commercial machine, and one gallon will only do a couple square yards of very dirty carpet, but it's well worth it, and very easy to empty the old and refill the new, so it's not a real issue for me.
