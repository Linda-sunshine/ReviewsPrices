review/summary: If you like hot coffee, this won't disappoint you!review/text: I have had this perculator for about a month and I use it every day. If you buy the coffee you like, this perculator will do the rest. It is durable and heavy like a great perculator should be. The coffee is always hot, not warm like so many drip coffee makers.
