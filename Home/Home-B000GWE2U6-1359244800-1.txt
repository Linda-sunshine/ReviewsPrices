review/summary: GREAT BUYreview/text: We had several humidifiers over the past years warm mist where the filters need to be changed and the cool mist (vicks ) which is the heaviest when filled with water .Then after several research online found that there is no difference if it is cool or warm mist as the air will be the same temperature when it reaches the lungs ...so why pay for warm mist when cool mist can do the same job .These humidifiers are not expensive and works great .They look like decorative pieces and works great .We are totally happy with the product and we have fewer nose congestions and colds ...It is less expensive in Amazon and they carry several crane models.Would def recommend this product ....
