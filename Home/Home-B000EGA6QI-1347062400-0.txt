review/summary: Lasted 7 months...review/text: This product is far from durable. The motor gave out after seven months (it just slowed down and then stopped spinning altogether). I had been using it only once or twice a week, to make fruit & yogurt smoothies and pureed vegetable soup: normal use for which it should have been designed. Very disappointing!
