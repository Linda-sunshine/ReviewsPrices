review/summary: Pleasantly surprised!review/text: Let&iexcl;s start with the reason why we cought this:My wife.She had been complaining more and more about our 5 year old pillow top mattress causing her aches and pains, in everything from her elbows to her back(I know, elbows, really?).She wanted a new mattress, and I definitely did not want to spend another $1k on a new mattress.That is where the mattress topper idea came in. I spent an hour or so a day for a few weeks researching (as I do before any purchase) all the different options on Amazon and this one had plenty of solid reviews at a good price.Key features I was looking for-I decided we would need at least 3&iexcl;&iexcl; because I needed to make sure it was thick enough that my wife wouldn&iexcl;t still be aching.-I also needed one that would stay cool as I am a hot sleeper.This one seemed to fit the bill.We got this mattress topper, I opened it up and laid it on top of the bed for only about 6 hours before putting a sheet on. It expanded just fine in a very short period and fit my king size no problem.There is a definite strong mint ice cream smell that has only slowly faded overtime, but this is way better than the apparent chemical smell some of the other brands come with.SUMMARY:I am a believer!My wife has not complained at all, her achiness form the springs are gone, the scent in the pad is there still after about 3 weeks of use, but I actually like it.The mattress topper is actually really comfortable, I have adjusted to sleeping on it just fine, it took about a night or two, but now I am back to my usual sleeping like a babyFor those who complain about it being too small, it really is about an inch short on each side, but I think it is to ensure the sheets fit over top, and also the actual mattress may have just spread out after years of use, so it is possible that if it was on a new mattress, it would be a near perfect fit.I personally do not sleep on the outer edge of my bed, I sleep on the side and have no issues.I highly recommend this topper!
