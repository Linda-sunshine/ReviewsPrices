review/summary: Works fine.review/text: I needed a small grinder to grind chicken breast for my kids, so I could get more out of expensive organic chicken that I buy )This little grinder does the job right.The only negative is cleaning it, but its the same for all of the meat grinders, electrical or not.Have not used for pasta making yet.
