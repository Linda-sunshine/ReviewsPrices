review/summary: *** OMEGA J8005 ***review/text: ust received this a few days ago. I read many reviews and did some research before buying this particular one. Amazon had it listed as a 'Deal of the Day' for $159.00. Couldn't resist. I was very pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use and clean up. I bought it for wheat grass juicing and it did a superb job. Stuck a few old dry carrots in first and it even got juice from them. Juiced 8-10 small oranges and, again, very pleased with the performance. I can highly recommend this model. You will not be disappointed!
