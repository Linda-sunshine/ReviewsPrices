review/summary: Has worked well for mereview/text: I've worked hard at seasoning this item, baking it with coconut oil several times. I also find that grilling veggies on it is very good for seasoning (and great for flavoring whatever I cook after the veggies). I do use it on the stovetop sometimes as well as in the oven. I've baked fries on it, which worked well--nice and crispy. The handles are nice so that I can keep a good grip on it. As for pizza--this is fantastic! I love to make pizza at home and this really does great things for the crust--not only is the texture just perfect but the flavor is actually better. YUM!!!
