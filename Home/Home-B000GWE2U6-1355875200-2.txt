review/summary: I've named him, Cooper.review/text: LOVE my owl humidifier. I'm someone who has really bad eczema and live in the Northeast so it often gets dry in the winter time especially when the heat is blasting. So I really needed a humidifier. Thankfully I bought this one! 1) it's super cute (I'm sort of a kid inside), 2) it works!!!!! Less scratching at night, my skin doesn't feel as dry, and my throat doesn't feel dry either. 3) it's small so it doesn't take up too much room.Highly recommend any of the Crane products!!
