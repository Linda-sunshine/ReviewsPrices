review/summary: Still smells after 6 monthsreview/text: We have a more expensive 3" topper on our bed and bought this for one of our kids who loves ours but hated this one. Part of it was the smell and part of it was comfort. We have had it out in the open for 6 months now and it still gives off a smell. We will be putting on our guest room bed and will report back in a few weeks after it has been used. For now, I recommended going with a higher quality product.
