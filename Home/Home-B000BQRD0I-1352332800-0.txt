review/summary: Awful steamer do not buy this productreview/text: I got this steamer for work about 3 months ago. I do a lot of product photography and needed a good steamer for clothing. At first the steamer worked fine. I was a little disappointed with the capacity of the water tank which is hardly any water at all but it still steamed the clothes so that wasn't a huge deal. However, the hose and handle get really, really hot. Almost too hot to hold so we had to wrap a towel around the handle just to use it. Then yesterday I was steaming as normal and the hose completely broke off of the base unit. It's just a small plastic piece that connects the two and I think it just got so hot it broke. Now it's unusable and very hard to contact their customer service. If you're planning on using your steamer longer that 2 months do NOT buy this one.
