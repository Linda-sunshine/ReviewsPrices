review/summary: Quartz Portable Electric Heatersreview/text: I appreciate the reviews of the electric heaters but they would be inadequate for my needs. I have an Eden Pure 1000 watts Quartz Portable Electric Heater which does a very adequate job for a room that is a 17' X 17' room with 10' ceilings down to around 45 degrees. I have had it for several years but I was considering replacing it with an equal or better performing Quartz heater but the specs listed for any of the quartzheaters are quite confusing with quite a bit of monetary difference with no specific reason for that difference.Could you maybe review any larger Quartz and reduce the confusion of those heaters which look and sound alike but are considerably difference in price. Thanks.John Grimsley
