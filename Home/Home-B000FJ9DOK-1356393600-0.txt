review/summary: First class water bottlereview/text: A friend gave me this in a gift bag of her favorite things. Now this bottle is my new favorite thing...a water bottle with no bad habits. It keeps liquids cold all day, easy to fill/hold/clean, the lid system is leak proof and fun to use, and the mouthpiece feels good on your lips. Pretty much perfection!
