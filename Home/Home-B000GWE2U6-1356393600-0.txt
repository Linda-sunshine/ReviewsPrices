review/summary: Cute, quiet, effective - but maintainance is a PAIN!review/text: Got two of these because they are nice and quiet and some of the best reviewed on Amazon. Unfortunately, with a little one at home, we just don't have the time/energy/diligence to keep up with taking it apart to clean it daily and disinfect it weekly. While all humidifiers require cleaning, I've found that I can get away with very little of it with the wick/filter-based model I have at the office. I just add the amount of water needed for the hours I'm there (guestimating) then leave it running on low while I'm gone. The airflow dries out the filter and base and keeps stuff from growing. But with these, without frequent maintainance, pink and/or black stuff starts starts growing in the crevices. I'll be getting two more of the filter kind for the house and donating these to Sal's army--do they even take stuff like that? I'd have given it a "two star" rating but my one-year old LOVES it. He's obsessed with his and waves at it every day. So it gets points for toddler appeal.
