review/summary: This is a top rated pan that nevere fails to impress.review/text: This pan was purchased because of great reviews, but the quality, build and versatility of this pan are even greater than advertised. The little bit of extra space from most 12&#34; pans is really helpful at times. The quality of the metal, handle and surface are amazing at any price, but at this price it's just crazy.
