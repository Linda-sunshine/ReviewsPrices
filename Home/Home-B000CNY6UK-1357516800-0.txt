review/summary: Best Coffee Everreview/text: Very quick and easy to use, you'll never go back to your French Press or drip coffee maker. The steam and pressure bring out all the flavour and aroma and take the coffee to another level. This size (6-cup) fills exactly one standard coffee mug with just enough room for milk and/or sugar. If you are planning to make two full cups of coffee at a time you obviously need a bigger size Bialetti. Simply a timeless product. I'm gonna be using mine every day for years to come.
