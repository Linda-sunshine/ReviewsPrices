review/summary: easy out, compact fit for small freezersreview/text: We bought this product to freeze ... homemade garlic paste. That's right. And it's worked beautifully! The flexible trays make it easy to pop the cubes out, and the trays fit easily into our limited freezer space.I also like the shape of the cubes. They're cubes, not ... rectangles, and would look great in a cocktail glass.Not that anyone else is looking to freeze garlic, but if so, a word of caution: the silicone soaks that odor right up and doesn't easily let it go. My husband rinsed it in bleach, we gave it a hand washing and we put it through the dishwasher (high temp wash, even) at least twice. Maybe three times. And no one would have to guess twice what we'd had in it. :) No matter, though, since this will be our primary use, and I *assume* the smell wouldn't transfer should we decide to make ice.
