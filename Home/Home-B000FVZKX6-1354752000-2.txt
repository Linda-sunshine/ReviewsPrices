review/summary: Purchased as a giftreview/text: Hi All, I bought this set as a gift. My Mother's friend has been wishing for some flannel sheets, but they are difficult to find in department stores. I finally found some by L.L. Bean, but, (as I was about to make my purchase), I considered checking out products/reviews on Amazon. The sheets I found in the catalog were exactly twice the price. They had more detail to them, but, seriously, who really cares. You want something, of good quality, that fits the bed well and is comfortable, (and affordability is also a factor, for me). I don't know, yet, how these will fit the bed, but the reviews I read, here, are much more favorable than the reviews for the more expensive, L.L. Bean, sheets. They arrived in just two days. They look very nice, much better than I had expected, and they feel fantastic. I am sure Bill and my Mother will be very happy with these, as I am. So, I highly recommend this item.
