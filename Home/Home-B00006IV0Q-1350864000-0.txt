review/summary: A Tipreview/text: I was not sure about this coffee maker, after reading so many lukewarm reviews. But I ordered it because I did not want to buy a more expensive one which also had lukewarm reviews. The percolator and I would run the coffee through twice.It got to the point where even that was not working made pretty good coffee once we got the right ratio of coffee to water. Then, after about 4 months, the coffee began to look like tea. I just figured that we had arrived at the same juncture as everyone else.So we would run the coffee through twice. Recently even that didn't work. So hubby began to inspect the pot. He looked at the coffee basket and 2/3 of the holes were clogged. He unclogged them with a safety pin and...behold! A perfect pot of coffee!!So, everyone, before you throw out a good coffee pot, rememerb to clean the coffee pot before you give up.
