review/summary: Excellent addition to the FoodSaver gizmoreview/text: I was a bit skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but I took the plunge and bought it anyway. This has become one of the most used attachments for my FoodSaver. I make beef jerky and beef sticks, and putting them in mason jars and vacuum sealing them saves me a whole lot of money over the FoodSaver bags. Plus, I can nab a few strips or sticks, put the lid back on, and re-seal them over and over. When the jar is empty, wash it out and reuse it over and over as well. I've used this on pint, quart, and half-gallon sizes, and have never had one fail or leak. I currently have most of my dry stores (flour, sugar, salt, etc.) vacuum packed in jars and labeled, and stacked nicely in my pantry. If you have a FoodSaver with an accessory hose, and use wide-mouth mason jars or have access to them, this is the attachment for you! NOTE: NOT RECOMMENDED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO HEAT CANNING VEGETABLES, FRUITS OR MEAT STOCKS; these should be canned using normal canning procedures. But for dry storage, this can't be beat! Highly recommend!
