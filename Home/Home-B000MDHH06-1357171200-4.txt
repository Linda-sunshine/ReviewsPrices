review/summary: Breville BJE200XL Compact Juice Fountain 700Watt Juice Extractorreview/text: I'm not too happy with it and have expected better results. The juicer is waisting a lot of material, even so by juicing very slowly.Herbs etc., even packed inbetween apples are not getting juiced well enough and end up mostly whole in the waste-container.There is simply not enough juice contraction. Something else I don't like about it: It is recommended to turn on the motor firstbefore entering food, which means, the food is splattering and jumping around in the compartment, while you are trying to addsome more to stop this from happening.I don't hate it, but I'm definitely dissapointed.It also takes quiet some time to clean it well.
