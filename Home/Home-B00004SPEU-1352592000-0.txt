review/summary: Ho-hum. It does the job.review/text: Dang, what a difference freshly ground coffee makes! I went out and bought this one based on the positive reviews but I gotta say, this grinder is merely okay. I use a coffee cone dripper so I don't want my coffee ground too fine. But, the grounds are in uneven sizes if i don't grind it for as long as I should for a automatic coffee dripper.. so that's minus a star. Another star was lost because it doesn't come with a brush. Lots of coffee grounds get stuck in the blade area and that's going to make your coffee taste subpar so make sure to get one and dust it off! I use a pastry brush and I wouldn't recommend it because the bristles are too soft. Any sturdy bristled brush should work though!
