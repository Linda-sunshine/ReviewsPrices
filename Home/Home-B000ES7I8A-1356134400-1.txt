review/summary: horrible, Horrible, HORRIBLE!!review/text: From the onset, this has always dribbled a bit while pouring which I have considered a minor nuisance until now when I burnt my leg while filling my mug. I would like to chuck this into the rubbish but need to keep it until I find a suitable replacement. I do not recommend this product unless you enjoy hot water burns.
