review/summary: Everthing promised and more...review/text: It is very easy to assemble and clean. The stainless steel just rinses clean. The handy brush that is supplied makes quick work of cleaning the basket - the toughest part of the cleanup. Now for the juicing - coolest part is the large shoot. It will take small apples, pears, beets as well as two large carrots. It is quick, producing 20oz in about a minute. Pitcher is nicely designed and effectively separates the foam.
