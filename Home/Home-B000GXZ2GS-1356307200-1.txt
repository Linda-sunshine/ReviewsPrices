review/summary: Best coffee everreview/text: This has to be the best coffee maker available. It looks weird but is a work of absolute genius. Despite advertising copy to the contrary, it is not capable of making espresso -- but it does produce full-flavored coffee to any degree of concentration you like. There are more fascinating delights to the design of this simple looking device than I care to catalog. Just accept the fact that your coffee, particularly if you grind your own to taste, will be better than you've ever experienced.
