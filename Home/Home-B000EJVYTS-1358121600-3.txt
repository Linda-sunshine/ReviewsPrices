review/summary: Gets the job donereview/text: I've had this for a year now and love it. Keeps the odors contained and don't have to worry about my dog getting into it. I love the size,not to big or small. So easy to use....hands free. Once in a while you may have to reset by switching the power button off and on. So many times I have knocked and bumped the lid while being open and thinking that I might of broken it, but it has really held up! I highly recommend.
