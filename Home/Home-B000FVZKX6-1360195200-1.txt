review/summary: LOVE these sheetsreview/text: I bought these based on the positive reviews on Amazon, and I was not disappointed! I have a regular pillowtop queen mattress and these fit beautifully - no struggling with the fitted sheet at all. They wash/dry beautifully and are incredibly soft and warm (I feel like I've got an extra blanket on me!). So glad I purchased them, as we've had a bit of a cold winter here in the D.C. area.
