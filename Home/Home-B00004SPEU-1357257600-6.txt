review/summary: Exactly What I expectedreview/text: I had actually gone to three local stores to find a Krups or Mr. Coffee grider as I have had both and they worked equally good. However, I could not find either at a local store and bought a cusinart which was way too big to fit in the tight cabinet space. After my sister suggested Amazon, I actually return the cusinart and ordered online. My previous Mr. Coffee grinder lasted 15 years and my Krups had lasted 16 years....
