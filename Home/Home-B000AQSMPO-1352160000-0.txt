review/summary: It broke! Buy a new one!review/text: I have purchased 3 Keurig units. Only 1 of the 3 is still working properly. After discussing my issues with Keurig customer service they agreed the units were defective. One of the two defective ones still makes coffee but sounds like a tractor and the other one leaks as soon as it is turned on. It was obvious from our discussion that Keurig Customer Service was very aware of these problems. Since the one year warranty period was over Keurig offered to sell me 2 replacement units at a DEEPLY DISCOUNTED PRICE of 99.00 each. My local Wal-mart had them on sale at the same price. It is my opinion that Keurig was very cavalier in response to my complaints about their product. They broke...just buy new ones from us! These units were very lightly used by 2 people in 3 different locations. Clearly Keurig did not care about my bad experience with their product.Keurig B40 Elite Brewing SystemI resent the fact that a huge company like Keurig builds product that it knows will fail after very limited use. Silly me, I expected more. An apology would have been nice. I will be replacing my Keurig coffee makers with Cuisinart coffeemakers. Cuisinart one cup coffee makers come with a 3 year warranty and are built like a tank. Clearly Cuisinart feels they have a product they can afford to stand behind. I am so tired of disposable consumer products.
