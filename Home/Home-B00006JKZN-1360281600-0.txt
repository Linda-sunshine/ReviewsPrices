review/summary: Good waffle iron and excellent pricereview/text: I own one of these and have used it for years. It is very consistent with cooking and relatively easy to clean. I do wish that the plates could be removed for cleaning, but then it probably wouldn't heat and cook as evenly and consistently.I just bought a second one as a backup, just in case the manufacturer decides to &#34;improve&#34; the product several years from now and if my first one gives up the ghost--as man-made products do from time to time.There are several basic buttermilk waffle recipes that I have used, but for ease and consistency, I settled on Bisquick's back of the box recipe. I use only one cup of milk instead of the 1-1/3rd they call for because that was just too runny. I set the baker I have at about 3 and 1/2. When the red light changes to green, I add the waffle mix--about a half a cup at the time. If I wait till it stops steaming, then the waffle is too crisp. No, when the light turns from green to red again in a minute or two, my waffle is ready. I didn't find any need for Pam. I've kept extra waffle batter in the refrigerator for a couple of days, if necessary. I am able to pop my waffle loose with a fork. Hope this helps, although you will want to experiment a little to see what works best for your taste and experience.I like blueberries in mine, but they leave a residue, requiring a more thorough cleanup. I've found a stiff-bristle nylon brush and warm water works pretty well. Then I let it air dry for a while, just in case any water gets in the inner workings. Definitely do not immerse these!Did I mention that this baker comes at an excellent price, too?
