review/summary: Love it so much I have tworeview/text: The small size makes it great for small apartments (or for storing at your parents' place so you can have it handy when visiting). It also helps me save a bundle on fancy coffees when paired with Torani syrups and Hersey's chocolate syrup. Bonus points for not needing a lot of consumables (paper filters) as the replaceable filter is metal and with care lasts a long, long time.
