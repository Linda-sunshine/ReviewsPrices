review/summary: Short cupping due to bad design see reviews on various sites before you buyreview/text: These machines are prone to not pumping water and "short-cupping" (delivering too little water into the cup. Keurig likes to tell people they need to descale because that means its a user problem and not a design problem. But using distilled water won't prevent the problem. If it did, a lot of us would be happier--not thrilled but happier. You need to read thru all the comments to understand the prob. Keurig has changed the pumps in their design at last 3 times in the last two years but the problem isn't the pumps; it's the valves.The most reliable way to unstick the valves is to remove the water tank, unplug the device, hold it upside down over the sink and give it a goo whack on the bottom. Really this works. If you think that's an ok way to operate a device that costs this much, then this machine is for.More recently we've heard that Keurig support is telling folks that they cannot get a refund or replacement under warranty anymore because too many machines have been returned. Not honoring warranty? I don't see how that's legal. I can believe they are overwhelmed with returns, but that's the cost of business when you sell a bad design, keep selling it, keep insisting it's just scale build-up, keep refusing to continue selling the product. They should have had full recall or refund for its customers.
