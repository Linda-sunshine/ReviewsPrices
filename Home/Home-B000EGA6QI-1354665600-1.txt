review/summary: nice hand blenderreview/text: First let me say that I love &#34;pink&#34;. This blender works very well. The motor seems to be fairly strong and I've not had any issues with it not blending food. It's easy to clean, the whole metal part (stem and blade) detach. Overall, works great and I would buy again. Especially in pink!!!
