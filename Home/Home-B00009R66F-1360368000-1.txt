review/summary: Beware of limited warranty-Hose break and had to pay for new onereview/text: While this product has done a decent job as a carpet cleaner, the hose lever broke while I was attempting to clean my stairs. I had only used the product twice with no excessive force on the lever. When I called HOOVER to replace the hose, they said it was not covered under the warranty and that I had to pay for the new hose. I was not happy with that since it seemed like a faulty, poorly constructed plastic structure to begin with.All in all, this product does what it is supposed to, but I was not particularly happy with the Hoover warranty and what it covered.
