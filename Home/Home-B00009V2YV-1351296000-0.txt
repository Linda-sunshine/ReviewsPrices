review/summary: Midland WR300 Weather Radioreview/text: Received very quickly (next day) and well packaged. This Midland WR300 Weather Radio was easy to setup with clear instructions. Reception and "voice" alerts are very adequate. Appears to be a quality product and I will know more on it's performance as we are expecting "FrankenStorm" here in New England in a few days. At this time I am giving it FIVE stars for excellence in Amazon shipping so quickly and my impression of how easy it was to setup. Will update my review after it has been put to the test with this upcoming "monster storm".
