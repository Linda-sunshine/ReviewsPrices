review/summary: 2 Stars to 4 Stars: Don't Like-It's OK-I like itreview/text: Bought this pump in February 2012. Liked what the reviewers had to say about it. It seemed to have only one real drawback - the frothing element was too low - difficulty in removing foamed milk container - this is true, but I can live with that. I still like the machine, but I had problems with the frother leaking water during the brewing cycle. It got so bad, I had to put a cup under the frother to catch the water - I would get a full cup od water by the time I got a cup of esspresso. I contacted amazon.com (very helpful) and they asked that I contact the company - so I did. The company gave me the run around - had me do all this stuff with descalling, etc. After 4 weeks of e-mails back and forth and a threat that I would contact amazon.com, I asked that they replace the pump - it was on warranty. I followed their instructions, sent them $15.00 (why? I do not know) and they sent me a new pump. After about 3 weeks of operation with the replacement pump, I have the same problem - a leaky frother. The leak is not nealy as bad as the first pump - just a few drops, maybe a teaspoon. I will continue to use the pump, because it does produce a great espresso and cappuccino - I simply put a espresso cup under the frother during brewing. However, 2 things that truly rub me the wrong way 1) the time it took to replace the malfunctioning machine and 2) the run around I got from the company - plus sending an additional $15.00 for a warrantied product - I guess that's 3 things. Would I buy another De'Longhi EC155 Bar Pump Espresso & Cappuccino Maker? - No.
