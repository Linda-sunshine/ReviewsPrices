review/summary: Great Juicer but...review/text: I bought this juicer in 2010. 2 years and wow, it still looks new !It's been 2 years that I have been juicing all kinds of fruits and veggies. The over all product is great BUT when I juice carrots or apples/pineapples some small slices do still remain in the filter and one can still filter the remaining pulp and get almost half a glass of juice. I think that is the case of majority of juicers. If one doesn't care about the what goes waste a little bit or don't care about that 25% of juice that goes waste, this is perfect juicer . The blades are great even after 2 years of tough usage almost EVERY other day !!!I wish the chute was designed better as the juice still keeps dripping after juicing.One has to wait a couple of minutes for the dripping to stop. Some juicers have stoppers where one can stop some traces of juice from dripping if the glass gets full. I wish this had one of those !About the MUG- Why I found it interesting?The lid on the mug filters the foam of fresh juice. I love this feature as I hate foam on the fresh juice.It is dishwasher safe as well !
