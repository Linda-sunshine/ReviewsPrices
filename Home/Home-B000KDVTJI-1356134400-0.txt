review/summary: Leaky, cheap and poorly thought outreview/text: If left full water leaks out of seams on the bottom and pools around the base. Fill indicator is located behind handle and difficult to see, especially when holding the handle (when filling it, for instance). Markings on fill indicator have worn off less than one year after purchase (again, indicator is behind handle). I HIGHLY recommend buying a more expensive but higher quality unit.
