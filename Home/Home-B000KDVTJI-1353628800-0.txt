review/summary: works like a champreview/text: Comes out of the box all near and pretty.takes up very little counter space and I love that the pot comes away from the base and the cord for easy filling and pouring. Takes very little time to boil water, but this is LOUD! Like freight train or airplane loud! No sneaking off to boil water for you. It was hard for us to have a conversation in the kitchen, but in all honesty, I don't know that anyone would hear it in another room or on another floor.
