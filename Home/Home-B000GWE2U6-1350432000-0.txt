review/summary: quiet and effectivereview/text: I have this in my daughters small room. It humidifies the air over night and has plenty of water left in the tank in the morning.I appreciate that there are no lights on this unit as my daughter is sensitive to "distractions" while trying to go to sleep.It's cute, it works like it is supposed to and so far it has lasted through constant use of a winter season.
