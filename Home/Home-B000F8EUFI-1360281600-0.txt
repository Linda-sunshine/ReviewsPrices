review/summary: happy overallreview/text: I have been searching for a vacuum cleaner that could hold up to my crazy house. I have two dogs a Doberman and a German Shephard, a cat, a 2 year old and allergies. I previously had a Kenmore Progressive which at the time was deemed top of the line for bag cleaners. However I was having to dust every day and even after I vacuumed it seemed I noticed hair all the time.This vacuum is great, I used mine first and then the Shark and couldn't believe what else I picked up. My only con is that is not very wide, so not ideal for large rooms.
