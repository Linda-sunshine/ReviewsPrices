review/summary: Brita 80 Ounce Water Filtration Pitcherreview/text: Using this pitcher is an easy way to filter drinking and cooking water. The filter is easy to place in the pitcher and has a good life span of approximately 2 months. It's a cost effective produce and a much better choice as opposed to bottled water which is a definite waste of money.
