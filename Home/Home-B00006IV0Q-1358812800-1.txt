review/summary: Never thought retro coffee would be so greatreview/text: I love HOT coffee and after years of a drip pot, I thought I'd try a percolator (I know......even the word sounds strange). I use the filters. There is no on/off switch - you turn it on by inserting the plug into the pot but that doesn't bother me. It makes coffee super fast and it stays HOT without re-cooking it. It pours out of the spout so much nicer than my drips did. Seems if you poured drip pots too fast you spilled everywhere. I didn't even realize that until I got this Presto Pot. This pours out cleanly making it easy to fill my thermos without spilling. I give this a 5 for the quality of the coffee, ease of use, ease of cleaning and it's clean retro look.
