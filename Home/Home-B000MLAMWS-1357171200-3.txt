review/summary: Beautiful!review/text: I was a little concerned when it arrived as the box was slightly torn, and the stirophome was all over the place, but.. This kitchenaid was perfect! I bought it for my mother for her birthday, and myself being only a teenager was wary on the price. However! This kitchenaid is definitely professional. It has held up to anything we have put in it, and matches our kitchen perfectly. The crimson red looks beautiful up close! Amazon also shipped it a lot faster than was expected, which was fantastic! Overall GREAT present, fantastic quality and fast shipping! Mom was impressed!
