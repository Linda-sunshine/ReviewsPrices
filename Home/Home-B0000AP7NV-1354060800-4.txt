review/summary: Excellent small Brita Pitcherreview/text: This Brita Pitcher does what we all buy them for--it filters water efficiently. There are no whistles and bells or flashing lights, just a simple clean-lined filter system that produces great tasting water. Some have complained about the lid falling out. I just place my thumb and forefinger on the lid and can easily pour with one hand having no problems with the lid or inner reservoir falling out. Just follow the directions: Wash with soapy water, soak the filter for 15 minutes in water, insert the filter so it fits snugly into the slot, fill with tap water along the side and not on top of the filter. Wait until all the water drains into the bottom reservoir. Works great with no carbon particles. The pitcher is just 4 inches wide so it fits nicely into the refrig door. The lower resevoir holds 4-6 cups of water which works well for my husband and I. I have not found this item to be "cheap",just a neat little filter system with a neat little price.
