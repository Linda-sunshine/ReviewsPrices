review/summary: Perfect for scooping coconut oilreview/text: I can't live without this! (Okay, I can, but I don't want to.) This totally solved my problem of trying to get coconut oil out of the jar/container and into the pan. Before, I'd have to use two utensils- one to scoop, and one to push the coconut oil off of the first utensil. sometimes it would get stuck on the second utensil, so I'd have to use the other one to try to get it off. This is an issue when room temperature is slightly warmer than normal, but not warm enough to melt the coconut butter. When the temp is cool, the coconut butter/coconut oil is pretty solid and falls right off the utensil used to scoop it, but in the summer, some is melted but some is soft, meaning it will stick to the utensil.Using the cookie scoop solves this completely. It works perfectly. Now I don't have to worry about having lazy moments and resorting to using liquid oils (bleghk!) in the pan.The OXO scoop is great quality.
