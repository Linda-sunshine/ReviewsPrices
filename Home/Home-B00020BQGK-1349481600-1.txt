review/summary: not badreview/text: This vac works fine enough. For the money it does what it is intended to do.Two points.1. It remains to be seen how it holds up.2.Ii dont like the way the power cord is connected to the body of the vac. There is a serious bend there.With that said it does a good job on hardwood which is what we bought it for.
