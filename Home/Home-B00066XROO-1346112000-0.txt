review/summary: The perfect griddle!review/text: I use this for camping and it's just perfect. Nothing sticks to it! Cleaning it is as simple as wiping it off with a paper towel. The tilt feature is wonderful when cooking bacon and sausage. Plus, the huge cooking surface means you can cook tons of stuff on it simultaneously. Couldn't be happier.
