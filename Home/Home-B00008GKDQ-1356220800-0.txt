review/summary: Eh...review/text: Works as advertised, but the unit has a slight tilt to it so cooking eggs is not recommended. Cooking pancakes worked great though and there's a bit of a learning curve so that you don't burn the pancakes. Also, for gas cook tops the surface is not usually perfectly flat so this rocks just a bit. Other than that it is exactly as advertised. This is probably the best of it's kind out there, but I've had mixed results thus far.
