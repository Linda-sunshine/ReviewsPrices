review/summary: Love this kettle!review/text: I have had this kettle for several years now. It sits on the counter all the time and is used almost daily. I love tea, especially loose leaf, and this works perfectly. My husband uses it to heat water for his French press coffee pot and the kids use it to heat water for hot cocoa. It's quick, very convenient, and the auto shut-off is great in case a distraction pulls you away for longer than expected. We haven't had a single problem with ours. I'd say it's been one of the best Christmas gifts that I've ever gotten.
