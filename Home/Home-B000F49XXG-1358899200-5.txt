review/summary: my wife loves this (& i do too)review/text: we love this. i bought it for my wife, and now i drink as much as she does. this thing is great. it's all you need. and it won't break the bank, i would; however do like i did, and buy a 3 year warranty off of AMAZON for it. i heard that cappucino makers in general have a tendency to break, we've had good luck with this one so far, but have only had it for a couple of months.
