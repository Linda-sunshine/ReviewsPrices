review/summary: Can't get it to heat up on first tryreview/text: When I plug it in, the display comes on and & adjust the heat setting to what I want & I wait... and wait... and wait... nothing happens other than the display flashing the name of the heat setting. I unplug, plug back in & sometimes I wait & wait again, sometimes it heats up quickly. I thought that shaking it around to the extent of mimicking motions of ironing would help since it has an auto-off function and movement might bring it to life, which it did once or twice, but now I think the auto-off mechanism is just always engaged and the thing refuses to heat up. I didn't come to this conclusion until it was past the return period so now I'm stuck with a broken iron that I barely got any use out of, maybe 5 times.
