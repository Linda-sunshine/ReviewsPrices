review/summary: Really Like This Juicerreview/text: I will try to keep this review very short and sweet:-very user-friendly; this is my first juicer and it's so easy to use and clean-it works very fast and relatively quietly considering the work it is doing-I have been able to juice everything I have tried thus far: lemons (without removing the peel), carrots, pineapple (without removing the rind) apples etc.My only real complaint:-the chute you drop the food into is a little small; I typically have to slice my apples or lemons once or twice to get them to fitThat's about it. I use this to make my green lemonade every day (and some other juices, too) and really have been quite please with the performance. I've suggested this juicer to friends and family, and they have all been pleased with the purchase, too.Happy juicing!
