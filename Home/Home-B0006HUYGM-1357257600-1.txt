review/summary: Compact, cheap, and efficient.review/text: I opened the box, plugged it in, turned it on, and within 30 seconds, the dust compartment was full. It was amazing just how much dust and dirt this vacuum picked up that was left behind by our previous vacuum. It works well on carpet and wood (though make sure to disable the spinning brush before leaving the carpet, or you will find all of the pine needles from your Christmas tree scattered around the room!) and the detachable hose was great for upholstery and hard-to-reach corners. Without a long handle, it may not be good for people with back problems, but the lack of handle also makes it easy to store away even in the smallest of apartments. The only thing I can't comment on (yet) is the longevity of the device, but so far so good.
