review/summary: sharp Nowreview/text: My daughters kitchen had good knives but always dull. Got her this for Xmas and she sharpened all her knives. New Years Day she got 4 Stitches in her pinkeye's from washing one of the newly sharpened knives. Cut a avocado in half and the seed sliced into also. Works really good but be careful after your knives have been sharpened with this product.
