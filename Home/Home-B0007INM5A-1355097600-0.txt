review/summary: Great!review/text: I love the Ecopod system for my Senseo machine.Those Senseo pods are hard to find and now I can make my own pod with whatever coffee I want, and recycle it!You need to be sure that no coffee is on the outside of the ecopod though because it will clog the machine.If that happens, just clean the pod holder so that water can drip through.
