review/summary: Works greatreview/text: We've owned this machine for over a year, and it still works ok. Within the first couple weeks we thought the steamer broke (it wouldn't function at all), but it turned out we weren't cleaning it properly and it was clogged. (Gross, I know). The espresso doesn't seem to drip as quickly as when it was first purchased, and we can't seem to find the cause.
