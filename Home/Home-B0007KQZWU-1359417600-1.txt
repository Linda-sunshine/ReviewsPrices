review/summary: Inferior quality..review/text: The product is not 18/10 - it is actually 18/0 on the exterior with only a stainless 202 grade cooking surface. The 202 is about the cheapest quality stainless in use and is not generally accepted as cookware grade - It certainly is not professional grade. The 202 is prone to stains, rusting and easily scratches. Unlike true 18/10 these scratches will not self repair/seal.
