review/summary: Fairly good machine. Good price.review/text: We unpacked and tried our machine yesterday. We are not espresso connoisseurs, but I can easily taste the difference between drinks made from steam machines and pump machines. Also I know when the coffee is over roasted and has a burnt taste (like the Starbucks offerings). That's the limit of my tasting ability. For us this machine made delicious espresso and frothed milk for cappuccino. It was easy and straightforward to use.Pros:1. Easy to use2. Inexpensive ($81 total including shipping and $20 rebate).3. Pump driven4. Removable water reservoir.Cons:1. Small steam volume. The temperature quickly falls below optimal when steaming milk (green light goes off). One then has to close the steam knob and wait for the machine to generate some more steam before continuing. I believe this machine has a thermoblock instead of a boiler, which would explain the small steam volume. Machines with thermoblocks supposedly brew worse espresso because of inconsistent water temperature, but I cannot tell the difference.2. Low clearance between espresso extruder and base of machine.3. Low position of steam wand.For more explanation on the guts of a machine, esp boilers vs thermoblock machines visit..[...]
