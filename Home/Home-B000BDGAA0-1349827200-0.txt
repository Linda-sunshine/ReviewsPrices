review/summary: Too hard for mereview/text: Firmness of pillows is a matter of taste. The same can be said beds, and 1000 other things. De gustibus non est disputandum. For me this pillow is very firm. I normally sleep with down or down-alternative pillows. I slept (poorly) with this micro-bead pillow for one night and woke up with a stiff neck. It is going back to the Amazon mothership. Your mileage may vary.
