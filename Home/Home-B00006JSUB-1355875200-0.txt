review/summary: Great - butreview/text: I love this cast iron skillet. It works great out of the box, but I recommend ONLY cooking fatty foods in this for the first 5-8 uses to really build up the seasoning on this. I cooked bacon on this and i noticed a much more slick surface. Also, do not use soap or HOT water, as this removes any oils on the cooking surface. If anything burns and sticks to the pan, simply put some veggi oil or vegetable shortening in the pan and stick it in the oven at 350 for a hour, not only does this help remove any crusty stuck on food, but it also seasons the pan.Good luck
