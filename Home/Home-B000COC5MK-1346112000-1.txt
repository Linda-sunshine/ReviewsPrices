review/summary: Like Wine? Then you need to own this!review/text: I bought this 2 years ago, and it is still going strong. I LOVE this wine bottle opener, and have bought it for friends, family, literally anyone I know that drinks wine. They all love it too. The charge lasts forever, it opens every bottle of wine every time, and well, I just love it. I drink wine to de-stress, and so it is counterproductive for me to jack with that stupid old fashioned wine bottle opener when this one exists! Buy it, you will love it!
