review/summary: Best can opener everreview/text: Best can opener hands down. My old $5 one purchased from the grocery store killed my hands; not so with this gem. I now look forward to opening a slew of cans for a batch of chili or whatever my little heart desires, as its pain free. I've said multiple times to my boyfriend that I looooove my new can opener.
