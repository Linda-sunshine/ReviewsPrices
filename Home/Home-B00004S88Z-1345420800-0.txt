review/summary: Pressure cookerreview/text: The pressure cooker was everything it was promised to be in the advertising. It is of premium quality and the aluminum is a very good and heavy grade. I remember this brand from when I was a kid and they are the only gasket free one on the market. It seals well and does everything as promised.
