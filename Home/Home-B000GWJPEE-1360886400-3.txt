review/summary: Crane "Owl" Humidifierreview/text: I previously had Mr. Frog, but accidently dropped the tank & it cracked! Which brings me to the main disadvantage & 4-star rating: the tanks are awkward to handle in refilling; they don't have a flat-bottomside, so be careful & be sure you have plenty of counter space (or basket in kit. sink) to sit, while youdisassemble/reassemble. Like all humidifiers, they're not super-easy to clean; best to just empty &rinse this when you're not going to use it that day; give it a thorough washing/DRYING as instructed before storing for the season.Otherwise, they come in so many characters/colors & they work GREAT! It's amazing: the cool steamwill start shooting out almost immediately--depending on a higher setting to start. The Owl is quiterealistic, as was the Frog.
