review/summary: You get what you pay for, a simple vacuumreview/text: I own a high end Hoover and now this one. This one is around $60 and my other was around $200. This one feels like $60. It works, don't get me wrong, but the hose and attachments are lower quality, you can feel.One annoying aspect is the hose keeps unsnapping from the base when using the wand. It is a cheaper and stiffer hose compared to its more expensive counterparts, so I just have to be more careful.While it feels cheap, I think it will last. If you can't afford a $200 version or have a smaller home, this should work fine.
