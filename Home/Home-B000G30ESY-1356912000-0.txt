review/summary: As advertisedreview/text: After 40 years of a simple one-button rice cooker, moved up to a fuzzy logic device. I wish I had not waited so long. The Zojirushi is easy to operate and I really like the function that lets one set a finish time for a delayed start. Hoping microprocessor lasts. If not I'll go back to a one-button device.
