review/summary: Easy and great coffeereview/text: Our Mr. Coffee broke again and I decided to do a little research to see what else was out there. I came across this AeroPress as well as Keurig, and a bunch of other single serving makers. A few folks we know have the Keurig, and we like the coffee, but each cup is really expensive and you have to order a case of each kind of expensive coffee. Plus, we just don't like adding plastic to the landfill for every cup of coffee.Anyhow, we took a shot and bought the AeroPress. It is really easy to use. Just boil water on the stove. While it is boiling, I grab a filter put it in the bottom, select the coffee we want, put it in, get two cups out (one for my wife and I), put a little milk in mine and heat in the microwave for 30 seconds. By then, the water is boiling, and I pour it in the AeroPress, stir the coffee in the press, and it starts dripping through. I press some into my cup and the rest into my wife's and we each have a shot of coffee. I top them off with more of the previously boiled water, and that's it.I pop off the end of the AeroPress to remove the coffee grounds right into the trash, easily scrape off any remaining scraps, rinse it for a few seconds and sit out to dry. Cleaning takes 10-15 seconds.Now, we start each day enjoying some wonderful piping hot cups of coffee. It's made the way we want, with the variety we like, inexpensively, easy, and nothing added to the landfill.
