review/summary: Quick and Good-Lookingreview/text: I've had this electric kettle for a few weeks and am very happy with it. It's got a great design and looks good on the counter, and it can heat up a lot of water much quicker than our last kettle (a Breville).I do wish that the "on" light was a little brighter and more visible, and a button to flip up the top would be nice, but these are extremely minor complaints against a product that performs excellently. I love being able to pour out my tea and refill it without having to unplug any cords.
