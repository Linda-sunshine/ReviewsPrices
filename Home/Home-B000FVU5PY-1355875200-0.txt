review/summary: Pinzon King set in Maizereview/text: Beautiful set of sheets, fit our King bed with thick mattress very well. I've been married 48 years, so have bought many sheets and ended up with some I would never again purchase. These all-cottom 400 count Pinzon sheets, however, I will definitely buy again. If there is a downside, it is only that they don't come out of my dryer with no wrinkles (front-loader LG washer and dryer set), but if I wash and dry them on the PermaPress cycle (warm water wash) and then grab them out of the dryer as soon as it stops, these sheets have very few wrinkles.I like to make up a neat looking bed, with our sleeping pillows leaning against the headboard behind decorative pillows with shams and toss pillows, so a bit of the pillow cases are visible when the bed is made up. So I do the old-fashioned thing and I steam iron the pillow cases. That step is not really necessary because they are not 'that' wrinkled, but these cases are so nice that it is almost a pleasure to iron them.If you like an ultra high threadcount, silky sheets that are lightweight, you probably won't like these sheets, but the 400 thread count is high enough for me, and the cotton used is high quality, thus does not create much if any lint. The fabric has some nice 'body' and more weight than most sheets and feel very good to sleep on. There is a woven thread stripe that makes it easy to see the right direction to put on the all-around elastic bottom fitted sheet. I have been using and laundering these sheets for several months and am very pleased.
