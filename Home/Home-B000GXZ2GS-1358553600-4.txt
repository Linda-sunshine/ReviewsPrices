review/summary: Don't toss your French press yet...review/text: Perhaps I am a little bit biased since this was billed to me by a friend as God's gift to coffee, but I have not been terribly impressed. For starters, there are lots of parts to keep up with (six in all: the base, the plunger, the filters, the filter cap, the scoop, and the stirring paddle), and the process itself is quite involved: grind your coffee beans, put the filter in the filter cap, screw the filter cap onto the base, position the base over your cup, wet the filter, scoop the coffee in (2 scoops for one serving, 3 for two, as I was told), pour the water (wait -- you made sure it was exactly 175F first, right?), stir the grounds, insert the plunger, slowly press down the plunger to extract the rest (should take about 20 seconds), unscrew the filter cap carefully, whack the plunger to deposit the grounds & filter in the trashcan, distribute the concentrated brew amongst the other coffee drinkers first, add hot water to your concentrated brew, then fix it up however you like...Whew. It's more like doing a science experiment, honestly, than making a cup of coffee. Not to mention error-prone: Twice I've not screwed the filter cap on tight enough and ended up with a load of ground coffee in my cup when I poured the water. Oh, and it uses a ton of coffee -- I can make a full pot of French press coffee (about 32 oz.) with the same amount of coffee as I use to make 16 oz. in this device. And a word about the taste: The taste of the coffee is different -- not better or worse, really, but I am accustomed to the "whole coffee bean" taste of a French press extraction, and this definitely has the taste of filtered coffee.If you have the time and patience for this level of involvement in making a cup of coffee and don't mind using roughly twice the amount of grounds as you would in a French press, this might just be the device for you. Otherwise, I think I'll stick with my French press.
