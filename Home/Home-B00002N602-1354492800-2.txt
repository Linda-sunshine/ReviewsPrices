review/summary: Just what I was expectingreview/text: I have never owned a Pressure Cooker before. As a single person with a full time job, friends, family, etc....I find that I forget to put a roast in the oven in the morning.....or have an appointment or date and need to get dinner done in a hurry....this fits the bill for a single person. I &#34;might&#34; have ordered the next size up but this one will take care of about 90% of what I need it for.
