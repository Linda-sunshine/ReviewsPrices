review/summary: Great Valuereview/text: I love this chair!I was on a budget when it can to buying a glider chair since it was one of the last things we bought before LO arrived. Most of the other glider chairs out there are double or triple the price of this one so I was hesitant as to why it was less expensive but figured I would try it out based on other reviews.It is a little small but that works for me since I am petite. My husband (who is over 6' tall) looks like a giant in it but he is able to use it if and when he needs to (which is rare since I am the main one using it). Great find!
