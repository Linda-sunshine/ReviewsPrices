review/summary: Older model was good while it lasted.review/text: We bought the older version in 2009 and it was great for a few years until things started breaking on it (hose where attachments go, place where hose connects to the vaccum, on/off switch). Now so many parts are duct taped together that I want to replace it. Still does a great job of vacuuming but the hose comes off all the time and because the belt still moves when you use the hose, the friction has melted our berber carpet in a few places. Can't complain too much for the price though. Based on the most recent reviews this newer model is worse than the one we currently need to replace so I guess I'll keep looking. There just isn't much out there in the way of bagged vacuum cleaners anymore. Too bad!
