review/summary: my workhorsereview/text: If I could only have one pan in my house, it would be this one. It is the workhorse, and I often use it two or three times in the course of one recipe. I just wipe it out with a wad of paper towels and keep on going. I've had it for three years now and it's still working like a champ. Would definitely purchase this hard-working pan again!
