review/summary: Small and easy to take apartreview/text: Works great. i take it apart and store everything on a small shelf when not in use. Only takes a few seconds to put it together. Steam comes out really fast and with the included hand gaurd/flattener it works great for my work clothes. Im going to try steaming the couch with it soon, but so far i love this thing. Easier then ironing when you dont have space for an ironing board.
