review/summary: This kettle switches itself on and wastes a lot of energyreview/text: This kettle tales a long time to heat up the water and then continues to turn itself on wasting lots of energy. Now I unplug it every time. Also it does not work with a small amount of water. Poor design overall. I am disappointed!
