review/summary: The best scooper out there!review/text: I have this scoop in all three sizes, and love them all! It's great quality, easy to use (especially with arthritic hands or children), and has held up for quite some time. The small size makes about 2" cookies, the medium 3-4" cookie (depending on the dough, of course) and the large is a great multi-purpose kitchen tool. These scoops are very handy for making muffins/cupcakes the same size. I've used a few other brands, which were cheap, difficult to use, and broke pretty quickly when dealing with thicker cookie doughs. I'm so happy I found these scoops. You'll love them, too.
