review/summary: third home runreview/text: This is the third of these exact coffee makers I've had. I guess I wear them out and then search for another. This time, I found it on Amazon when local stores were out of this model. I have had no problems with any of these thermal carafe coffee makers and would recommend it to anyone who loves good coffee that doesn't have to be reheated as the carafe keeps the coffee hot for hours. Another plus:turns off automatically when coffee is done. No worries! Just sip and enjoy!
