review/summary: unpredictable outcomereview/text: I bought this breadmaker because it was highly rated by Amazon customers, but I am very disappointed in it. A major defect of this unit is the beeper, which is so quiet you can't hear it unless you are sitting with your ear next to it. As a result when you try to make raisin bread or anything with extra ingredients, it never turns out right. In fact, the bread turns into a mess with raisins and/or nuts stuck to the outside of the crust. Even worse is that if you try to use the Speed Bake option, it never signals when to add extra ingredients. Where were the engineers on this feature?Another problem is that a loaf of bread takes four hours to make, which is much too long, IMO. My old Kitchen Pro took less than half that time to bake a loaf. This unit does have a "Speed Bake" option, but even that takes two hours or more. Not very Speedy.So, with respect to those who gave this thing a high rating, I would pass on this one if I had a second chance.
