review/summary: So far so good!review/text: I have been using this product for about a week and right out of the box I noticed a big difference in the air when I cranked this humidifier on for the first time.I really don't understand when people complain that you need to fill it up a lot. It runs on water. Do you drive your car all day and then ask why your car needs more gas?? I fill the humidifier once a day and soak the filter in cold water each time I do so, as per the instruction manual's recommendation. It takes about 2 minutes to do all that and some slight lifting of the water tanks but no big deal.I live in a tri-level house and I set the humidifier in the main living room which is located on the 1st floor. It seems to hit most of the house as I have been noticing that I'm not getting &#34;shocked&#34; as much on my metal furniture in the downstairs family room and my sinuses are not as bad either.I really like the fact that you can &#34;set&#34; the humidity level and the unit will automatically kick on and off when that level is reached in the area surrounding it (when the unit has water in it, of course).All and all a good buy.
