review/summary: Not what I had hoped forreview/text: I have the Hamilton Beach Personal Pod machine, that is what this review is based on.I received the product quickly and they were what I expected, however.....as many others have stated I just don't get the quality of coffee I want. Even packed with as much coffee as you can squeeze in it, you can almost see the bottom of your cup through the brew. I even thought if you can use 2 pods at a time, why not 2 Ecopads? Not recommended, have paper towels handy if you try it.So I just started using the regular 12 cup filters and my usual brand coffee. The trick is to fold the top of the filter closed without compressing the coffee. Leave it loose enough so the coffee will completely fill the bottom of the basket without letting water go around or under it. Hence the larger 12 cup filter instead of the smaller ones. Took a few tries to get the fold right, but now I get good fresh coffee every cup.
