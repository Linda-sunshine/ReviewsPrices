review/summary: Similar to Teavana, but better pricereview/text: This teapot works well, especially for the price. I have used it for two weeks with a variety of teas and have not had any problems with leaking or the release mechanism. The only fault I have found is the lid comes off a bit easy from its hinge, but it is very easy to place back on and the plastic does not break. I have a similar teapot I received as a gift from Teavana and this product works just as well for a fraction of the price. An overall good value.
