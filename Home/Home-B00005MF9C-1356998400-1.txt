review/summary: My gosh best single cup EVER!review/text: I had been looking at the Keurig for a long time but didn't want to spend all the money and all I wanted was to use my own grounds. I had no interest in the K-cup industry and still don't. This coffee maker saved me tons! It comes with a washable filter (not as disgusting as it sounds) and the coffee comes out piping hot every time! No grounds are left untouched by the water and the flavor comes out full force. I could comment on the noticeable bean oil difference, but a little stirring takes care of that so it really isn't an issue. I think its because of the filter.All in all this is one of the best purchases I've made in years!
