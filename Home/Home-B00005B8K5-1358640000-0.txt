review/summary: Don't be fooled by the namereview/text: This is not your momma's pyrex. It's soda-lime glass, not borosilicate glass. As such, it should be more resistant to impact damage and less resistant to thermal shock. Oddly, one of our bowls split a few shards off the edge while it was sitting in the cabinet. Sounds weird, I know, but it did.We found the round bowls seal quite well, making them great for travel where they might be jostled around and even spend some time on their sides. The rectangular pieces do not seal well enough for that. The containers and lids are both easy to clean.
