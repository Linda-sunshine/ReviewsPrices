review/summary: Ginormous and Easy to Use!review/text: I had to read the instructions to wrap my head around how to use this canner, but after that it was easy to use. It's a great size and a great price for the size. It's great to just use for water bath canning, too, due to its gigantic volume.Haven't used it as a cooker, but the canner is fantastic and we couldn't be happier. I would recommend this to any home canner.
