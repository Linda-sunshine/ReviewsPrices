review/summary: Great coffee makerreview/text: We're really happy with this purchase. Our previous coffee maker was a cuisinart grind and brew, which lasted six years. We wanted something similar, but didn't need the grind and brew feature any longer. This has everything the last one had, plus some bonus features, like a temperature setting. There are other features we like better about this one, like the see-through carafe and how easily the coffee pours out. It's easy to use, but you do need to allow time to deal with the filter feature before the first use.
