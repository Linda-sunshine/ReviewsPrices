review/summary: Good Cast Iron Skilletreview/text: This "pre-seasoned" skillet comes ready to use, although, as the directions state, you'll need to season it from time to time, especially if you want to cook with only a little oil or if food starts to stick. Because I can't stand the idea of just wiping clean instead of using dishwasher soap, I do wash it, and I still don't need to season it every time.If you are unfamiliar with cast iron, you should know that it is indeed heavy. The main handle on this skillet is a little short and narrow; fortunately, it comes with a gripping handle on the other side for two-handed lifting. You also need to dry cast iron immediately to avoid rust. But you cannot beat cast iron for an even, radiating heat.This particular cast iron pan (12-inch skillet) is deep enough for pan frying, but it works equally well for saut&eacute;eing and even griddle cooking.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
