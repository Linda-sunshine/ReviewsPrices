review/summary: Great, Affordable HEPA Optionreview/text: I bought this as I live in a house built in the 50's. As such, the HVAC system that was added after-the-fact leaves a bit to be desired in terms of air circulation even with the help of ceiling fans. I do not have the option to open the windows to help air out the house in the winter.This unit makes a huge, noticeable difference in air quality!I have found it is most efficient in around a ~100 sq. ft. room (like a bedroom) but will work in a larger room (such as a living room) if you place it in the center of the room. It can be a bit awkward to have it sitting in the center of the room, though.The high setting is borderline too loud but if it is not in the room you are sleeping in it just kind of sounds like white noise. My boxer is not afraid of it (for what that's worth).
