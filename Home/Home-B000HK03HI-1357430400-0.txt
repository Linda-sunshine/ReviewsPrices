review/summary: A giftreview/text: I never got a chance to use this product, but I bought it because of reviews and it fit the bill. Nice grip and big knob was well received by someone with little counter space and no room for an electric. I'll post more info when I find out more about it's operation. It came well wrapped and ready to start cranking. I feel like it was a very good purchase.
