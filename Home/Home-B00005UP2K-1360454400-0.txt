review/summary: Leaking oilreview/text: Be sure to web search "kitchenaid stand mixer leaking oil" before considering this mixer. If you don't use it "often enough" - or use it "too often" - really, that's what the manufacturer says - the grease packed into the gear box starts to separate and create a profuse oily leak. This occurred shortly after warrantly, of course, and the cost of professional repairs would exceed the value of the mixer. Check out one of the fix it yourself videos on the web and you'll marvel at the internal design of the mixer - especially the loosely contained glob of grease just waiting to leak. I know there are a lot of 5-star reviews, but I wonder how many will have the same experience out of warranty.
