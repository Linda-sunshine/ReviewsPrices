review/summary: GREAT!review/text: This is a replacement for a very pricey pan which lasted but one year. The &#34;Thermo-Spot&#34; deal is not a gimmick. It heats up very quickly with virtually no stickage of the food. Highly reccommended replacement for those &#34;clebrity-endorsed&#34; pans, of which I have used in the past.
