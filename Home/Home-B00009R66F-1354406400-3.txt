review/summary: Broken upon arrival, but works well after repairreview/text: I purchased this unit Jan 2011 from amazon and tried to clean the carpet. It did not pick up water at all and the contents of the soap reservoir were all over the floor, what a mess.I figured that I must have put it together incorrectly, so I reviewed the machine and it was OK. Tried a few months later to clean carpet again and same bad results.Since I am a procrastinator , it took a few months to take it to the local Hoover warranty repair facility (close by) and they had to replace a variety of items, amongthem the pump (1 day fix). Anyway it works now, but it should have been tested before shipment. Too many reviewers here have had similar results. buyer beware.I would have given 5 stars if all was well at delivery, but can only give three for the problems. Would I purchase again, yes.
