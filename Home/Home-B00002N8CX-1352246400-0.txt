review/summary: Complete disappointmentreview/text: Did my research and had such high hopes, but this vacuum is a big disappointment. The unit and accessories appear as described, and it sounds strong and has good suction from the open pipe.Except, not. My house has bare floors and large (9x12) wool or cotton rugs, and 3 cats. After going over the kitchen, I turned around and saw the same onion skin and pet hair just mocking me. Then I spent 20 minutes on the living room rug, and afterwards it looked like only I'd crawled around picking lint by hand. Other gripes: the flexible hose kinks flat/closed (doesn't self correct), the floor tool clogs about every 90 seconds in both brush positions (and must be cleared WITH FINGERS, the debris doesn't suck off by the pipe alone).I don't have the heart to go in to more detail. I'm not sure how I'll get my floors clean with this device. This blew the budget I had to replace a 15 year old, $40, Dirt Devil little red canister (that finally burned out). Harrumph.
