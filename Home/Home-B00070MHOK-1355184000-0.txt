review/summary: Perfectreview/text: This steamer is perfect for what I needed it for. Many of my wrinkled shirts go unworn because I'm often in a hurry and don't have time/feel like getting out the ironing board. The water boils very fast, usually within a minute and I can usually get a few shirts done before the water runs out. You would probably want something bigger if you were steaming lots of garments at once, but for my needs this was perfect. Highly recommend!
