review/summary: I've now purchased 3 of these!review/text: This cute, quiet, effective little heater is perfect for my cold work office. It replaced a MUCH noisier quartz heater. The quartz heater is great, and it now sits in my bathroom where noise can often be a welcome thing, but at work - this quiet ceramic heater rules. For a little portable heater, it is very stylish. The other women at the office liked it so much that I've now purchased 3 to share - yes, our building is that cold! A few of the guys at work chuckle about these heaters - one called them &#34;plant stands&#34;. One teased us about the faux crackled paint finish, (it is just a textured 2-color plastic finish), but for the price, this heater is by far the best I've seen.Pros: Nearly silent. Stylish (for a plastic space heater). Gives off nice heat - with the door closed to my 12' x 12' office, things warm up quickly. Oscillation function. Controls are easy to use, (though I have never used the remote, it certainly looks functional). The body stays cool enough to rest your hand on it. Only the grill where the heat blows out gets warm.Cons: Some guys may tease you about this heater just because it's so darn cute. The thermostat only functions on &#34;high heat&#34;, not when you use &#34;low heat&#34;. On &#34;low heat&#34;, the unit just runs non-stop. When on &#34;high heat&#34;, you can use the temperature setting to keep the room from getting too warm.
