review/summary: Next best thing to $5,000 espresso machinereview/text: You easily could have called me skeptical when a buddy of mine told me that a $20 coffee brewer that worked like a percolator created the best coffee he had ever tasted. I just wasn't believing that one. As an owner of just about every type of coffee maker over the years, from espresso machines, to Kuerigs, to drip coffee makers, I thought I was pretty well versed in what made good coffee.I was pleasantly surprised to find that firing up this little pot with some fresh ground beans made for a really nice cup of java. The flavor panel is a bit different than my espresso machine, but certainly much improved over a drip brewer. It makes a very smooth coffee where you can actually distinguish the type and roast of coffee.It took about 5 different tries before I found the perfect mix for me. Even though this states it is a 3 cup maker, I use this for one large mug of coffee. I take three spoonfuls of beans and grind them to a course enough level that they do not move through the metal filter. After it finishes its gurgling, I pore the bulk of the coffee into a big mug. I then put in an additional 4-5 oz of water. I end up with a nicely strong 6-8 oz mug. Cafe Americano - here we are.The one issue I have with this brewer is that it is a bit of a mess to clean up. Also, when the heat is up too high the initial burst of coffee into the top chamber will squirt out from under the lid and send coffee all over the stove top. This must be why the instructions say to use med-low heat.Overall - I really like this little coffee pot. I save it for weekends when I don't mind the extra cleanup time and I can enjoy the nicer brew.
