review/summary: Great Little Grinderreview/text: I really hope Krups continue this model for a very long time. Its perfect for every day use. We use it to grind 2 cups of coffee 2 x a day. It does it perfectly each time, going all the way to a fine grind. Emptying the result into the machine is simply a matter of shaking and taking off the lid.Without a doubt the best grinder I've seen.
