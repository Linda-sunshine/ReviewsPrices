review/summary: These lids rock!review/text: I don't know where I would be without my plastic jar lids. We make a lot of fermented foods, water kefir, and kombucha. I couldn't live without these lids. We use these during the second fermentation of our kombucha and the result is a delicious and effervescent healthy treat. They are also great for sealing up leftovers in a glass jar instead of toxic plastic. I prefer using only wide mouth jars, but we have a few regular mouth, so we have lids in both sizes. The regular mouth lid will fit some reused jars from products such as spaghetti sauce, etc. LOVE THESE!
