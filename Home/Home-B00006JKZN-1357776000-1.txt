review/summary: so good I ordered a second for myselfreview/text: it is hard to find a classic waffle maker (ie, not belgian). my mom and I saw this waffle maker on sale at a specialty kitchen store (intials ws) a couple of months ago and she passed it up (her waffle iron was on its last legs, but she wasn't ready to give it up yet). fast forward a bit and her waffle maker is completely dead and she has realized just how hard it is going to be to replace (don't the manufacturers understand we don't all want belgian waffles?). my mom kept going into ws hoping that she might find one left, but no luck. I found it on amazon and ordered it as an early christmas present (for me as much as her since I love going over to their house for waffles). the first batch she made were perfect--crispy on the outside and soft and light on the inside. my mom declared it easily the best waffle iron that she had ever used (and that includes the ancient heavy ones that are 30+ years old).it heats up quickly, browns the waffles perfectly and, even though the plates don't come out, it is easy to wipe clean. if you love classic waffles, don't hesitate--buy this waffle maker. I love waffles, but usually just wait for an invite to my parents' house to make them. the waffles from this iron were so good that I ordered one and I am going to start making them myself.
