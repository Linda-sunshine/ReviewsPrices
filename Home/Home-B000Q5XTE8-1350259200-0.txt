review/summary: Good chairreview/text: After using the chair for a week I am revising my entire review. This is a good chair for a good price. I have never used an Aeron chair but the thought of paying upwards of a thousand dollars for an office chair is just not something that appeals to me. So this is a good substitute.I am raising my rating to 4 stars because I think the chair deserves that. But I am still unhappy about the customer service experience. It would cost them maybe 50 cents more to put a couple of color sheets in the box explaining how to properly use the chair and get the best service out of this model but they put only the bare minimum assembly instructions in the box. When I called the 800 number I only got an answering machine and no one has ever returned my phone call. By rights I should have docked their star rating for the poor customer service experience but I didn't.Also, I note that the Lorell website [...]Warranty.aspx?main=16 indicates that this chair has a 5 year warranty and the pneumatic cylinder has a lifetime warranty. That seems pretty generous considering the cost of the chair.All in all, you still need to actually sit in some chairs to figure out what you want in a chair. I did this after the fact by using my local office supply store as the show room for Amazon. If the local store had managed to have a better selection or value I would have returned this chair and bought theirs, but I didn't.
