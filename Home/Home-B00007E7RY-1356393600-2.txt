review/summary: Decentreview/text: It's rather too loud for my RV (35 foot), so I use it in my home now. It definitely cleans the air. I keep it in my shop area and run it when I'm cutting a lot of lumber on the table saw. It cleans air in minutes. The double filter really helps keep HEPA filter lasting longer. And the washable outside filter also keeps cost down. I like it, but don't love it. I still haven't found anything better, though. If you want this thing in a really quiet room, forget it. If you want it in a baby's room to make white noise, ti will be perfect. I also had smell with it sometimes, but then when I washed the outside filter, it helped. But the filter wasn't that dirty. Don't think that's a problem with the operation of the unit itself, but maybe a filter or even a basement issue. I'm not sure.
