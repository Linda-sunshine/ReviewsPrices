review/summary: Does it jobreview/text: Bought this spare along with the housing. Recommended by Consumer Reports so I got it for my kitchen and bathroom faucets. Can I tell the difference? No. Does it remove lead like it said its suppose to? Dunno. What's lead [rust] from galvanize piping taste like? Do I drink tap water? No, only steam distilled water. Do brush teeth using the faucet filtered water and do use filtered water to cook pasta and boil water but that's about it. Gave it 5 stars cuz when I boil water I see a great reduction in waste build up on the pot so it must be doing its job.
