review/summary: LOVEreview/text: If I could marry my mixer, I would. I even plan to get new attachments.Came a lot quicker than I thought it would, had no scratches and was the exact color I had hoped it would be. No adjustment to the height needed, works perfect, and has completely changed my baking for the better. I find any excuse possible to use it!Now I just need a cover for the mixer, a fitted cover for the bowl, and the scrapping beater blade. And my sister has been eyeing the ice cream attachment.
