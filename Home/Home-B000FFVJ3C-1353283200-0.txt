review/summary: Satisfiedreview/text: I haven't had it very long, but I am addicted to the apple chips it makes. I do not core the apples and simply slice them using my mandolin slicer, let it sit overnight in the dehydrator, and they are ready in the morning. They make wonderful, delicious guilt-free snacks!I've also done banana chips and banana ropes (long slices of banana), and I love both but really like the banana ropes because it reminds me of chewing on licorice, and since I can't eat licorice anymore, this is a nice substitute treat.I have not been so lucky in regards to vegetable chips. I've tried zuchini and sweet potatoes and neither turned out well. The zuchinis shrank to a size that was so tiny that they were almost unrecognizable. If anyone has ideas on making vegetable chips in this dehydrator, I'd love to hear them.It is for this reason I have rated it a four instead of a five; though it may be my fault for not doing it right. I would be nice if it came with recipes for doing vege chips--maybe there is something I need to do to prep them first. I don't know.Either way, it's a good little machine. I thought 5 trays was a lot, but now I am considering on stacking higher so that I can make more at a time. One tray fits the slices of one huge apple on the thick slicer of the mandolin.
