review/summary: Great if it works!review/text: The bread came out perfect, but after two uses the control panel locked on me. When it arrived, I noticed the packaging was repackaged using smaller staples. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and used it anyway. Boy, am I disappointed. I contacted Amazon and They rectified the issue by sending out a replacement. If the replacement doesn't work, I am not surprised with products "Made in China". I am disappointed that a brand name such as Panasonic gets its reputation down the drain because they outsourced it to China. What a shame of all the years of hardworking in building its name and reputation!10/25/2012I ordered a replacement. Boy, it doesn't even get any better. First, the light crust setting is too dark. The sides had a large amount of flour still unmixed and so are the corners. This led to burned sides the first time. The second time I scraped the sides to mix, but the bottom still had unmixed flour. The bread came out not even close to perfect. I am giving it another try with Panasonic by ordering another replacement because of the high reviews . This will be my third and last order from Panasonic. Very disappointed!!!11/24/2012After using three of this Panasonic bread machine, I have to say that not all are made equal. If you're lucky, you get a good one that makes perfect bread every time, but you still have to observe the dough as it kneads. In order to use this machine without problems, please read the five star reviews. The reviewers give you hints on how the machine works in details, which the manual lacks.Please note, I changed my rating from a two stars to a four stars due to the manual lacks of details that reviews mention.
