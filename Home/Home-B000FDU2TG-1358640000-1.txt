review/summary: Blends softer foods well; leaks with nuts and raw veggiesreview/text: When I first acquired this blender three years ago, it worked well the first two-plus years and I thought I found a sturdy blender. But little did I know that it only worked well because I typically blended softer foods such as bananas, apples, berries, lettuce, parsley, powdered food, cooked vegetable soups, cereal, avocados, already creamy nut butters - to name a few foods. But then I started to use nuts more often and noticed it would leak a little. As time went on, and as I started adding food like sliced raw beets, celery, kale, and other stronger veggies the amount that leaked increased. (Note: I never tried frozen fruits nor ice). However it only leaks if I want to blend tough foods. So if I want to blend only soft foods, it will not leak. So despite leaking with tougher foods, we will be keeping it for when we need to use less power.The first time I noticed that it leaks, I called customer service to see if it was just a defect of our smoothie or jug. Even though our warranty expired, they sent us a replacement jar FOR FREE immediately. It came within a few days of making the phone call and it worked well for a few days. And then it started to leak again. I then figured out that this was not engineered to handle tough veggies and nuts. It was after reading reviews for $300+ blenders that I found out that this was common among this specific blender (I purchased this before ever using Amazon).Cliffs:-Great blender for softer foods (foods excluding nuts and raw veggies).-Leaks ONLY when using tougher foods - still blends soft foods without leak after initial leak.-Great customer service.
