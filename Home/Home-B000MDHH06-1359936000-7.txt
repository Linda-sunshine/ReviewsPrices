review/summary: Doesn't juice Big Macs, only 4 starsreview/text: Just kidding, I love this thing. I bought it recently after watching a few of those food documentaries and realizing I don't eat enough fruits and vegetables and this is actually a pretty cheap, easy way to get those nutrients into my body without a lot of effort.I've been juicing for about two weeks and have no problems with the juicer itself but there are few minor annoyances I've run into. Sometimes, for whatever reason, a bigger chunk of pulp or rind will get stuck in the spigot where the juice comes out, clogging up the thing. You just have to remove the top part and fish out the piece but it's a bit annoying.Also, they show that you can fit an apple into the feed tube. I'm not sure where they're buying their apples but here in Brooklyn (I don't think we're known for extra large apples) none of the apples I bought fit into the tube whole. No big deal, I don't mind halving or quartering them but it's a bit misleading.Overall I've been able to make quick juices with lots of fruits and vegetables with minimal effort thanks to this thing. While I'm not going to go on some crazy juice-only cleanse, a glass of juice here and there for breakfast and dinner to go along with a meal has helped me lose some weight and given me the peace of mind that I'm eating more of mother nature's goodness than I would normally. Also, have you seen how much sodium is in stuff like V8? That's crazy. You don't need all that stuff floating around your bloodstream.
