review/summary: optimus h-5210 heaterreview/text: This heater is the best heater for the small price. I have had many room heaters that performed less and more expensive. You do have to be within 6-8 ft to benefit. Best for small rooms. It functions very well on low wattage of 400 and 800w.It also is super quiet. You cannot hear it.wil-indianapolis,in
