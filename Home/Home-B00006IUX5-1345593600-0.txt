review/summary: Grinds the Coffee Beans to fine powderreview/text: Never owned a coffee grinder so I cannot compare this one to others. Hence,4 stars as there maybe better ones on the market. I chose this one by price, cheapest, as I had a pound of coffee beans and no way to grind them. I ground all the beans at the same time in very small batches. Anything more than a tablespoon or so and the grounds got all over the place. Very messy job and grounds got out when I refilled it. Clean up by brushing out the remains, do not wash it as per the instructions. Keep all the beans and grinder very dry. Got as fine as I wanted. Not a daily chore because of the mess in my opinion. Would buy again if had a need but expect to keep on the shelf for years.
