review/summary: Just as Good as The More Expensive Brandreview/text: I bought the Lodge dutch oven as a gift for my son-in-law. He loves it and has used it many times. I had thought about buying him one from Le Creuset, but it was so much more expensive. After doing some online research I decided that this one would be just as good. My son-in-law agrees and best of all the Lodge is made in the USA.
