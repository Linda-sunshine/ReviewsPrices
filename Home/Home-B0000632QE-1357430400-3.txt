review/summary: not a fanreview/text: I had never used one of these before and was impressed with the reviews on Amazon, so this was the mandoline I picked. The price seemed right, and the reviews were decent. But when I actually used it, I realized it's not a very good Mandoline. I don't like that it's got no legs to elevate it like so many other models have. This is a dangerous tool, and without the legs it just feels a lot more dangerous. It also has no real option to adjust the thickness of the cuts. Other mandolin's have a dial for adjusting the width. This only gives you two thickness options, thin and thick. Also, there is no blade for crinkle/waffle cut, and you can't add one either. Some of these facts are in the description, but it's not until I got the product that I realized how important the options are. I was pretty disappointed with this, and will probably very rarely use it. I definitely recommend forking out some more money and getting something that's more versatile.
