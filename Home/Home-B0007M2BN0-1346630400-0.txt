review/summary: No microwave cooking time table on the product or on manufacturer's websitereview/text: So I had this thing lying around, and then I decided to use it to boil some eggs.Problem is, I don't have the instructions manual any more, so I don't have the table for the microwave times, and don't know what cooking time to set on the microwave.I really wonder why they did not just print the microwave cooking time table right on the product. Seems like a very obvious thing to do. Makes me wonder what these people were thinking. Or perhaps such a feature is patented already??So I went to the manufacturer's website at (...) hoping to find the instructions manual there in PDF format. No such luck.
