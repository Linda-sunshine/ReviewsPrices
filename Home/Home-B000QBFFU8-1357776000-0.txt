review/summary: Great, mostly easy to clean centrifugal juicerreview/text: This is a very powerful and fast centrifugal juicer. 5 different speeds for different types of fruits/veggies. It's only got a few parts that need to be cleaned, and the hardest one to clean is the juicing screen. Just make sure you have a good brush (one is actually included) and scrub it with soap after everytime you use it. The other pieces I just rinse well and let dry directly after use. They'll go in the dishwasher occasionally if needed.Before you buy any juicer, make sure you have an understanding of the differences between centrifugal, masticating, upright masticating, and dual auger juicers. There are a multitude of resources explaining this out on the internet, so I won't get into it here.
