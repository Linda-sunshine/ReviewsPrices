review/summary: Exceptionalreview/text: I have used Silpat Non-Stick Baking Mats for years. They are the best I have found and last a very long time, in fact, this order is replacing the mats I originally bought making them a terrific value. I definitely recommend hand-washing which is as easy as rinsing with hot water since they are non-stock. The half-sheet size fits perfectly inside half sheet size rimmed pans
