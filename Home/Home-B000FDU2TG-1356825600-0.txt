review/summary: Not a Vitamixreview/text: I went cheap and purchased this just about one year ago. From day one it didn't live up to our old Breville but I remained optimistic. It struggled with ice, frozen bananas and anything with seeds. I was always getting chucky results no matter what I made. After the wife made little comments for 9 months I took the big plunge and went for a Vitamix 1709. Without going into a full review, I don't know how we survived without it this long. Yes it is expensive but it's like an army tank compared to anything else on the market. Save your money and go with something that will last.
