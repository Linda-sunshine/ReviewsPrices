review/summary: homemade and nutritiousreview/text: It is simple of operate. There are plenty of recipes for about four different kinds of desserts. It also can be used for desserts that are a favorite in your cookbooks. The ingredients can be a little costly especially for fine ingredients. The price for the ice cream maker was good for me being at the time a lower price. I recommend because you can make the desserts your self.
