review/summary: LOOOOVE this!review/text: Despite getting a totally condescending look at Sur le Table when I asked if they had any of &#34;those microwave egg boiler thingies&#34; - I have completely loved this product! It's so fast and easy - no mess at all, so a breeze to clean up. If you're like me and forget that you have water boiling until it's all completely evaporated...this is the thing for you. No waiting for water to boil, no forgetting to set your timer...just pop it in the microwave and voila - you're done!
