review/summary: Presto 08800 Knife sharpenerreview/text: I purchased this knife sharpener to replace an old one that cost five times as much. After using it every day for the past four months, I am completely satisfied. It performs almost as well as the expensive one and if the motor was a little stronger, I would have rated it five stars. I was encouraged to buy this unit after reading a review by someone who had used it for over a year and was very happy with his purchase.
