review/summary: Did not know this had aluminum base, wouldn't have bought it.review/text: The aluminum base makes it heat up much faster and burns food or makes food, especially chicken, to the bottom. When trying to stir fry chicken, pieces stick to bottom so you have a layer of food on the bottom. I now have to stir fry chicken in a separate nonstick pan. I can stir fry my veggies in this pan without any problem without anything sticking to the bottom, just wish I didn't have to use 2 separate pans to stir fry.
