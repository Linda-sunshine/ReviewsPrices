review/summary: Works like the positive reviewers statedreview/text: I personally use it to clean the steps in the apartment building where I live which is about 6 floors worth. I was looking for an easier way to clean the stairs because I hate lugging our vacuum up and down the stairs so I decided to give this a try.It did a good job both with just the suction and the bristles spinning. There is a lot of suction when you attach the crevice tool so that's a plus too.It is pretty loud and does get hot but it has a chip on board to shut it down before it overheats. I have not yet gotten to the point where the vacuum shuts off because its overheating but after about 6 flights of stairs it was hot but was still working good. One down side is that if you start loosing suction power the filter is getting full and clogged which happened to me after using it twice (ie completing all the steps 2 different times) on the stairs. I thought that was pretty good amount of time for such a small vacuum. Its not like I didn't know that I was purchasing. Any filter type vacuum does this so I'd say this is still acceptable.I know some people commented that it was awkward to hold sometimes but after I used it about 5 times I just got used to it and didn't think it was a problem. The one thing I didn't like was that when just the suction was on and no bristles and the vacuum is not flat on the floor it will blow the the stuff around on the floor that your trying to sweep up.If your using it for small things like stairs, vacuuming in between couches and cars it does a fantastic job and I would recommend it to you because of its suction power, versatility and ease of use.
