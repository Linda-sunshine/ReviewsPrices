review/summary: Great Air Popper!review/text: This was a replacement for my dad's 30 year old air popper that finally died. He tried another brand, and it was terrible, so I got this one for him to try, and it's comparable to his old Orville Redenbacker popper. I'd recommend it if you like fluffy, perfectly popped pop corn!
