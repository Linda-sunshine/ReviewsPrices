review/summary: Really good! Better than my classic iron.review/text: I was skeptical about new irons after hearing from salespeople and others that they were not as good as the old metal irons. I shopped for this entirely online, so never even hefted this iron before the purchase. Amazon reviews come through again! The heft is good, good balance in the hand. Easy operation, very clear signal when it is heated to temperature, great steam. Very nice sole plate. Very crisp results easily obtained.I have only had the iron for a month or so. Only long term use will tell whether the electronic controls turn out to be what turns the iron into a paper weight. I will say that I wonder whether electronic circuit boards and appliances that heat up in close proximity to those boards work well for the long term.For now, I like it a lot, and I think the price is really reasonable.
