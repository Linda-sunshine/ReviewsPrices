review/summary: Filter worksreview/text: This is the best filter i have ever used. My water used to be cloudy before i used this, really works and tastes good.. When i first use this the water comes out a heavy flowing stream, after uses--maybe only 2 months the water trickles out thin,, but it fits my sink which has been hard to fit. I reccomend it over Brita
