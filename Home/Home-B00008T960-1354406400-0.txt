review/summary: LOVE this mat!review/text: I ordered the Silpat baking mat after seeing it used on several cooking shows and I'm here to tell you that it is simply awesome. My cookies slid off with no problem and in fact I could pick them up off the sheet with my fingers with no sticking. The mat was just a little too wide for my baking pan so I trimmed one edge and then it fit beautifully. I'm getting ready to order another one so I can use two sheets at once. Clean up is a breeze as I followed the directons that came with it. I store it rolled up with a rubber band to hold it and it fits nicely in my rolling pin drawer. I highly recommend the Silpat for any baking needs.
