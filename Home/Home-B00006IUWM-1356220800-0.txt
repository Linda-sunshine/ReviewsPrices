review/summary: A great gift for the picky mom.review/text: I will be honest, I don't cook so I am not writing this from my personal experience with it. I got this as a gift for my mom. She loved it, says it has been one of the best gifts I've given her. I am glad I FINALLY found something she actually uses and likes.My parents are old school (they are in their late 50's) and also hate throwing stuff away. My mom has this really nice knife set, I can't accurately say how old it is but I know she's had it for years and years, and she will not get rid of them. She just keeps resharpening them with a stone.I was shopping for a last minute gift for her and saw this and decided to give it a try, it wasn't that expensive so I sent it to her. I got a call from her telling me that she loved it, its amazing. Her knives are slicing through things like butter. My dad used it. My aunts went over with their knives to get in the fun.So this has been my one gift to her that has been truly impressive. Forget the expensive coffee maker (they prefer their 10 year old percolator), expensive purses (but this jcpenney one is so big and has all these compartments for carrying all these things I MIGHT need), auto car waxer (nothing beats doing it by hand) and countless other gifts stored somewhere unused.
