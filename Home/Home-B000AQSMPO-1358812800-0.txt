review/summary: I agree this worked great for about a yearreview/text: I got this as a gift andI really loved this coffee maker. It took about 2 months until I got the right combo of coffee and settings to get the strength I wanted in a mug, not cup size (use extra bold and run it through the same k/cup twice, once on med and once on small) . It worked great for about a year, then all kinds of goofy things began to happen...it would not brew, then brew only half the amount of water, now it makes this sick grinding noise and it can take up to 10 minutes before it brews anything. I called Keurig and they had me clean the spout with a paper clip and flush the brewer with their coffee cleaner, which helped for a while, but never really &#34;fixed&#34; the problems. And i have done this 3 or 4 times over the past year. For the person who say it's okay for a $160 dCoffee machine to only last a year, I do not agree. This Keurig is not a throw away $20 Mr.Coffee, this is supposed to be a top-of-the-line unit. Since I really like the taste and convenience of this system, I will purchase another once my unit finally quits, but will try a different model.
