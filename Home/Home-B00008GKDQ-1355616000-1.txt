review/summary: Indoor grillingreview/text: Made in the USA, doesn't get any better than that. Comes seasoned and ready to use. It was shipped lightening fast!I grilled filet mignon's the first night and the grill marks were perfect. I have a mid-century modern electric cooktop that is made by Thermador and the grill fit over the large and small element. It heated evenly, waited about 10 min for the even heat. The grill wasn't hard to clean either. I did season some more with olive oil and put it in the oven on very low heat. I want this to last for years and years. So please with this purchase, Hubby is relieved from the outdoor BBQ in the winter so I can use my grill inside.
