review/summary: My Breville juicerreview/text: I love my juicer. I use it almsot everyday. I love the way I can juice kale, all my green veggies. You get a lot of juice from it and the pluse is dry. I just cant say any thing bad about it. I love the way it cleans up so nice. It will juice up whole beets, apples (small ones ) three large carrots. I take a hand full of kale and a small hand of parley and bunch up together and push it down with the carrots. I would recommend this jucer to a friend.
