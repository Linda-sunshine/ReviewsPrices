review/summary: Great bargain!review/text: I bought this juicer after reviewing the Consumer Reports article about juicers. I had been contemplating buying a Breville juicer, but after seeing the ratings a similar Hamilton Beach juicer in the report, it seemed like a good bargain. So far, the juicer is working great. Cleanup is fairly easy and painless. Great product and great price for a beginner juicer.
