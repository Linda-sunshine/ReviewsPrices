review/summary: Lodge Dutch Ovenreview/text: the Lodge Dutch oven 7.5 Qt. is great.Nice big size for large roasts, short ribs, etc.Very affordable, and quality seems great.I would recommend it to anyone wanting an oven proof dutch oven, but not wanting to pay the premium price of the more expensive brands.
