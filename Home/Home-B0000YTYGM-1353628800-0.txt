review/summary: Makes great coffeereview/text: After much reading of reviews we decided to purchase this coffee maker. We have had it for several weeks and find it easy to use, and to clean. Nice to have a thermal pot which keeps the coffee quite warm for at least a couple of hours after it is made.
