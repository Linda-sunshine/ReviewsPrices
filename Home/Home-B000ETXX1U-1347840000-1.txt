review/summary: Best for only one personreview/text: We bought this air mattress to use at our daughter's new apartment until a bed could be purchased. My husband and I slept on it for a couple of nights. I have major back issues, and found the mattress uncomfortable, since having 2 people on the mattress caused a "dip" in the center. The mattress did hold the air well, and I think if just one person was sleeping on it they would do fine.
