review/summary: New to juicingreview/text: I bought this juicer due to the great number of reviews in the price point I was looking for. I didn't want to buy something so cheap that it turns me off of juicing, but also did not want to spend a ton of money when I'm not planning to be hardcore into juicing. I read that cabbage juice was a helpful natural cure for ulcers and heartburn so I figured why not. Well after it arrived I saw the sticker that said it was the same brand of juicer featured in &#34;fat, sick and nearly dead&#34; so we watched the documentary and decided to start juicing once or twice a day. We are pretty darn hooked. My husband loves it and says he feels great, the clean up of the mesh piece is a bit tedious but we make sure to clean it thoroughly after every use and have had no problems. We use the pulp in soups and other recipes such as meatballs and souffl&eacute;s etc and have noticed a lot of health benefits from the increase in veggies and fruits in our diet. We use it about twice a day. If you aren't sure about juicing and don't want to go overboard this is a great machine to do it. It is effective enough that the benefits are felt but not so pricey you feel like you spent a car payment for something to sit on your counter.
