review/summary: Good idea but has flawsreview/text: This product an a good example of something that could be perfect but has major flaws instead.Notes from design committee...1. Today we are going to design an egg boiler that gets filled with water and put in the microwave until water is boiling and eggs are cooked.2. Good idea. Will it be hot to the touch after eggs are cooked and user have to remove it from microwave?1. Yes2. OK - let us not put any handles on it then.1. Agreed2. Will user have to remove lid while it is hot?1. Yes2. OK - no handles on the lid either.1. Done2. After lid is removed and eggs are removed - will user have to remove hot silver tray?1. Yes2. Don't forget - do not put anything that could be cool that the user can use...1. Of course not2. How does the user drain boiling water?1. I don't know but I know we won't put anything to help...2. Perfect.I think you get the story. Very pretty design and eggs come out very well. But this contraption is plain dangerous - you are moving something full of boiling water with no handles to help and then to have to take eggs out, remove silver tray, and drain hot water with - again - nothing to grab onto. My over mittens got wet, I got burned once, etc...
