review/summary: Great product - better than narrow mouthreview/text: This is a great product and a real money saver. The wide mouth sealer works much better than the narrow mouth for two reasons. 1) the rubber seal ring is of a higher quality and design so the lids not get caught when removing. 2) there are three standoffs inside the sealer that keep the lid flat against the top of the jar while sealing (there are only 2 on the narrow mouth). I find the wide mouth jars much more convenient to use for storage than the narrow. I've only tried it with Ball Mason Jars so far.Update Feb 2013I love this product and have been using it for almost 6 months now and it saves me tons of money. About using with hand-held vaccum. The problem with using this with the hand-held sealer is caused by the raised lettering on the top in the area required to make a seal. This can be overcome a bit by placing the edge of the sealer just to the lower edge of the raised FoodSaver letters and pressing firmly against the top. I have considered sanding the letters off until smooth which then wouldn't require as much force to make a seal. However, FoodSaver has solved this problem with the recent T03-0023-01P Model (Note: P at end of part number), which is manufactured without the raised letters on top in seal area, thereby making it smooth and allowing for an easy seal.
