review/summary: Great product while it lastreview/text: I purchased this product and received it within two days. I used it imediately, I did some spot cleaning of the inside of my Dodge Charger and Mercury Milan stopping every ten minutes to avoid over heating.Next day, I used it on my stairs for ten minutes. I had no issues product worked like a champ. Until two weeks later and I used it again. The product did not having even a small percentage of the power it had the first time I used it.After a minute of trying to figure this thing out, I smelled burning. Do not get this product if you expect it to last longer than a month. Please read past reviews.
