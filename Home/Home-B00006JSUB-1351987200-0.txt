review/summary: My last 12" Skillet.review/text: This pan is the right size to cook for a family of three or more and priced right. It was very easy to finish seasoning by cooking bacon, sausage and hamburgers its first week. Now it splits time between my gas stovetop and oven. I put it in the cupboard for a day before bringing it out again.I've had a pair of 8" and 10" Lodge skillets for 20 years, they weren't big enough sometimes. To save money I kept buying then tossing out large, soon scratched up, non-stick skillets every couple of years...and yes I used nylon or wood spatulas in them with low to medium heat. So not worth it.On durability...my 83 year old South Carolinian grandma left her antique 10" Lodge cornbread skillet to my Dad, who passed away at 77 and left it to cook for my 41 year old brother's family in this century. One of his kids will likely get it. If cared for...meaning not left to rust Lodge pans do not wear out they just get smoother and better cooking with time. Do yourself a favor and get this pan. I plan on leaving all mine to my 10 year old pancake maker, Alexei.On weight...what better way to avoid old lady flabby arms than to lift some heavy iron each day.
