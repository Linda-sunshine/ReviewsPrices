review/summary: Excellent productreview/text: The product is well made. That's very unusual in this day and age. The cutting head locks into the main body of the can opener with ease and easily removal for cleaning. The can opener has a release button on the top of the main body to release the cutting head, as contrasted to most electric can openers which require you to turn their heads to a particular position to remove them. Most of the latter types are not substantially made, their heads do not lock in tightly and are at the very least difficult to use. These types appear to come down the same assembly line and merely change the brand name, color and may make a few cosmetic changes to the case style for marketing purposes. Each of these tend to be underpowered, noisy, the can jumps out of the track and gear, and do not cut well. West Bend also allows you order an extra cutting head where many others do not. The pluses of the West Best unit are, it's well made, it works, it's easy to use, it's far quieter than most other brands and it appears to be designed to last. It may cost you a little more money, but the lack of frustration is well worth the added expense.
