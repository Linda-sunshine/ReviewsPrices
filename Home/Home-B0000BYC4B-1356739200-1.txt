review/summary: An absolutely money saver!review/text: I use these smaller plastic lids for everything, especially tinctures, homemade creams and spice mixtures. If you buy spices and herbs in bulk, these lids are a MUST! I'll definitely buy more of these!I love these jars and they are an excellent alternative to the metal lids necessary for the traditional canning purpose. I primarily use the larger plastic lids for tinctures, juicing (shout out to Dan-The-Man who introduced me to these tops) and decoctions.I've bought about 3-4 packs of these in both sizes and 1 of the tops out of the lot is somehow warped (won't seal tightly). UPDATE: Apparently, this top just doesn't seal as tightly with liquids as it does with dried goods.
