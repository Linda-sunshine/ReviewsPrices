review/summary: This pillow was not an ideal solution.review/text: Thought this pillow would be great, but I was frustratingly wrong. Even without the pillow case (which the manual says not to do), the pillow maintained a stench and was unnecessarily firm, causing neck tension and migraines to worsen, instead of get better. Don't buy it.
