review/summary: Great Product.review/text: I have used my Lodge Logic L8DOL3 Pre-Seasoned 5-Quart Dutch Oven about a dozen times since I purchased it earlier this summer. Each use of this dutch oven has given me excellent cooking. Although I thought it's pre-seasoning was adequate I did season it again before it's 1st cooking. It's heating distrubution is excellent and this duth oven, although somewhat heavy due to it's cast iron, I am able to move it about rather easily, compared to my 7 quart dutch oven. So far it's my favorite cooking utensil.
