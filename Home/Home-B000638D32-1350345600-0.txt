review/summary: Great knife - sharp and sturdyreview/text: Very sharp as you would expect and a large blade, about 2-1/4" height. It's so big that it won't fit into my existing knife block. I'm glad it's straight edge instead of serrated so I'll be able to see if this worksAccu Sharp Knife Sharpeneron it once the edge starts to dull.Most knifes specifically tell you to hand wash vs. using a dishwasher. Most quality knives will rust. Surprisingly, I have yet to see any rust spots as of four trips through the dishwasher. Don't take it as a recommendation to use a dishwasher on it but at least you can be assured it won't immediately rust if it ends up in the dishwasher by mistake.
