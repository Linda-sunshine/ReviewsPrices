review/summary: I am constantly surprised as to how good this is...review/text: I purchased this about an year ago...and have been using it since. I use this about once a day on an average, and sometimes more. I am constantly surprised as to how the coffee comes out most of the time....I have gotten best results with espresso powder from columbian makes...(the cheapest coffee in shoprite aisles - the ones that come packaged like a brick)...and have enjoyed these more than the illy espresso...Over time, I have figured out how much to press (I have this tamper: http://www.amazon.com/Espresso-Tamper-Sizes-Alloy-Coffee/dp/B0001XRNEM/ref=pd_sim_k_2) and the crema comes out looking nice pretty much all the time now.The steamer is a bit lacking...but, is OK for my taste. A good investment...and has saved me tons on coffee shop cappuccino.
