review/summary: Not as Comfortable as I Expectedreview/text: I purchased this pillow anticipating that it would provide more of a cradling effect for my head. However, I feel that some adjustments need to be made to the pillow to either remove some of the filler beads and/or provide a looser fitting pillow liner that would lend itself to easier and better contouring and crading of the head.
