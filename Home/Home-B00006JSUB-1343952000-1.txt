review/summary: I love this panreview/text: I bought this and the twelve inch as a Xmas gift to my self. After doing tons of research on a new set of pots and pans I found the best for cooking and health was the cast iron as long as you purchased from the best company....lodge. I love these pans and cook everything possible. It is true they are naturally non stick and the clean up takes seconds with a good brush and hot water. The 15 inch pan cooks five chicken fried stakes at one time as well as a complete breakfast of potatoes eggs and sausage. This Xmas I will be buying sauce pans and a griddle. I am now hooked on grandmas cast iron pans and wish I would have taken her hand me downs years ago when offered.
