review/summary: Great gadget, just keep in mind what it's designed forreview/text: I love my stick blender with chopper - it's great at the things it's great at, and tons easier to use and clean than the Big Machine. Blending hot soup in the cookpot? Fab, it's the best thing ever made for the task! Quick easy chopping/mincing of nuts, fruit, onions, celery, green pepper, fresh herbs? Truly excellent. Use a quick pulse-type action to control how finely chopped they are. I made a quart of cranberry relish yesterday, pulsing fresh berries and a quartered orange, and I love the texture much better than the Big Machine. Smoothies? I can't really say, since I'm not a smoothie fan, but I'd recommend using small pieces of ice instead of whole cubes.But forget the whisk, just throw it away, because physics are against you. With a single high-speed rotary action, you're guaranteed to throw food all over everywhere without actually incorporating much air into it, and you will probably knock over the container in the process. I've tried it three times and I'm now convinced: Use a mixer or an old-fashioned rotary egg beater, either of which has two sets of beaters spinning in opposing directions. Or use a hand whisk, which you can use in a controlled side-to-side motion or in a "firestarter" twist (roll it back and forth fast between your palms).And if you're needing to process big batches or thick, heavy foods, then get out the Big Machine that's good at those things, and don't blame the little stick for not being a Big Machine. Guess which one I use the most? :)
