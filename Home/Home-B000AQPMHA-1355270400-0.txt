review/summary: Great Single Cup Brewerreview/text: Bought a B40 for myself and then, after using it, another for a gift. The latest version of the B40 (purchased in a department store) has (3) three brewing sizes. It's easy to use and makes a good cup of coffee. There are a lot of choices for K Cups so shop around. I also bought the My K Cup from Amazon that allows you to use your own coffee. The B40 has everything I need at a good price.
