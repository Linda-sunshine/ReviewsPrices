review/summary: Nice productreview/text: I bought this for use with the Mr. Coffee ECM160 4-Cup Steam Espresso Machine (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000U6BSI2/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_18) after seeing others' reviews that they wanted it for the same thing. Just like others have said, it will not fit all the way down to the bottom of the filter cup, but it will go down to about the 2 cup mark, which is perfect for making one big travel mug of coffee in the morning.
