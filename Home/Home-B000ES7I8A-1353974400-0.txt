review/summary: Makes the perfect cup of hot chocolate or tea!review/text: I bought this kettle as a gift for my 80 year old mother. I love it because it shuts off automatically and is safer than a tea kettle on the stove. This item is energy efficient as it is boils water much quicker! Mom can now have her hot tea or chocolate and I have peace of mind. This is a great product. I would recommend this product to anyone with aging (or young) family members due to its inhanced safety.
