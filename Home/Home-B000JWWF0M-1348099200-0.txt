review/summary: Would NOT recommend!review/text: This is my first review on an Amazon purchase. Most of my buys on Amazon I've really liked, not so with these sheets. I was looking forward to getting a great buy on 600 count sheets, and it is true--you get what you pay for. These are not only the most wrinkled mess of sheets I've ever had, but after one single wash--the pillow cases are tearing @ the seems! OMG! And they call these 'Sateen'--I had to look @ my order to see if I received the correct sheets!I love the color, the cafe is not a blatant bright gold, but a nice muted soft one. That is the best I can say about these sheets. The quality is simply awful... I lay in bed and cut off/pull out threads that hang out of every seem. Will NOT purchase again, and highly recommend to others not to buy these!
