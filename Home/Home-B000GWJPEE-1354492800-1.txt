review/summary: We Like It!review/text: My 12 year old daughter has eczema and allergies. We bought this model for her room to run at night during our dry winters. So far it's been great. We've been using filtered water since it doesn't have a filter in the humidifier. It's quiet and the steam comes out of Hello Kitty's ears. It's also easy to fill and clean, though the manufacturer is very specific on the need to clean it once a week with white vinegar. So far, it's definitely helped with the eczema. It seems to do just what's it's supposed to.
