review/summary: ease of usereview/text: a great and easy to use can opener i have had one for two years now it works everytime i use it almost everyday. if you have a hard time using a can opener like me ( an permanent injured hand) then try this one. i bought two more for friends who have tried mine and are thrilled for such a cheap price. thank you amazon for being the best company offering great options for the consumer.
