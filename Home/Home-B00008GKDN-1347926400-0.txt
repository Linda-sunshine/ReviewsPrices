review/summary: Love itreview/text: I do a lot of cooking with cast iron. In the kitchen. On the grill. In the fire pit. And especially camping. I have 4 dutch ovens, and a multitude of 12 and 10 inch skillets. But I didn't have any flat ones. Did I need this piece? Did it meet a need none of my others were meeting? No. But I thought for the price, why not add it to the collection. I wish I did sooner. The pre-seasoning on it is excellent. It worked like a champ from the get go. And unlike a lot of other 'pre-seasoned- pieces I have bought, there was zero sticking and it cleaned up with a rinse of water and a dry towel. Boom, done.Eggs, any style, have cooked perfectly with zero sticking. Bacon, steak, chicken, etc... have all come out great. I love this piece.
