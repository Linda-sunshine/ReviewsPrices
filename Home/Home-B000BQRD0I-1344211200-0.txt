review/summary: Works wellreview/text: I have had several steamers in the past. This is the first time I'm trying this particular one and it does a good job. I will never switch back to an iron. Pulling down on the fabric while steaming helps get out the tougher wrinkles. However you need to be careful because it can get hot. It comes with a pad that helps some. I have had problems in the past with mineral build up, my steamers don't last more then 2 years. This time I'm trying distilled water instead of tap water. I hope this will help the steamer to last longer. So far I am satisfied with it and the price is right.
