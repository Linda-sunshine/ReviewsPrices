review/summary: Still working things outreview/text: I haven't figured this product out yet. It doesn't come with good instructions so it's a work in progreess. The product itself is easy to use, and seems vey sturdy, but I can't get the coffee/water ratio right yet. I haven't given up, but it's easier right now to use my Kurig and then froth my milk with the Frabosk Cappachino creamer I bought also.....
