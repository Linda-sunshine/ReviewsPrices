review/summary: Effective, Reliable Ice Cream Makerreview/text: We've had this ice cream maker for a couple weeks. The Cuisinart unit works very well, is reliable, and produces good quality ice cream or sorbet once you find a recipe that meets your individual desires. One of the advantages to this unit is the cost saving in not having to buy crushed ice and coarse salt, or the hassle of trying to find coarse salt. I was a bit skeptical when we researched ice cream makers, but am happy with the decision we made to get this unit. Yes, the unit makes some noise, but it is not excessive or much different than any other ice cream maker. The motor works reliably and we have not seen any tendency for it to slow down as the mix thickens. I agree with another reviewer who notes that making your own ice cream is not a decision based on economy. Good quality ingredients are more expensive than what it would cost to buy your local mass produced bargain ice cream. The reason to make your own ice cream is to tailor a product to meet your individual tastes and create a product that the mass market may not fulfill. We recommend this product for people who desire a simple, reliable electric powered ice cream maker that does not use ice and salt.
