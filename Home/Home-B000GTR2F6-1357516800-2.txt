review/summary: Died too soonreview/text: I purchased my Keurig 3 years ago as well as one for friends as a gift. Both machines broke within a month of each other with same problem. I am so incredibly disappointed. I loved this machine! It is great while it lasts. But beware, it is not built to last long term. Like other reviewers mentioned, Keurig offered to sell me another at $79. My friend I gave it to was much luckier; they actually replaced hers even though it was out of warranty.
