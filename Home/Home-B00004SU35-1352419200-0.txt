review/summary: Don't waste your money... Update to Update...review/text: Bought this for my husband who has always been a big popcorn far. We were going between this and one of the move expensive theater style poppers. My husband loves how easy it is to use and how great the popcorn turns out. As the one who ends up having to clean it it is pretty easy to clean which is a plus in my opinion. For the price it is a very durable and dependable buy.Updated 20 Nov: My husband has used the heck out of this thing since I bought it. The only problem we have had which is the reason I am going down to 4 stars is that one of the wooden "knobs" on the top came off and ended up going into the popcorn while using it. He can't seem to get it to stay screwed on now and will most likely have to glue it back on. Now sure how that is going to hold up with the extreme heat. Guess we will see. Still a good product for the price.Update 10 Dec: After the initial problem we had we have been very careful with the popper. Unfortunatley last night when I went to wash it by hand the long metal "stirrer" came out. Once that happened not matter how hard we tried we couldnt get it to go back in.. Kinda discouraging since my husband really did like the popper. I know it was on the cheaper side but it is discouraging for it to have only lasted for a couple of months..
