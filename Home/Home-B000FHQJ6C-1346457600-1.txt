review/summary: Avoid! You get what you pay forreview/text: I bought this juicer in July and went with this version because of the low price - as this was my first time juicing and I didn't want to spend a lot if it turned out to be a habit that didn't stick. In summary - you get what you pay for with this juicer. I used it almost every day for about 6 weeks. At first, I was happy enough with the juice. I thought it was a little time consuming to clean, but had no basis of comparison with other juicers. I tried putting the plastic pulp container and the juice cup in the dishwasher a week in, on the top shelf, and both warped. The pulp container no longer tightly fit so pieces of pulp came flying out when the machine was on. A few weeks later, my husband put the dark gray plastic piece (not sure of the name) in the dishwasher, and afterwards, juice would spill down the side of the machine when in use, between the base and the pulp container. Still, we juiced on...I turned my juicer on this morning and was putting kale through when I noticed smoke coming out of it. The plastic (note: PLASTIC) piece that turns the blade was actually melting and smoking. Literally. The juicer is now useless and surprise - I'm outside of the 30 day return window. Lesson learned. If you're halfway serious about juicing, I would avoid this machine and purchase something with higher quality parts.
