review/summary: It's Fun to Watch Marshmallowsreview/text: I LOVE THIS ITEM. We do a lot of dehydrating of our produce for use during the winter months. The product fits well over the jar and seals the lid with ease. They say to use a spoon to pop the lid, but we use a clean paint can key and it works well. Now all of our work is safe for the Winter months and the tons of soup we are going to make. As for the marshmallows, they expand to at least ten times their size before retracting back to their normal size inside the jar. We have marshmallows stored so the bugs cannot get into an open back. If you do a lot of "dry canning" - I would recommend this product without second thought.
