review/summary: Awesome spiral slicer!review/text: I finally got around to making zucchini spaghetti. I'd seen a video of this slicer in action, but couldn't believe how easy, fun and great the results really were! Love it! Very effortless and had perfect 'spaghetti'. And it's very easy to clean. I am looking forward to using it more!
