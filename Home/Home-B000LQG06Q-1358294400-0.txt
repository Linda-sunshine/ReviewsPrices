review/summary: LOVE.review/text: Have you seen (or smelled) thisGum? This is what the mattress topper smells like. If you LIKE mint chocolate things, then the aroma will be pleasing. My whole room smells like mint hot chocolate, and I'm really rather enjoying it. But if you don't love Mint'n'Chip, the odor might be disturbing. I like it!As for comfort, it just arrived this morning, and I put it on the bed and let it "relax" until this evening. I'm sitting on it, now. I needed a topper because my mattress is a bit dated, but I can't afford a new one, right now. This topper is a stop-gap measure. I find the memory foam quite comfortable.However, I haven't slept on it, yet, and it's winter. I know some past complaints have been that the visco stuff makes people sleep too hot. This is supposed to be "ventilated" (and it does have tiny holes through it, all over), so it remains to be seen if this will be comfortable on warm nights.So far, I love it.
