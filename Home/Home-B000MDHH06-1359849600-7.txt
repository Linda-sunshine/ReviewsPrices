review/summary: Very good value.review/text: Bought this juicer as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. It's well constructed and the pieces fit well together. My only complaint however is that it sucks through the last chunk of your produce without juicing it, no matter how slowly or gently you are pushing.
