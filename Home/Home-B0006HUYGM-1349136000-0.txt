review/summary: Greatreview/text: I have been meaning to write this review for some time. I have received this vacuum cleaner as a gift about a year ago and it still appears to be in perfect shape. It really does what a vacuum cleaner is supposed to do as opposed to so many other models that don't. The only thing I wish could be improved is the stretchability of the hose. It is quite short. It works for what I use it for though, namely, cleaning a chinchilla cage and spot cleaning carpet and tile. Also worth mentioning is the fact that it is super easy to unclog it because the hose can be easily removed from the unit. This product deserves five stars.
