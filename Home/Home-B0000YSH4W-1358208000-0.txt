review/summary: One of my favourite books.review/text: I read this first at 12 and it has been one of my favourite books ever since. Jonas lives with his parents and sister in a society where everything is strictly ordered. It's safe and everyone knows what to do and how to act in any thinkable situation. The society runs like clockwork. Jonas is turning 12 soon. For the children, every year is marked with a Ceremony. At the Ceremony the transition is marked with new clothes, a bike, new duties etc. for each age group. The Twelves are given their assignment - their job for the rest of their adult life.Jonas' Assignment is a shock to him and to the Community. But he soon learns to cope with it - and with a dangerous new world of feelings, memories, lost freedoms and the consequences of brutal equality. The story follows him through most of his twelfth year, where Jonas' thoughts of his home drastically changes. He grows up fast - and then has to make a choice for himself and for the Community.
