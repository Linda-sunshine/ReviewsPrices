review/summary: Not another kitchen gadget... but you got to have it!review/text: I must have every kitchen gadget known to mankind, but when I saw this, I just had to have it! I saw it on the Today Show and let me tell you, it has lived up to my expectations. My recipes will never be the same! I love zucchini and yellow squash and I always sliced it with a knife, which means bigger and fatter slices that seemed to take forever to cook. With this, you thinly slice it in many ways and it cooks so much faster without over-cooking it and somehow it just tastes better! I've done zucchini, yellow squash, potatoes, cucumbers - it is just great! I think everything tastes better because it is so thinly sliced! You can make zucchini noodles and use them instead of pasta - and it tastes great! I highly recommend this if you are into cooking - just a great tool!
