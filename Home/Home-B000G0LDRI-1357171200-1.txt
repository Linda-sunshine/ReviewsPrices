review/summary: Love this machine!review/text: My doctor recommended that we get a humidifier so I chose this one. Our house is fairly small, 1200 sq. feet.I set it up in a central location and the humidity is changed in the whole house.Yes, the high fan speed is fairly noisy... its a fan, but I don't use that setting.I keep it at a medium setting unless we are in the living room or kitchen and then I turn it to low.We have no problem watching tv while its running nor do we have a problem with talking on the phone.
