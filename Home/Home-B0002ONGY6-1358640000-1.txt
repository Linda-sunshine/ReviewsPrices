review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I was expecting some decent quality out of this sheet set: softness, shine and comfort sleeping. I have another set of sheets from Bed Bath & Beyond, and I'll just say that it's better to spend some extra money and have better value!Definitely disappointed on the quality of this set, maybe some people might be happy enough with it, but I know that you can get something way better for extra $40!
