review/summary: GREAT for morning coffeereview/text: Makes a good strong cup of everyday joe. The first one of these that I received from Amazon had some manufacturing defects and so I sent it back. The replacement, received within the next 24 hours, was defect-free and performed very well. Some users out there report that the handle melts. Well, that's because they failed to place the unit slightly off to the side of the burner during the brewing process. in other words don't set the handle directly above the heat source.These units were designed for Medaglia Doro Coffee and Cafe Bustelo type coffees. Just don't tamp the grounds down into the reservoir for brewing and use a medium fine grind but not the fine grind that a true espresso maker requires.It's truly a great unit when used correctly.
