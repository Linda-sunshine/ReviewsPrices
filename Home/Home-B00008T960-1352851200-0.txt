review/summary: Will never bake without one of these again!review/text: I now have three of these, two large and one small. I bake a lot of bread and although I have a bread machine I like to shape the loaf and bake it in the oven. These pads make rolling out and/or shaping the loaves so easy especially with clean-up, just run under hot water with a little soap and no mess on the counter to scrape up. Also, my cookie sheets are like new with no baked on crud. I recommend these to anyone who bakes anything and only wish I had them before I replaced all those cruddy looking baking pans.Update: I just want to add how great these are for baking chicken parts or fish. Just lay the chicken breasts on the sheet, dribble olive oil over them with some herbs and bake. Of course, the sheet is greasy afterwards but clean up is a joy and chicken is done perfectly. I just lay the sheet in the sink, dribble some soap over it this time and add hot water, swish and rinse. JOY!
