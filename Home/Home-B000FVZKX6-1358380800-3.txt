review/summary: SO SOFT! SO WARM!review/text: These sheets are great - we received them for our wedding and they are amazing on a cold winter night. So soft and fuzzy - they're amazingly comfortable. They made a lot of lint in the dryer, so you may want to wash / dry seperate the first few times, but they are so thick and comfy.
