review/summary: It's a great griddle, but HUGEreview/text: This thing works great. We have cooked tuna melts, bacon, pancakes, and probably other things on it, and everything turned out nicely. There is some minor unevenness to the cooking surface, but it's nothing that can't be compensated for by moving items from one area to another as they are flipped, etc. The cooking surface has performed as expected, but we usually apply a small amount of olive oil before cooking. It also cleans up pretty quickly, and the removable drip tray is very helpful. The only drawback to this thing is that it is HUGE. Fortunately, we have a counter top to the side of our stove that is just the right size, but the hugeness of this griddle does make it difficult to get at for cleaning. Measure your kitchen carefully before buying.
