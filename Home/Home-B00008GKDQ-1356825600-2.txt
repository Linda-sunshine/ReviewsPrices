review/summary: Makes your stove dirty, and it's a bit big.review/text: This works as well as any other Lodge cast-iron pans (which some people will say is not very good at all, but it never gave me any problems.) However, it is a little too heavy for what we need. If you're making 4 burgers at a time, this is what you're looking for. If you're making 2, like me, then the Lodge Logic 12-in skillet works just fine, and there's no reason to drag out this giant slab of iron that requires two heat sources.This is very big, very heavy, and very sturdy, but my other complaint about it is when you try to use one side, the other side is dripping oil onto the stove. Eww. Then the stove gets sticky and hard to clean. I bought this after I got an 10.1-inch and a 12-inch skillet, thinking it's just as awesome, but I honestly rarely use this.I imagine we'll still use it to grill things, but I should have gone with a smaller grill too.
