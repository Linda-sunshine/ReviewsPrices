review/summary: The best everreview/text: I absolutely love this jug. It's heavy, not at all fragile, and the perfect size and shape. It takes up very little space in the refrigerator. I find it easy to use the handle, but I can understand why someone with large hands would have a problem. However, if your hands are too large for the handle, you can probably grasp the whole jug easily. As far as the lid, it is easy and intuitive to use - I can't imagine people having problems figuring it out. I originally ordered it to store iced coffee but I'm back to get more for all my refrigerated liquids.
