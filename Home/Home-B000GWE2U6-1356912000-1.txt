review/summary: Works Well but Poor Designreview/text: This humidifier works well and is cute BUT is poorly designed... there doesn't seem to be any way to take the top off for refilling without spilling water everywhere, and then it's awkward to refill because when you flip it over it does not rest flat. Overall kind of a pain to use.
