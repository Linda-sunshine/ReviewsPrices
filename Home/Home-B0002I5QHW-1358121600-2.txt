review/summary: Fast and inexpensivereview/text: I ordered this on Friday with Prime overnight delivery. It came early this afternoon. The local supermarket was having a sale on London Broil beef. I went to the store and bought a 4 lb chunk, brought it home and threw it in the freezer for about 45 min to firm it up. I took the very large steak out and cut it into apx. 3/4 inch cubes. I assembled the grinder in less than 1 min, and it I was impressed with how well the thing stuck to my Corian counter top. Anyway, it took me about 10 minutes to double grind the whole 4 lbs of meat. Because this was a stealth purchase that I don't want my wife to know about, I dried each part adter I washed it. This process took about 10 min, but most of that was in hand drying. If you were to put it in a sink rack the total disassemble/clean time would be about 2-3 min.When I started looking into grinders last week, I was looking at those $300+ models that will &#34;grind an elk in about an hour&#34;. Luckily, a more sober mind prevailed, realizing that I would probably never need to speed grind an elk :) So, having read many other reviews of this grinder I decided that for my 5 lb top grinding chore, it would be sufficient if it worked as advertized. Well, work it does. I was very impressed. For me, the reduction in fear concerning e-Coli in tube hamburger (which accounts for about 90% of all hamburger sold in big chain groceries) was worth the price. The whole reason I started looking for grinders in the first place is that our supermarket will no longer grind roasts for customers. There's no way I'm eating &#34;tube beef&#34; of unknown handling, so buying a grinder was a necessity, This one will do everything I need.
