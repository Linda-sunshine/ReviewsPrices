review/summary: Great little blending tool!review/text: My husband will not wear his false teeth...thus I have to blend his food! The first small blender I purchased from Amazon was 39.99 and it was a plastic cup that you had to line up and all the stuff to make it work correctly. I hated it....for it was frustrating to use if you didn't line everything up just so...so. It was a blessing in disguise when the plastic cup fell off the counter and broke. Thus, I needed a new something. Read up on the smartstick...and hubby said it would not work, I argued back! I won the argument! It is the best for blending chicken pot pies, lasgne, chicken, etc. I add a little milk if it is thick...and whip it up in no time! It is the greatest invention and barely any extra work. The other blender made me so frustrated and it was hard to use....and this stick is the best!!!!!
