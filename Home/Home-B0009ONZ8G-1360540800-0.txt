review/summary: Strong suction, cheap productreview/text: The suction of the vacuum is quite good. However, it feels really cheap -which it kind of is to be truthful- and super noisy. The vacuum pipe -flexible cord- feels little short as its keep popping out.On the plus side it does a very good job on both the carpet and wood floor.I wanted a vacuum that was light, and powerful enough, but cheap all at the same time and this is it.
