review/summary: Questionable qualityreview/text: I purchased it from Bed Bath and Beyond, at first the smell was hard to get rid of - silicone seal was releasing fumes under the high temperature. For the first 3 weeks we kept just boiling the water and pouring it out and it helped to get rid of smell. After 2 months of use the plastic cap started melting and breaking in small pieces, also the chrome cap came off loose and glue was crumbling into the kettle. I think it's a health hazard and also a fire hazard, I would not buy it again, my husband threw it in a trash ( $70.00 ) when glue particles ended up in his cup......I was thinking of taking it back to BB and B but it was over 30 days....It's a waste of money....it's a shame for Capresso !
