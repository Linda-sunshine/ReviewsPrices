review/summary: Not worthy of Cuisinartreview/text: I own many Cuisinart products, and have been a customer since my first food processor 30 years ago. This is the first time I have to say I think Cuisinart should be ashamed to put their name on this product. It just looks and feels cheap. The on/off buttons are tiny. When the unit is off I keep thinking it's on since the light is so bad it still looks red when it's off. The swing-out brew unit never looks like it's fully closed. It just feels like it's going to fall apart.Pros:-Brews a decent, very hot, pot of coffee-Works with standard replacement cone filter baskets (unlike other Cuisinart brewers)-Carafe seems solid, and keeps coffee hot a long time. Pour-through feature works perfectly.Cons:-Looks and feels cheap and cheesy, negative style points-Doesn't feel like it will hold up-For the price, expected a sturdier unit
