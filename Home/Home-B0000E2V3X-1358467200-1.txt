review/summary: Best pizza I've ever made in an ovenreview/text: After more pizza stones and pans than I can remember that failed to produce great pizza, we had completely given up making pizza indoors in an oven, and make it exclusively on a gas grill. Seeing the amazing reviews, I had to give this pan a try. I'm now a convert. I can make pizza whether it's pouring rain, the dead of night, or so cold that my little grill won't get hot enough. No more schlepping crusts in an out of the house, no more crusts falling through the grill grate.We bake pizza at 525F, and it cooks so quickly and evenly, it's like having a pizza oven in your home (well, ok, maybe not totally, but compare the price!). And the last good part is the cleanup: there's almost none! Wipe it clean with a sponge, dry well, and rub a light coat of vegetable oil - that's it. I expect to have this pan forever - or until one of my kids steals it!I'm going to try to bake a loaf of crunchy-crust bread to see if this pan can do what nothing we've tried in our oven has succeeded at: a real French pain de campagne.
