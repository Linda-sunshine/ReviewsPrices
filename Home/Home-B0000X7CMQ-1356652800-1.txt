review/summary: Two Years Later...review/text: And, I still love this coffee maker. Why? 1.) it's freaking fast. 2.) carafe keeps coffee hot a long time. 3.) durability.I went through a lot of coffee makers before picking this one. As it brews a new pot, I decided that I would definitely get another. As I won't need to do that for a long time, I decided to review it on Amazon instead.
