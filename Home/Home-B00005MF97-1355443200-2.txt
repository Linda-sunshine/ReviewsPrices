review/summary: Cranberry Relishreview/text: I planned to make Cranberry Relish for Thanksgiving dinner without chopping by hand. The B&D worked very quickly and although I had to reload twice to chop 1 pound of cranberries and a large orange, I'm sure the 3 cup bowl will be adequate for most future tasks.
