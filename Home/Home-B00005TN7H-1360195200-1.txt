review/summary: Perfectreview/text: I owned two foodsavers and never thought to purchase this unit. It wasn't until I was watching some youtube videos that I thought, &#34;Why don't I have this sealer?&#34; I use the sealer with my 2 quart ball jars that I use as cannisters. It works great. I know all of my pastas and grains will stay fresh and insect free until I use them all up.
