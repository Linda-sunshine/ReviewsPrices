review/summary: Christmas giftreview/text: This appears to be exactly what I need/want for a Christmas gift for daughter. Difficult to rate until it's actually put into use, but delivery was prompt and the item appears to be perfect. Finding it on-line was really helpful because health limitations prevent me from getting out to stores or malls. The only glitch was that I tried to pay using redemption points from a credit card and it didn't work out and I wasn't able to change the payment method. I'll try again on another purchase to see if it works.
