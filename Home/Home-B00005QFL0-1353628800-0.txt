review/summary: Very good machine.review/text: Works well, makes a nice crust. Very happy with this so far. The only problem I've noticed is that the yeast dispenser is a bit too small for the largest loaf in some recipes. I had some difficulty getting the full amount to fit in there. Next time I need to do that, I suppose that I will put the liquid in first and dry ingredients on top with the yeast sitting there (as with other machines), and forget about using the top dispenser.
