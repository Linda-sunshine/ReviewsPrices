review/summary: Poor Quality and No warranty responsereview/text: Purchased scale because of consumer reports good rating and warranty on product. Scale stopped working entirely and can't get it to turn on. Have tried two e-mails and two phone calls to Taylor USA for a warranty repair or replacement. No response to all attempts to contact Taylor scale. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! It does not work very long and when it does fail, your on your own. Taylor scale won't even answer complaints.
