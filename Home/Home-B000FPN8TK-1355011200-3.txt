review/summary: Very easy and neat, loose leaf tea makerreview/text: This product is easy to use and easy to clean up.I prefer loose leaf tea and was looking for something that was easy and didn't require cleaning multiple parts after making tea.It's great for the workplace, and I've shown it to several tea drinkers in the office who use the pot with strainer method. I've even bought one as a gift.Light weight but sturdy plastic, no glass to break or parts to disassemble - if you want a quick, easy cup of tea, this product will do it for you without a fuss.
