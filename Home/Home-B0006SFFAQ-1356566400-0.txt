review/summary: Solid coffeemaker...fun colorreview/text: We have owned several of these over the year. They are a decent for the price, and I consider them mid-range. They are not super cheap and not super expensive either. It looks nice on the counter. We clean ours pretty regularly since we have hard water, it takes a toll on a machine that dispenses water to the filter like this. Nonetheless, it is pretty easy to clean and makes decent coffee. Would buy again.
