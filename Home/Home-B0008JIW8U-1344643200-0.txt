review/summary: Horriblereview/text: I have had 2 of these coffee pots in 2 years. The first one lasted less than a year. Contacted Mr Coffee and they replaced that one free of charge. The second one died this morning. I will not be replacing it with another Mr Coffee pot. First the clock quit working and now the on/off switch has stopped working. BUYER BEWARE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
