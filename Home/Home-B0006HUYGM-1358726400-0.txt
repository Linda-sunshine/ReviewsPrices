review/summary: Best hand vac I've ever usedreview/text: this thing has more suction than my Kirby vacuum! the best hand vac out there, plus it has all the parts to get in those tight spots when you want to detail your car. I love it. And it's a must if you have pets. 1 dog and 4 birds make quite a mess and I keep it in my bird room and it makes cleaning up after them a snap!
