review/summary: Lodge Pizza Panreview/text: What can I say, this pan is everything it's supposed to be, solid and built to last. So far I have cooked pizzas and roasted veggies and without incident. I played around with preheating the pan and not preheating the pan. For me, I find the best results without preheating. I simply shape the dough and transfer directly to the pan. Then dress the pizza, put it into the oven until it's ready. The pizza will also slide off the pan with just a little effort. I highly recommend this item
