review/summary: Great for what it's needed forreview/text: I ordered this for my husband who refuses to give his plants regular tap water. So yes, this is not for our drinking usage, is for the plants. Since was for the plants only, I didn't want to spend a lot of money & wanted something that wouldn't take up a lot of space. Plants & hubby seem happy, so guess it works just fine.
