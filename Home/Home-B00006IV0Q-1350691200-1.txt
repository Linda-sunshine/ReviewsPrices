review/summary: Great coffee, but not strong unless you limit # of cupsreview/text: I've had this percolator about two months. We like it so well we are purchasing another one for our vacation home. Here are the pros and cons:Pros:Nice looking, easy to clean, makes HOT coffee that stays hot, flavor is fresh and clean, not burnt and muddy like you get in a drip coffee maker. Nice smell throughout the kitchen when it is brewing, and it brews very quickly.Cons:No "sneak a cup" while brewing (although it brews fast so that's not a big deal); no automatic shut off (although it is easy enough to purchase a timer plug that you can plug it into that can regulate shut off time). But the biggest problem for us is that it is impossible to brew more than 6 cups of really strong coffee. The basket is simply too small to be able to hold enough grounds to make strong coffee. The way we deal with this is just to brew six cups at a time, which is fine for two people because the cups are actual 8-oz cups, not 6-oz like the drip coffee makers. So we each get three full cups in the morning, which is all we need. But if you wanted to brew more than 6 cups, it will not be strong. This is the reason I gave it only 4 stars, otherwise I would give it 5.For us we never have a problem with grounds leaking into the coffee. We use percolator-grind coffee; any finer and it will leak out (you cannot buy off-the-shelf bags of coffee, you either need to grind the beans at the store with their machine set to percolator grind or go to Starbucks or Peets and ask them to grind it at that level). We use a regular basket paper filter, we just poke a hole in the middle of it and it works fine, no need to buy the more expensive filters that come with the pot. But again, you cannot overfill the basket trying to get stronger coffee.
