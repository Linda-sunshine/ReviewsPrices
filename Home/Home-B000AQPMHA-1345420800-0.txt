review/summary: I Flipping Love this Thing!review/text: I am coffee challenged. I love drinking it but my coffee making skills are sub-par. I make swill. That means when my husband travelled, I had to drink really bad coffee. Oh, sometimes I would drive to McDonalds to buy a cup of joe but who wants to do that every morning?So last week, I sprang for the Keurig Elite model. And I flipping love this thing! I make awesome coffee now! No mess, it's flavorful and I have so many choices of K cups. My husband also loves it, so much so that he upped his coffee consumption resulting in a quick order of decaf K-cups to prevent a jazzed-out spouse. My son got some hot cocoa mixes that we're trying out as well.There are only pros for this machine--no negatives in my house. I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could. I wish I had gotten it sooner.
