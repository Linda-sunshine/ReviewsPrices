review/summary: 4 Cup lighter than I thought, pours messier than I'd likereview/text: So with the sheer size of it, I expected the measuring cup to be quite heavy and it wasn't. Don't get me wrong, it has some heft, but not hurt your wrist kind of weight when empty. The handle has a raised ridge just before where the handle meets the cup. This ridge for your thumb adds more 'grip', making it less likely you need to turn your thumb into the cup to get a good hold and possible contaminate your liquid or dirty your thumb. You just grasp the handle and the ridge provides enough resistance for your thumb and everything is hunky-dory. The down side? The pour edge is designed such that if you pour too fast the liquid doesn't flow out the cup but some 'hangs onto' the cup and runs down the side and off the bottom, spilling it unnecessarily. I know you can pour slower, but remember that heft? You want to pour this fast enough to lighten the weight fast so you don't end up with wrist fatigue or whatnot. It's minor but worth docking a star.
