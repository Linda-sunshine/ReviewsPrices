review/summary: Worked...for about a yearreview/text: Bought this unit because of the reviews and because I love to drink cappuccinos on the weekend. Unit worked great for a year...now the pressure isn't strong enough to push the water through. I've DE-calcified the unit three different times and there still isn't enough pressure. I really don't know why there are so many 5 star reviews...my guess is the reviews weren't updated after the first year. You get what you pay for.
