review/summary: Some things never change!review/text: Yes it's true some things never change and that's a good thing. Pyrex has been around for a very long time and it hasn't changed much. It's good to know that Pyrex is still Pyrex and to me the Pyrex name spells quality! Unlike many companies that once had a good name and now has lost that quality reputation by selling out. succumbing to corporate greed and putting profit before quality. It's good to know Pyrex refuses to do that. Everything from the lids to the heavy, thick, solid glassware, to the way it's packaged to protect the product but still be easy opening for the consumer make this item worth buying. The sizes are fairly small, i wish the description was better. It stated size in volume rather than measurement. l need larger sizes than this set offers. However; I will still put this set to good use. That's my reason for just 4 stars. Pyrex gets 5 starts! The seller gets 4 because I feel it needs a better description of the exact pan size so the consumer gets what they need preventing ordering mistakes and returned items. I own the size that I need, measured it but could only find the size listed in quarts. That didn't help me get the right item that I wanted. The picture looks like the one I wanted but it's actually just half the size. My error of course it's just I feel that if its a 6x9 pan then help me out and say so. That way I get exactly what my wife needed. Of course I'm out of my element here in the first place. This would not have happened if I were ordering tools. Do you see my point? A little help, a better description please. Thanks. You wont be disappointed with any Pyrex products! I hope my review helps you. Enjoy your day!
