review/summary: Cleaner air, works great...review/text: Great at 140 when I bought it and now 130. Great for a small apartment and/or decent size living space. After 1st 2 weeks of use, noticed that I dusted less. It comes with prefilter installed that I clean every week with a vacuum cleaner outside and it helps. During pollen season I can have the slide door open and the purifier running minimized the yellow dust so that I can enjoy the spring air better. Easy to control and operate. Plug in, turn on, breathe... you do have to take it out of the box 1st and wraping...
