review/summary: Not for someone with Arthritisreview/text: The button to activate the water heating process requires you to use a lot of pressure with your finger to push the button down. The person whom this device was intended to use is unable to use it; which makes it pointless for my application. Otherwise the unit functions as it should by producing very hot water in a quick amount of time.
