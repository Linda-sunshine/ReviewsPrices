review/summary: Pretty crappyreview/text: It does worka bit, but unless you havce a lot of free time to lose, or you find using this relaxing, this is not worth it at all. It takes too much time to do a shirt and you have to refill it for every shirt. I rather work an extra couple of hours and just send my shirts to the cleaners. Weak product.overall, I say it's better to just use an iron or cleaners, definitely dont get this!
