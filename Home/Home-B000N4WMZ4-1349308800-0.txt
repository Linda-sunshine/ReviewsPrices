review/summary: Nice Size and Shape- Poor Qualityreview/text: I have owned this oven for a year and I love the shape and size of the cookware- Its perfect for boiling pasta, soup, and any one pot meals to feed 2-4 people. However the largest disappointment is the quality.After using for a few weeks, I noticed a chip in the enamel on the top of the lid. Knowing that it was made in China I had a moment of concern, but figured that since it was only on the lid, it would not be in contact with my food and the worst attribute would be aesthetics. However after a few more uses, more chunks of enamel were missing and the exposed ares started to rust.It has yet cracked on the inside, but I daren't wait until that happens because I don't want to ingest lead (yes, stereotypical paranoia attributed to 'made in china' products), however I notice pronounced scratches on the white enameled cooking surface.After the year, the surface enamel has eroded in quarter sized imperfections and will no longer be used in my household. Now I wish I could find this same shape and size at a more established enamel cookware company.
