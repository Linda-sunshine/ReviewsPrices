review/summary: Divided on this product.review/text: My girlfriend decided that she no longer wanted to buy plastic water bottle. Even though I prefer Poland springs. So I get this for her. The package arrived on time, I followed the cleaning and usage instructions. The problem is that the water in this thing taste horrid! It has a coal like taste. I know this may not make sense but let me put it to you this way. The tap water tastes better before putting it into this thing. That's a huge problem. We're keeping the product to see if the water eventually tastes any better but who knows. I'm not sure if it's just Britta or a defective product.
