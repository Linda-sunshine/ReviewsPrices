review/summary: Great Alarm Clock (especially considering price)review/text: I've had this alarm clock over a year now, and it has been great. Aside from all the great features everyone else has mentioned, there are two features I really like:1) The snooze length is adjustable. I don't understand why 9 minutes is the traditional snooze duration. I set my snooze to 10 minutes to simplify the early morning math of figuring out how many more times I can hit it.2) Hit the snooze more than once to get a longer, uninterrupted snooze. The alarm goes off and you want 30 minutes of snooze? Hit the snooze button 3 times. Now instead of a three short snoozes, you get one long, uninterrupted one.
