review/summary: The cleaner does not have the features described in the product descriptionreview/text: The major problem with this cleaner is with the product description. The cleaner is described to clean bare floors. I have not tried to clean bare floors because the bare floor attachment,required for cleaning bare floors, is not supplied and is not listed on the Amazon web site or the Hoover web site as an accessories for this cleaner. I believe the cleaner does not really clean bare floors as advertised.The product description indicates that the cleaner rinses as well as cleans by keeping detergent and water separate and automatically mixing them. It does not rinse. Detergent and water are mixed and there is no clean water tank.The carpet cleaner works very well for basic carpet cleaning. The only problem with the design is the brackets for holding tools. The front tool storage where you have to store the spin scrub tool is not designed for that tool, as the cover will not close with the tool in place. The rear bracket for holding the brush tool does not secure that tool very well, and that tool is often falling off when you are moving the cleaner.
