review/summary: Much more than a regular stick blender!review/text: Given as a gift to someone that has limited kitchen appliances so the many features and attachment really eliminate the need for other appliances.First try was a carrot cake. NO more grated knuckles or finger tips shredding the carrots. The chopper made short work of a tedious job when done by hand.The nuts also process to the desired dice.And I can tell you that it was the best homemade carrot cake I have had!
