review/summary: Like this set very muchreview/text: Really enjoy this set of Stainless. First one for me and I am a professional chef. I use these at home and like the weight, even heat distrubition, no drip rims, and handles that never get too hot. I think the lids seem a little cheaper quality, but most likely because they don't need to be as sturdy as the pots and pans they cover. These clean up real well with the Bar Keeper's Cleaner and maintain their shine. The saute pans give a good browning and caramelization that you can't get from non-stick.
