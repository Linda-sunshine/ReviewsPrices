review/summary: Quality Construction!review/text: This thing has 579 reviews for a reason - it works!I haven't seen construction on a plastic like this in 20 years. I never expected it to be so well built. Sure, the reviews said it works great but my gosh, the construction on this thing is FANTASTIC! Right when you start playing with it you'll see how well everything works and how smoothly the pieces work with each other. It's hard to explain.We have had this for a few months now and use it weekly. In fact, it rarely leaves the kitchen counter. We really only use the thin spiral slicer but we experimented with the other two blades (we just like the thin one the best). We couldn't fool our kids into believing the zucchini pasta was real pasta but my daughter still loves it (not the other kids though).One suggestion - try raw sweet potato with the skinny spiral blade. We eat it raw, without even cooking it - it tastes delicious.If you're thinking about this one don't, stop reading the reviews and buy it -lol!
