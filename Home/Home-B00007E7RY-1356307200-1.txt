review/summary: Works greatreview/text: It works great, the only downside is the fact that it shoots air up which causes it to get caught under picture frames and anything on your wall making it go back and forth when on high power if that makes sense. Outside of that it is reasonably quite and works just as described, you can definitely tell a difference in the quality of air from one part of my place that has the filter and one that doesn't.
