review/summary: Works as advertised!review/text: What can I say, it just works! It holds a large capacity of water, which my wife and I finish quickly never the less :) The water feels fresh and filtered. I used to own a Brita pitcher, until the filters, including the replacement ones I bought from several places, stopped working. I mean, there shouldn't be any drama with a water filter, and so far, this one works fine.
