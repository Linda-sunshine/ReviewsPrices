review/summary: Midland Emergency Radioreview/text: Received the Midland radio in timely fashion and programmed it per directions. Withinn a few days we had alerts for severe weather via this radio and reacted accordingly in the middle of the night. We wouldn't be without this product. We plan on getting these for our family members for their own protecton. This radio is as necessary as smoke detectors in your home.
