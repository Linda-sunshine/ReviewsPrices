review/summary: Not easy to openreview/text: The pitcher is a good size for someone who doesn't want to take up too much space in the fridge, and I expect that it will filter water as well as any other Brita, which is fine. However, be aware that, at least with regards to the one I received, getting the top off to fill it with water is not easy. I had to pry it off with my fingernails. Maybe it will ease up with use, but in the meantime I have to tell my 93 and 97 year old parents for whom I bought it not to push the top on tightly or they may need help getting it open.
