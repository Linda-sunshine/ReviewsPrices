review/summary: Good humidifier but insane price on replacement filtersreview/text: I'm giving this humidifier four stars because it does a good job overall. My main gripes are pretty much the same for all filter-type humidifiers--and that is that, at least in our area where the water is "hard," filters last hardly any time at all before they need to be replaced. You can extend the life some by carefully rinsing them, using the water treatment fluid, etc. But they all, way too soon, get hard, and you're getting use out of only the bottom half of the filter, and the top half gets dry, and then, you're pretty much done. So time for a filter replacement. Those filters are always expensive, but the replacement filter for this one is insanely expensive--$24. Ridiculous! I hate having to replace them as often as I do, but I was glad to find a "universal" filter at Wal-mart for $10. It's made to be cut down as needed, but it doesn't need to be cut down at all to be used in this humidifier, and it works every bit as well as the high-dollar version (and neither work long enough, but no difference with this one). I'd have thought $10 was expensive, but it's darn reasonable compared to $24! (My only other gripe about this humidifier is fairly minor. The two tanks are shaped to look cool, I suppose, but, as others have noted, the weird shape means they won't stand up by themselves as you're refilling them. You get used to it, and it's not that hard, but a better design would have easily eliminated this problem. I wish Honeywell had opted for function over "form.")
