review/summary: Worst Coffee Maker Ever - Do not Buy!review/text: I purchased this product to replace a Zojirushi coffeemaker on which the heater had burned out for the third time.Like some other reviewers, I was confident that the overflowing issues associated with this machine were nothing more than user error issues. How wrong I was. This machine will spill coffee and grinds all over your kitchen at will, regardless of how you place the lid or how clean you keep its waterways.While attractive, it is cheaply made. The LCD screen is small and unlit. It is diffucult to tell whether it is set to AM or PM, or if it is set to programmed brew. The labeling on the function buttons has mostly worn off. This is, in my experience, an overpriced piece of junk. The only pro that I will offer is that the coffee that*does* make it into the caraffe will remain hot for hours. Do yourself a favor. Do not fall victim to any positive reviews for this trash. Furthermore, do not,as I did,think yourself smarter than the rest and that these problems are user caused. They are most certainly NOT. You will own, as I regretfully do, a one hundred dollar paperweight.
