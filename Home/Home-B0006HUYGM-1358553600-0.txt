review/summary: Does not pick up fine cat hair on microfiber very wellreview/text: The 71B hand-held vacuum is strong and has several nice features including the hose and the easy switch from horizontal to vertical cleaning. However, there are a couple things that miss the mark in my opinion:1) Our household has two fine-haired felines (a long-haired tuxedo cat and a short-haired domestic tabby). Their fur gets buried in our microfiber couch. Using this vacuum, I have to go over and over one spot just to try and pick up all the hairs, but in the end, there are still hairs stuck on the cushions. I would say the vacuum cleans about 90% of the hair, but the rest needs to be wiped off with a wet paper towel.2) Another not-so-great feature of the vacuum is the filter. Trying to clean that thing with my bare hands is a pain in the rear! I would recommend getting a replacement filter from the Eureka site that is washable.3) The vacuum is quite heavy so it might become inconvenient to some if cleaning a large area.
