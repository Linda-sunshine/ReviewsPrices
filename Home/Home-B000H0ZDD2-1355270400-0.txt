review/summary: Keeps a 10X12 foot room Dryreview/text: Humidity is an issue for our smallest bedroom, bought this a month ago and it has kept the room drier and more comfortable. The fan is not too loud I am very sensitive to sound but it is comparable to a room fan. Now in the winter I just run it while at work and it is very effective.
