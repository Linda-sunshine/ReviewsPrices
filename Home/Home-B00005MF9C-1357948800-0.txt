review/summary: Excellent and Sturdyreview/text: This great little one cupper is just perfect for my needs. It makes a large cup of really hot coffee in a really nice tumbler and keeps the coffee hot for a long time. It's easy to clean and maintain without the use of filters, and is perfect for me to use several times a day when I feel I need a refresher cup. It's quick and easy. We put a nice little tray underneath it so there are no leaks or runs and it works great. Excellent product.
