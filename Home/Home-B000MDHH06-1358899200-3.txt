review/summary: Awesome Juicerreview/text: This is my first juicer recommended from someone on Facebook. The price at Best Buy was $99 which was right up my alley plus with it being my first time juicing I wanted to start off small. This juicer is powerful and gets the job done!! It produces a great amount of juice on just about everything. But of course if the veggies doesn't have a high juice content, you can't be disappointed (it is what it is). The only thing that I dislike is the clean up and sometimes pieces of the fiber left in the chutte shuts up and out everywhere especially lemons and limes. If you are making a considerable amount of juice, just expect to clean/empty the juicer several times. Other than that, I LOVE MY BREVILLE!!!!!! Highly recommend this one for first timers.
