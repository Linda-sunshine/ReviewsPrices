review/summary: stopped workingreview/text: I bought this about 6 months ago and a few months in, the coffee maker essentially stopped working. You are supposed to be able to push the button down once and the brewer should stay on. After about 3 months, my button stopped working. Sometimes there is a small point that the light comes on. I have to hold the button at that exact location for it to brew. Other times, I can't get it to light up anywhere or end up with half a cup of coffee. I assume that there is a short somewhere but I can't get in the coffee maker to check the wiring. I only make coffee once or twice a week so at most I used this about ~25 times before it stopped working correctly. I'm on today to buy a new coffee maker.
