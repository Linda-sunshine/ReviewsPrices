review/summary: High Quality Pitcherreview/text: The seal on the top is excellent. You need both hands though. Press down on the outer "rim" of the lid and then turn the center tab clockwise slightly and it seals tight.We use the pitcher to make "sun tea". I start with cold water and put in a few tea bags and let it set in the sun for an hour or so (or, forget the sun, just set it in a warm place). It tastes so much better than using hot water, and it is so easy.I also use one of the jugs for milk. 2 liters equals 1/2 gallon.I purchased these jugs after our "automatic" Mr Coffee ice tea maker (with the plastic jug) broke and do not miss seeing those unsightly tea stains on the plastic jug.
