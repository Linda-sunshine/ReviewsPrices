review/summary: Cool Mist Humidifierreview/text: The product is very easy to use and works fantastic, we also have the frog. Originally purchased for my daughters fancy rat who at the time was suffering from respiratory illness. However, with continuous use I have had to place a towel under the product because of condensation build up and to absorb moisture. I thought maybe it was just my particular unit but, I have spoken to several other people who have had the same response. My conclusion is the setting was placed to high for too long. Hope this helps :)
