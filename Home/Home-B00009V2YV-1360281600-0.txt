review/summary: Best everreview/text: I bought this radio after experiencing a tornado in my area and I had JUST had a baby so I was terrified in my basement under my pool table with a infant while my husband was at work and we had no electricity so I had no idea what was going on. I learned from that experience and got a emergency radio and all the other safety jazz ALL people should have in a emergency. I love this radio it gets the job done and it has not failed me even through all kinds of bad weather we have had. The radio tells me even before the internet does. Its honestly amazing and could save your life... think about that.. I know I have.
