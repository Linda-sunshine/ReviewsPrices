review/summary: Didn't get hot or even warmreview/text: I received this dehydrator on Thursday and set it up right away. It is now Sunday, and my peppers are still not dried. Since I have never had a dehydrator I didn't know what to expect. I cut everything up according to the instructions, set the dehydrator to 135 and still, limp peppers 2 1/2 days later. When I turned the dehydrator up to 145, it did get hot. So, it seems that this unit will only be good at temps over 135 which is not useful to me as I would like to dehydrate herbs too. It is going back.
