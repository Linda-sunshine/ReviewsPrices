review/summary: Waited too long to get this!review/text: I should have bought this product as SOON as I saw it. I thought my life was complete with a mini-food processor till I got this. It's excellent for blending soups, smoothies, and baby food. So much nicer than using the food processor for big batches. Not too noisy and not too heavy. The cord is just long enough to reach but not too long that it gets in the way. Also easy to clean.
