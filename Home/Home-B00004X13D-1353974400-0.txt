review/summary: Great from the start!review/text: This is a great waffle maker. I've never had any problems with the waffles sticking, and I don't use cooking spray. (I did oil it down before the very first use). It takes a little while for it to warm up, but if you start it before you start the waffle batter, it will be ready when you are. It doesn't have a timer, but it really doesn't take long to fully cook the waffles. I'd definitely recommend this as a great buy!
