review/summary: I'm a believerreview/text: Obviously no shortage of raves here. I'm still gonna weigh in though because I'm a believer. Travel mugs are one of those things - if you care about them at all, you care a lot. A crappy mug sucks the joy out of your coffee routine. I had this mug for, I don't know, 3 years? 4 years? I lost it a couple weeks ago. Heartbroken but hey, at least they didn't go and change the design and make it suck in the meantime. So, I'm here on Amazon to buy my second. Won't consider anything else. Awesome mug. No leaks, great insulation and despite some other people having problems snapping the hinge --- mine operated great, always. No problems. If you're looking for a new mug, buy this. It'll be your own travel mug revelation, I promise.
