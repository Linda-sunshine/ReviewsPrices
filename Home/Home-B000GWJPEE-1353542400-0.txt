review/summary: per doctor's ordersreview/text: I got one because my eye, ear, nose and throat doctor told me I was all clogged in the tubes between my nose and ears and a cool mist humidifier would be the answer to help "un-clog" me. So based on all the other reviews I purchased this humidifier and just love it. It is quiet and the water (if filled up) lasts forever. I noticed a difference right away and my husband says I no longer snore...now THAT is bonus.
