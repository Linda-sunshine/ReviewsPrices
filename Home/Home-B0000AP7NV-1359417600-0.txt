review/summary: Pretty Happyreview/text: I had another water pitcher filter, a filtrate, and it worked pretty well. The reason I bought this one was because I could not find a replacement filter for the other one in any store. When I finally found the filter here on Amazon, it was only $2 cheaper than this new pitcher and I already checked, this uses standard Brita filters which are easy to find and far cheaper. It is also worth mentioning that the water taste is just as good if not better. Last but not least, the lid of the Fitrate pitcher would leak if you tipped it too far, a problem I have not seen with this Brita. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a compact water filter pitcher especially if they were planning on buying a Filtrate pitcher.
