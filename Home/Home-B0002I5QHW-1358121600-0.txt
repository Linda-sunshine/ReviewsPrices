review/summary: Great for stuffing sausages!review/text: I bought this to make a small number of sausages. I have not used it for pasta making so I cannot comment on that. For sausages, however, this is exactly what I wanted for making just enough sausages for the two of us. It goes together quickly and easily. There was no frustration involved with this machine once I read the instructions and used it properly. Base is not to be submerge in water, but it cleans easily with a damp cloth. It attaches securely to the cabinet and fills the casings quickly and easily. It was easy to disassemble and clean. Conveniently comes with a sturdy deep tray to keep all the parts in. All around a very nice, well-engineered little machine. Not expensive, not heavy, not noisy, doesn't occupy a lot of storage space, not frustrating. Just a lot of fun to use, and it made great sausages. If I ever use it to make pasta, I'll comment on that later.
