review/summary: Love it! Buying a second one.review/text: Pizza gets made at our house almost every week. Feeding a crew of seven (including two teenage boys and their father) requires a couple of large pizzas. We had an old aluminum pizza pan on hand and for awhile limped along with a jelly roll pan for our second pizza. When I realized that homemade pizza (yes, dough, sauce, the whole works) was such a hit with the kids I decided to buy a second pan. Did some reading online and found that a pizza stone was the preferred method. But then I went to Amazon to make the purchase and this was the number one selling pizza pan. After reading the reviews (including one that was just spectacular!) and reminiscing about my great-grandmother's kitchen filled with cast iron, I went ahead and made the purchase. Just used this pan for the first time last night and all I can say is WOW! I knew I was replacing that jelly roll pan, but this puts my other pizza pan to shame. The crust came out nice and even (no lumps and bumps), beautifully browned, and even a little crispy on the bottom (that never happened before!). All seven of us rarely agree on anything, but we do on this -- we need another one!!
