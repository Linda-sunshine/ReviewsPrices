review/summary: given me good coffee but bad vibrationsreview/text: I have an older of these units that developed a leak( from pump to steamer), which I was able to fix with epoxy.In all fairness I often left the boiler turned on all day which would have weakened the plastic tube prematurely so I washappy that a little jb weld epoxy could fix the machine.This machine makes a very reliable cup of coffee/expresso. Much better than any steam toy.However I bought another of this machine. That unit had a pump that vibrated overmuch. It always had a very loud pump, and then after 4 months of limited use(at most 2 cups a day) it got very quiet and wouldn't put out enough pressure to make coffee(let alone espresso).It looks like DeLonghi is pretty good about providing a replacement if the machine goes bad in the first year.Within a few days of my mailing them they have sent a replacement...
