review/summary: One Loaf a Week For Over a Year Now! Works GREAT!review/text: This is a great, basic break maker. I've made at least one loaf a week for over a year now with the Sunbeam 5891 2-Pound Programmable Breadmaker. I've used almost every setting and this machine works like a champ - sturdy and dependable. It is not for people who make bread daily or need a more robust machine, but for the general user, the person who would rather have a good loaf of homemade bread than the expensive stuff from the store with chemicals, this is a Perfect Machine! I make a lot of pumpernickel, wheat, sourdough and herb breads with this machine. The non-stick basket and kneading attachment clean up easily and have taken a LOT of use. I cheat and throw them in the dishwasher and they are just as good as new. Candidly I have no other breadmaker experience, but after researching a lot of cheap and spendy machines, I picked this one over a year ago and am VERY HAPPY with this machine! Highly recommend!ps: you will likely go through a learning curve with breadmaking as we all have, BUT it will get better and the bread will get perfect and delicious... it takes time and learning and some mistakes, but you CAN get a really great loaf of bread every time!
