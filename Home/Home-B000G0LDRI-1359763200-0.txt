review/summary: Honeywell Humidifier w/ air-cleaning feature.review/text: I was convinced I would have to purchase a much more expensive product to improve the quality of the air inside our homethis winter. What with dry, forced air drawn from the highly polluted outside environment, I was resigned to something much more costly.This humidifier is absolutely great. The air is comfortable, not only in the room where it is located, but in the whole house.Dust doesn't accumulate as quickly--and in the dirty city that is a real plus.And--it shuts itself off when one of us forgets to fill it.
