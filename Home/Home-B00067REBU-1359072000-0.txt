review/summary: Non functionalreview/text: I gave this to my daughter as a present. Unfortunately it sat in the box for a year until she tried it. When she attempted to use it it would not work at all. Another example of cheap Chinese crap. Her fault for not trying it out sooner and discovering it. Last sunbeam equipment I'll buy.
