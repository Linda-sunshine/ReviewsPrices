review/summary: Hoover SteamVac after two years of usereview/text: We purchased the Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner in late 2010. We were impressed how promptly it arrived from Amazon. The other reviews were very accurate. The carpet cleaner works well. We use it at both our house and our son's house. We have three cats and he has two dogs. We used the tip from other reviewers about mixing boiling water and hot water in the clean water tank. It works well. Thanks! Overall we have gotten our money out of it. There are quality problems with the plastic dirty water tank and the dirty water tank latch. The front of the tank cracked when I was converting between floor and hose mode. I covered the crack with water proof metal tape for a quick fix. It has continued working, so I never replaced the tank. The left hand tank latch broke on the "knit line" due to a plastic molding flaw. The machine works ok without the latch. I worked with engineering plastics for years as an engineer, so I am comfortable with plastic parts used in demanding applications. However, this part was poorly designed and badly made.The only operational complaint I have is that the unit leaks a little water when shut off. I just set it on a plastic boot tray to contain the drainage. The two parts broke soon after purchase, but the machine works ok. The failed parts should have been covered under warranty, but the nearest dealer is 90 miles away, so we just lived with the problems. We have cleaned a lot of carpet with the machine and clearly got our moneys worth. However, I cannot recommend purchase of this cleaner due to Hoover's quality problems.
