review/summary: drips really badreview/text: it says in the manual that it will drip while it starts up and to give it time to warm up. i did this and at first it was great, but when i got to the second shirt, i noticed it was dripping. i faced the nozzle down and a flood of water came out of the hose. then it stopped creating steam all together. i had to turn it off and back on for it to start steaming up again. while it was working it did get the wrinkles out pretty well.
