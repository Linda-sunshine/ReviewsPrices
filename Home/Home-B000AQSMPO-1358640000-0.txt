review/summary: Worst product I've ever bought !!!!review/text: I was so disappointed when I got this out of the box and used it!! I have yet to make a cup of coffee out of it that doesn't have a horrible chemical after taste!! I don't know if its the plastic tubing leaking toxins into it or if it's the kcups which are loaded with the artificial sweetener sucralose. But I tried to contact the company and I just got brushed aside. I then called to get a refund for the disgusting k cups that aren't supposed to be diet but contain sucralose and the bitch told me she couldn't refund me I would have to try to return it to the store. I liked the idea of how quick and convenient this product is but I can't get over the taste
