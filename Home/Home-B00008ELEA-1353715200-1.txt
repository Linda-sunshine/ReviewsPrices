review/summary: Nothing like perked coffeereview/text: Our old Faberware Percolator gave up the ghost after many years of service. This is almost identical - they've improved the cord. The metal is slightly thinner and the cover does not fit as snugly as the old one. It brews excellant coffee and quickly. We're happy with it after using it for over six months.
