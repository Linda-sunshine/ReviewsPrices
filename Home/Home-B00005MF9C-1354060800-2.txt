review/summary: Great Productreview/text: I bought this because I attend &#34;sewing weekends&#34; with friends and some of us drink flavored coffee, some of us drink regular coffee and some of us drink decaf or tea. I need my caffeine quickly and didn't want to wait for the coffee maker. This was perfect and boy does it brew fast. I was a little skeptical by reading some of the not so favorable reviews, but decided to try it anyway due to the cost. I am so glad I did. I recommend this. It doesn't and won't be used on a daily basis, just several times a year.
