review/summary: What a great knife, and a great valuereview/text: This has become one of my favorite knives: the other one is my Santoku knife, which cost 4 times the price of this Victorinox.The Victorinox is crazy-sharp, and cuts even slippery things without sliding (think tomatoes, etc.) It takes a little getting used to how light it is, but it does a beautiful job at a great price.I'm thinking of giving some as gifts...Recommended.
