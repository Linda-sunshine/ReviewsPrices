review/summary: poorly designed and doesn't hold tea wellreview/text: I bought this after having another mug from Teavana. I thought I would try the cheaper version but this was a waste of money. The tea infuser is not tightly woven so tons of tea gets into the water - to the point you can't even drink it. Also there is no drip tray for the infuser when your done. There are two different tops so you have to unscrew the infuser part to twist on the drinking lid. Really poor design and useless for tea. May be better for traveling with coffee if you throw away the infuser.
