review/summary: Presto Professional SaladShooter Electricreview/text: This is the best gadget to get vegetables and potato slices done quickly. I love this Presto. I have the Professional and the regular one. You can do hashbrowns quickly. Instead of buying frozen. You can ruffle cumcumbers and potato's. You can make your own fine cheese instead of buying it already done. It is a very useful item.
