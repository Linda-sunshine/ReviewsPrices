review/summary: Much appreciated giftreview/text: As a dedicated cast iron cook, both on the gas range and campfire, I appreciate receiving the Lodge pizza pan for Christmas. Almost to the point where I can't imagine any other cast iron pans I need. Typical high quality Lodge product that I expect to pass on to the next generation. Can be used not only for pizza (nice collection of recipes included) but for roasting veggies, baking biscuits, etc in the oven. Can be used stovetop as a griddle, but because it is larger than a burner, it is recommended to preheat in the oven to assure even heating and to reduce chance for damage.
