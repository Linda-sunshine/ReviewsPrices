review/summary: The Giverreview/text: Jonas, a boy on the verge of becoming a twelve, lives in a society where everything seems perfect. People feel no pain, everyone gets along, uniformity is celebrated, and everyone is happy to follow the society's norms. However, Jonas is nearing a huge milestone in his life, which will shake his view of the world around him.As children in the society reach the age of twelve, they are assigned to the careers they will work in until they grow old. Jonas's task, which is chosen by the community's Elders, is a very important and honorable position. This task will send Jonas on a path that leads to self-discovery, self-awareness, and forces him challenge everything he has ever known. Jonas sees his family, his friends, and his whole community differently. He begins to question the Elders, the ways of the society, and what is right and wrong. Events in the society leave Jonas with the biggest decision of his life, and he must choose to do what he believes is best for himself and the society.Lois Lowry depicts the dystopian society in great detail. The work is written for teens, and Lowry definitely plays to that audience. As a high school social studies teacher I think The Giver would be a great book to use in a sociology class. It could be part of a more broad culture unit, and used to discuss social norms, variations from one culture to the next, and could also spark discussions about some controversial topics written in the book. Lois Lowry's The Giver is an extremely well written and thought provoking work. I would highly recommend this book to any teen or adult. I cannot wait to read the rest of The Giver series.
