review/summary: Very good purchase for arthritis suffererreview/text: I open a lot of cans: I have three dogs and I cook with canned tomatoes and tuna quite frequently. Opening cans has become a painful process with several different kinds of can opener (including OXO Good Grips, which I had used successfully for many years) and this electric version saves me pain! It takes a little while to get the knack of placing the can initially, but it holds firmly while operating and lifts off the lid neatly when finished. It will also tackle tall cans, such as chicken stock or fruit juice, with ease. It looks and feels well made and tough: I will add more if I have trouble in the future, but so far I am very pleased.
