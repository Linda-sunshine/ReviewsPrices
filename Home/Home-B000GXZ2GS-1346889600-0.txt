review/summary: Simple...durable...fantasticreview/text: This is awesome and it makes a dang good cup of coffee or espresso. The version I bought on Amazon came with its own tote for traveling with. Easy to clean, easy to use, portable, and most importantly, it makes a better cup of coffee than my office coffee maker. The plastic is higher quality than that which can be found in most machines, so it doesn't impart any nasty plastic odors from the usage of boiling water. Easy to gauge if you want to make 1 or 2 cups (the lines are on it). I imagine that this could probably be used to brew a nice cup of tea or all sorts of herbal drinks, too. Fantastic, a great buy and great value.
