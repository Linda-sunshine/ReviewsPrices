review/summary: Sharpens Really Wellreview/text: Very pleased with the performance especially for the price. It sharpened blades with ease. Don't test a newly sharpened knife on your finger or you'll regret it (I didn't do that, but someone in my house did). I had to adjust pressure after sharpening knives as they were cutting with much greater ease. Boy, they were so much duller than I thought - the difference was night and day. Would highly recommend this product.
