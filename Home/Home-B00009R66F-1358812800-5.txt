review/summary: Definately recommend this carpet cleanerreview/text: We've rented carpet cleaner in the past, but this machine is easier to use and does a much better job cleaning the carpets and extracting excess water. I was careful to go over each area an extra swipe to extract the moisture and the carpets were dry within a few hours. The spin brushes really help to extract stain and make carpet look fresh and like-new again.
