review/summary: Impressivereview/text: Having never juiced before I have been using this machine almost 3 times a day for a week. I'm very happy with it's performance. It's powerful, makes quick work of the veggies and fruit and the pulp is pretty dry. Those silver lid clamps are in fact metal even though it does not tell you this anywhere in the description. This morning I tried running about half of the pulp through again to see if more would come out and there was only a couple of extra drops so not worth that effort. One time the chopped bagged kale clogged the strainer but seemed this happened because the bagged kale is pretty dry. I had no trouble at all with Broccoli, bagged turnip greens or bagged spinach. Even though I've read that it's best to drink the juice right away as not to lose nutrients I'm sure I will start making one batch for the whole day in the morning instead of juicing 3 times a day. Also I was skeptical that I would enjoy the taste of veggie juice but I have tried many combinations and they all taste pretty good. If this machine gives me trouble down the road I will edit this post with details.Clean up is easy. Just rinse everything and scrub the strainer with the provided brush. Must use the brush as it gets in those tiny little holes.I do wish the juice cup were larger but this is a minor issue.Oh the shipping - Very Fast - Ordered on Sunday with Super Saver Shipping, Monday was a holiday and it was at my door Tuesday evening. I was very happy with this since I wanted to start juicing right away.Happy Juicing everyone!
