review/summary: Thanks for the warning!review/text: I had been looking at this glass water kettle for a few years now and when I first saw this glass water kettle, the price was near $80.I read all of the Amazon reviews and was very disappointed in the way the Capresso supervsior addressed the lady's problem with an "I don't care..." The lady spoke to customer service rep about the foul odor/taste and said the rep. was very nice and when she spoke to the supervisor, that's when the attitude changed.I'll be more than happy to boil water on the stove with a beautiful clear Pyrex coffeemaker. I also have a collection of clear Pyrex and Corning tea pots. I just saved myself a lot of money and trouble. Thank you for your reviews.
