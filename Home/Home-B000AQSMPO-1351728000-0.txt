review/summary: Horrible brew tempreview/text: The brew temp barely reached 140 at the spigot. A complete waste of good coffee.I've purchased the updated single cup one (Mini B31) and it brews at 192+. It's not the perfect brew temp, but at least it reaches the what it claims.Seems a lot of people have had to return this one before they got one that produced at a decent temp, but I'm not wasting my time or money.Sending this back with haste.
