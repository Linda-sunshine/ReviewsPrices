review/summary: Mr Coffee Filterreview/text: I just purchased a new Mr. Coffee maker that came with a flimsy coffee filter. I purchased this one which says it is a Mr Coffee filter and shows a Mr Coffee box it comes in. What you really receive is a filter that is not in a Mr Coffee box and has no reference to the Mr Coffee brand. The water filter cartridges that came with my new Mr Coffee maker would not fit in this smaller version filter. I had to remove the handle on the new filter just to get the water filters to kind of fit. Not happy that the pictures on Amazon don't match what you actually get but I was not expecting a lot for less than 6 bucks.
