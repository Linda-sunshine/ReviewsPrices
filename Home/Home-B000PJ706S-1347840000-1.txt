review/summary: Beautiful design, but that's all.review/text: I wanted a new electric tea kettle for my new kitchen. The beautiful design of this kettle won me over. I bought it at Macys for myself, and, later on, sent another for my daughter who lives in Chicago. About 6 months later she tells me it quit after a month. Now it's too late to return the kettle. I paid top dollar for it and paid shipping to Chicago. I was mad, but had no receipts or kettle at that point. Meanwhile my kettle is working fine. I didn't notice any odor. Two months later, after about eight month of service, my kettle died. Just stopped working. Maybe that was better than having the handle break off, as some others reported. I didn't have reviews to look at in Macys, so I will be doing a lot of research before I buy a new one. Meanwhile my old Russell Hobbs kettle is working fine. Unfortunately it has a part plastic kettle, which I know is unhealthy. I went through four electric hot water dispensers in my old kitchen. I loved the convenience, but they didn't last and it was a waste of electricity. I was advised not to put another in the new kitchen. What's a tea drinker to do? Microwaved water tastes "funny " to me. I gave the kettle one star for looks, but I wouldn't advise purchasing it.
