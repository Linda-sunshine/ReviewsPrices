review/summary: worked for 1yr, then died!review/text: If you plan to use this for more than a year, don't waste your time on this dehydrator. It worked well at first, but died unexpectedly drying the summer vegetable harvest without any warning. Pay the extra money and invest in a unit that will last, this Nesco dehydrator is a piece of junk!
