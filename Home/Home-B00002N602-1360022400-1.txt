review/summary: Great presssure cookerreview/text: Bought this to replace my presto pressure I received as a wedding gift in 1985. This works the same way as my first one and I like that it is deeper rather than wider. It is best to leave the metal tray in when cooking as it prevents things from sticking. My first one had a Teflon or some time type of non stick coating so this did not happen but I don't mind using the metal tray. Don't have to worry about the non stick coating from deterioration although it lasted me 27 years.Also wanted to say that other pressure cookers out there have more gimmicks on them than this. This pot works the same way as the one I had bought 27 years ago. That goes to show this doesn't need to be changed. I believe all Presto cookers have worked this way for a long time and don't need any more gimmicks added on . Why fix it if it ain't broke! Most Presto owners stick with Presto. I have included a paragraph showing when the first commercial Presto was made and displayed in New York. You can look up the whole article. [...] I don't work for Presto or anything like that I am just a homemaker with a lot of extra time on my hands and researched this myself before buying this one. lolHistory of pressure cookingIn 1679, the French mathematician and physicist Denis Papin invented the first pressure cooker or steam digester as he called it. The story is whilst he was presenting his new steam digester to the Royal Society it exploded, leading him to invent the safety valve. Three years later he represented it to the Royal society and gained positive reviews.The pressure cooker title was first seen in print in 1915. In 1927, the first pressure cookers were sold in Germany and in 1939 the world&#8217;s first commercial pressure cooker made by National Presto Industries was exhibited at the New York World&#8217;s Fair.
