review/summary: touchless trash canreview/text: We purchased this garbage can to keep our new dog from dunking his head in the garbage can... While the motion sensor is handy I don't know how long this is going to work as the dog is taller than the can now and has noticed he just has to pass his head over the top to open it.However, the device works great as advertised. I love that i can hit the button to open/close the lid if needed.
