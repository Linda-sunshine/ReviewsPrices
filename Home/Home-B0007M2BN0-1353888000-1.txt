review/summary: I prefer just using a pot on the stove.review/text: This is no easier or quicker than a pot on the stove. I love kitchen gadgets, but this one wasn't worth keeping. The only reason I'd suggest buying this is if you don't have a stove. If you live in a dorm or want to make eggs in a hotel with just a microwave, this might be good.If you have a proper kitchen with a saucepan at your disposal just boil your eggs the old fashioned way:5-steps to Boiling Eggs:1. Place eggs in saucepan with water about 1"-2" over the eggs.2. Bring pot to a boil, no lid.3. Turn off the heat once boiling, put the cover on the saucepan.4. Set timer for about 12 minutes.5. Drain water and run cold water over the eggs to cool them down.Done.
