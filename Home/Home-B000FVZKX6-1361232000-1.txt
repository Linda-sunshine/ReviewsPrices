review/summary: Fabulous!!!review/text: I have purchased many sets of sheets over the years, but none are as great as this set!! I, of course, washed them immediately and used normal settings and washed them in warm water. They are perfect!! Kept their exact shape and size as there was absolutely no shrinkage what so ever! I've had them for several weeks and washed them a couple times... They are extremely soft and sleep very well!! I highly recommend these sheets!! The price is unbelievable...you cannot buy this quality just anywhere and the quality at this price would be unheard of....SO BUY THESE!!!
