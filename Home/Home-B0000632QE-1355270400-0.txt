review/summary: Really Like Thisreview/text: Yes, the blades are deadly so you have to be careful. However, if you store this the way it's intended to store and use the protector, you will be fine.I bought this to shred large amounts of cabbage to make sauerkraut. This did the job for me very well. I have also used it to slice cucumbers (perfectly), oranges (for the dehydrator!), apples. I am really glad I bought this and I use it at least once per week.
