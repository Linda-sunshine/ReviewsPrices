review/summary: Less than expected.review/text: Got this to replace a 30-year-old digital clock radio whose reception was not what it used to be. Unfortunately, this item's radio reception turned out to be even worse. Volume/tuning knobs are not conveniently located (should be on the top of the unit where they can be easily seen/manipulated). Even worse, after buying this on Amazon found the same item at Walmart for about $4 less than I paid. Ouch.
