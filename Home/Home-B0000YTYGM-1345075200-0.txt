review/summary: Can't figure out how people make a mess with this itemreview/text: I bought this coffee maker after reading a number of comments bashing it for various instances of making a mess.Ran the first full carafe of water only without any problem. The water was very hot, and I left it sit overnight to see how the insulated carafe worked. 17 hours later, the water was still warm enough to be a very drinkable cup of coffee. Spout poured a very smooth stream into the cup with no problem what so ever. Made another full pot of coffee the next day. Brewed very hot and flavorful cup of coffee. Again, no spill while brewing, and poured perfectly into the cup. The "pour" position on the carafe lid is, in my opinion, nearly idiot proof. The carafe lid does have some funky mechanism which I suspect is designed to open during the pour and brew cycle, but close to preserve heat otherwise. I suppose that could cause a problem should it malfunction or get dirty. It has been no problem so far.The unit is quite tall, and does not have a removable reservoir. This is not a problem for my space, but if you have height limitations, it could be somewhat inconvenient.I haven't had the unit long enough to comment on maintenance issues, but my first impression is that it is a great coffee maker. I would definitely recommend it.
