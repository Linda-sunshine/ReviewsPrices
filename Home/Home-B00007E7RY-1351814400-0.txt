review/summary: Honeywell 50250-S 99.97% Pure HEPA Round Air Purifierreview/text: I am very impressed with this hepa air filter so far. I have owned it for approximately a month. I have asthma especially around cats and I recently took in a stray kitten and was very worried about asthma flare-ups. So far with this air filter I don't even know that there is an animal living in my apartment. So I would recommend this product to anyone who has pet allergies or asthma. I am thinking about buying a second air purifier for the bedroom.
