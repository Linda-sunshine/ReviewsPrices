review/summary: Great for jerky!review/text: This dehydrator works as advertised. I bought it because I am sick of paying about $12/lb for beef jerky. The quality of the jerky this machine churns out exceeds that of the store brands. Be aware of one anomoly; I'm not sure if it is because of the increased wattage of this model, but take the estimated drying times in the recipe book and cut them in half.
