review/summary: LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!review/text: There is nothing bad to say about Lodge Logic cast-iron skillets!! This brand is top of the line!!! I could never go back to using skillets that are not cast-iron. All the &#34;non stick&#34; skillets will eventually become scratched and you will be eating food with the coating cooked into it. Who wants that? What is the &#34;non stick&#34; coating made out of??? Anyway, I don't have to worry about anything being cooked into my food other than what I put in myself. These skillets are easy to take care of and will last a lifetime.
