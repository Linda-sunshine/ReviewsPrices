review/summary: Great!review/text: I am a bachelor in my mid twenties with no cooking skills whatsoever. I got tired of eating potatoes so I figured it was about time to get a rice cooker. While I have never owned any other rice cooker I still feel good talking about how much I love this thing! So far it has made great rice and is helping me eat a wider range of foods without spending lots of time cooking!
