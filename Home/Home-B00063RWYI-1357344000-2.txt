review/summary: excellent productreview/text: When you buy cast iron cookware you already probably know that you are getting into a little bit of extra effort for cleaning and maintenance of the iron's non-stick properties. That said, the Lodge pre-seasoned dutch over arrived in perfect new condition, seasoned and ready to go. The unit is a fine basic dependable iron cooking vessel, good for baking, stews, and whatever you want. I am using the dutch oven as a cooking pot for use with an induction coil cooking surface.i recommend this unit to experienced cooks who want to add a versatile cast iron pot to their kitchen tools.
