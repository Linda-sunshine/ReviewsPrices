review/summary: Good pan, but not for magnetic induction stove topreview/text: I thought that it said that it was good for magnetic induction, but it will only work on the regular stove top or flame. Its a good pan, but I felt the description was misleading, I got a big stainless frying pan from Walmart, that I could test with a magnet, & the Walmart pan does work on the magnetic inductive stove top.This wok pan got replaced by one stainless steel pan & three stainless mixing bowls that work on the Duxtop magnetic induction stove.
