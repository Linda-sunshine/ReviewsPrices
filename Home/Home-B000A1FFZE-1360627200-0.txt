review/summary: Great with a couple quirksreview/text: I really like this toaster with exception of the tray in the oven. It does not slide into the oven very easily, it seems slightly too big. Also, items tend to be too close to the burners. For example burritos often burn on top.It toasts much better than other toaster ovens.
