review/summary: Well Worth the Moneyreview/text: I decided to replace my bathroom scale, that I had for many years. I consulted Consumer Reports and read a lot of the reviews about this scale and a few others before making my purchase. I've owned the Taylor 7506 for about a month and I'm completely pleased with my purchase. The scale reads consistently if you get off and get back on (my other scale would fluctuate as much as 1.5 lbs). Excellent quality for a very reasonable price. I would recommend this scale.
