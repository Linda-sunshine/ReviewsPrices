review/summary: Sharp but rustyreview/text: I bought these knives for my new house and have had them for a month or so and half of them are already rusted after just a couple uses. They are pretty sharp and cut great but I dont get it how can they rust so quickly. I wouldnt recommend them because I am sure you can find better knives that dont rust this quickly and this easily.
