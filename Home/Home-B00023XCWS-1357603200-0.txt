review/summary: Has changed our morning routine!review/text: No more pots on the stove to boil water for tea. No more microwave with the Pyrex beaker to prep water to go into French Press for coffee. This puppy will boil your water and shut itself off in about 90 seconds. I could see it in a college dorm (Ramen) or a camping trip (Swiss Miss). I love this easy-pour, quick, efficient unit.
