review/summary: Sharp to stay!review/text: Since I owned Ginzu knives back in the day and found them reliable, I ordered this set. It contains all the knives I need and they are as wonderful as I remember, easy to handle and sharp as a cat's claw. The best part is that no sharpening is needed so I can slice and dice without taking the time to strop the blades. You will enjoy this set!
