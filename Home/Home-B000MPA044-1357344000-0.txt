review/summary: Coating Peeled Offreview/text: As several other reviewers mentioned, the unit directions are misleading and confusing. I did figure out how to get it it work and made a stew so delicious, my father compared it to his mother's (the highest compliment you can get in this family). However when I went to clean the unit, I noticed the non-stick surface was bubbling and peeling right off. Awesome - just gave my family cancer with their holiday meal. I am very careful with my appliances and only used wooden utensils and cleaned it with a soapy washcloth, nothing scouring. I am very disappointed and will be returning this ASAP.
