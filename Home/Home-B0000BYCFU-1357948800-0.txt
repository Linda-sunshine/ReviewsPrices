review/summary: Good product, but. . . .review/text: Good product, but it was too big and heavy for me to handle. Also, it's pretty tall and didn't fit on my stove well. Also, the pressure gauge failed after 3 uses! Tried to buy a replacement gauge, but they were backordered, and my produce couldn't wait, so I bought the 16-qt cooker/canner which arrived in 2 days!
