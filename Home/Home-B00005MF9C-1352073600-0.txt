review/summary: OMG! But this item!review/text: I was tired of making a full pot of coffee at work and then making sure I finished it or atleast put it in the frig for the next day. Neither usually happened! Other people at the office all like very full bodied coffees so I've always made my own. Now I make it fresh, drink very good coffee that takes minutes to brew and never waste a drop! Seriously for the price this is one GREAT coffee maker! Even if it only lasted a few months it would be worth the savings in coffee poured down the drain in just one month! The machine is so simple even a man could do it without reading the instructions! No filters needed, cleans easily and makes great coffee - really what else can you ask for - except manybe a day off!Only changes I would like would be the cup not be so thick at the top, even with the drink spout in the lid it is a little too thick.
