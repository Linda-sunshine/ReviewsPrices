review/summary: New kitchen staple - stays on my counter!review/text: Love this cheery colored little workhorse. Whatever did I do without a food processor? Whips up my salad dressing so much faster and in general, so much more powerful than my prior fav - the magic bullet. So far, really dependable and seems to be well-made despite the plastic used. I love it and depend on it a lot.
