review/summary: Excellent purchase. Very pleased.review/text: Based on other reviews of this product, I made the purchase and have been very pleased. We have owned it for 4 months now and use it at least 5-8 times a week. So far, it has held up and we've seen no decline in function. Given the current price of espresso drinks, it has payed for itself at least 3x over.Pros:The espresso maker takes less than 3 min to heat up and produces a consistent water temp of 180 F.Instructions were very useful and informative. They describe set up and cleaning adequately.The steam bar heats milk nicely.Easy to clean.Decent price for a reliable machine.Cons:Sits a bit short. RecommendBodum Pavina 2.5-Ounce Double-Wall Thermo Glasses (Espresso/Shot), Set of 2as they are the right size and diameter for the dispenser. May want to elevate machine from counter, as the steam bar sits a bit low.Steam bar emits a bit of water when first turned on, so its best to clear it before steaming the milk to avoid watering it down (very minor complaint and likely not a big deal).Due to its size and light weight, the machine does vibrate a bit when brewing, so unless you have a single cup or heavy glass, you would be wise to keep an eye on your espresso glass to ensure it doesn't move away from under the dispenser.For the price you pay, you get a good machine that will save you time and money at the coffee shop.TryLavazza Super Crema Espresso Whole Bean Coffee, 2.2-Pound Bagfor a nice, balanced shot of espresso.
