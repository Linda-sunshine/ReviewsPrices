review/summary: Great for kids lunches, we finally replaced one after 4 yearsreview/text: We use these almost every day to pack our kids lunches. It is really nice to be able to pack something warm on cold and/or rainy days. We usually pack the food pretty hot, and it is perfect-eating-temperature 3 to 4 hours later.Our oldest had this thermos for 4 years, and we finally replaced it for a new one, mostly because the plastic base was coming off (probably because we washed them in the dish washer instead of by hand, as indicated).The kids put it in their lunchboxes, inside their backpacks, and in the general "lunchbox bucket" to carry it for lunch, so you know that they are not being treated delicately. The thermoses have never had a dent.Great quality product that pays for itself.When we replaced it, we replaced it for the exact same brand and model.
