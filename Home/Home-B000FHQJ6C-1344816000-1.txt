review/summary: Bought Threereview/text: This was my first try at using a juicer. I was told to buy a "top of the line" machine to get the most benefits. Not wanting to spend several hundred to begin with, I chose this rather inexpensive model. I am delighted at the result. So much that I purchased one for my daughter and one for my niece. Both girls are as happy as I am. If you are just starting out at juicing, this is the product for you. I use the pulp in my soups and it is delicious!
