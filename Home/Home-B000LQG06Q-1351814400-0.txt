review/summary: Delivers on descriptionreview/text: This product is exactly how it is described. The key to a successful buy is understanding what type of support you need for your back. I got this b/c my mattress was hard, but putting two inches of foam on my bed caused my shoulders to be pushed slightly forward throughout the night as I slept. After a few days, my shoulder pain was too intense to continue. If you like a little bit of mattress support then this could work out just great for you, but identify what you sleep best on first (if possible). I wouldn't recommend getting more than 2" in any situation. Just for reference, I am 5'10" 160 lbs and have an athletic build with wide shoulders.
