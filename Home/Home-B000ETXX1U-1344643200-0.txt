review/summary: Original and replacement both leakedreview/text: The air mattress wouldn't hold air after the first two nights when this was being used by my (skinny) friend. The company replaced the air mattress -- customer service was great. However, the replacement slowly leaked the first few nights. Just got it out of the closet and tried to use it again, and the leak is terrible. It loses a third of its air during the day (when no one is on it) and loses half the air when someone sleeps on it. Airing it back up in the middle of the night is not an option, as it's very noisy. I'm going to try to get my money back rather than have a third replacement. This thing is heavy and not worth the hassle.
