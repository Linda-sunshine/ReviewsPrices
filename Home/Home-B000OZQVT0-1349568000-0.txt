review/summary: Real Flame Gel Fuelreview/text: I have been using Real Flame Gel Fuel for the past 7 years for an outdoor fireplace I purchased and just love it. It is so easy to use and each 13 oz. can lasts at least 3 hours +. I also have a personal Real Flame Fireplace that uses the same fuel and really enjoy it. I recommend this product.
