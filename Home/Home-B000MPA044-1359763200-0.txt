review/summary: Must-Have for working momreview/text: I'm so glad I got this one. This is one of my best purchase for my kitchen. Now I pretty much use it everyday. It makes quick, easy and delicious soup and stews. I arrived home at 7 pm every night and I need to have dinner ready before 8pm for my family. With this pressure cooker, all I need to do is take the meat out of the freezer. Throw in the frozen meat, vegetables, seasoning then set for 12-15 min. While the pressure cooking is working its magic, I get to prepare the salad and pasta/noodle or rice. Usually I won't release the pressure but wait a bit longer for it releases the pressure lock itself - it will take extra 15 min I believe. It always ends up with flavorful and tender meat.Be creative, try all the possible dishes with this thing. You won't be disappointed. So far this pressure cooker can make awesome beef chili, chicken soup, corn soup, all different chowders, roast pork and beef, curries, pasta sauce, rice soup, etc. You need to try and error for a few times to get used to it but it's not so bad. Best part is most dishes can be done in less than 30 min.
