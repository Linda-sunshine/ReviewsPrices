review/summary: No complaintsreview/text: Using these filters with the Atlantis pitcher and I have no complaints. There are small black specs (most likely the filter particles) but it mainly stays above the pitcher and stays out of the drinking water. Worth the cost as I've cut down on buying and consuming cases of water bottles. Good to use when refilling the dogs water bowl also.
