review/summary: Way too softreview/text: The title tells it all. It starts to be good if you weigh 250+ pounds. Otherwise you end up sinking in it and having a sore back. Before purchasing this one, consider twice driving to Target, Walmart, or Bed bath and beyond to get one from there, because returning the product via mail is virtually impossible because of the size.
