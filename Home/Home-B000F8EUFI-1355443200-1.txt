review/summary: Works well but lacks in one important areareview/text: the Dirt Devil Dynamite has good suction, and is very light; however, it lacks a belt release, so the beaters can't be shut off. My house is mostly wooden floors; however, I have a room with long shag carpet and beaters can't be used on it. So many vacuums have this option by default and I never thought about checking for it before I purchased it.
