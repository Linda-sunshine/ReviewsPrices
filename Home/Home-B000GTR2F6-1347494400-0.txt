review/summary: Failure of two units in under two yearsreview/text: I had two units overall and both died due to a water pump problem. The first died within 4 months of ownership so with the warranty they sent me a new one for free. This second died just right outside my warranty window. The only thing they would do is offer me a replacement for a "discount" which was still expensive. From reading around it seems that this is a common failure mode of this machine, with the water pump failing or pumping slowly. I tried to argue this but the customer service rep didn't care telling me that it's still a "good deal". This company needs to own up to its design flaws of this product. This is criminal and cannot believe they get away with this. I will never buy a Keurig machine again.
