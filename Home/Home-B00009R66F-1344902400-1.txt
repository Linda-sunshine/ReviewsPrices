review/summary: As expected: perfectreview/text: I bought this because my new apartment was mostly carpeted and we had a rug which was not washed for a few years. I thought buying one will allow me to keep it clean constantly. It arrived in a day from ordering, packaging was no issue. Assembly was easy. And it worked perfectly. You might need t o move it slowly and with strength if your carpet is so dirty as mine was, but that's it. Pretty easy to use. You just need to put in hot water, add the cleaner, and you're good to go till you need to change the water. Will try to remember to update the review when I use it more, and if there were any issues with it. So far, so good.
