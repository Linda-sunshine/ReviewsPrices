review/summary: Good, not greatreview/text: Reading the past reviews on this product and how highly ranked it is I though the knives would have done more justice. They work better than the other price comparable knives I had however they arent as sharp as I would have hoped. The scissors seem kind of fragile/cheap but work nicely.Again, the knives serve their purpose and aren't horrible....however I just had hoped for a better product based on it's reviews.
