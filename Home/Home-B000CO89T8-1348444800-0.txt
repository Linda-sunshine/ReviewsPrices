review/summary: does the job!review/text: I bought one of these and have been using it everyday for several years. Yes, you have to start with hot coffee, but hooray, coffee stays nicely hot for the duration. I dropped it several times over the time I've had it, and though it still works fine, the plastic is cracked and I worry that it may short out, so I bought a new one. I didn't even think of shopping around, definitely was happy with it. It looks fine too, and the cord is long enough to get under a desk (about 5+ feet).
