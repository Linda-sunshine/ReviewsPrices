review/summary: BEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD!review/text: Easy assembly! Easy Clean up! Makes grating 2 to 4 lbs of CoJack cheese for a mega batch of enchiladas a breeze! I highly recommend the Presto Professional Salad Shooter to EVERYONE who loves to cook. I do not own a food processor because I feel this is a better product for my needs. Especially love the fact that it cleans up very quickly after use; a must in my busy world. I'm a &#34;clean as you go person&#34; so it never sits uncleaned for even 1/2 an hour.
