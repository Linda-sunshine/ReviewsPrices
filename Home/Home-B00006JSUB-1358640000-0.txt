review/summary: Great large skillet made in the USAreview/text: This skillet is fantastic! It's huge! We needed a larger cast iron skillet and this is perfect. Can't beat that it's made in the USA - it had the little card stating this, and I've noticed people ask this question on other cast iron products so I thought I'd mention it here just in case this interests you.
