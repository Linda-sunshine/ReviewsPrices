review/summary: Decent for the price but my wife got neck pain from the bedreview/text: I've owned this bed for about 2-3 months now. Pros: Of course the light weight is just awesome. It's amazing to be able to carry a queen-sized bed up the stairs all by yourself. It's pretty well-made. It blows up quick enough and reliably. It held the air well, also. I tended to re-fill it to capacity every 1-3 days, but that's just me - it probably didn't need it - I just like it extra firm. Cons: My wife claimed that it messed her neck up - something about the lack of support. She stopped using the bed and her neck pain went away. There was a strong odor of rubber the first few days, also. The first day, it was very strong. I came home and literally thought that the sewer backed up or something. After a week, the smell was gone, though. That's about all I can say about it. Decent for the price, but use at your own risk.
