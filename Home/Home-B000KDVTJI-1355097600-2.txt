review/summary: After 2 Years, Still a Great Productreview/text: My husband bought this electric kettle for me in 2010. I use it almost daily from September-April, and every now and then throughout the summer. It works perfectly, just as it did when I first rec'd it. The pitcher styling allows for easy filling for both me and my kids, as opposed to the "kettle" shaped versions with the handle over the top. I recommend it without hesitation to anyone looking for an electric kettle. I only wish it was faster (7 minutes to heat up a slightly overfilled kettle-oops).
