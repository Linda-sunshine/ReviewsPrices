review/summary: Best knife I ownreview/text: Bought this knife based on its high recommendation from America's Test Kitchen AKA Cooks Illustrated. I had what I thought were two pretty good chef knives already, a Wusthof Gourmet and a Calphalon full forged blade, which I took good care of. For $24 I thought I'd take a chance on the Victorinox and am very glad I did. It's a revelation. Chopping and slicing go so smoothly that they're much more fun than before. I look for opportunities to use this knife and look forward to recipes that involve lots of knife work. Smooth, effortless slices through everything I've presented to this little wonder. One of my best purchases ever.
