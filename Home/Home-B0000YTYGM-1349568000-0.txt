review/summary: disappointedreview/text: We loved this coffee machine, especially the insulated carafe. Constantly cooking coffee is horrible...I don't get why people still buy glass carafes and warming plates.My husband doesn't care, but I was constantly annoyed by this carafe's slow pour. I am used to open top restaurant-style carafes that pour a cup in 2 seconds. The Cuisinart carafe pours a cup in roughly 7 seconds. Petty, maybe. The fault definitely lies in the cover's design. It works great for keeping the heat in, but sucks at pouring. I expect it wouldn't take much to improve the design.And after about 1 to 1.5 years of use, it died. It would do its "finished" beeping sequence about 30 seconds after pressing "on". I let it soak with vinegar overnight, no improvement. Since there's really no one to diagnose and repair coffee makers, we'll have to buy a new one. I hate throwing possibly-repairable items away. Even though more expensive, I'm going to try and convince my husband to agree to a Bunn. We all know those just about never fail. And they're available with carafes.
