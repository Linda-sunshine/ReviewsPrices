review/summary: Great Productreview/text: I've bought 3 of these pads for different size beds. This is the first 3 inch, I got it for a firm King bed. The 3" pad is great, I can't sleep on the bed without some kind of pad, I had a 2" that didn't fit the bed (it was for our old queen bed) so I ordered a 3" King, it's perfect. I have noticed the chocolate mint scent, doesn't do much for me. But it has already faded. The pad was packed well and arrived VERY fast, within a day or two. I will definitely continue to buy these mattress toppers!
