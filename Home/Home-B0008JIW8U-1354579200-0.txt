review/summary: Seemed like good value, but machine broke after 2 monthsreview/text: The 12-cup machine is what you need. Don't buy the 4-cup machine because that's barely enough coffee for large mug. I know because I had to ship the 4-cup machine back and re-order this 12-cup one. So the coffee was OK (not great, but not terrible) but then the machine suddenly stopped working. I can't turn it on. I tried returning it, but because I didn't buy it from Amazon directly (but through a vendor) that was not an option after the initial 3-4 week returns window. I'll call Amazon again though... a machine shouldn't last only 2 months.Lessons learned:1) Buy from Amazon directly so you can return items if you need to. Otherwise hard to return to small vendors. Amazon is so much easier to deal with.2) You really do get what you pay for. I'm sure others had this machine work for years and it was fine, but I didn't get so lucky. Keep this in mind. I don't think it's a high quality brand.Hope this helps!
