review/summary: Awesome Product!review/text: I've had other one cup brewers and this is by far the best. I also use the reusable k cup to use other coffee or tea and that's also good if you don't want to always buy the one cup k cups that are in stores. I've made iced coffee and tea and it tastes good. Plus it's perfect for the morning cup for work.
