review/summary: Quality Pizza Pan!review/text: I owned a pizza stone in the past and was considering getting a new one at some point but then I found this pan. I haven't ever taken the time to research the care of a pizza stone but I know the few I've seen, I don't think they ever saw water. Being a fan of Lodge products, I know they are able to be washed with warm water (no soap), which I like. I have used this pan several times and I'm highly satisfied with the outcome!
