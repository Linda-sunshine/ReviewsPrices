review/summary: Good coffee makerreview/text: I just got mine 2 weeks ago after I heard a very good review and recommendation from an actual user. I am still doing trial and error on the right taste for me. So far, it has produced rich and good coffee. The other user that I talked with told me that you can reuse the filter up to 3 times, and that's what I have been doing. Easy to clean. No residues on the bottom of your coffee cup. The only cons would probably be that it requires more amount of ground coffee(which for me is not economical). The scoop that came with it is like equivalent to 1 and half of normal coffee scoop, and that could explain the rich coffee. So I am trying to see if it will give me the same rich taste with the same amount of coffee that I used to use for my french press.
