review/summary: Fantastic designreview/text: The V-shape makes it so much easier to cut because it double the contact area of the regular slanted blade mandoline.My old mandoline was poorly made, making it difficult to clean, to adjust the blade, and the vegetable frequently broke at the very end of the slice instead of coming off nicely. This one has none of those problems.My only complaint is that the storage case is rather flimsy so I always tuck it away somewhere safe right after using it.
