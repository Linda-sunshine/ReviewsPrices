review/summary: The Best Soak Ever!review/text: Taking frequent espsom salt, bubble and dead sea salt soaks in the tub have been so so until now. I, as most may, have a shallow tub in my apartment so deep water baths and soaks were out of the question (unless you were thin as a rail or the size of a child) water came only to the hips or waist before it began to drain out.Now with this fabulous little 'thingamajig' my baths and soaks are very beneficial, healthful and enjoyable. My aching body thanks the company for making it and Amazon for selling it (which made it so easy to find).
