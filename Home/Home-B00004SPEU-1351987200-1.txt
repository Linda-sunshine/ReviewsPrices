review/summary: Had this for over 12 years...still keep coming back to it, regardless of the broken lid!review/text: We had purchased this grinder before our son was born...He's 12.5. The lid broke long ago (buying a new lid today after searching and seeing that they do actually exist!) and since then we have bought every grinder under the sun to try to replace it (before internet shopping was so easy-- it was whatever the department stores had at the time) and we keep coming back to this old beast (being afraid to throw it away). Even though we have to turn it on by sticking a fork in the button, it's quieter than anything and faster than anything we have tried. The Bullet is excruciatingly loud and the grind is not even! Mr Coffee motor seized up after so many uses as did the Cuisinart. This thing works as good as it did the day we bought it. This is the 200W motor, not the 160W motor.
