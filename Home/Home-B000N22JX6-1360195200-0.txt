review/summary: Very surprised how much heat this generatesreview/text: i had a parabolic dish heater for years which finally went out. i loved it because it was quiet and gave off a lot of heat. this little thing, although not silent, has very low sound and warms my office and bedroom very well. i'm very satisfied and would get this again. 4 stars because it's not completely silent.
