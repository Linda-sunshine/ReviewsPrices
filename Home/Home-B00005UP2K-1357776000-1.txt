review/summary: 34 years and still going strong . . .review/text: I received my Artisan mixer in 1978 as a wedding gift. This machine is used nearly daily and I have had absolutely NO problems with it at all. I purchased the 5 1/2 quart model with the lift bowl about 10 years ago - while there have been no real problems with it, it doesn't seem to be able to handle the thicker/denser batters like my original Artisan..... So I find myself going back to my old standby more and more.
