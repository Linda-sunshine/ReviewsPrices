review/summary: Just under four years and still going strong...review/text: I am a huge fan of thermal carafe based coffee makers, but it is difficult to find a good one that keeps things hot, has a cone style filter, and a 12 cup capacity. After quite a bit of searching, I found this one with it's great reviews and after close to four years it is still brewing a perfect pot of coffee every day. As others have said, it keeps coffee hot for a *long* time (helps to pre-heat with hot water first) and I love that you don't have to unscrew the lid to pour. Mine (apparently) didn't have the defect that causes overflow, for which I am grateful. I have since purchased another for my mother as well. The only real complaint I have is that the timer window is a bit hard to see - if it had a backlight and/or a slightly easier to see "pm" and on/off indicator I would be pleased, but that is just a minor thing compared to how well it performs overall - still gets 5 stars from me :-)
