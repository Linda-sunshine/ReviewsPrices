review/summary: Very powerful cleanerreview/text: I'm only giving it three stars because the brushes aren't working. I had to contact Hoover customer service, they were very prompt and helpful in resolving the issue. I have to take it in to have it serviced. But, I did use it and it does get the dirt up, the detergent I used had the room smelling fresh. You mix a cap full of detergent with a gallon of hot water and go to work and you will see how dirty the carpet really is.1/11/2013 UpdateAfter having the service technician looking into why the brushes wouldn't turn. It turns out nothing major was wrong. I got it home and a week later, I put it to work and it got the stains out. Stains that have been in for a very long time. My carpet feels softer, looks cleaner, and the room smells great. The attachments work excellent on the sofa and loveseat. This machine got up the loose fur left behind by the regular cleaner. I would without a doubt recommend this cleaner to those with pets or those who don't want to rent a bulky cleaner from a local store. This will get the job done.
