review/summary: Hard to find decent Twin XL for Split King Bedreview/text: This is the best mattress pad under $50 that I could find.We have a split king adjustable bed - Has twin XL matresses; top and bottom of bed go up and down (also vibrates). Very hard to find size that will fit.Only complaint is that the pad infrequently (twice in 1 month) slips off a corner of the mattress due to the mattress going up and down. Need to get some of the elastic straps with suspender type clips to hold it in place.
