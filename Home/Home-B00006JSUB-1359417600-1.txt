review/summary: Great Cast Iron Panreview/text: Great Cast Iron Pan, what more could you want, it just works, and cooks evenly. Product came quickly, and well package. My wife loves it. The only thing wrong with Cast Iron is that it is very heavy, but that's all. Nothing taste better then being cooked with a cast iron pan.
