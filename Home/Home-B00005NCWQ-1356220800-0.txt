review/summary: The best pot of coffee ever!!review/text: Got this coffee pot for my wife after Hurricane Sandy, when we had no power for 10 days. She also has a Kerig machine, but Loves the flavor from the Percolator better! This is a Great Quality product! Great to have for power outages too! Get one for yourself, you will Love it too!
