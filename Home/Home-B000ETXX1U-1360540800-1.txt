review/summary: Product malfunction after 6 monthsreview/text: I purchased this product in March of 2012 and at first the product worked great, comfortable, easy to inflate/deflate, and easy to store. After 6 months of use the outer pool suddenly failed to retain air. The leak was slow, but the mattress would only be useable for a period of 4-6 hours for one person and less than 3 hours for two people. The worst thing about the malfunction is it was not just a simple hole that was able to be patched. Rather it was an outer pump issue or something else internally focused that could not be manually fixed. Since this was outside of the 30-day return policy I was forced to eat my initial cost without any recourse.
