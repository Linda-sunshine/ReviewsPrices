review/summary: Great buyreview/text: I've been using it for about a month now and I really like it.I bought it because it was entirely stainless steel, something extremely hard to find for this price. I read a lot of the reviews on here and decided to try it.My thoughts after my usage comparing to common complaints/reviewsPros: Quick heating, nice sleek look and finish, fits nicely into the kitchen and doesn't look cheapCons: Can't boil as much water as I had hoped. But still enough for a couple of mugs of tea.As for the complaint that the sticker leaves a permanent mark behind after removing it...sadly it is true. It doesn't bother me though and people who aren't looking for the mark won't notice it more than 5 feet away. The mark just makes the stainless steel a tint darker, which blends in easily with the finish (the picture actually makes the unit look brighter than it actually is).Moreover, there was a complaint that water always dripped down the side when pouring. I didn't have a problem as long as I poured it at a leisurely pace. The opening seems to be designed for the mesh guard to filter out water minerals/impurities. So i'm assuming that's why the spout is designed smaller than usual. Don't pour too fast, esp in the beginning, you should be fine.
