review/summary: Worked for a few months, then diedreview/text: The WR300 radio was working great for a few months, then stopped receiving everything. The AM/FM radio and the weather radio just stopped working on day, with only &#34;static&#34; (white noise) on all channels. It's still under warranty, but looks like I have to pay to send it back to the manufacturer, and then pay them to send it back to me.
