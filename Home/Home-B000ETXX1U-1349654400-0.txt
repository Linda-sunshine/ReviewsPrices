review/summary: Perfect bedreview/text: I was looking for a good bed to us for short overnight stays. This bed was as advertised and was very comfortable and easy to set up. Took less than 5 minutes to fully inflate and was much more comfortable then expected. High quality and comes with a great carrying pack. Easy to deflate and repack.As suggested in the instructions, give the bed time to stretch and add air just before getting in the bed.Shipping was much quicker than expected as well.
