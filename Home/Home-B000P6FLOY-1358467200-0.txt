review/summary: Works Greatreview/text: I use it to cook a prime rib roast and turkey, it does a great job. Easy to set and monitor. I like the magnetic back so it just sticks where you put it for ease of reading, and the alarms are clear and simple to understand. I would recomend to friends and family.
