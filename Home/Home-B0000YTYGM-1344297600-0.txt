review/summary: Pleasantly Surprisedreview/text: I was initially scared of this product. I had read the reviews after I made my purchase. Many of the reviews talked about how the coffee maker continuously overflowed without provocation and made a mess of many kitchens. You will be happy to know I have not had one accident! The unit is not difficult to set up and I must have been a little lucky, knock on wood. The coffee taste great and stays hot for a very long time. Since the carafe is never heated there is never that burned coffee flavor. I like my purchase and hope to have it for a very long time.
