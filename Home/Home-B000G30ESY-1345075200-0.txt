review/summary: Terrific machinereview/text: This is a terrific rice cooker. I originally looked at cheaper models, but was drawn to this one because of the fantastic reviews. I'd say the key positives for the Zojirushi cooker is 1.) consistent production of high quality rice 2.) the stay warm function 3.) fool proof operation. I'm not much of a cook, but this machine churns out perfect rice every time. Also, with the 3 cup version you can make as little as one cups of rice (qualitatively, the best results have come when I've made 2 cups (uncooked)). I've found 3 cups of uncooked rice is great for 3-4 hungry people. Highly recommended machine!
