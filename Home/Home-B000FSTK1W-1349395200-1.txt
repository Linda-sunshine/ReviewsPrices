review/summary: Almost Perfectreview/text: I love this shower caddy. I let it set for almost two days and have had no problems with it staying attached to the shower wall.A change in the design for the razor holder would be nice. It keeps falling off of the caddy. I am a woman using a small, plastic razor. It seems better designed for a larger, mans razor. Plus it needs a better connection to the caddy.Other than the razor problem it is perfect. It holds all my large shampoo and conditioner bottles, a nail brush, a bar of soap and, I have just placed the razor beside one of the bottles.It is easy to rinse out and easy to remove if I want to do a real cleaning.I have used scrubbing bubbles cleaner to clean the shower and it came out fine.I bought this because I have a large, double shower head with hose and could not use a caddy designed to hang from the shower head. It has worked out great!I would recommend it to a friend.
