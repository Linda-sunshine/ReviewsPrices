review/summary: Canning Made Easyreview/text: With a bumper crop of vegetables from my garden this year, I decided to can the surplus. The Presto Canner made the process very easy. The directions booklet is clear and concise, and the pressure control dial is easy to read. While some recipies can be canned without a pressure cooker, having this cooker/canner allowed me to can a wide range of recipies, including various tomato sauces with meat. You do not have to be an experienced canner to use this product, but once you have used it, you will be an expert!
