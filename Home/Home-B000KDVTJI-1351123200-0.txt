review/summary: FAULTY DESIGNreview/text: I LOVE THIS POT. It is beautiful. Feels substantial without causing wrist strain and so easy to clean/wipe down. Fast to heat. I like it so much that I leave it on the counter....the counter that must always be clean of everything in my OCD world. Maybe the flaw is that I use it...alot. At about day 36 it started to leak right around the bottom where the stainless steel meets the black plastic bottom....there is no fix. It leaks. I have to protect every surface that it sits on, while drinking/using, every surface that I am ever to store it unless I empty it and dry it out...
