review/summary: Works like a charm almost every time.review/text: I've had this opener for several years and I am totally satisfied with it. I read some of the poorer reviews and the ones that indicate poor charging need to clean the charging contacts. Once in a while some wine residue will get on the contacts and prohibit proper charging. A cotton swab with a little alcohol is all it takes to safely clean all 4 contacts. Great product at a bargain price!
