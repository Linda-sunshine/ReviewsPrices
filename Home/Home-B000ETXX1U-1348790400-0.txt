review/summary: This matatress deliversreview/text: After searching for an air mattaress, I chose this one because of the many, many positive reviews. It was a little more expensive than the others but what good does it do to save a few dollars if the product is not usable or breaks frequently. This mattress has an automatic fill panel and a retractable cord that stores inside the mattress. What a good idea. It fills quickly. It is very comfortable. The outer ring around the mattress is higher which keeps everything on the mattress itself. The only recommendation I would make is put some padding on the mattress before a sheet. The mattress is then perfect. Hope this helps.
