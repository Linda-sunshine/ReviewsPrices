review/summary: very happyreview/text: This device appears to be well built and has made the cutting of certain foods much easier. Slices perfect potatoes for potato chips. I like it very much. Warning: Do not take this device lightly. Pay attention to what you are doing. If your the cutting corners lazy type, do not buy the device. This device will cut your finger down to the bone in a New York second. USE THE PROTECTIVE GUARD ALWAYS, ALWAYS. Do not be tempted to use your hands to save time. You have been warned.
