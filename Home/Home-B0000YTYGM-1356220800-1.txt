review/summary: Great productreview/text: I'm very happy with this coffeemaker so far. You don't need to worry about the reviews saying &#34;make sure to line the arrows up on the lid&#34; and stuff. The lid has a stopping point when you tighten it so you just tighten the lid until it stops and voila it's lined up perfectly. In my experience so far you can easily assume hot coffee for about 8 hours if you're drinking a little bit throughout the day. Noise level is good, much quieter than the BUNN Phase Brew I had before and I haven't had any leak problems. I would definitely recommend.
