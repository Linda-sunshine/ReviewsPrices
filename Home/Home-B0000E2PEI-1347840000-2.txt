review/summary: Good Scalereview/text: I like this scale. I weigh myself very first thing in the morning and take that weight. If I go on the scale 5 minutes later, my weight is slightly different so I ignore it and, as I said, I go with the first morning weight. It's easy to read and clean and is attractive in appearance. I will buy some as gifts for Christmas. The price is also very good. I've looked elsewhere. Good luck if you're trying to lose weight.
