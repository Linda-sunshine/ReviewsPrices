review/summary: LEAKS...just like everyone saysreview/text: I read lots of reviews of this product and purchased it despite several reviewers saying it leaked. I assumed that they were not properly following the assembly instructions and that caused the leak. I was wrong. I very carefully read and followed the instructions (heard the loud &#34;CLICK&#34; everyone was talking about). In fact, I was so concerned that I did it properly the assembly took a lot longer than anticipated.Upon my first use, the clean solution tank leaked onto the carpet. I figured it was a fluke. The next use (for stairs with the attachment ... and again carefully following the assembly instructions), it leaked again. This time the clean solution tank leaked and was empty (all over the floor) within 1-2 minutes. It created a huge puddle and mess.What a horrible steam cleaner. Shame on Hoover for not &#34;getting a clue&#34; from all the bad reviews and returns and fixing this serious design flaw.I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE!
