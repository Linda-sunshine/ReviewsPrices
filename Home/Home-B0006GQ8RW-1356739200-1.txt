review/summary: Are these fake?review/text: This is a review of the Brita filters sold by this vendor, not of Brita filters in general. I purchased a Brita system from a brick and mortar store and the filtration system worked fine. When I needed to replace the filter, I turned to Amazon in hopes of getting a lower price. I purchased a 4 pack and I have used 3 of them so far. Each one of these replacement filters leaves a surprising amount of black filter particles in the tank. One filtered water very very slowly, one very very quickly, and one didn't seem to filter at all as the carbon spots went into the drinking chamber and consequently into our drinking glasses. All of them left a bunch of carbon spots in the water collection chamber. I really question whether these are authentic or expired filters. I went out and purchased another 4 pack from the brick and mortar store and it worked fine - minimal carbon dust and consistent filter pace. I never write product reviews but wanted to warn you that the ones provided by this store are not of high quality and do not seem authentic. Using them probably has the opposite effect on your water - instead of cleaning and filtering your water, you will get more particles in it. Beware.
