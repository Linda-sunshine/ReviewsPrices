review/summary: good vacuum, arrived without hosereview/text: Nice little vacuum, works well but it arrived in a big product box without the hose and the wand. Had to spend another $20 to buy a replacement as I needed it for my second home right away. Otherwise I would have waited for them to ship the parts. Clearly someone opened the box and took the parts before it shipped. Very good suction and easy to use.
