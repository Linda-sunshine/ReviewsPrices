review/summary: Never thought I'd love sheets so much!review/text: We bought these sheets at the beginning of 2012. It is now September, and we haven't taken the sheets off the bed except to wash them. They are unbelievably comfortable. We liked them so much we didn't change them when the weather warmed up; we couldn't bear the thought of sleeping between anything else! They are not too hot, although we keep the bedroom pretty cold at night. I would highly recommend them to anyone.
