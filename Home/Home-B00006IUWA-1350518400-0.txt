review/summary: It's OK but...review/text: I was disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews and then ordering and using this product. It does pop the corn but prior to the hot air reaching a temperature high enough to pop the corn, many of the kernels are blown out of the popper unpopped. The air current is very strong and popped and unpopped kernels go everywhere whether a bowl is under it or not. The popper gets very hot. To be fair the instructions do say that it gets very hot and do tell you to make sure a bowl is positioned properly. It doesn't say anything about the unpopped kernels that come flying out prior to the onset of actual popping, and I wasn't able to position a bowl in such a way that it caught all the output.I put in about a 1/4 cup of kernals and I would say a good 1/4 of those blew out, unpopped, as the popper heated up.Although it does a good job with the actual popping, I'd rather not lose a substantial amount of my popped corn before it's popped.
