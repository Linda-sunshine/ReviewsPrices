review/summary: Works great and quick!review/text: This works great and it heats up soooo quickly. Like other reviews, it does leave water on the counter, I think it's steam so if you know this in advance, just keep a towel close by. We used it in our concession stand for the cup of soup ramen noodles and hot chocolate.
