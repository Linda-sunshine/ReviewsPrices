review/summary: better toaster than ovenreview/text: my wife wanted a toaster, but felt that a toaster/oven combo would be a good compromise. This isn't bad, but it's more a toaster with a small oven than a true best of both worlds. the oven will do small things, and can fit a rather flat bake potato in it, but i have to reheat pizza one slice at a time. take a look at the dimensions of the oven pan as it might not be as big as you think.for the price though, it's worth it just for the toaster. i like the &#34;Cancel&#34; button that will release our toast.
