review/summary: Not bad, but lees than expectedreview/text: I don't want to repeat what others already said about this item. It's not a bad product. Heats water fairly fast, etc. It doesn't feel sturdy/heavy enough, which I don't like. But the biggest problem is the shut-off mechanism. It takes too long to shut it down - you can hear the water boiling heavily, but it takes a good minute or so after it started to boil to shut the power off. A waste of electricity if you asked me.
