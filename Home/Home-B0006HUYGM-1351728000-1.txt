review/summary: Great for Camper and RV. Really picks up pet hairreview/text: We have three cats. We bought this to use in our Camper and RV even though we have a built in Vacuum in the RV. This unit, with its separate brush drive does a much better job picking up the pet hair than the built-in unit with an air driven brush. In a one week no vacuum trial in the RV we filled the dirt cup with debris and pet hair from the floor. That was after an initial cleaning where we had to empty the dirt cup multiple times. Does it work? Absolutely! A great little machine at an excellent price.
