review/summary: The filters from Amazon are terriblereview/text: Normally, my Brita filters last two to three months. The filters I just bought from Amazon are lasting two to three weeks. I suspect they are being stored wrong by Amazon, but can't exclude the possibility that Amazon is buying remainders, thus they are old, or they are selling counterfeit filters.
