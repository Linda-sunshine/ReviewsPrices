review/summary: Great dutch ovenreview/text: This is a great cast iron dutch oven. I purchased it for a wedding gift, and anticipate it will be well received and well used. If there is anything at all I wonder about, it is the cast iron underneath the enamel is not perfectly smooth on every minute part of the pot. However, I imagine that is always true of cast iron coated with enamel. It was a great deal, and I hope the young couple loves it as much as I do.Thanks!
