review/summary: Great little machine!review/text: I purchased this little machine as I was scheduled for wrist joint replacement and slicing and dicing has been very difficult and will be for quite a while. Frankly, I don't know how I did without it all this time. Great! Easy to use and better yet, easy to clean!
