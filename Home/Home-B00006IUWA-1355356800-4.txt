review/summary: Does what its supposed toreview/text: Pretty much what I expected in a popper. It was quick and most of the kernels were popped. The only drawback was that it has no on/off switch. You have to unplug it to get it to turn off. And the top should lock on somehow because I bumped it and the top fell off and kernels were blowing around lol. Overall though I'm sure this one is just as good as any of the other ones out there.
