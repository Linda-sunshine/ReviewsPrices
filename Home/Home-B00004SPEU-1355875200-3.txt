review/summary: Average grinderreview/text: While I am a big fan of Krups products, I found this grinder to be average. It leaves some beans without grinding & does not have a way to control from course to fine grind. Beware not to fill to top. I did & got a motor smell. I am sure the grinder will last but I was disappointed
