review/summary: Lasted A Yearreview/text: Even with regular cleaning (descaling), our keurig is zonking out on us. It's worth the extra money to invest in a newer version, as they have water purifiers built into them. Unless you run distilled water through this one with every use AND white vinegar atleast once every 2 weeks, it won't last long. That is just too much maintainance for an appliance in my opinion.The issues we have been having are that it shuts off after warming up, grows louder and louder but shuts off, and when it DOES finally work, the &#34;tall&#34; cup option is about 1/3cup worth. It takes FOREVER for a cut of joe. Other days there are no issues. It's hit or miss but mostly miss.
