review/summary: Does not hold airreview/text: Purchased one and it was immediately defective, would not hold air. I was able to exchange and get a new one, but that did not help my guest at the time. Replacement seemed ok at first. Read the reviews about stretching and needing a refill - my experience is ths this is much worse than stretched fabric. One small adult was almost on the ground every morning. Two people can't sleep on it or they roll into the middle together, until the air is gone, anyway. I plan to try a different brand or get a futon because it's embarrassing to have my guests go through this.
