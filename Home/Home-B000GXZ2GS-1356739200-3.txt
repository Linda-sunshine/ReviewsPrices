review/summary: best way to drink great coffee and avoid raising your cholesterolreview/text: I have used the aeropress daily for two years and love the cup of coffee it produces. For those of you trying to decide between this product and a french press, one consideration is that the paper filter used in the aeropress removes the coffee oil thus reducing the hazard of cafestol, the most significant cholesterol raising substance known and found in the oils of coffee beans. The aeropress is easy and make fabulous Americanos. Highly recommend this product. Search no further.
