review/summary: Great cleanerreview/text: Bought this to replace an old broken one. It works great. The tank is on the smaller side so you need to do the carpet in small patches. If you want to do the whole carpet it will take longer but it works so good the extra time is worth it. Already got rid of some stains and some icky black water. Great machine at a decent price
