review/summary: Great Blenderreview/text: This blender works great and is easy to clean and operate. A few points to consider.... If you want an espresso grind this is not the best choice. While it blends exceeding well for a normal brew, it does not get fine enough for espresso. Also if you rinse the inside out be sure to let it dry upside down as water can seep down below the blade housing and get your next grind wet if you don't dry it out fully. Neither of these is a negative and doesn't take away from the product at all.
