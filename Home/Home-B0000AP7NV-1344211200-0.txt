review/summary: great Brita for a small fridgereview/text: This Brita is great for a small fridge - it's super slim-profile, and filters about 2-3 cups of water at a time (this is how much the reservoir at the top can hold). The water filters really quickly - I can fill it up, and less than a minute later I can pour a cup as it's filtering the remaining water in the reservoir (and the water from the top never overflows even when tilted).
