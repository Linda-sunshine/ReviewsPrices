review/summary: It's huge! And not terribly even heating, but is great for large meals.review/text: So this thing really is big. You can make a ton of everything on here. Cooking guide temps are right on so don't throw those away. It is a little uneven in areas as seen when cooking pancakes, but it isn't a deal breaker for me. Pretty easy to clean and drip tray and tilt feature is nice when you need it.
