review/summary: It works well but not great.review/text: This works really good for pureeing food or for chopping into really small pieces but not that great at chopping into bigger chunks. It is nice because I don't have to use my bigger food processor for everything but it doesn't hold a lot and you have to be careful not to over pulse. If someone was looking for a small food processor, I probably wouldn't recommend this one.
