review/summary: Battered and dented but still going strong!review/text: This Bread machine arrived with a dent in the side thanks to the stupid merchant (not Amazon) packing it with just its original (thin) cardboard box. Kept it as it was only cosmetic and still worked fine (OK, couldn't be bothered to return it)Last Christmas we had a full house so I set it to make a loaf for early in the morning. We don't know what happened, but somehow it must have "walked" across the countertop and fallen onto our tile floor. The resulting crash caused some drama when several people thought that the noise was Granny falling over in the shower :) We're still not sure what caused it to 'walk' as it had never done this before and hasn't since - mischievous Christmas spirits perhaps...Anyway, the lid is now permanently detached and there are quite a few more dents - but it still works fine! I do have to wait till the yeast adding mechanism has done its thing to sit the lid back on, but it bakes just as well as before.
