review/summary: My Wife is overjoyed!review/text: I got this as a filler Christmas gift. She was less than enthusiastic about it. But after a month of use, WHAT a DIFFERENCE! She says that it is so useful and takes up so little counter space that it is now one of her most valuable kitchen gadgets. Right up there on the counter with the Kitchen-Aid mixer, cappuccino maker, coffee maker, toaster etc.Go figure. Ii was just trying to fine something to fill a gift box and hit a home run!
