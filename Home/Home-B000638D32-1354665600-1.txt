review/summary: Very Sharp, Fantastic Knifereview/text: I wanted to upgrade the knives in my kitchen as I've been preparing more and more foods for myself. The knives I had were old, not very sharp, and my attempts at sharpening them proved to be useless.I now realize that no matter how much I sharpened those old knives, they would never be as sharp and true as this fine blade from Victorinox. Everything I slice with this knife is like cutting through butter. It has a very smooth action, and the weight of the blade is comfortable for me and makes me feel like a professional.It was sharp enough on arrival that I was definitely a little cautious at first when slicing and dicing. I've never owned a nice Chef's knife like this and I am very happy with my purchase.
