review/summary: Whirly Pop In The HOUSEreview/text: Hey Guys, buy this. It's something like 20 bucks, and worth every penny. Even if you don't like normal popcorn, you're going to love the whirley-pop popcorn. It's like a good version of something that's organic. It really just brings a lot of optionality back onto the table. Want siracha popcorn? Who knows? Try it out! Just put some on the stove, and boom! Cinnamon? Chocolate? Put it in, whirl it up, and pop. It's a great snack, and it's actually really pretty good for you to boot!
