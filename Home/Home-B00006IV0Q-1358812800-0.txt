review/summary: Very Best!review/text: I enjoy my perkulator each time I set it for my first cup of coffee of the day. It's perfect amount of coffee it makes for myself. It's perfect, uses less space on my counter, wash and polish it, ready to show off on my kitchen counter. Stays very hot but if not drink within 1.5 hours, its best to unplug so the coffee won't taste too overly done. The the taste is suburb vs drip coffee makers. That is my opinion..thanks..enjoy it if u decided to buy one.
