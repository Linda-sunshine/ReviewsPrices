review/summary: only one disappointmentreview/text: I love this coffeemaker. In fact, I love it so much I've bought three (one was a gift). I just ordered the 3rd, even though my first one (about 10 yrs old) is still working just fine. I was afraid they might discontinue it before I truly needed a new coffeemaker and with a 10-yr-old product, it could go when I need it most, like Thanksgiving. I just received it and brewed my first cup.....still great. The only thing disappointing is that the description says it is black and brushed metal. It is indeed black with plastic resembling brushed metal, but it isn't metal. My old one is metal.....magnets stick to it. The new one magnets do not stick to. Not a big deal as far as coffee brewing goes, but it irritates me that it's advertised as metal. I wanted exactly what I already have (and will continue to use until it dies), but it seems they have indeed discontinued at least that part.
