review/summary: Good dispenser, but the filter didn't work much!review/text: I love the pitcher and the size of dispenser, I live in Pennsylvania and the water tastes really bad in state college, but using the filtered water it tastes clean and when I boil water to make tea there is no sediments in it anymore, however the filter didn't work much for us, it didn't work even for one month, and after 20 days I still see the sediments in my tea, so may be it doesn't worth to buy one filter every 20 days!
