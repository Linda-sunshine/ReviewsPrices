review/summary: Reliable and quietreview/text: The combination of the Capresso Infinity Conical Burr Grinder and the Bonavita BV1800 CoffeemakerBonavita BV1800 8-Cup Coffee Maker with Glass Carafe, Brushed Aluminumhas dramatically increased the quality of my coffee drinkng experience. The grinder has an attractive appearance and the small size doesn't take up much counter space. Very durable - I've used it almost daily since purchasing it about six months ago. Virtually no dust at the medium grind setting recommended for the coffeemaker, so clean-up is a snap.
