review/summary: Glass is so much betterreview/text: Made the switch from traditional plastic containers to glass. I got tired of worrying about staining and lingering flavours/smells in my plastic containers. My one little quip about these is that the lids are a little difficult to get on. Once they're on, though, they provide a nice, tight seal.
