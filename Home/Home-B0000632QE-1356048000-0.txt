review/summary: Great toolreview/text: This cuts everything so quickly and very sharp. The problem is storage. It stands up but we cannot mount it to the wall with the carrier it comes with so i leave it on the counter standing up. To remve the mandoline out of the holder, theres a latch before you pull it out and a little bit difficult to remove.
