review/summary: Weighs about a half pound heavierreview/text: I have three scales and the Taylor is very attractive but consistently weighs about a half pound higher then my other two scales. So either it is right and the other two wrong, or it just weighs heavy. My vote is the latter as I weigh at home and at the gym and Taylor, while very consistent, appears to be a little on the heavy side.
