review/summary: Cuisinart CSB-76 SmartStick 200-Watt Immersion Hand Blenderreview/text: There is always danger involved when buying kitchen equipment for the wife at Christmas time but I couldn't resist. She borrowed one of these from a neighbor and loved it. I took a chance and it went over well. As you can see, I am still aive to write this review. She has used it several times now and it works as expected wth good power. Mostly used to puree ingredients for soups. Clean up is relatively easy but beware the sharp blades. So far, I recommend this device.
