review/summary: Pretty Decent Office Mesh Chairreview/text: I've used this chair for a few weeks, and it has performed adequately for my needs. It's a low-end option for someone who needs a solid office chair with a mash back support, as it can literally save you hundreds of dollars. It looks and feels durable, and from everything I've seen so far and read about it makes me believe that it will last me at least a few years of intensive daily use.The chair is relatively easy to assemble, although you may not get all the parts (something that has happened to me for instance). The chair is very adjustable, and you can fiddle with three separate levers in order to find the right settings for you. One thing that I like about this chair is that it can go pretty low - I am quite tall and I use a keyboard trey on my desk, so the lower the setting for the chair the better. One thing that I don't like about this chair is the material for the back mesh - it is very plasticy and feels a bit sticky on your cloths.For the price you can probably not find a better chair, especially on Amazon. There is a nice IKEA chair at roughly the same price, but if you are far away from an IKEA store then this will not help you much.Overall, I am pretty happy with this chair.
