review/summary: happy with this purchasereview/text: When the oven came in the box, i thought it was damaged in few little spots - the black coating came of as the lid was, most likely, hitting the bottom while delivered. the protective paper (very thin) was jammed and slid on the side. I was unhappy with it and thought about returning it back. The manufacturer should think of the way to protect the item better to prevent the damage caused by delivery. Then I read the instructions for the oven and realized that the black coating is not something vital and can be restored, so i kept it.As time passed, I grew very fond of this product. It serves its purpose well. I use a lot. and even made a lasagna in it! It's also great for making pilaf. So, I'm going to order another product soon - a combo cooker!
