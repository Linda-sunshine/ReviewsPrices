review/summary: Great for baby foodreview/text: I've used these for the past 6 weeks to make baby food cubes and they work great for that purpose. We haven't had any problems with strange smells, but I've generally only left the food in the tray for a day or two before removing and placing/storing the cubes in a plastic bag. It's not that challenging to remove the cubes, but I've found it's best to press them up from the bottom 1-2 at a time. They've washed up fine in the dishwasher.My guess is if these trays start smelling, even if you took your ice out and put it an another container it would still smell and it's probably time to clean your freezer and not blame the trays. But, I have not used them for ice, although I probably will at some point in the future when I have room for it in my freezer again...
