review/summary: Safety Not Guaranteedreview/text: I actually really love my Electric Kettle, but I am giving it 4 stars, because it has one flaw that doesn't really bother me, but might bother others. I bought this because I like to have hot boiling water to clean up with-I don't have a working stove/range right now and I use the Kettle for this purpose. I normally use the Keurig for one cup of hot water (cocoa, tea) and if I need more for the teapot I then use the Electric Kettle; I will probably use it more for for tea now that the weather is colder.It has a design flaw in that it has a mesh strainer at the top and when you pour, some of the water dribbles down the front of the kettle and not where you are pouring it (a cup, teapot, over the dishes, etc.) This could be annoying and possibly unsafe. I still love it; it boils water, it turns itself off. That's all I needed and that's what it does.
