review/summary: Great Machinereview/text: The De'Longhi EC155 is a great entry pump espresso machine! It has the ability to use both ESE pods and allows you to pack and tamp your own grounds if you like. This has been a great money-saver, instead of paying three or four bucks at Starbucks for an espresso drink I can make my own at home for less than a buck. It produces a nice espresso with good crema, if you're considering making espresso at home but don't have a lot of experience, I highly recommend the EC155!
