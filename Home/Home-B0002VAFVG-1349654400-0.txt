review/summary: Not the best for the pricereview/text: My take on this is after using 3 different models and finding that this is simply a high priced name with an average product. Parts are costly, yield is dry and lower than average, and clean up is a mess. This is not a well designed model. They hide it's inefficiency with bulky stainless steel and a grandiose name "Elite". There is nothing elite about this that I can't get from a model $200 less. I will not make this mistake again.
