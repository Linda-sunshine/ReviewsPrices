review/summary: Consider this iron before purchasing a more expensive iron!review/text: I was one of those individuals who purchased a Rowenta Professional iron several years ago--paid over $100. Within months, it began to drip water as I was ironing. I thought it was because I was filling it incorrectly. I didn't iron much so I just ignored the problem. After dealing with this problem for a couple years, I did a little searching online only to find out that this is a common problem with this brand. Unfortunately, it was too late to do anything about it. Now that I am in nursing school, I am doing a lot more ironing. Thanks to Amazon and everyone's reviews, I found the perfect iron. This Black & Decker is wonderful in every way--inexpensive, lightweight, easy to use, irons as well as the Rowenta, and doesn't leak! I just used it for the first time this weekend, and I highly recommend this iron. I may start ironing more often!
