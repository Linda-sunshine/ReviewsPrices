review/summary: Not built for the long haulreview/text: I sparingly used this Keurig only for myself but the machine stopped working after two years. I contacted Keurig customer service and they told me my problem was 'spontaneous brewing' and could not be fixed. They offered to replace my unit for $97. The machine was just pouring out cold water upon being turned on, unable to brew and shutting itself off. I have no idea what caused this as I always took care of the machine and didn't use it very often, so there's no way I wore it out. The Keurig at my office needed replaced a few months ago. From my digging around, it seems two years is about as long as these machines will last. They produce okay quality coffee when they are working, but if you buy one, don't expect it to last that long. Patents have started to expire for Keurig so I hope a greater selection of single serve machines will enter the market. Maybe we should wait for those and not give Keurig anymore money for such a low quality product.
