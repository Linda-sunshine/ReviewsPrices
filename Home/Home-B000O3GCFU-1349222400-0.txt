review/summary: Does the job!review/text: My little one kept asking for a warm lunch, but I dare not let her the lunch provided the school. Processed junk galore! After reading the reviews for the Foogo, I thought I would give this a whirl. It does keep food warm by lunch time and my child couldn't be happier. You must be sure to read the directions that come with container to properly use it.
