review/summary: Cheesy looking but works fantasticreview/text: It looks like a very modern 1980s design, but it works. When it says only use 1/2 cup of seeds, it means it. It does not pop as fluffy and light if you add more. Since it only takes a couple of minutes (like 2-3) from start to finish, you can just make a second smaller batch. I use my Misto oil sprayer to light spray some corn oil on the finished corn so that the salt will stick. :)
