review/summary: Juice for onereview/text: I bought this juicer in August and it worked great in the beginning. As time has gone by and the use has increased the quality of this product has decreased.If you intend to make one 8 oz glass of juice once in a while this is your product. Don't buy this product if you intend to juice a lot, it just isn't of the level of quality you expect when you pay $100 for something.
