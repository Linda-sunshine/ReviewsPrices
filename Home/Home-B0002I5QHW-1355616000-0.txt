review/summary: Value Pricedreview/text: This grinder is great for the price. I bought it for the sole purpose of making bologna salad. The suction cup base sticks tightly to the countertop. The thing is mostly plastic, even the spiral part that you put the meat in. I thought that was odd. It's not very heavy duty at all, but for the price of $23 (way better that like $99 of similar others) I like it.
