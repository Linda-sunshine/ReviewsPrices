review/summary: Easy to clean, easy to use, works well but you get what you pay for to some degreereview/text: I have used this product for a couple years and it has served my purpose of chopping, pureeing, liquefying, and mixing small batches of food. The unit has three main pieces (the motor, the blade, and the container) and each piece is easy to clean.My only complaint with this unit is that the container portion is made up of thin plastic and that plastic has started to leak for me. Considering how cheap this product was, I am not really surprised or upset. I have got use out of this product and I continue to use it though I now primarily use it for dry materials and no longer put liquids into it.
