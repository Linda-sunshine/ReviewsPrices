review/summary: Worked great....for two weeksreview/text: We bought this humidifier at another store (rhymes with "may mart") and it was fantastic for a couple of weeks. Then one evening (we only used it at night while we slept), we filled it up like we did every night, turned the knob, and nothing. No light, no motor operation.....nothing. It was the cheapest humidifier we could find at the store, and I guess we just found out why. I do not recommend buying this product.
