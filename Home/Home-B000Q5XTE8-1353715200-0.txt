review/summary: Easy to assemble, comfortablereview/text: Purchased this chair after researching a number of chairs for home office. Assembly was quite straightforward to do by myself. The product overall seems sturdy and solid. Tilt adjustments are good - seat and back can be adjusted. Arms have a simple height adjustment (only 2 positions). Mesh back so far is holding up well and is supportive. Looks could be better. Overall happy with purchase, hope it lasts.
