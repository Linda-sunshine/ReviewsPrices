review/summary: Very lightweightreview/text: I am pleased w/ this purchase. The vacuum is lightweight & is great if u have mostly tile floors. We have pets & small children so we vacuum often. My only negative comment is that I wish the cord was longer & retractable. But this is a great vacuum for the price.
