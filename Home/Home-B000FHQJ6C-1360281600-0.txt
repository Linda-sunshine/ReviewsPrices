review/summary: Best juicer for the money!review/text: This isn't the fanciest juicer on the market but it does an excellent job for an extremely affordable price. It was highly rated by Consumer Reports and beat out several much higher priced models. My wife and I loved it so much, we bought a second one to keep at work.Why I didn't give it five stars:-Juicing some items still leaves somewhat wet pulp. Oranges and strawberries for instance are still wet in the waste collection bin. I've tried to re-juice this pulp but it made a huge mess trying to deposit the pulp in the feed chute again.-It isn't terribly loud until the strainer basket begins to plug. This can throw the balance off and the whole machine begins to make a lot of noise and vibrate. We've chopped things up more, plunged the items slower, and the strainer gets cleaned every time the machine is used. When making a big batch of juice, the strainer can still plug however.-Cleaning isn't hard, it just takes a little time. The strainer brush works but it takes some elbow grease.That all being said, if you are getting into juicing, this is the machine for you. For around $60, you can get an awesome machine. If you discover you love juicing, spend the $300 if you want but you don't have to.
