review/summary: PERFECT!review/text: I got 2 of these because I'm a shower-product glutton & we were running out of room for my poor, patient husband's shampoo. I followed the instructions to a T then loaded 2 shampoos, 2 conditioners, 3 facial cleansers, a body wash, a Clarisonic & other random junk on each side, and plopped my loofah in one of the soap dishes. 3 days later, so far, so good. They're massive, but they're sturdy & hold a ton. I might just get another for the laundry room to hold stain removers & stuff. (Told ya I liked my products.)
