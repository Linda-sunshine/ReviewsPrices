review/summary: Ice Cream Magicreview/text: I bought this as a gift. The gift recipient was skeptical, at first, that the ice cream any home ice cream machine would produce would be on a par with commercially produced product. I had to talk him into giving the Cuisinart a try.Now, just a couple of weeks later, he has already made 6 quarts of ice cream for family and friends and can't wait to make more. He says the texture is perfect, the recipes that come with the machine are great, and the possibilities of delicious frozen treats are endless!The 2-quart capacity gives him a lot of flexibility. Each time he has made a batch of ice cream, he's made 1 quart each of 2 different flavors. That flexibility makes this machine perfect for families and entertaining where there may be varied tastes. For pure fun, he has asked his family members to dream up flavors that they would like, and he will rotate making a flavor for each person. He is especially looking forward to making ice cream with his grandchildren, and may buy another freezing cylinder to be able to have ice cream making marathons!For fun, flexibility, a wonderful product, and a good price, buy this ice cream maker.
