review/summary: Great for cappucino loversreview/text: I use this little espresso maker every morning. It is easy to use, fairly quick and pretty easy to clean. Just like other reviewers said my only complaint is that the steamer arm is so short. And I would buy a tamper seperately because the one on the machine is too low and close to the coffee handle. I also soak the steamer arm weekly in a cup on vinegar and water so milk doesn't build up.
