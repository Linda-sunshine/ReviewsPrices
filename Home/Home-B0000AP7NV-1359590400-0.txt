review/summary: charcoal particles in water, lid falls outreview/text: My old dorm building has some pretty awful tap water so I bought this to fit in my tiny fridge. After following all the instructions and running water through it a few times, the water would still have fine charcoal particles floating in it. I did this several more times and there's still particles floating in it. The final straw was at a certain angle the lid keeps falling out when pouring and even the filter would tumble out into the pouring reservoir. what a waste of time and cash.
