review/summary: great when it worked...now it's an expensive boat anchorreview/text: My wife and i received the top of the line B70 Keurig as a Christmas present. For the first 8 months or so, it was a quick, convenient, great tasting way to make coffee in the morning. I did all the recommended maintenance including de-scaling and clearing the various holes and pins with a paperclip. (yes, with a paperclip as recommended) After the first de-scaling, my machine wouldn't brew. I descaled it again, poked the various holes again and got it working...for a few weeks. It was downhill from there. Every few weeks, sometimes days, I basically had to trick the thing into working by unplugging it, waiting 30 seconds or so (like you would rebooting a computer), poking the holes, pins etc. with a paperclip and trying again. Sometimes it worked for a few weeks in a row, sometimes it didn't. It eventually stopped working, conveniently for Keurig, after the warrantee was over.Their tech support got it working one more time after multiple de-scalings, pokings, (I think you get the idea by now) until...it finally died!Keurig offered me a brand new one for $119.00! Really? $119.00?.... for what? Another expensive boat anchor?Keep in mind before you buy, that the K-cups at Costco run about $36.00 - $38.00 for 80 k-cups. My wife and I used 2 per day and when we had company, more than that. You do the math and decide if it's worth it for you.I'm sure Keurig makes money on the k-cups and for how expensive these things are, they should have GIVEN me another one just so they could keep getting the $450.00+ per year we were spending on k-cups.I still have my old Cuisinart..., 7 years old and running strong!
