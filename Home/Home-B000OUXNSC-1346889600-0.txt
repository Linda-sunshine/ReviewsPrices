review/summary: Wasn't what I thought it would be.review/text: I was a little disappointed when I pulled this out of the package. Not as cushiony as I expected. Very thin, but works alright. Considering getting a memory foam mattress to put underneath it though to add some cushion to my hard bed here at college.
