review/summary: GREAT SHOWER CADDYreview/text: i share a very small bathroom with three other girls and needless to say, there is not a lot of space in the shower to put soaps, shampoos and razors. i bought this to hold all of my things off the tub ledge so there would be more room for everyone else's things. command has great products, i've never been disappointed with something i've bought from them and this shower caddy is no exception. i've had it up in my shower (on a smooth plastic wall) for about two months now holding: shower gloves and a razor (on the included hook) full bottles of shampoo and conditioner, face wash, canned shaving cream and a bar of soap. it's never fallen, never wobbled. and if it did, it comes with extra strips just in case.one of the best features about this is the fact that you can slide the caddy off the wall mounts to clean it!all in all the best advice i can give is to follow the instructions exactly and find the most flat surface in your shower to place it on (ie if you have tile, dont put the strips directly on the grout lines)
