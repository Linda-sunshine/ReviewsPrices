review/summary: Got after Krups died. Great move.review/text: Had Braun for many years. It died 1+ year ago. Got Krups, which we had abandoned many years ago for Braun. It lasted one year and internal electronics croaked. Coffee good. Computer bad.Got this, and have had for about a month. Love it. The controls are clear and not on some menu. Coffee is fine. Wife can put carafe in dishwasher as cap comes off. Couldn't figure how to get Krups cap off, so had to hand wash.Coffee pours well. Doesn't have to be positioned perfectly. With Krups, slight tilt from perfect and ran down side of carafe.We'll see in a year, but right now it is just right.
