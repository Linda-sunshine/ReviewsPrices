review/summary: Great Coffee Potreview/text: This is a very good coffee pot....fast brew, hot pot, and the new design looks great in my kitchen. The stainless steel on the side is very good looking with the black color plastic and matches my stainless cooktop. The pot is not quite as deep as the others which makes it look nice on the counter top. My old Bunn died after 7 years....and needed replaced. I think that's a good run for the money.
