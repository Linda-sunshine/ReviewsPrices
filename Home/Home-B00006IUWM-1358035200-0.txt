review/summary: Impressedreview/text: I didn't expect &#34;pro&#34; quality with this, but I was surprised. I bought this for my 85 year old Mother. Every knife in her house was duller than dull. Christmas day, I literally sharpened every knife in her drawer (about 15). It did a pretty nice job. Worth the money.
