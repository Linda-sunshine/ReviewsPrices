review/summary: GREAT PRODUCTreview/text: The Lodge Logic 5 qt dutch oven is a dream to cook with. I make artisan breads in it and it works great. Also great for stews, soups, anything you want to use it for. It is heavy but you can cook on lower heat and make great stuff in it.Highly recommend this item.
