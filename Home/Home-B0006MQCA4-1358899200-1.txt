review/summary: Just buy thisreview/text: There's 1,000+ great reviews, what are you waiting for?Bought this as a replacement for an outdated pitcher filter that kept falling apart and I am IN LOVE.I fill up my camelbak a few times a day, the water is TASTY! Can you imagine?This holds a lot of water, & though somewhat inconvenient to fill & carry back to the fridge, gets the job done great.Also, Amazon sells this for 10$ less than Target, plus free shipping.
