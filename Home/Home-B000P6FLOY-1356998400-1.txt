review/summary: Works greatreview/text: This thermometer works great and is easy to use. Compared to other models I especially like the fact that it has a pot clip so I can clip it on the rim of a pot and monitor the temperature of a liquid, For example if I set the alarm temperature to 205F I'm free to go do something else while I'm bringing something to a boil and the alarm will call me back before it boils over. Or I can reheat a liquid on the stove by setting the alarm temperature to 160 or 170F and the alarm will sound when it's ready.I can easily adjust the alarm temperature either up or down using the 2 large up & down arrow shaped buttons on the front. The audible alarm is loud enough to be heard from another room and there is a switch to turn the alarm on or off. I also like the fact that you can turn it off to conserve batteries if you're not going to use it for a while, and although the switch is on the back, I think that's where it should be since I rarely turn it off. And to top it off it takes 1 readily available AAA battery.
