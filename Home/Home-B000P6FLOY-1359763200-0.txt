review/summary: Very nicereview/text: I love the clip so that I can use it in my candy making, I love that I can insert it into my meat and then close the oven, I love that there is a timer, and an alert that will tell you when you have reached the correct temp. Even though I have only had it a short time I am madly in love with it and well never go back to the other forms of thermometers.
