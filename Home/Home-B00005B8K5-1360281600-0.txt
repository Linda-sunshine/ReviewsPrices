review/summary: Pyrex stands for qualityreview/text: I wouldn't hesitate to buy these again -- this is a very durable glassware set that I have used in the oven, microwave, and dishwasher. Like all plastic lid sets, be careful with hot water around the lids and if you must use the dishwasher please remember to use the top rack. I have had these for six months and they work as good as new.
