review/summary: Cuisinart DCC-1200BCH Brew Central 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemakerreview/text: This coffee pot, is the best coffee pot, I've ever had in the last 50 years. There might be better but why look any further when this one should satisfy you at a decent price? Highly recommended. No problems in three years.
