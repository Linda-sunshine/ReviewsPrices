review/summary: Quickly became my favorite pan in the kitchenreview/text: This griddle is just plain awesome. My only complaint is that the burners on my stove aren't large enough to heat it properly. However, since it's cast iron, that simply means that I need to give it a few extra minutes of heating time. And it does heat uniformly given that few extra minutes even though my burners are at fault.That was my biggest reason why I desired a cast iron skillet in the first place. Because the metal one I have just didn't retain heat. It didn't matter how long I left it on the burner, the edges would not heat up.But cast iron has nice heat convection properties which means that I can make uniform pancakes every time.Ideally, even if only cooking three pancakes on this griddle, they will come out quite small. If you want the restaurant style flapjacks, you'll need a bigger pan. But this is perfect for myself or even if serving a guest.
