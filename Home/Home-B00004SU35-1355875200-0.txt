review/summary: Lasted &#60; 6 mos... then brokereview/text: Hi. I used this popper about 6 times since i bought it and it broke last night. When you look at how it's constructed, it's not hard to see why it is broken. The construction is really cheap and feels flimsy. The screw that keeps the top part connected to the 'whirley' part snapped off and now it needs to be trashed.
