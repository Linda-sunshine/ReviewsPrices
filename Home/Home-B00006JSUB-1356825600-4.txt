review/summary: Great piece to ownreview/text: I know that you are supposed to buy a &#34;seasoned&#34; skillet and there are ones out there that are hundreds of years old. I just could not stomach using a skillet that someone else had owned, especially since you never clean these with soap. I bought my own and it is great. It is heavy and you do need to buy the special brush to clean it (Lodge sells it). But it is definitely something I hope to keep and pass on when I have children and my children have children. I am glad to start the tradition.
