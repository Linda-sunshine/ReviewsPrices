review/summary: Keeps Coffee Warm but is hard to pressreview/text: Keeps coffee warm, and makes delicious coffee if you can get the press down without a hammer (exaggerated). More than half the time I have to press so hard that it ejects coffee everywhere from a sudden release of force from around the pressing unit. That is my only concern about the product. Cleans easily, and requires very little care. Great coffee, but seems like too much effort to achieve this since 75% of the time I end up cleaning coffee and grounds off the counter.
