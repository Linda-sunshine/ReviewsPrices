review/summary: Reliable coffee machinereview/text: Great coffee maker - frother is a bit tricky to handle as you need to tilt the machine up to fit the cup under it and then tilt it again to get it out but apart from that I was happy with it. That was until I discovered the wonders of hassle free Nespresso! Sorry De'Longhi!
