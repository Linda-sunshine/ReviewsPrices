review/summary: Best electric kettle (than similar Sanyo/GE brand)review/text: This is my third kettle. My previous kettles are Sanyo and GE of similar capacity. And they rust(GE and Sanyo)/died(SAnyo) and explode on me (GE). For the GE the plate separating the heating element and container gave way and a loud crack, cement looking water splash out onto the four walls of the kitchen. Luckily no one is around when this happens. This aroma one is good, does not rust after months of using. Boils the water fast and does not leak. Sometimes, the 'good brands' do not always make the best products. I used only filtered water in all my kettles to prevent carbonate build up.
