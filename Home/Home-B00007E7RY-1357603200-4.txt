review/summary: Works great, however it can be LOUD and the LED is annoyingreview/text: I am an allergy sufferer and since putting the 50250-S in my bedroom and running it on low every night, my breathing has improved considerably. As a bonus, it makes an excellent white noise machine, however at any setting other than low it's pretty darn loud. Also, the blue LED ring around the control knob is incredibly bright in a dark bedroom. While I currently have it taped off, I will probably open up the panel and disable the LED permanently. Given that many people will use this device in their bedroom, it seems like a rather big oversight to equip this unit with such a bright light that cannot easily be disabled without putting ugly tape all over the control knob or modifying the unit and likely voiding your warranty in the process.Power consumption it pretty low - using a Kill-a-Watt meter I determined it cost me less than $3 a month to run this thing all-night, every night (electricity is $.09/KWh in my neck of the woods). A worthwhile investment in my health.
