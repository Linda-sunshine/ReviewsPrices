review/summary: Works fantastic and don't need the Foodsaver brand sealer!review/text: This thing is great...ok I only used it once so far. I have the Weston sealer, not a Foodsaver vacuum sealer. So I was concerned how well it would work, since the Weston you have to manually stop the vacuuming (e.g. not auto stop to know when it's done) but it's easy...you can hear the difference in the vacuum. When you pull the top off, the jar is sealed. I don't get how it works since the top is pushed on when it's vacuuming, but somehow it does and I like it!
