review/summary: Love this so much I bought another one!review/text: This is the best thing ever invented! I throw it in the microwave for 3.5 minutes, add my loose tea just poured in and a little while later, out pops the best tea! It pours from the bottom. I thought it would be hard to clean out but it isn't at all. This is one of the best things I've ever bought on Amazon. Bought another for my parents for Christmas I liked it so much!
