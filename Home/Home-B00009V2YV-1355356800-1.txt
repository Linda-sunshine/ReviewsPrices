review/summary: Every home should have onereview/text: I'm not aware of any home in this country that is not at risk for some major catastrophe either man-made or natural. This radio could possibly save your life. Once programmed it will sound an alarm and then provide a spoken computer-generated message from either the National Weather Service or the emergency broadcast network should there be some sort of emergency in your area. There are so many different warnings listed that you may not have ever considered useful. For example, this radio will sound an alarm during Amber alerts should you desire it to do so. It will also notify you, for example, if your local government has issued an advisory to boil your water due to a water main break. I suppose that you could probably get this information sent to your smart phone these days, but this radio will wake you up in the middle of the night to tell you that there is a tornado bearing down on your city.
