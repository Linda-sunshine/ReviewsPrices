review/summary: Great Cordless Corkscrewreview/text: This was a Christmas present for my girlfriend who suffers from bad arthritis in her hands and fingers. We both enjoy wine with dinner and she enjoys a drink in the evening.This opener works great. In fact it did such a great job we didn't even realize that the cork was extracted.This is a great tool and does not hurt her hands or fingers.The wine chiller was a added bonus. In fact this setup was cheaper than buying the opener by itself.I highly recommend this, in fact I bought one for my house.
