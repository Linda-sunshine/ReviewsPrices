review/summary: Not American made quality!review/text: The clear plastic percolator window on top has broken with light use. It should have been made of glass like the old quality percolatos like Revere. If you buy this, be prepared to shell out for a glass top, which is available and should be on all new percolators. Made in China but with the mask name of a rugged American mountain/park is just more bucks in the pocket of some CEO.
