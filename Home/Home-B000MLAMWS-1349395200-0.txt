review/summary: Kitchenaid is Kingreview/text: I waited so long to buy the mixer. Found the right price on Amazon...ordered it and it was shipped and received in time for Christmas. It was worth the wait. I am an avid Baker and now I do so much more. I really enjoy all the Kitchaid products I have. I am looking forward to making pasta next....
