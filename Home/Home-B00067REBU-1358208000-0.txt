review/summary: It's huge! But works great! Well worth the price!review/text: I was a bit surprised by how large it was. I had a bread maker before - about 10 years ago. I wanted to get into making bread at home again - and after reading all the reviews, and thinking about the price, I settled on this one. It's large but makes nice loaves. FORGET the recipes in the book - they make good tasting bread but not perfectly formed. Lots of recipes on the interwebs.Rarely do you get something worth more than what you paid for it.
