review/summary: Simple and delicious.review/text: I've been making some great at-home lattes since I got my Bialetti. I love that this is simple, easy to use, and small for storing in the cupboard. By making lattes at home instead of buying them, I've already saved the cost of this Bialetti many times over. The 3-cup really is only for one person, which is perfect for me. If you want to be making expresso for two people, buy the larger version!I ruined the plastic gasket by leaving it on the stove and forgetting about it, but I got a replacement gasket quickly from Amazon for just a couple dollars. I had expressed burnt crisp to the inside of my Bialetti, but no other damage done and it all worked out okay. I'm setting a timer now so that I don't forget again!
