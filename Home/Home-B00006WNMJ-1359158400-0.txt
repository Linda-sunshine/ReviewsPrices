review/summary: You need the Strength of 10 Men to get off the old one!review/text: The old filters are next to impossible to get off. I'm a guy, weigh 225 pounds and am pretty darn strong. I can't get these off without Dynamite. You're better off just buying another whole faucet filter and it only costs a few dollars more.
