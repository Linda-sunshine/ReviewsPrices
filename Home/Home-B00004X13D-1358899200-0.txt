review/summary: Don't waste your moneyreview/text: Bought this at the recommendations of others. At first the waffles turned out awesome but now they are awful most of the time. The waffles get burned in the middle and sometimes do not cook all the way around the edges. Here it is not even three months and am replacing it. What a waste of money. I would not recommend it to others.
