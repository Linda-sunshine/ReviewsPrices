review/summary: Wrong filter shippedreview/text: I received the Medelco basket which is not as pictured, does not fit, and is not what I ordered. LIke other reviewers mentioned it came with no packaging, which in some ways I appreciate, but thought it odd. It shipped from Abes of Maine. So far I have been given a return authorization, but no mailing label. What a waste of time and energy for a $5 product.
