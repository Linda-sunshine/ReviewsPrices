review/summary: SHOCK AND AWEreview/text: Received this thing from Amazon in early July, 2012. I was replacing a scale that I had for about three years. This lasted 3 MONTHS. Talk about built-in-obsolescence! I am furious and don't know if I will ever pay attention to reviews that have been posted about anything I buy. What happened to quality control.
