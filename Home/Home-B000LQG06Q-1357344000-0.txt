review/summary: Memory foam toppers are the bomb!review/text: Have a nice $1200 King size bed on the firmer side that just became a $2500 bed with this addition IMO. I have never owned memory foam toppers before, and this is so soft and luxurious without any of the aches and pains associated with some pillowtops I've been on. As to the heat issue, it is the winter so hard to say but I live in Houston and no problems yet with some nights in the 70s. I run on the hotter side at night and believe I would have noticed by now. Anyways, best addition to a bed I've ever bought. Oh, we also have one on our 8 year old queen futon mattress which makes it awesome as well. One caveat - don't leave it open with a 3 year old running around they will pick the corners off until it's shredded - keep it covered. Overall - 5 stars!
