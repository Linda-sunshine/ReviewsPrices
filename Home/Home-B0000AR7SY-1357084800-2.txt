review/summary: Have had this for a few yearsreview/text: I received this as a Christmas gift about 3 years ago and still use it to this day. We drink a lot of coffee but don't grind every day. This one has stayed strong, sharp and is so easy to clean up. The only issue (not a big problem at all) is when cleaning up, some of the grounds will stick to the plastic due to generated static electricity. Easy e ought to wipe out with a paper towel.
