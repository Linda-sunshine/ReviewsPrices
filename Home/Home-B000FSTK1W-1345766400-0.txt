review/summary: Works Greatreview/text: Needed a shower caddy that would stick to the shower wall since I couldn't use the hanging type due to the design of my shower head. Tried the suction cup type caddy's which would never hold. Finally gave this a try based on the reviews. This thing works great. Holds a lot of bottles and has been on for 2 weeks now...will update if it falls. I followed the mounting directions exactly which is probably pretty important if you want to mount it in a wet environment like a bathtub/shower.
