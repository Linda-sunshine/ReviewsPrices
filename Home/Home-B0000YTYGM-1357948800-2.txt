review/summary: Don't change great productreview/text: We had the exact same model for many years and it was still making good coffee when we decided to buy a new one. The new one is the same as the old one. It continues to make great coffee. I don't understand why manufacturers continue to make changes (usually for the worse) to products that don't need any changes made to them?
