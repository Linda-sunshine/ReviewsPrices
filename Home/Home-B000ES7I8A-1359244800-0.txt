review/summary: I am disappointed with this productreview/text: I bought this kettle because it is described as "cool-touch" with 8-cup capacity. I have a Hamilton Beach kettle that I bought 7 or 8 years ago and it still works like a champ! But after I received this one and tried a couple of times, I must say that I am disappointed with this kettle. I list some cons here:- It looks big but holds less than 6 cups if you fill the water under the max line, which, by the way, is hard to see. I think this is partly because of the lid - the hinge on the sides makes half of the lid going into the kettle when open, so in order to not make the lid immerse into the water inside, you cannot fill up the kettle.- Therefore I think the design is flawed; the lit should open upward more completely to not occupy the room inside the kettle.- It takes much longer to shut off after reaching the boiling point than my current Hamilton Beach kettle. I almost thought it won't shut off the first time I used it.- The lid cannot be tightly closed. When pouring out the water into a cup, some water comes out from the side of the lid.- There is no indication of water level.After one day, I decided to return it.
