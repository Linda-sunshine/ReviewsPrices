review/summary: tfalreview/text: As advertise,the 8 inch fry pan is all that but the actual cooking surface is 6 inch.Should have ordered a 10 inch pan. The pan that I have works great,love it and the best advice is "Low Heat" give it time to heat up and watch the wonderful results.(P.S. I never clean in the dishwasher,shortens the life of the pan, hand wash.
