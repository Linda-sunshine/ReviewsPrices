review/summary: Great!review/text: Love this thing! I love hard boiled eggs and my boys love soft boiled eggs (ugh I know) but it works perfect for both depending on how long you microwave it and leave it in after. So much easier/safer than watching a stove when I have little ones running around. Super easy to do and rinse off afterward.I've never had an egg explode (though my husband did - I wouldn't take that to mean the product doesn't work though, he tends to have that kind of luck while cooking)
