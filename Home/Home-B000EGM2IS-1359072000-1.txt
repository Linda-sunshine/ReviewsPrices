review/summary: Bought this for a giftreview/text: I bought this for a gift for my boss, who loves to drink hot tea at work, but did not like waiting for the water to boil. This was the answer! I bought it last Christmas, and it is still working perfectly, and gets used quite a lot on a daily basis, with no problems.
