review/summary: Used it everyday for over a year.review/text: This product has won accolades from some very serious coffee people. In my opinion they are well deserved. This little design miracle is capable of making an amazing cup of coffee.My intention back in late 2011 was to become a coffee connoisseur. Alas my time and budget never allowed me to get as far as I had intended. I did however along the way taste some extremely good coffee made in a number of different ways.For the money and convenience the Aeropress is hard to beat. Read the various reviews that go into detail about the variables that affect the final taste of the coffee and and you will get some great tips.I also would like to add that when i travel I always pack this device so I can assure that I get great coffee on the road as well.peace.
