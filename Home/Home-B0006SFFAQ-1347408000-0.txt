review/summary: Broke carafe TWICE in 3 monthsreview/text: While I like this coffeemaker, I only had it for 3 months and now I have to replace it. First I accidentally tapped it against my new granite countertop and while I concede that breakage was entirely my fault, when I poked a hole in the bottom of the glass with a simple steak knife while washing dishes, I GAVE UP!! I am not paying $24.95 for a new glass carafe every few months. Forget it. I am going with the Krups stainless steel model now. I don't know what Cuisinart could do to make a stronger, less breakable carafe, but maybe one option is to make stainless steel available for ALL their models. Sheesh.
