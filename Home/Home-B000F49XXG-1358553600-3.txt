review/summary: Great inexpensive machinereview/text: Bought this machine for a second home. This machine makes great espresso consistently. I have a much more expensive, higher end Rancilio Silvia machine, that is far more difficult to make consistently good espresso with. Hardware quality is not the same, but I would not expect it to be at a fraction of the cost. Curious how it hold up over time, but at this price it is very hard to beat.
