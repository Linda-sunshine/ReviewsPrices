review/summary: Great Concept... but mine doesn't workreview/text: I received this right on time but was disappointed after the first day. It's far less substantial than the description made it out to be. The pressure works great - for about two seconds. In order to spray a pan of garlic bread, I have to stop after each piece and pump the canister back up. It doesn't spray very well, but it spits gobs of oil quite nicely. I filled it to the halfway point - and no more - and pumped as instructed.I'll experiment with it later to see if I can get it to work properly. Meanwhile, I can't claim to be a happy user.
