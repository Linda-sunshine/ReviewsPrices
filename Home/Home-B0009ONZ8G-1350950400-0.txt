review/summary: Good for low pricereview/text: fairly easy to assemble move about but negatives are that it is fairly loud, the suction hose on the back is too short and hard to connect/disconnect to use the tools. I was disappointed to find the same model $30 cheaper in a local store after I purchased this one online
