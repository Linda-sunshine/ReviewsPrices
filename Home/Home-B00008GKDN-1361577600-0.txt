review/summary: Cast Iron griddlereview/text: This griddle a little small, but works with my glass top stove. The only short coming is the handle to too damned close to the stove top and you can't get your hand around the handle especially if you have the handle mitt. Positon your griddle carefully before you begin and this low handle problem will be a minor one.Before I bought a glass top stove, I had a better stove with a griddle and a grill in it. I missed the griddle/grill especially.As I said it's a little small, but it will do for pancakes or grilling a couple of pork chops or burgers.Cast iron is far better than a poisonous gas emitting teflon pan and lasts longer.Treat the griddle right. Use it, clean it gently and oil it.A good way to oil a griddle is rub vegetable oil on the grill top and handle. Stand the griddle up in a dishwasher (or equiv) with a plate underneath it to catch the excess oil. When the excess oil drips off, Wipe the griddle with your hand. Then wipe the oil from your hand on a cloth or paper towel. Do it again until there is no excess oil left on the griddle. This method will keep the griddle from picking up lint from a cloth or paper towel I store my griddle in the oven.If the griddle feels sticky, wash it again and start the oil process again. Eventually you'll get it right and IT WON&#34;T STICK when you cook with it.Jim
