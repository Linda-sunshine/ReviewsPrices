review/summary: Sturdy, non-stick seems durable, but a bit heavyreview/text: Sturdy, non-stick seems durable. Even though a bit heavy, I think I'll collect a few more sizes of this brand. It's also super easy to clean because the outside is also non-stick. Sometimes, when I'm cooking 2 separate dishes in the same pan, all I need to do is wipe it in between.
