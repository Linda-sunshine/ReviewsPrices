review/summary: Works quickly, and perfectlyreview/text: I bought this because I had an herb garden and wanted to harvest all of it before the frost set in so I figured I would buy a dehydrator. This was my first time using one, so I had to research on how to do it correctly.I was amazed at how fast it worked. I thought it would take at least 10 hours but it was completely dried out in just two hours.The only problem I have is that there is no timer or no on/off switch.
