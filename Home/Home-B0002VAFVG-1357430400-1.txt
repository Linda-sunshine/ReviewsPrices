review/summary: Love itreview/text: The hardest part about this juicer is prepping the fruit or veges. Easy to use, easy to clean and the juice is YUM!!!! The biggest downside is the size and where to store when not using it. For now it stays on the counter as we use it a lot, but eventually, it needs to displace something in the cupboard. Worth every dollar!
