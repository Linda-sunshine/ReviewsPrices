review/summary: Used for over a year, and still impressedreview/text: I use this item probably 2-3 times a week. Puts out a good volume of steam quickly. I use it for my work uniform (polyester) and it takes the wrinkles out immediately. So much easier than ironing, and a small footprint for a machine. I'd buy again.
