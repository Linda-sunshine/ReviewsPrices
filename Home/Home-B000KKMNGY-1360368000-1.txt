review/summary: What a difference they make!review/text: If you are really squeezed for storage space and/or want a place where you can just reach and grab without rumbling through all sorts of junk to get to the one item you want, this is for you! Make certain you have a flat shelf and some space beneath the shelf as these are roomy. I have pullout shelving in my kitchen but they still did not give me the convenience I required so I added these to those areas plus my kitchen closet and my studio and office. It is so easy now to just reach out and get what I need (those items I tend to use the most). They are a bit pricey but the reward is in the daily convenience.
