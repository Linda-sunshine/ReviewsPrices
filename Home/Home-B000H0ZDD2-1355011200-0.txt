review/summary: Still working greatreview/text: I have had this product running in the cab of our offshore boat for several months now non stop. I must say I was skeptical about this little device working, but it works great. It is always filling up with water, so I know its taking it out of our cabin which has finally stopped the mold that forms after tossing our dive gear in the cabin. I would recommend this product to anyone with a small room or space.
