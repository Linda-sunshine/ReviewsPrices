review/summary: This thing is awesomereview/text: I really, really like it. It makes the job of cooking much simpler and more efficient. Also, it is a BREEZE to clean if you have a dishwasher since all you have to do is hit one button and the part that needs to be washed detaches. This also means easy &#34;assembly&#34;. I hate when I have to put products together and figure all that business out, but this is just literally two parts...with the blender portion attached or not. I haven't used the blending cup it comes with just yet since I didn't need to (you can blend things directly in the pot!) but it seems like it could be useful one of these days. Shipped quickly as well.
