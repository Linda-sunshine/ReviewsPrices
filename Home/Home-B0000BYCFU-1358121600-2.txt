review/summary: What a joy.review/text: I bought this for myself as a Christmas present and and spent several days after the holiday canning. I had a great time and because of the size was able to put 60 jars of chili, spaghetti sauce, soups and apples in just a few days. I'm looking forward to doing the next patch of goodies in the near future.
