review/summary: Whole lot of shaking going onreview/text: I understand that no product will generally have great reviews from everyone, so before buying I looked over reviews and thought, well, overall this should be "okay". NOT. It was extremely noisy, mostly due to the fact that the storage wells wobbled. There was just no way to keep them from vibrating. Perhaps, if there had not been wheels on the base part of the humidifier,it would have been stabilized, but I was not about to start messing with that part. In the end we bought one from Sears and have been very happy with it.
