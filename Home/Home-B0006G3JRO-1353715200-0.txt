review/summary: Not perfect, but I love this gadget!!review/text: I use the stick blender all the time for soups, and it is great for smoothies for the kids or blended ice drinks in the summer for grown ups. (We have a crushed ice option on the fridge that we use. Always use some liquid with the ice.) The mini chopper is not perfect, but useful instead of dragging out the large food processor. I have to scrape the sides down for making things like herb butter, and it doesn't work well for spices. The whisk can be messy if my bowl is not deep enough, but I love the versatility and end up using this thing at least 4 times a week. Do not put the processor lid in the dishwasher as water gets in and it takes forever to get it out. I cook everyday for my family, and I've owned mine for about 2 years now. I've given several as housewarming gifts as I really like it.
