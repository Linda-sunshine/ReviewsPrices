review/summary: Was a great grinder, for a monthreview/text: I received a gift card for my birthday at the end of November. I have been wanting a coffee grinder for months and have been on amazon just as long looking at review after review. Finally, I found one that had fairly good reviews so I ordered it. It worked wonderfully for a month. Had great uniform grind, did not have a problem with static as I had read in so many reviews and it was not loud. The only problem is it just quit grinding one day. Thank goodness for amazons excellent return policy! Now, to find one that lasts longer than a month, or 6 months... Very disappointed in this grinder and manufacturer.
