review/summary: Nice vacuum at a good price.review/text: Was looking for a low priced vacuum for our second floor, and the Hoover Tempo fits the bill. It's lightweight, stores easily and has great suction. Only thing I could wish for would be a longer hose for the attachments, but at this price, I'm happy with what I got.
