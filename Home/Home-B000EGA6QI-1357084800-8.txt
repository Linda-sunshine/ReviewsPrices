review/summary: Extremely quick and easyreview/text: After receiving the Smart-stick today, I made my favorite Italian lentil and spinach soup. In the past, I had to blend it in batches in my big Kitchen-aid blender... took maybe 10-15 minutes. Tonight, I blended it IN THE POT in about 15 seconds. Wow! I will be making this soup much more often.
