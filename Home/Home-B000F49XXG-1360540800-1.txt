review/summary: Awesome Espresso!!!!review/text: This is my first espresso maker and I LOVE IT! I heard about this from a review of Top 2012 Espresso makers. I had never made espresso before either until I bought this and found that it was easy to use after reading the directions and making sure that I correctly cleaned the filter before use. It's a neat little maker that looks nice, works easily and makes delicious coffee, yes!!I love getting up and making my own espresso in the morning now! Getting to use my own cute espresso cup is a plus too :)
