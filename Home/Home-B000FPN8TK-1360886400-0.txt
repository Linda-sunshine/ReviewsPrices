review/summary: Another kind of teapot!!review/text: The Adagio teapot is practical, especially if you use a lot of loose tea and are not keen on buying a traditional type of teapot.I would have preferred a glass teapot, but when ordering, I hadn't realized it was made of plastic. As other reviewers have mentioned, I too am not very comfortable with storing hot liquid in plastic containers.The teapot does leak a little, but only if it is not placed properly on a surface. The serving of the tea, although easy, is a trifle unusual- you place the teapot on top of the cup and the tea pours into the cup...The loose tea leaves are not very easy to get out of the teapot when cleaning it.In the two years I've had it, I haven't had any problems with it and it is a conversation piece when I use it for guests. The price is reasonable. However, I am still looking for a traditional ceramic teapot, with a good filter...'
