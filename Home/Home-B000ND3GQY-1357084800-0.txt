review/summary: I like itreview/text: I use this to make fried rice and it can make a good amount. It fits on the large hot plate of part of my stove and cooks evenly. The sides are just aluminum, I believe, and the bottom is what is what counts. Overall I'm satisfied with the product, tho I limit it in it's usage. It's fairly big so I have a hard time cleaning it in my sink... But I have a small, old style, stainless sink.
