review/summary: What a mistakereview/text: I bought this grinder because of the number of 5-star reviews, now I wish I had read through the reviews more carefully. This thing has only two faults as far as I can see, but those are two BIG unforgivable faults. I will not be buying this model again.First of all, as something that's marketed as a coffee grinder and not a spice/nut grinder, the capacity should not have been so small(Notice the capacity is not mentioned on the Amazon product page). I can barely load enough coffee beans to make one cup of coffee. The blades surely would have had no problems with a larger load if the wall of the grinder chamber was made higher to increase the capacity, but somehow the maker has decided to keep the chamber shallow, why?????Second of all, this grinder grinds very coarsely unless you grind for a long time while shaking the whole machine vigorously. Merely grinding for longer without shaking the machine is only going to give you a layer of very fine grind at the bottom and coarse grind all the way above the blades. I don't know what kind of coffee making requires such a coarse grind. Did Proctor even test this product before starting to sell it? Since I use Aero-Press for my coffee I require a very fine grind. As I mentioned before, I AM able to force a passably fine grind out of this grinder that does work well with my Aero-Press. However, it takes a long grinding session, and as you should know, coffee grind starts to overheat and lose flavor if grounded past 20 seconds. Also shaking the machine to produce a fine ground presents me with a strange phenomenon: coffee grind starts leaking out of the hole where the retractable power cable is stored!!! It's the weirdest sight and I don't believe it's good for the longevity of the machine! I wouldn't be able to take the thing apart to clean up the coffee grind accumulating inside!
