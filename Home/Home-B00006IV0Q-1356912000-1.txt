review/summary: Delivers hot, flavorful coffee; easy to cleanreview/text: I like my coffee hot. I've never had a Mr. Coffee type drip coffee maker deliver coffee hot enough for me. This percolator makes coffee hot enough that, even after adding cream, I don't need to zap it in the microwave. I also think the percolating method makes more flavorful coffee.Regarding complaints about grounds in the coffee, I don't think its that much of a problem. But I'm kind of particular, so I just put a paper filter in the bottom of the basket.I think I read comments about difficulty cleaning this coffee pot. Actually, nothing could be easier. I just fill it up once a week with fresh water and put two tablespoons of Cascade dishwasher detergent (granules) in the well and let it go through a perk cycle. Then I pour it out, rinse it, and perk one more pot with just water. Clean as a whistle.I almost didn't buy it because it doesn't have a timer option. But I just bought a plug-in appliance timer and use that. Problem solved.I was also concerned about reliability, just because it's made in China. But it seems very well-built and I've been using it once or twice a day for almost 4 months now with no malfunctions.
