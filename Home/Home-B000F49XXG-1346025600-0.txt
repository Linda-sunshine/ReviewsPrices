review/summary: A De' Longhi Disappointmentreview/text: I own an older, smaller De' Longhi that is superior to this. My objections to this machine are numerous: it doesn't produce much crema at all; it rattles so much you have to hold onto the espresso cup to keep if from dancing off the side; not only is the frothing wand too low to the counter, as someone noted, but for the first second or two when it's turned on, a straight, hard stream of water--not steam--comes out, seriously diluting the espresso. I'm going back to my old De' Longhi.
