review/summary: My pet frog creates mist!review/text: So I bought this cool pet frog on Amazon. You fill up its head with water and s/he creates mist! It's remarkable. That is the only care and feeding that you need to give it! In this sense, these frogs make excellent pets. Other than some white residue and a couple of water drips on the floor, they don't leave the usual messes around that regular pets do.I have to say, it makes me feel weird to rip off my pet frog's face every time I go to fill him up with water, but he has not uttered a peep, so I have to believe this is painless for him.There are 2 downsides of this pet frog that I have found so far that prevent it from getting 5 stars. The first is that if you hold the carrying handle while you fill it with water, it can be difficult to keep steady if you don't have strong wrists. I would suggest holding the frog's head by both hands when you fill it if your wrists are on the wimpy side.The second is that you should make sure you have a plastic tray or something under your pet frog if you decide you want to put it on the floor or on a table. It tends to create a lot of moisture in a radius around its base and this could be tough on hardwood, other flooring, or tables.All in all, I'm pretty happy with my pet frog. I wish he would be a little more lively and animated, but at least he always has a smile on his face. Well, until I pull his face off so I can fill his head with water.
