review/summary: Breville Juicer is the best bank for your buck!!review/text: Packaging was fine when it arrived...no major damages.We already know what to expect of the juicer as we have used it before at my wife's work...this is the reason why we would like to acquire the juicer because we simply love it. The preparation of cutting the fruits etc is a pain for 30 seconds of juicing, but it is worth all that effort once you taste pure juice instead of buying 'Simply Orange', 'Tropicana', or 'Ocean Spray'. It will be addictive and we do juice everyday.It will pay off at the end if you are a Jamba Juice or juice consumer. Jamba Juice cost $6 for a jumbo size which is crazy expensive and all they use ingredients are frozen fruits and yogurts. We buy a whole bag of carrots worth $2.99 and a $5 bag orange which will last us the whole week. You can calculate on average of $5 for jamba juice for the whole week and it will be $25 when it only cost $8 and it should be healthier...
