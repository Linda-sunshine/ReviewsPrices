review/summary: Great Coffeereview/text: I've had this product for a month or so now and highly recommend it. It's easy to use and cleans up quickly. I can make a pot of coffee in a short time, but it's great for just one cup. The coffee that is pressed out is too strong for us, we add equal parts hot water and it's a perfect cup of coffee. I might add that I suffer from acid reflux and coffee is a big trigger for me. In moderation I tolerate coffee made with the AeroPress much better than coffee made from a drip coffee maker.
