review/summary: Reliable Waffle Makerreview/text: This is the second Cuisinart WMR-CA Round Classic Waffle Maker I use. I like the small grids, so the waffle comes out crisp and brown. The old one just gets old, so I purchase this new one to replace it. Somehow the first time I used this new waffle maker, my waffles got stuck on both side of the waffle iron even after I apply butter on both surfaces. But when I used it the second time, the problem went away. I guess it needed seasoning. Since then it is doing fine.
