review/summary: Great Hot Coffee - every time!review/text: We were looking for a 12-cup coffeemaker - preferably one with a insulated carafe. We didn't find one, so we kept the carafe from our dead Krupps and moved on. I read lots of reviews before I purchased the Brew Central 12-cup coffeemaker - all the good and the bad. I even bought a metal tray to hold overflows - so far not even a hint of a problemAfter two months of daily use, I'm giving it two thumbs up! If I had more thumbs, I would give it more thumbs up. It consistently brews perfect hot coffee quickly.The water filter is impressive. I like its little beeps to tell me the coffee is ready. I would probably love the set it and forget it timer, but it just isn't worth it. I live in the country and we experience too many power failures.I am so glad I bought this coffeemaker. I highly recommend it.
