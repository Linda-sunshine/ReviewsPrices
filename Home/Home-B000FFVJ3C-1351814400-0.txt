review/summary: Easy to cleanreview/text: I am a first-time dehydrator user. Living in Hawaii, we are used to partially-dried fish and meats as beer appetizers, and this works extremely well for making just that. Dried fish, as well as partially dried marinated beef (known as pipi kaula, pronounced pee-pee cow-lah) can be set up at lunchtime, and be ready to eat a few hours later, after work!I just line the meats in the trays and stack them up with the dehydrator on the top, set the dial to its highest setting, plug in and around 3 hours later, it's all done. Break out the drinks and it's party time.I don't use the machine to totally dry anything for prolonged storage, and I don't have any experience with other machines, so I can't critique this other than that it works perfect for the way I use it.I plug my kitchen sink, fill with warm soapy water and soak the trays overnight. Light scrub and rinse clean, and dry. I keep the original box, and just put the dehydrator inside along with the instruction manual, and put it in the corner.Love the dehydrator, use it once or twice a week. Recommended!
