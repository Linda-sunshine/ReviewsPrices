review/summary: So far great!review/text: I purchased a cheap under $30 dehydrator not knowing anything about dehydrating. I learned real quick that it was pretty much useless. Rotating trays every few hours and no temperature control didn't cut it. This Nesco product works nicely. I will update if anything changes since I have only used it twice to dehydrate eggs but what a difference! All the trays were evenly dehydrated because of the fan and temperature control. It's quiet also which is nice. The only thing I could think of as a con was that you have to turn it off remove the top to check the progress. Next project dried fruit or beef jerky. Excited to experiment with this.
