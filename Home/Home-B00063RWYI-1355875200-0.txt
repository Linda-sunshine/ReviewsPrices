review/summary: Lodge is the best!review/text: This pan is every thing it says it is. I had no problems with rust although the pan did need a good coat of olive oil and it looked beautiful like the picture. I love all my cast iron pieces from Lodge. I ordered some cast iron bread pans made by Camp Chief from another vendor and they were not as refined as the Lodge pans. Lodge's bread pans were too small, but none the less I well keep my bread pans for now. Amazon gave me an incredible price of $23 and some change for my dutch oven pan and I couldn't be happier. Cooking with Lodge cast iron is not for everybody due to the seasoning instructions, but I think this is way better then teflon. I just wash with water and a scrub sponge and dry and reapply olive oil and my pan is ready for next use. It is heavy and I just leave in on the stove for now. I do use my hot mitts to protect my counter tile, but it is no big deal.
