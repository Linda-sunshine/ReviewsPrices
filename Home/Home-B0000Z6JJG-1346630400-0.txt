review/summary: None better!review/text: I was given my first salad-shooter 20 years ago. It took a lot of use - grated mostly cheese because there is nothing as good as fresh-grated cheese. The motor was sounding really loud and stressed so I upgraded to the professional model. I love it! I use it mainly for grating zuchinni, cheese and slicing cucumbers.
