review/summary: Not quite as describedreview/text: Stainless steel HOUSING? NO. It's actually all, or mostly, stainless steel, inside and out. I've used kettles like this, in hotel rooms, that have a stainless steel inside bottom--like this one--but plastic on the sides and top. This one is stainless on the bottom inside, stainless on the sides, inside and outside (one layer), except for the sight glass under the handle, and the top is stainless on the outside and plastic on the inside. The spout is stainless, but has a plastic mounted wire strainer insert which may be removed if desired.Now, is this kettle better or worse than my stainless-and-plastic hotel-room ones? Some would say better because mostly stainless is in contact with the water. Less leaching of nasty chemicals like plasticizers, etc. I would, however, say worse, because stainless is hotter to the touch (don't touch it while it's boiling; you'll burn your hand) and it's noisier. So, while I think it's quite necessary and desirable to have a stainless bottom, it's actually preferable to have plastic sides and top, for noise and heat waste reasons.Your choice, but you should know what you're getting if you buy this.
