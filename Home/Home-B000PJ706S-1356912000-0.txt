review/summary: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCTreview/text: I purchased this kettle after a recommendation from an associate. It is beautiful, heats quickly, and I had no trouble with a smell. However, after a year of use, the top fell off. I had taken care with this appliance but the plastic that holds the top just broke. I sent an email to customer service with no response at all. I didn't expect a new appliance but at least an acknowledgement of poor design. This is also a safety issue that could cause a bad burn. I will never buy one of their products again. A manufacturer should stand behind their product and Capresso certainly did not.C.Ely
