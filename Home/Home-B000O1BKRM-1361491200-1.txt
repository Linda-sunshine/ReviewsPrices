review/summary: great ice cube traysreview/text: I love that these trays are silicone so getting the ice out is easy, which is really the only reason I bought these. The size of the individual ice cube is perfect, & since they're a cube shape they melt slower than your typical plastic tray ice shape, making your ice go further. The only thing is I wouldn't say that they come out as a perfect cube every time, but honestly that isn't a big deal to me, I bought these for ease of use more than looks. I highly recommend these trays.
