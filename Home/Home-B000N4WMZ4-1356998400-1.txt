review/summary: Great pot but wrong color!!review/text: I gave this five stars because I know Lodge makes a great pot, but beware if you're buying the burgundy color - it looks burgundy on the website but in reality it's more of a deep chocolate brown - I had to return it because it was a gift for my daughter -in-law and her kitchen has red accents with no brown in sight!
