review/summary: it works but is hard to cleanreview/text: it filters the coffee well but it is hard to clean out after using it...it arrived with the handle half on and half off one side was off and it was very difficult to attach it. I thought this would be a great way to avoid wasting all that paper with filters but you need to clean it out with something to get all the grounds out so using more paper with paper towels...anyone who knows an easy way to clean this item please let me know.
