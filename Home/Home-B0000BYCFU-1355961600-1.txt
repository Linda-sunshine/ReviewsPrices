review/summary: My Reviewreview/text: This is my review so far. I have only played around with this figuring out how to use it as a canner and as a pressure cooker. As was said this thing is huge and you might have a hard time finding someplace to store it. Setting on the electric burner it is about 17 1/2" tall so figure in the clearance above it. It came with a Warning flyer in the pot that said "Do not use pressure canner on any outdoor heat source such as a gas burner for a turkey fryer" Does anyone know anything about this? I plan on contacting Presto to see what they say. I will post more after I have used this more, but so far it works as it is suppose to. I was hoping to use this on this burner..Camp Chef Explorer Series EX-60LW 2-Burner Modular Cooking System, BlackHas anyone used this on this burner?Update..Presto emailed me and said that the BTU should not be greater than 12,000 BTU. I'm still doing some research on this.
