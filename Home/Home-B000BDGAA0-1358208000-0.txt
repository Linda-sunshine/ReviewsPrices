review/summary: Don't Bother!review/text: I used search criteria of &#34;big fluffy pillow&#34;, and what I got was roughly the equivalent of a rectangle of wood wrapped in a thing layer of foam rubber. It is incredibly uncomfortable and reeks of chemicals. I gave it a try for one night and woke up with a stuffy nose and a rash on my face. I was going to return it, but for some bizarre reason my cat likes it so it has been turned into a cat bed.
