review/summary: Great Productreview/text: I have used this thermos for about a month now and I think it's fantastic. I have only used it for hot liquids, but I've filled my coffee at 6:30 AM and it's still hot by noon (about the time coffee should have been gone). This also causes one to drink less coffee because it's still so hot and it has a small hole to let out the liquid that you end up having the same 16 ounces of coffee for quite some time. I would recommend and have recommended this product to friends that travel with their coffee and can't seem to make it last.
