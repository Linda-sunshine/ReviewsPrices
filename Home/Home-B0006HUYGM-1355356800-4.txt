review/summary: Absolutely LOVE it!!!review/text: Purchased the Eureka after my Dirt Devil Hand Held finally died. I was unsure of how it would perform, but I definitely needed something small to vacuum my stairs. It worked amazingly well. The suction was far better than the dirt devil and the attached hose made really cleaning the stairs so easy. I have a dog and the hair gets all over. I also use it on my couches and it removes the dog hair without effort. Definitely worth the money!!
