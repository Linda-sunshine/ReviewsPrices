review/summary: Worth buyingreview/text: I've owned this trashcan for a little over two months and still love it! It took time to get used to the touchless feature, but once you get a hang of it, you gotta love it, especially when bringing hands full of scraps to throw away. Try doing it with the trashcan in the closed cabinet under the sink. It seems to be too sensitive sometimes, and opens when I am just walking too close by, but this doesn't bother me at all. The mechanism is quiet, opens and closes properly, you can open it with the "Open" button for it to stay open when you are cooking, and need to use it constantly. I finally don't have to worry about the cat getting into it when we are away from home. The only downside of a closed garbage can is that in the heat of summer garbage starts smelling faster, but you can't feel the smell when the can is closed - that carbon filter and tightly closed lid do their job pretty good. Overall - I am very satisfied with this product, and feel it's totally worth the price.
