review/summary: Great Addition to Any Fridgereview/text: I bought this dispenser to replace a much smaller Brita. The large size of this unit is it's best feature, since I don't have to refill it several times a day. All I have to do is fill it up before I go to bed at night, and I have cold water all day long the next day.The water in my city is very chlorinated, and tastes quite bad straight out of the tap. The Pur filter completely removes any unpleasant tastes, even more effectively than the Brita filter did. I'm also comforted by the fact that the filter removes lead from water, since I live in a building that is over 100 years old. Who knows what's still in those old pipes?Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with this water dispenser, and highly recommend it.
