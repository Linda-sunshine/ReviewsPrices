review/summary: Great coffee, poor qualityreview/text: I bought this coffee maker a year and a half ago. It works fine but the lid that closes over the filter and water is almost cracked all the way in half. The arm that releases the water to brew broke at the attachment point to the lid. Honestly, I am not sure how it would crack like that accept for maybe the steam? I have finally decided to toss it because now the maker leaks some when I make a pot of coffee. Why aren't things made to last anymore? Geez...
