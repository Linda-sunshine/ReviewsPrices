review/summary: Very soft, but shrunk significantlyreview/text: I have had bad luck with sheets shrinking, so I got queen size sheets for my full size bed. It's a good thing I did because despite taking all precautions when washing these when I first got them, they shrunk. They fit my 10" full size bed alright, but would not fit a queen size bed any longer without significant bunching.Since I planned in advance, I am very happy with the purchase, but it's something to be aware of for you all out there.
