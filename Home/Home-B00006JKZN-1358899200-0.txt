review/summary: Best Waffle iron weve foundreview/text: We tried 2 different cheap waffle makers before we got this one...we didn't want big thick Belgian waffles, which seem to be all the rage nowadays. We like thinner, crispy ones. The two other standard (thin) waffle makers we got took forever and didn't cook well.This one cooks fast and thoroughly, but makes them fairly thick still. But its the best we've found for a reasonable price.I wish the lid locked down or something, but you can have it all!
