review/summary: Great Buyreview/text: Everything about this product, from its durable quality, to the precision of its craftsmanship makes it a good buy.I use it predominantly to make "spaghetti" from zucchini as a pasta replacement, and I have to say that I barely miss it.The only thing I have to say is that it should have included an "angel hair" cut attachment as well.
