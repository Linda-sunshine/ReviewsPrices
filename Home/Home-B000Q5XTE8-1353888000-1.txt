review/summary: Bad Partsreview/text: The product came with rusty parts. The packaging was also crushed. Some of the parts were crushed.I wanted to return the chair but we live in the third floor and it is a pain to haul it back - so I started to use the chair.The chair now does not hold my weight and sinks down.Altogether a very bad buy - not worth the money paid for it.
