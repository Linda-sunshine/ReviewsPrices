review/summary: Fuzzy Logic Cooks Good Brow and wild ricereview/text: As a physicist I am accustomed to tweaking things to make them do what they are not suppose to be able to do. Not so here, this rice maker is perfection in every way.I only cook high fiber content brown, black, wild rice some mixed with beans. The 3 cup size is perfect for making fresh rice every day for two, but is sufficient for larger special occasions needs. as with guests. High fiber content rices are hard to cook but very kind to my sugar levels as I am diabetic and cannot eat white rice or wheat products. Before this rice maker, I could only rarely cook brown rice do to excessive cooking time, now I program it to finish and hold warm about when I expect to get home. Before, I never had the requisite two hour cooking time., now not an issue. This machine remembers everything, so it is very easy to restart for the next day. A surprisingly solid value. I also know something of fuzzy logic. This is a very good use of fuzzy logic as it compensates for my misuse, and other unplanned variables, as contrasted to a non yielding fixed cycle.
