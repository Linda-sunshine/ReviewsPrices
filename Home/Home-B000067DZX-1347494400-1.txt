review/summary: Very Limited Shelf-Lifereview/text: Out of four Pur water filters I used in the last two months, three clogged within a couple of weeks. I live in New England, receiving water from the Quabbin Reservoir, an excellent water source. As such, these filters were simply an insurance policy. I would highly recommend choosing another product.At this writing, due to favorable reviews, I will try the 'Mavea' product line. Hopefully, I will have better results.
