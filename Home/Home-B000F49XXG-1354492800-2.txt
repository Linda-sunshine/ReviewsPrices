review/summary: De'Longhi EC155 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker.review/text: Unfortunately when this arrived it blew our house fuses , I then discovered it was 120 v , Australian power source is 240 v . Because the return shipping cost was AU$75 I decided to purchase a voltage step down converter for AU$100 , which I am still waiting forUntil this arrives and i can try the coffee maker I do not know if it has been damaged or not I would like to see International Electrical product sales , including the suppliers, emphasize this information so that willing customers do not have the same problems, as I am sure it will put people off considering these types of sales.
