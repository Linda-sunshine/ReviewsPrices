review/summary: Broke after 2.5 years with light usagereview/text: I bought the Lodge Color Enameled Cast-Iron 6-Quart Dutch Oven from Amazon in Feb 2010 and I've been pretty happy with it until yesterday, when part of the enamel on the bottom broke off and the little pieces flew into the air and hit my face. I was frying some bacon over med-high heat. Luckily I didn't sustain any injuries.It is not used very often (on average, about 2-3 times a month), I always washed it by hand and used wooden spoons.I've never owned an Le Creuset so I cannot compare, but I will never buy anything made by Lodge again.
