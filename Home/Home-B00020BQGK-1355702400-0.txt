review/summary: this does not suck literalyreview/text: I have a slate Kitchen floor and needed a little vacuum to get the crumbs up in the morning after the kids go to school. This vacuum do not only NOT get up the crumbs it over heats in like 3 min. I can't even vacuum my whole floor. Unless you live in a tiny tiny tiny apartment and only need to vacuum 2 square feet then this vacuum is not the one for you!
