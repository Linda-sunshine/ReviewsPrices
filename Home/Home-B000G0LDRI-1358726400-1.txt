review/summary: Why did I wait so long?review/text: I thought I could do without this product and now I can't believe I waited so long! When my daughter came to visit at Christmas, she actually got nose bleeds from the dry air in our home. That's what convinced me to get this humidifier. It has made a huge difference. It puts out close to 5 gallons of water in a 24 hour period to hold the humidity at about 45%. We don't run it 24 hrs/day though, because it is kind of noisy and when we're in that room we don't always have it running. In fact, the noise is the one drawback to this unit. Other than that, it's great. Works efficiently, easy to operate and you won't believe the difference in your home. My floors even stopped squeaking!
