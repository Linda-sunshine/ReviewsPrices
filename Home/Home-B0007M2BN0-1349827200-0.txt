review/summary: Awesome!review/text: Product worked perfect, 9 minutes for hard boiled (large grade AA eggs-700 watt microwave) I think I could have let them set for a shorter amount of time after cooking and run under water. They were hard boiled, slightly over done but I love this product. I had my doubts with other reviews but I am convinced this is great! Now to tinker the cooking time with fewer and smaller(medium or large A eggs). Woohoo! I will post more results when necessary.
