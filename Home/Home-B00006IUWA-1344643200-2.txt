review/summary: Works great.review/text: I have owned this popper for 25 months now and it still works like new. Doesn't take more than 3 minutes to pop a big bowl of popcorn. I tried using the butter tray, but it never worked for me. The popcorn would be done popping and there would still be mostly solid butter. Eventually I lost the tray and plug the whole with a broken measuring cup. I've found that buttery oil is a better topping anyway. I purchased this along with theParagon Bulk Bag Yellow Corn (12.5-Pounds)and couldn't be happier. The seeds were only $16.99 and I still have nearly 5 pounds left after 2 years of consumption. I recommend both products to all popcorn lovers. You will say a lot of money when you don't have to keep buying individual bags.
