review/summary: Amazing!!review/text: Never had heard about these until my boyfriend saw it on a cooking show and wanted to get it to make Belgian Crystallized Sugar for his beer brewing. But the chef said it's perfect for baking too, so I was all for it!It saves so much icky-sticky-burned-on-the-pan clean up time!! This thing is worth so much more than they ask, I swear! It might have a couple dark stains and such from being in the oven, but that's normal according to the instructions, and it hasn't affected the food at all. Such easy clean-up, I love it - just wipe it down under warm water and there you go! And the pan still looks clean, no need to scrub and scrap burned-on food - I never thought that was avoidable!My boyfriend accidentally cut some baked goods on top of it and it cut right through it (oops!!), but we got another one anyway because WE LOVE IT!! So worth it!! Will make sure not to cut on it again, haha.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! Oh yeah, also, he bought it for making that crystallized sugar because it spreads the heat evenly to anything on it, and cold too! Sure worked for our cookies, they baked evenly and tasted great :)
