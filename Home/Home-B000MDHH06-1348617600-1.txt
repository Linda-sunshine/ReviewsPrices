review/summary: good buyreview/text: I've had it for a few months and I use it everyday. I think the carrots are a little hard on this unit hut it still does the job great. Its easier to clean than the more expensive version I think. If this one burns up im getting a smoothie maker where it doesn't have the fibrous waste like the bullet.
