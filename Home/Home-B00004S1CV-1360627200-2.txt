review/summary: Just one complaintreview/text: My biggest complaint with this mug is that the holes of the tea infuser are too large, and some of the smaller bits of tea pass right through. Sometimes I shake the infuser with the tea in it into the sink, but that feels like a waste of tea. Usually I just deal with the bits. Given that I bought this for tea, this is a big con for me.But, other than that, the mug works perfectly. It keeps liquids hot for hours (I put boiling hot tea in my mug at 10am this morning, and it burned my tongue at 12:30pm), but the outside doesn't get too hot to hold. It is completely leak-proof. Even with the drinking lid on it's difficult to spill because the drinking hole sits about 1.5 inches below the top.It doesn't hold a lot of liquid, but as a result it's small and fits in my book bag easily, so that's a wash.If they just made the mesh holes a little smaller, this would be the best insulated tea mug known to man.
