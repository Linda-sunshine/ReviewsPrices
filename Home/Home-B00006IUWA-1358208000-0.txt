review/summary: Wish I Had Gotten This A Long Time Agoreview/text: My wife hates microwave popcorn, but our new apartment's stove top seems to magically not allow stove top popcorn to be made. After several attempts, that only produced either un-popped and burnt popcorn, I decided to try a hot air popper. I haven't really seen or used one since I was a little kid but I figured it was worth a shot so I bought this one, being the best reviewed.After several uses I have to admit I could never go back to popcorn on the stove. This PopLite makes the fluffiest, best popcorn, and in a flash. Only downside is it does kinda shoot a few kernels here and there but you just need a tall enough bowl. I have not tried the butter melting tray, but I will say that it makes the best popcorn, in way less time, and I would guess it is more efficient on energy as well. If you have space on your counter, this is the best way to go for a healthy, cheap, and delicious snack.
