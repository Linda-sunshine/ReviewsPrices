review/summary: Quite functional and powerfulreview/text: Bought this unit for huge living room of about 600 Sq ft. We have a huge living room having open concept attached to a kitchen. In the winter when we had to raise the heat, it often used to make it extremely dry and that's when we thought of a humidifier. This unit is extremely powerful. It has two big tanks which are somewhat quite heavy and requires some effort to fill up but based on our usage we usually fill them up after 2-3 days as we don't keep the humidifier on all the time. Since the unit has a powerful fan, sometimes it can make the room little colder due to its functionality so we usually shut it off after few hours and based on the humidity levels we start is back again. The noise is somewhat present for the fan but not that loud, but based on its huge displacement size some fan noise is expected. Overall it is a good functional unit if the room size is like ours along with the functionality of two huge water tanks to reduce the job of filling it up more frequently.
