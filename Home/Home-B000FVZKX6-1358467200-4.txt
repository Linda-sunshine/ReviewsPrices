review/summary: Comfortable Sheetsreview/text: I was looking for a soft but durable sheet with deep pockets that would stay on a Tempurpedic adjustable bed. The sheets do a much better job of staying on the bed than the old ones, but sometimes slip off. The feel is very soft and it looks like these will be durable sheets, though we've only washed them a few times.
