review/summary: An excellent way to brew a cup of teareview/text: This ingenious little teapot is the perfect way to brew a hot cup of tea. Just put your loose tea in the pot, pour in the boiling water and let steep for a few minutes. Set the pot on your cup and it pours right out the bottom through a mesh that keeps the tea leaves in the pot. And it is BPA free which makes it all the better.
