review/summary: Great Valuereview/text: My wife and I put this vacuum on our wedding registry because it had good reviews form Amazon and Consumer Reports and was at a great price point. It's been almost five months now and we are very satisfied with this vacuum! I will say that it is not the best design in the world and the quality seems on the lower end but, for the price you can't beat it. Overall performance is very good as it does a great job cleaning our carpets and even our bare floors when we use it on them. The only complaint that I have about this vacuum is that it's louder than most vacuums I've used before. But again, for the price you can't beat it!
