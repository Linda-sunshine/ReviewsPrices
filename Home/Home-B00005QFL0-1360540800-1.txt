review/summary: Love this breadmakerreview/text: I had a breadmaker that I used for years, but it was never as good as this one. I love it and have used it at least once a week since I got it. I did have one small problem. The insulator in the bottom of the unit which holds the heating element steady was broken. I didn't notice it until I had used it a couple of times. My husband thinks it must of cracked or broken when they put the screw in it & tightened it down, as I hadn't touched the heating element. I looked it up on Panasonic's website and it only cost a few dollars, so I ordered on and got it in a few days. They might have replaced it free if I had called Panasonic, but it was getting close to Christmas and I wanted to get it as fast as I could. It was very easy to replace. The point of this story is that ever since then if I have to wipe out the bottom of the unit I am very careful not to disturb the element. I still love it and would buy it again. I do wish there was a little window in which to watch the bread rise and bake, but it is something I can live without. I like the automatic yeast dispenser, so I wouldn't want to swap that for a window. One other thing...they do not tell you in the manual the size of the loaves. Someone on a website called Panasonic and they said an XLarge loaf is 2 1/2 lbs, a Large loaf is 2 lbs and a Medium loaf is 1 1/2 lbs. That little tidbit is very handy to know. I am making European Cheese bread while typing this and it smells delicious!
