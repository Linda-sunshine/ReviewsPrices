review/summary: so far, so good!review/text: I only just received them, laundered and put them on the bed and, so far, I am very pleased. These sheets are thick and well made compared to other flannel sheets that I've had. They washed and dried beautifully, retained their shape and while there was some lint in the lint trap, it wasn't much. I'm expecting that they will wear well and last a long time.(I do wish the pillow cases were longer. They measured 29 1/4 inches long after laundering, which I think is rather skimpy for a queen size bed, but pillows have gotten skimpy, too, so what is one to do?)
