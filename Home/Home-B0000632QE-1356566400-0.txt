review/summary: Worked great for the first 9 months.review/text: First of all, respect the edges of this Mandoline when you get it. It is super sharp and very easy to cut yourself so use the device it comes with for holding your fruit or veg and you may want to consider buying protective gloves.This Mandoline did a great job for the first 9 months but now the blades seem very dull. Getting it to slice potatoes is extremely difficult and even something as soft as tomatoes is not nearly as easy to slice as it used to be. I am not sure if there is any way to sharpen them and would love to know if someone has. For this reason i would not recommend this device. The center is dull and the edges are still super sharp. This makes this thing more dangerous than it is worth and after paying nearly 40 dollars for it i am disappointed that I may end up just throwing it in the trash.
