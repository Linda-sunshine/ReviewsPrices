review/summary: Christmas Giftreview/text: Got this in the color "ice" today from my husband for Christmas. Like another reviewer, the styrofoam packaging was all broken apart inside the box. Everything was there, but there are a few large scratches on the item, and this has removed the paint. We do not want to send it back, but it was disappointing. Will update when I use the item. Still excited, as I have wanted this for a long time. Also, the color is not as bright or vibrant as in the picture on Amazon.
