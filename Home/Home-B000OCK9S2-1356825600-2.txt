review/summary: Great sound terrible clockreview/text: We got this for our kid's room. The sounds are great, but it is almost impossible to see the numbers on the clock unless you are directly in front of it. I can't see it at all at night when I go into check on the kids. The blue back light behind the numbers is a bad idea. I've tried adjusting the contrast every way possible and no luck.
