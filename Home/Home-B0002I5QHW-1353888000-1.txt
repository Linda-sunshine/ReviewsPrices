review/summary: Not bad for a little grinder!review/text: Not a bad little grinder for the price! I purchased this so that I could grind up the leftover ham I cooked for Thanksgiving (about 5 pounds of ham)to make shepherds pie and add a little ground up ham to my hashbrowns in the morning and it worked flawlessly. I also plan on using it to grind up the leftover roast pork that I frequently cook. I'm giving it four stars because I've only used it once, so time will tell if it holds up. If it does I'll update my review. It's also very easy to take apart and clean.
