review/summary: Great Performancereview/text: I love this thing. It heats the water pretty fast and is very easy to clean. Once a month I put in some white vinegar and let it sit for an hour or so. That cleans any hard water deposits with just a wipe.This thing does make a lot of noise. It's not going to wake anyone up, but it is loud. If you have it next to a small TV, you may not be able to hear the TV. If it's in the kitchen, you may hear it in the living room, but it just sounds like water boiling. The funny ting is it makes the noise before it boils. When the water is actually boiling, it's quiet.
