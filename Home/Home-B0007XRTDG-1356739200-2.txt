review/summary: Changed Our Lives!!review/text: My husband & I live in a small, limited space apartment in a very nice retirement community which does provide 3 meals a day. However, we decided that we would like the option of cooking some of our favorite recipes and without a stove and oven we were limited to a microwave. I began a search for an electric skillet and after reviewing dozens of them we chose the Presto 16&#34; skillet and it has definitely changed our lives. It is easy to use, cooks evenly, and is easy to clean. We are now considering getting the 12&#34; Presto skillet for smaller recipes after the first of the year. I have liked Presto small appliances and plan this spring to get a Presto crockpot.Thanks, Terry
