review/summary: Great productreview/text: My husband is a deer hunter and makes lots of deer jerky for family and friends. These Nesco Dehydrators work great for this process. They work well for drying fruit, also. If you are looking for a good, portable dehydrator, I recommend the Nesco. We have bought 2 of the smaller models and one large one. I also recommend buying extra trays but no more than 2 because then you loose air circulation over the food. This is a good, useful product!
