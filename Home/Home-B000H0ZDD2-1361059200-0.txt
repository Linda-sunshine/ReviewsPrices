review/summary: Hard working little guyreview/text: When I saw how small this is I was skeptical that it would perform but after one day there was a noticeable decrease in the moisture on my windows. I'm using it in a small (8x10) bedroom where water was completely covering the lower half of the two windows! It needs emptying about every 3 days which for how much moisture is in here tells me it's pulling out an impressive amount ^_^
