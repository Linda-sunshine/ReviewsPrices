review/summary: Cleans well, just take your timereview/text: First things first: read the directions. I've used this thing several times and still every time I pull it out I have to flip through the book again to make sure I'm doing it right. Everything fits together and works great, but there are a lot of moving parts and the takedown and reassembly is not always obvious. The upholstery attachment works fairly well, though it's a bit of a chore to switch everything around for that use. But when it comes to the quality of the cleaning I've been very impressed, so I can forgive the minor annoyances.
