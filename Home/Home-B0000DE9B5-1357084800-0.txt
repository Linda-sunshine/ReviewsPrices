review/summary: Great for iced tea!review/text: I use this with my home iced tea maker all the time and it works great! I love the thick walls of glass - it is very durable. The lid works well enough but can be a little tricky to keep totally clean. Also the handle doesn't leave much room for fingers - I have big hands (men's large gloves) and it is a little tight for me. However at this price it seems like it will be hard to beat, and I do recommend it.
