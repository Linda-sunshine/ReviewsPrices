review/summary: Amazing!review/text: This vacuum is amazing! Prior to this purchase, I have only owned regular vacuums, but decided to purchase this steam vac based on the great reviews and because I needed something that could really deep clean my carpets. I am so glad I listened to the reviews of others because this vacuum has been great. There was a little bit of assembly required, which took me about 30 minutes to complete. I read through he manual prior to using and I haven't had any trouble. So far, the vacuum has taken care of any stains I had on my carpet. I feel like this vacuum has already paid for itself with one use when you take into account how much you would pay a professional. The only thing a bit weird is that it is called a "steam vac" but there isn't any steam, it cleans by heating your cleaning solution and scrubbing the carpet. If you need a vacuum to deep clean your carpets, don't hesitate to get this one!
