review/summary: Puts out buzzing noise when plugged inreview/text: I really liked the look and function of this alarm clock and found it easy to set up but when we went to go to sleep and turned everything else off we could hear that it emitted a steady low humming noise that we couldn't handle and we returned it the next day.
