review/summary: Great Value!review/text: For the price, this little guy is great! I appreciate how compact it is and that the crevice tool fits into its own compartment, but I do wish that the hose for the crevice tool was a bit longer. It's tricky to get between the couch cushions. I'm sure that more expensive vacuums might offer more versatility, but this is good value for the price point.Overall, I'm glad I got this as it is a great improvement over our last handheld vacuum. I would recommend it to others.
