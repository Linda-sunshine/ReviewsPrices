review/summary: Makes everything!review/text: I use this for cucumbers, carrots and beets for salads. I do long "noodles" with zucchini. I just started doing some tricks where you put notches in different places of the vegetable and it chops it as you shred. Very easy to use, very easy to clean and has a guard so I don't hurt myself (most important!).
