review/summary: open boxreview/text: So while I am confident the item inside the box is new, the box has been opened and it is unsettling. Not the most well built unit, clearly a low end cleaner. Getting it for $90 during the black Friday retailer greed time makes the low quality tolerable. I have very low expectation of any real life expectancy from this unit, but at the price I won&#8217;t be too upset.
