review/summary: Amazon has a winner in Pinzon Signature flannel sheets!review/text: I looked at several different sites before choosing these Pinzon Signature 190-gram flannel sheets and decided that if the quality was there that the price was reasonable. I was not disappointed. Our temperatures at night have been mostly in the 20's and these sheets do a good job of helping keep you warm...they're really cozy! We have a deep mattress and the bottom sheet was very generous in its' fit. Yes, there's quite a bit of lint when dried...I cleaned the lint trap twice while drying after the first washing, but that's what flannel sheets do! I have older sets that still shed lint. All in all, I would say that these Pinzon Signature sheets are a winner!
