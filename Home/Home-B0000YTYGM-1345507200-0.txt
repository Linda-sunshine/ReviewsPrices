review/summary: Nice Coffeemaker.....While It Workedreview/text: I also ignored the negative reviews for this coffeemaker. I love the convenience of having coffee brew into a thermal carafe, keeping it hot. This coffeemaker did that, but after about 9 months I noticed the coffee wasn't quite as hot as it was at first, and then a few months ago, after having this appliance for approximately a year, it simply stopped working, just like that. In reading all the reviews on all coffeemakers I'm back at the beginning, it seems no company makes a decent 12 cup thermal coffeemaker.....and I really don't want less than 12 cups and would gladly buy a 14 or 16 cup coffeemaker, but don't see anything like that on the market. Will continue to research and hunt for a new coffeemaker....
