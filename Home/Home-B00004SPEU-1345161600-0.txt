review/summary: Two thumbs upreview/text: I actually sent this Krups to a friend. He sends me some fine Guatemalan coffee so I'd return the favor. My Krups came from the Thrift store 4 or 5 years ago and is still going strong after being bought used. We had talked about grinders and I told him to get the Krups but he didn't and was disappointed. Now he is among the legion of fans of this fine tool. lol
