review/summary: Even makes supermarket coffee taste fantastic.review/text: Bought as a gift for my sister-in-law and given to her in Florida at Christmas. Tried it out with coffee purchased at the supermarket, with unknown roasted date and the coffee/'press' came out amazing. Definitely worth every penny.
