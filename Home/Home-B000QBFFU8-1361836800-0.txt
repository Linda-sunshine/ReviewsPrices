review/summary: Fantastic Juicing Machine!review/text: My husband and I were looking for a juicer that could extract most if not all of the liquid and one that was easy to clean. The Breville provides both of these features and more. We are most happy with the feature that allows you to select what type of fruit or vegetable you wish to juice such as soft fruits - course vegetables which allows the unit to self adjust the blade.This unit is a lot more quiet than we expected and since the unit takes minimal time to run depending on the amount of fruit or vegetables you are juicing, the unit is not on for very long. It also comes with a handy brush to safely clear the basket of any leftover pulp. All of the attachments fit nicely in the dishwasher as well. We use the pitcher that it comes with just to ensure we don't overflow our glasses and make a huge mess.I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to find a top of the line juicer.
