review/summary: no quality controlreview/text: The coffee maker would not be bad IF they bothered to match the seams up properly for the reusable filter. This causes coffee ground to get EVERYWHERE and plug up the machine. Additionally, a replacement for the filter is near impossible to find, unless I switch over to paper, which I can only get onlineI may as well just have bought a standard mr coffee pot for the price, and then just bought a reusable filter.Very unhappy with this purchase
