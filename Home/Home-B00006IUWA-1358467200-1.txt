review/summary: Should be a 5 star But Plastic Melts Way To Fastreview/text: I bought this popcorn popper based on reviews I read here on Amazon. On my first use it popped the corn great and I was very happy, until I saw the plastic was starting to melt on the top. It literally was starting to droop from melting. It was so hot I could not touch it for a few moments. So do not try and do two batches of popcorn back to back or you will not have a popcorn popper to pop a third batch. I still use this popper with the deformities and it does pop well. It would of gotten 5 Stars had it not melted.
