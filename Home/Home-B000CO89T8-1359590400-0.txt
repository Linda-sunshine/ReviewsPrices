review/summary: How did I live without it?review/text: Received this as a Christmas gift and I absolutely love it! It gets pretty hot, it lightly sizzles if you lick your finger and touch it. I don't think it will re-heat a cold cup of coffee but it does a FANTASTIC job of keeping the coffee pretty darn hot. It's one of those little inventions I didn't realize I needed until I have it and now I'm buying one for all my friends.
