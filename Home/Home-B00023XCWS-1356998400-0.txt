review/summary: Does what it's supposed to, minor flaws.review/text: PROS:Brings water to a boil in about five minutes. It seems to automatically shut off once the water is boiling. Small, easy to carry, does the job.CONS:The lid is a bit poorly designed and flimsy (if you tip the kettle too much when pouring, the water will pour out of two small gaps that are near the exit). I'm not sure if this is some glaring flaw, or if it's the result of the fact that I have not yet installed the filter that came with it. The plastic that the kettle is made of will conduct the heat, so the kettle itself will be very hot. Be sure to use the handle. I wish there was at least a small layer between the inner wall of the plastic and the water to reduce thermal conduction.Other users have complained about a plastic taste. I haven't noticed a taste, but that might be because I cleaned my kettle beforehand with vinegar and boiling water. Whenever you get plastic or metal containers that you will store liquid in, there almost always is going to be an initial taste. Don't be an idiot, clean it as you're supposed to.All in all, great kettle for the price.
