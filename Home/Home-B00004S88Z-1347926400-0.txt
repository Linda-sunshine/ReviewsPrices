review/summary: The Perfect Starter-Cannerreview/text: I was very tempted to buy the 41-quart (All American 941) version of this product, but decided to get this one instead. I'm glad I did. It's a terrific starter canner for someone like me who is just beginning to learn how to can my own foods.By far, the biggest reason to buy this product is that it doesn't require a gasket. Many pressure cookers require some sort of gasket. This one doesn't. Instead, the instructions ask you to rub a little dab of olive oil along the edge where the lid makes contact with the body. That's very doable. I love knowing I won't be searching for some gasket 5, 10, or even 20 years from now for this thing.Second, it holds 7 full sized quart canning jars. That's not a huge amount, but it's a decent number for any project. The product is obviously well made with no visible defects, sturdy, and solid. It's aluminum, so it's not terribly heavy, but you don't want to be lugging it around full of water and jars.The instruction book that comes with it is very informative. The pressure gague seems to be right on target. When I set the pressure via the weighted cylinder that sits on top of the valve, I get exactly 240 degrees F with 10 PSI. That's exactly what I'm looking for.I would recommend this as the best first canner for anyone wanting to get into canning their own food. I may upgrade and get the larger one (in addition to this one) later on, if my gardening harvests are larger, but for now, this is perfect. I would not recommend you use this to cook food though. I think a smaller all steel pressure cooker (it will require a gasket, alas), would be a better choice. I can recommend you visit the Miss Vickie web site for additional information on both cooking with a pressure cooker and canning (www missvickie com ).
