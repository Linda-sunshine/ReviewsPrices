review/summary: Worst wine openerreview/text: REALLY, avoid this one at any price. It might work once and a while, but its rare that it will open a bottle of wine, with any type of cork. Even if they sell this at the .99 store, avoid it or expect it to work one time....maybe. Going to try and return it and get something worth while and that can open a bottle of wine.
