review/summary: Best daily use coffeemakerreview/text: This is our second DCC-1200. Our first one lasted about 8 years without any problems at all. We make coffee 4-7 times a day. I especially like that you can make a great tasting single serving cup of coffee. Many coffeemakers can't do that. This is a basic, no frills coffeemaker that is easy to use.
