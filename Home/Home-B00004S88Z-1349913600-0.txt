review/summary: Played price, lost sale.review/text: All American 921 21-1/2-Quart Pressure Cooker/Canner looks like a very well built item and has had good reviews. Not a whole lot about it outside of some minimal info by the same companies on the net. Other products are out there and I will keep looking. The All American 921 21-1/2-Quart Pressure Cooker/Canner is VERY expensive item were you to purchase it at the Manufacturers suggested price, which almost no one does. However, Amazon has been up to their old tricks and this time it has cost them a sale. I saved this for several days while I research additional items to go with the All American 921 21-1/2-Quart Pressure Cooker/Canner and they jacked the price up another $30.00. Forget it. Even with the 'free'shipping, you are now more expensive than other supplier. I like Amazon, I have purchased several thousands of dollars from them, but they lost on this one by playing games. Sorry.
