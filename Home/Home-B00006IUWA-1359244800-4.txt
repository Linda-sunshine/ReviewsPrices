review/summary: Makes delicious popcornreview/text: This air popper works so well. It pops almost all of the kernels perfectly. There are always a few left in the bottom, but less than when you use microwave popcorn. I love how easy it is to make a healthy snack. Just pour the amount of kernels you want into the air popper and plug it in. The built-in measuring cup on top is very handy. My only complaint is that it's sometimes hard to clean out all the little pieces left at the bottom. Usually just turning it upside down over the trash can works, but I like to make sure everything is out before I put it away.This is a really good product for the price. I use mine quite a bit, so it was totally worth it.
