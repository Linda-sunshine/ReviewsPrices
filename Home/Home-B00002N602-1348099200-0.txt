review/summary: Quick and healthy cookingreview/text: I LOVE my Presto pressure cooker. This is a replacement of one that my mother gave me which I am sure was many years old. She also gave me old pressure cooker recipe books and I found that the cooking time is a little different with the new pressure cooker (both are Presto 6-quart cookers). A black bean dish that cooked for 35 minutes in the old cooker only takes 25 minutes and a little more liquid in the new one. I learned by trial and error to find the right adjustments to make.
