review/summary: Great Popcorn Popperreview/text: This was everything the reviews said it was. Pops perfectly and quickly, easy clean up, great tasting popcorn. I loved mine so much, I bought another for my parents. I am not rough on mine, but do see the gears are plastic, so I'm careful with it but I'm realistic that it may not last forever. Rest assured, I'll be buying another if it does. Had I known about this popcorn maker before, I would have bought it years ago! My parents had an air popper years ago but this trumps that gadget hands down. The only downside I see at the present time is that I eat twice as much popcorn now!
