review/summary: I love this breadmaker!review/text: I bought this a year ago, so I could stop making all my bread dough by hand. This little machine makes dough incredibly well! I only baked the bread in it once. I wasn't thrilled with the results. The bread loaf was oddly shaped and a bit tough. I prefer to make the dough in the machine and then transfer it to bread pans for baking.
