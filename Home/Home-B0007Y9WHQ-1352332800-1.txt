review/summary: Such a versatile appliance!review/text: My husband is gluten-free, and I'm always trying to find a way to make "noodles" out of veggies. This machine makes short work of it, and I find I'm eating more veggies simply because it's fun to prepare them. My kids enjoy it, and it makes dinnertime prep and easy and fast.
