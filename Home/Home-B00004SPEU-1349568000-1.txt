review/summary: Priced appropriatelyreview/text: Not sure what I was expecting buying a ~$20 coffee grinder, but I can say it was priced appropriately. It does it job, albeit not that well. It's excessively loud, and lacks the ability to choose the "fineness" of grind.OF course what do you expect to $20. If I was to do it all over, I wouldnt have been so niggardly and purchased a better product!
