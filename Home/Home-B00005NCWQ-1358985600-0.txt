review/summary: Pretty good for campingreview/text: I bought this to use on a propane camp stove while traveling. It is fairly well made - durable, etc... Unfortunately, the spring on the tube that holds the basket for the coffee got lost before long. However, the pot seems to perk coffee okay without it. It's much better quality than most other metal coffee pots that I've seen around, especially for the price.
