review/summary: A Beauty Of A Workhorse!review/text: I have a 30-year old tilt stand mixer by Kitchenaid that still works fine but it started to leak oil at the top of the housing. I chose the 6-quart as a replacement and it works wonderfully. And the &#34;Espresso&#34; color looks sharp in my kitchen.I mostly use it to make bread and pizza dough and found it to knead the dough in no time at all. The attachments on this unit do not have the round balance wheels at the top like the smaller mixers and that's handy for adding ingredients while the mixer is running. Anyone who owns the smaller units knows that those wheels get in the way and splash the added ingredients all over.The flip lid on the front for attaching accessories is permanently affixed - which is great. Because in my case the old mixer had a removable cap that could easily get lost.Hmm, I think I'l go make some banana bread.
