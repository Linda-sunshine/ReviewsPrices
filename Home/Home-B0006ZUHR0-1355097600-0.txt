review/summary: Excellent choice for the moneyreview/text: This iron replaced a leaking Rowenta that was more than twice the price. I was a bit hesitant ordering another iron online due to their frailty with being dropped. But time was of the essence, and Amazon Prime was going to deliver a lot sooner than when I could find the time to shop all over town to find the store that carried it. The biggest asset in this iron's favor is that it does not leak! I do miss the ultra smooth sole plate and 400 steam vents of the Rowenta, but I do not miss the leaking. The Black and Decker heats up with amazing speed. It has separate temperature controls for steam, a feature I have seen on a very expensive still made in Europe iron. The only frustrating feature is that the iron will time out and shut down will one is using it. All it takes is a touch of the thermostat button to keep the iron on. But some of us do need to do pressing for periods of time longer than 10-15 minutes! I am happy with this choice...it has handled my delicate silk tulles with no problem. It is a surprisingly good iron, much better than other irons in this price point. If it had more steam vents and a bit more umpf to its steam, then I would have rated it 5 stars. But all in all, I am just really glad it does not leak.
