review/summary: right on time!review/text: It's a clock. It tells time. And boy does it tell time well, and though I haven't timed the timing of the time it's telling, it certainly feels like it's telling time well. It also wakes me up with a noise, or, as some say, an "alarm," which is simultaneously consistently shockingly jarring and exactly what I hoped it would do. It has the ability to wake me up at two different times during the a 24 hour span but since I only go to bed once per day, living by the motto that I'll sleep when I'm dead, I haven't utilized nor to I plan to utilize this fine functionality.
