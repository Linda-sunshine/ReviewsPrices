review/summary: So usefulreview/text: Handy dandy little tool. I make smoothies with it, and it handles ice, frozen berries, etc... like a charm. I've used the chopper attachment to make hummus, and it handles well. Haven't run into any issues yet, but we'll see over time. I'm curious to see how long the plastic gear that everyone has issues with will hold up.
