review/summary: Lasted 5 months, was told to just buy a new onereview/text: This Smartstick blender worked great for 5 months, then it stopped working. Since it was under warranty I called Cuisinart. I was told that I would have to pay to have it shipped to them, and then pay $10 for the shipping of the new hand blender to me. I asked why if it had only been 5 months why I should I pay anything. I was told that since it is a low cost item it is cost prohibitive to charge the shipping both ways. If it was a $500 item they would pay the shipping. The shipping would be the same cost as buying a brand new one. Thanks but no thanks.tl;dr Don't buy this, Cuisinart considers them disposable.
