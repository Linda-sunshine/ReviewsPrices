review/summary: Works fine but has minor leaksreview/text: This Kettle heats water pretty quickly although it's a little noisy. Well, I took the noise as a reminder that a pot of water was heating up, so it was fine with me. But after four weeks, there was white mineral deposit and rust accumulated at the bottom rim of the outer shining metal body. Obviously the seal isn't good and water leaks.
