review/summary: Stop feeding the landfills :)review/text: I have gotten very used to Brita filtered water, and now take an aluminum drinking bottle to work with me each day filled with it. Beyond having to dump the first few pitches (with black flakes of the carbon in it), I like having a fresh filter.
