review/summary: Too much work!review/text: There was the occasional pot of very good, very hot coffee. That kept me trying for a long time. But there were more bad pots than good. I really tried to time it carefully and follow the directions exactly and frankly was baffled that the outcomes were not consistent. Eventually I decided it was too iffy and too much work, particularly when caffeine-deprived at the crack of dawn. Back to my aero-press.
