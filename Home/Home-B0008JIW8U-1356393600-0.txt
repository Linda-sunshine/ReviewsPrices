review/summary: WORKS GOODreview/text: Like coffee maker, makes good coffee. The only problem I find is the first cup taste good, but by the time I go for another it taste burnt. I guess that this is a problem with all hot plate coffee makers. I just remove the pot and set it asside and reheat in the microwave and that works fine.
