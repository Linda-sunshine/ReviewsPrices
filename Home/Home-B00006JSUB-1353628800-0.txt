review/summary: My first Cast Ironreview/text: Overall this has been good. I did find I needed to oil it several more times and things still stick if I don't add oil. Maybe this will change over time. Also, I admittedly am not terribly fond of cooking so perhaps it's just my lack of knowledge, the measurement is of the top, not the bottom. I measured my burner (glass top) and it was 6 inches so this seemed like a good fit. But the top diameter is 6.5&#34; and the bottom is smaller than 6&#34;. It's way too small to cook anything besides an egg or two. I plan to get a larger pan so I guess I'm happy enough with the quality to buy this brand again.
