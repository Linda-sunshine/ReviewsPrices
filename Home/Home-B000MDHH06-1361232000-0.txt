review/summary: Well pleasedreview/text: This is a reliable, relatively small, and well-designed fruit and vegetable juicer. The machine does a fantastic job of extracting liquids from fruits and vegetables. Another important factor which influences my rating is the ease of clean-up. The juicer comes apart with no trouble at all and the parts are easy to clean. You definitely need to use the service brush included with the product to clean the blade/screen of the smallest particles, but you do not need to purchase any additional equipment in order to maintain the machine.
