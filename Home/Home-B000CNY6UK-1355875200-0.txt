review/summary: Thank heavenreview/text: As a lactose intolerant person it's impossible to have a latte or cappucino on the outside. I sit there, tongue hanging out, watching everybody savoring and enjoying their coffees, but alas, not little me. So, when my brother and sister-in-law offered me an espresso/cappuccino maker I jumped at the chance until realizing that there was absolutely not one inch left on the counter or in any cabinet and sadly, had to decline. But it got me to thinking that there had to be something within my budget and was space friendly. When I saw this little Bialetti I knew I had to have it - small and NON-ELECTRIC. I used it yesterday for the first time along with my new stainless steel milk frother and boy oh boy - it was heavenly. Since I drink only lactose free milk there was a concern initially it wouldn't froth but it did - like crazy. It's easy to use, takes up no space to speak of and makes two medium sized coffee. I do have to say that what makes cappuccino so wonderful to me (and I suppose everyone else) is the frothed milk. I know this will sound like heresy to you purists, but honestly, you could use a regular coffee pot and just add the frothed milk. However, having said that, I think this little pot makes the experience so much richer - special really. I don't expect to make cappuccino on a daily basis, so each time we use it, it will still be special. There was only one thing I didn't like when we opened the box. There was something oily around the part that screws on. I assume it was there for a reason (or maybe not) and that rather turned my stomach, but a quick rinse and wipe took care of it. Recommended.
