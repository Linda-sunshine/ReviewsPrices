review/summary: Does the job great and looks beautifulreview/text: I bought this set after doing some research which stated that stainless steel is a safe, non reactive material with food. I didnt like teflon as it wears off and that it might cook into your food or aluminum as it warps easy and possibly causes Alzheimers when you cook with it. The hard part about cooking with stainless steel (after using non stick pans) is that you have to be a little more patient when cooking. I learned that cooking with stainless you have to basically burn the oil (till its brown) then put your food on. When you do that, the stainless steel becomes basically better than teflon and nothing sticks including eggs. I had the stainless pans for about a year and they still look brand new. I use Bars Keepers Friend to clean and polish the stainless when they get dirty. It brings them back to a brand new like finish as if i never used them. Pans are solid, scratch resistant, they dont warp, or fade. They heat up very evenly and will definitely last a lifetime. They're definitely are All Clad quality but at half the price! But make sure its the multiclad pro from cusinart.
