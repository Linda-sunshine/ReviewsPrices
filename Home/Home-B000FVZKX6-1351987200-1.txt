review/summary: Awesome sheets!review/text: I definitely made a great purchase with these sheets! They are extremely breathable and super soft. My husband loves them as well, and he is usually not a fan of flannel sheets since they make him too hot. No problem with washing them and they fit on my California bed perfectly.
