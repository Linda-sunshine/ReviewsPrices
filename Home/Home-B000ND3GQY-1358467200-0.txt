review/summary: Stainless steel makes a maintenance free wok.review/text: Great hype about cast iron with heat distribution, &#34;wok flavor&#34; etc etc...while that may be true, breaking in and maintaining one to make it rust free is a science, a chore, a zen discipline and down right pain in the rear. This SS version has none of that &#34;wok flavor&#34; stuff, but no &#34;seasoning&#34; for break in necessary, and cleaning is quick and easy. &#34;Seasoning&#34; is the process of scrubbing off the motor oil, burning the metal, oiling, and cooking with oily stuff at various temperature for the FIRST TIME with a cast iron wok. Maintenance free, rust free, cooks well even without the &#34;wok flavor&#34; is a great trade off for my not so authentic Chinese taste.
