review/summary: What you see is what you getreview/text: This bed is very well made. It inflates and deflates quite fast. I was concerned that all the air would not deflate for storage however it deflated perfectly with no air remaining and it could be folded up and stored very fast and efficient. This is the first inflatable bed I have bought and my wife and I are very happy with it
