review/summary: On/Off Switchreview/text: I just recently purchased this thermometer to replace my old one that broke. It works great and I love it. After reading many reviews alot of people said their was no on/off switch. Their is an on/off switch on mine. It's located on the back of unit above the battery compartment.
