review/summary: Great filters make great tasting waterreview/text: These filters work great and make my water taste so much better. Since they are made by Brita, it's not surprising that they work perfectly with my Brita filters. I usually refill the pitcher 1-2 times a day and have found that these filters last 3-4 months before the water starts tasting a little funky. With four filters in a pack, that is a years worth of clean, good tasting water for $18!
