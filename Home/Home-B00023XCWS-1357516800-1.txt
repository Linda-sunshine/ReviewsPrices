review/summary: A decent kettle -- does the jobreview/text: In many ways, this is a great little kettle. It heats quickly, and the dual water levels are easy to read. I'm not bothered by the exposed heating element; that likely poses little danger (especially with the auto-off feature). Only after purchasing it did I wonder whether it was wise to use a plastic kettle for everyday use. (It's probably fine; it's just my personal feeling.) So I keep it in my office and use it from time to time, but it's not my main kettle right now (the kettle proper of my main unit is made of glass).
