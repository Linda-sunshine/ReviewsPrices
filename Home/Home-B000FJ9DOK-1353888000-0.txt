review/summary: Great insulationreview/text: This isn't the first Thermos Nissan product I've enjoyed. The double walled vacuum is flawless. I keep this one in the freezer and fill it with a few cubes and water when I'm going to need a cool drink available at meetings and drives - and I stays icy cold all day.
