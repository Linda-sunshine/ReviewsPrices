review/summary: Best so farreview/text: I have purchased several weather radios, and this is the best one so far when it comes to function and price. There are at least two challenges 1) the LEDs are dim and do not flash--bright flashing LEDs are attention getting features available on other radios, and 2) the instructions are difficult, but not impossible to follow. Some of the instructions are counter intuitive and some steps might be missing.
