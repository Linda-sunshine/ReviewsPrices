review/summary: Amazing I am in Love!review/text: I purchased this after my Mirror Pressure canner exploded in my kitchen on the 4th of July. Let me say that it was a quite an explosion. I was very hesitant to ever can again after my horror experince. However, just last night I used my WONDERFUL All American cooker for a second time and was again so pleased.It takes any guess work out of canning. Follow directions and watch your gauges and your on your way to successful canning! I would highly recommend this canner to any experinced or begginers! The first time I filled the canner to capacity with 16 pints and all came out perfectly sealed with fresh green beans!I would buy this ten times over again, but it is built so sturdy I think I will be able to pass it on to my childern! Amen!
