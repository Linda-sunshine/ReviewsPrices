review/summary: Efficient, machine for beginners or advanced bread makers.review/text: As a seller ofOrganic French Sourdough StarterI know about making bread at home. A friend recommended this to me because of its ability to make sourdough bread in it. This machine makes baking bread a snap even for busy on the go professionals that aren't home all day to check on bread. This machine has many options including a timer that allows for up to 13 hours. Most sourdough bread recipes call for a longer rise time and this machine accommodates this perfectly.This machine also makes three different size loafs as well as different settings for different types of bread including French bread. Sometimes I want to make a larger loaf, for entertaining and demos and this machine, with its ability to make different size loaves, gives me the flexibility I need.
