review/summary: 5+ years and still brewing great coffeereview/text: I have owned a Brew and Go for at least five years and have brewed at least two mugs of coffee in it every day. It is still doing a great job. The perma filter did get a hole in it a few years back. For awhile I was using the #2 cone filters, but one day my local grocery store was out of #2's. I bought the small basket filters instead (much cheaper) and just fold in the excess to make it fit in the basket. Works great! I use the mug that comes with it to measure my water and brew into, then pour from that mug into whatever mug I am using that day. I like my coffee bold, so I use 3 tablespoons of ground coffee and I have not had a problem with grinds in my cup, unless I spill some between the filter and the basket. By using the mug to measure the water, I have not had any problems with overflow.
