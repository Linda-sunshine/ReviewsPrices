review/summary: Same-sized cookies!review/text: The cookie scoop arrived as promised. I was surprised that it is so substantial. It was easy-to-use (spring grip worked smoothly and dough released well), reduced the cleanup (scooping cookies is far less messy than hand-rolling), tolerated the dishwasher, and resulted in uniform cookies. It is all good!
