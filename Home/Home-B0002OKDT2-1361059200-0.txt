review/summary: Don't waste money on a cheaper juicer.review/text: One of these single-auger type Omega's are really the best juicers. It is an amazing machine with the most intelligent design I can imagine. Incredibly easy to clean (this is a huge deal since it WILL dictate how much you use it). Much quieter than the vertical juicers and produces much more juice - get every drip out of your produce.My first juicer was some no-name $70 vertical fountain and I used it once before I took it back because I knew I would never use it again; cleaning it took 30 minutes and I wasn't able to get it all nicely.Cleaning this juicer takes about 2 minutes of running the parts under the faucet and it's ready to dry and go again. Comes with a strainer and a large &#34;toothbrush&#34; for even easier cleaning.Honestly, if you're even considering this juicer, do yourself a favor and get it. You will use it every day.I pair my juice with a tsp of Spirulina powder for an incredible nutrient punch in the face.
