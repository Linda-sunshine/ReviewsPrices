review/summary: I can't believe it's this badreview/text: I purchased this coffee maker with great expectations knowing Bunn is a well known coffee machine maker. The primary problem is the carafe. The carafe spills and drips everywhere, even when using the utmost of care. I am very disappointed and who designs this crap without trying it.
