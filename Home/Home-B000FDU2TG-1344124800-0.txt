review/summary: BLENDER CARAFE LEAKSreview/text: thought i was making a good informed purchase based on the reviews. however, after using blender for about a year the blade mechanism on the bottom became loose and leaks blender juices everywhere. what good is a product if it only lasts as long as the warranty? will not buy kitchen aid products anymore.
