review/summary: Two years in and still going strong!review/text: I purchased this vacuum in Feb. of 2010 and as of January 2012 I am still amazed at how well this product has held up. Other than changing the bag a few dozen times and two short sessions of cleaning up the brush, this thing has been flawless. You can spend a lot more on a vacuum but I don't know why you would.
