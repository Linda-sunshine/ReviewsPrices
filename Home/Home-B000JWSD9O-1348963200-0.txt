review/summary: DO NOT FALL FOR THE 5 STAR REVIEWS!!!review/text: I used to work for a store that sold basic to luxury bedding. THIS is a clear example of one can be mislead by all the great reviews. I have a couple sets of Sateen sheets. Specifically polyester sateen sheets. I'm not exaggerating when I say they are amazingly silky smooth and soft. I've been having difficulty finding similar sheets as the store from which I originally purchased my sheets no longer sells sateen sheets.So, after a search on amazon, I found these sheets with so many five star reviews, I thought "well this MUST be a good product". I was wrong. Now for more perspective, I'm not the only one that's commented on the great quality of my sateen sheets. Everyone that feels my sheets comments about the smoothness and softness. When I opened the package for these "Elite", "collection" sheets, I was shocked at how rough and cheap the sheet felt. Let me put it to you this way, I've been to cheap motels that have better sheets than these. I would feel bad having a guest sleep on these sheets, much less myself. Again, I'm not exaggerating. These sheets are poor quality. I truly feel like I was ripped off.My sateen sheets were purchased for just under $50.00. This product I'm reviewing costs twice as much after shipping. I'm still at a loss as to how so many great reviews have been placed on such a poor quality product. It just goes to show that you can't rely on customer reviews. Better to search for professional opinions on a product, THEN search for it on amazon if you wish, or elsewhere.
