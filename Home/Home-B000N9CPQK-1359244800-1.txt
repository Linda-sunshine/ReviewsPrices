review/summary: Clean Air!review/text: My father has advanced COPD, and while he was still smoking in a small apartment, this little machine took out most of the smoke so that I could at least stand to walk into his home. Now he has quit smoking, and still lets this machine run to continue to rid the smell of smoke and also ionize the air. I think it improves mood of everyone that enters! Love it!!
