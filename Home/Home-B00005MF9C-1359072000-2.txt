review/summary: Ideal Solutionreview/text: My son needed a single serving coffee maker in his room. We tried a more expensive one, but it was unsatisfactory and had to be returned. Even though this one is very inexpensive (less than $15) it is perfect for this application. Another outstanding feature is that the coffee it brews is very hot and not tepid like the previous one.
