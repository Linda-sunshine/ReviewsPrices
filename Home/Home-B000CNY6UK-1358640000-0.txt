review/summary: Differentreview/text: The instructions that came with this weren't clear enough and I had to experiment to get this to work. The device is quite small, only about 4 inches in diameter at the bottom, so it doesn't fit well with my glass-top stove and I feel as if I'm wasting heat when I use it. I have not used this too many times and I'm still trying to get the right grind and amount to use. It does make very strong coffee fairly quickly, and that's what it's designed to do, but I have yet to really enjoy a cup.
