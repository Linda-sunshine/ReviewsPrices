review/summary: This chair has grown on me.review/text: I had shoulder pain and was looking for a chair that I could adjust the heck out of but was also cheap. This chair seemed like a good compromise. And while it was not quite what I was expecting it has turned out great and I am very happy with it. I have had this chair a year now and it has proven extremely durable, with no diminished function and no visible wear. I quickly got used to the wobbly armrests; I thought they weren't going to be durable or stable because of the wobble but time has definitely proven otherwise; they remain just as the day I installed them and they are actually reasonably strong. The wobble in the armrests is the only thing preventing me from giving five stars. The mesh back is very comfortable.I guess I should also mention it takes up a bit more room than I would have thought, but that hasn't been a problem for me.I only used the adjustments for the first couple of weeks but I am very glad they are there. My shoulder pain has gotten dramatically better and indeed is almost gone. I am not saying this chair is the reason my shoulder pain got better, but I can say it has certainly done no harm. (You're experience might be different of course).
