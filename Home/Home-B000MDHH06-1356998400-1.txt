review/summary: Really Enjoy!review/text: This is the first juicer I have purchased and I really enjoy it. I will say it is a little loud once you start putting certain foods in such as carrots and apples for it to juice. The one drawback that is that it doesn't have a separate bin that it separates the pulp in where you can add a plastic bag to make an easy clean-up. Which isn't a huge deal but you will want to make sure you clean the machine right after using it so that you get all of the food bits out before they dry. Other than that I have never had a problem with food flying out at me or with bits of food in my juice. Just make sure that you are entering the foods slowly.
