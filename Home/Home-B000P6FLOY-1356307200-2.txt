review/summary: Garbage, broke after using it a second time!review/text: I bought this in July and used it twice since, first time it was off by 15 degrees but after testing it seemed consistant so I kept it. X-mas eve (today) I stuck it in a 17 pound rib roast and 20mins later its beeping with a temp error, now I need to cook this $100 roast without a thermometer. I did see in the instructions that this was a one use item, if I had known I wouldn't have bought it.
