review/summary: Very dissapointedreview/text: After using the Krups Bravo type 871 for ten years we decided to get a new espresso machine for a change. We order the De'Longhi EC155 because of the great reviews it had at Amazon. We made a BIG mistake. After two days of using it we're going back to our old Krups machine. The De'Longhi does not make espresso. It's lazy, the parts don't fit right and the coffee is extremely mild for my taste.
