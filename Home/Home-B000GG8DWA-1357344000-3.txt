review/summary: Why Not Just Buy A Hot Plate?review/text: My mother has an infrared quartz heater, although made by a different manufacturer. But I liked the heat output technology so much that I decided to buy the same &#34;type&#34; of heater for myself... well, I guess it would be more accurate to say that I truly purchased the heater for my two dogs. They are chihuahuas, and, whereas I am &#34;hot-natured&#34; - I like to sleep with my windows up even in the dead of winter - my poor darlings are forced to shiver through the night because they are &#34;cold-natured.&#34;So, considering them, this heater seemed to be right on target because of its low profile - it would give them heat directly when they were dozing in front of it, without wasting heat by being one of those tower-type heaters that far exceed their height.Now, because this is a heater for dogs, I wasn't looking to have the best quality - as long as it did the job and made them happy, I would be happy. But this is just about the cheapest, poorly built heater I have ever seen!When you take it out of the box it seriously feels like a toy - there is nothing solid about the construction, just plastic! I think maybe even the screws are plastic!And the heat... well, I guess I now know that, even when buying the infrared quartz type of heater, there should still be some type of forced air system that will allow it to &#34;radiate&#34; more than several inches from the heating surface. My poor dogs were practically sitting INSIDE of the heater trying to get some of the warmth.And hence the title of this review: having this heater was just about as helpful as putting a hot plate in the middle of my room.So back it goes... and, as I learn what things are acceptable to buy online versus those that are better to be bought in person, I will be on my way to Lowe's. 'Tis easier to return this sort of thing at a box store than to a virtual one.
