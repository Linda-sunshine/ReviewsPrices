review/summary: Excited and Dissapointed all at once!review/text: I didnt realize its just for coffee...I was looking for a GRAIN MILL!! But Its ok...I used it on a bag of Garbanzo Beans it took 3 days to mill and it does not go to a fine powder but I'm keeping it because I may use it for coffe one day when I remember to buy beans instead of ground coffee!it shipped incredibly fast too! I would definately buy from this seller again, but next time I'll be sure to ask questions and not assume anything!
