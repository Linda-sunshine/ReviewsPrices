review/summary: Stick to the Originalreview/text: I had this slider when it was first sold on TV. Had the first one for 12years, until the blade finally start to get blunt. I bought different slicer, which I hated. Its' blade didn't slice soft tomato, and juiced onions instead of mincing. So, I bought the Swissmar's, and very happy with it. The design is slightly different than the first one, but it still works the best.
