review/summary: The invisible cordreview/text: There are already excellent descriptions of the pluses and minuses of this item in other reviews, but I didn't see mention of the fact that this is a corded appliance - something you'd never guess from the photos in which the cord has magically disappeared. Mine was delivered without a manual. It's available online, but I didn't pay for the item so I could then use my printer to print a 25 page manual. And it makes one wonder if I was sent a returned item by Amazon.
