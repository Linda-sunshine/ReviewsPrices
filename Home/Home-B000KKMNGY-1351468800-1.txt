review/summary: A Great Space Saverreview/text: Living in an apartment I don't have much room in my kitchen (that's an understatement), so I started to organize. I got this for my foil, bags, clear wrap, etc. It is perfect as I have a very tall shelf, so this under shelf wrap rack takes advantage of previously unused space. I used some other organizing containers (can I say Tupperware) for most of the rest of my pantry stuff, and built my own magnetic spice rack. If you are looking for magnetic spice tins, the best I have found are from the container store as they have the clear tops and you can sprinkle or pour without taking the top off while most others require you to remove the top to get anything out.Things are looking good now.
