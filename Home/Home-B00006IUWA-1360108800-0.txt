review/summary: No Burnt Kernels!review/text: I LOVE popcorn. I probably eat it 2-3 times a week. I used to always use microwave but when we bought our house the new microwave sucked. It would only pop half the bag then start burning. I then started using my flat-bottomed wok with my silicone splatter shield. This actually worked wonderfully but constantly cleaning it plus the wear to the bottom made me rethink.After reading reviews we settled on this one. We love it! It was super quick, little mess and fun to watch. Our only thing is we are not on diets so I microwaved butter to drizzle on. It tastes so light especially since we are used to popcorn popped in oil.Also, it clearly states in instructions that it will NOT melt refrigerated butter, only room temp/softened. I'm fine with that as it saves cleaning the machine more than necessary.
