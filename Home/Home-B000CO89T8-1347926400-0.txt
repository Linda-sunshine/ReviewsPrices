review/summary: Minimal heat and not much longevityreview/text: First of all, the heat was not very impressive on this thing. Secondly, I received this item on December 20, 2011; it is now September 19, 2012, and it has already stopped working (Just shy of 9 months). I last used it 24 hours ago, and I just went to use it again, but there is nothing; no light, no heat, it's just dead. I may have only paid $8 for this, but I am not happy that I have to now order another one so soon. I will definitely be looking into another brand or model, because I don't want this to happen again.
