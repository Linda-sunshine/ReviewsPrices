review/summary: Completely worth it.review/text: This is an excellent item to have if you do a lot baking, nothing sticks to them and clean up is a breeze. I purchased 6 of them to use with my 6 new cookies sheets and it has made our holiday baking so much easier. Plus you'll save money in the long run since you won't have to keep buying parchment paper or non-stick foil.
