review/summary: I can't figure out how to turn this on there is no plug on to it?review/text: My stove broke last month and I keep having to eat pizza delivery and microwave meals and I got sick of it so I order this dutch oven on AMOZAN.COM so I can at least cook some little hot meals in it but I got it from the mail today and just open it there are not any plugs or buttons or spot for a battery. I feel like I am missing something obvious about how to turn this oven on so it heat up but I canno't figure it out no matter how many time I try. Can someone please tell me what am I supposed to do I spent all my money$ on this and I felt like a giant butthole because I can't make it turn on? :(
