review/summary: I love it!review/text: I put it under the desk, near my feet, on low (400) setting. I stay toasty all day, totally silent. If I set it to 800, I have to move back from it because it is too hot. My keyboard cord gets too hot as well. I have had it for a few months now with no problem. (I hope I didn't jinx it!)
