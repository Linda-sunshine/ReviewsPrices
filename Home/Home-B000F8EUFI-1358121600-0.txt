review/summary: Perfect for what I neededreview/text: I live in a small apartment with my boyfriend, and this vacuum worked perfectly. It comes with 2 nozzle attachment things (one fat, one skinny) and also an adapter brush-end, and was pre-assembled and ready to go. It actually sucked up way more dirt than I expected, and I had to empty the cartridge after 1 use--which can be annoying for some, but I thought of it as a success. It was easy to clean out, and small so it can be stored anywhere.There's no thingamajig that adjusts the height of the nose to different carpet heights, so it ran a little harder on my shag rug. Not a big deal for me, but if you have kids or plan on sucking up mountains of cheerios then you may want something more heavy-duty. It's loud, it IS a vacuum after all, but it wasn't as loud as I expected after reading other reviews.Overall, I'm super happy about it.
