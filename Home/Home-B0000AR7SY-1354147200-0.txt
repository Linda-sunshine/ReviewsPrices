review/summary: Love This Grinder !!review/text: We drink a lot of coffee at our house. After owning several types (blade and burr) and brands (Mr. Coffee, Krups) of grinders, I thought I should report that the Capresso Infinity is the best one we've owned.. Period. I've seen some reviews, complaining about the difficult clean-up, and mess that this grinder creates. Compared to previous burr grinders I've owned, this thing is a dream. A simple tap on the ground coffee reservoir is all that's required to keep it completely empty, and looking like new. It's quiet, simple to operate, and it does a great job of grinding consistent, perfect coffee, every time.With regard to cleaning, it couldn't be easier. Turn the (empty) bean reservoir to the "Release" position, and lift it off. The burr lifts straight off the grinding chamber, giving access to the areas to be cleaned. A small brush is supplied with the unit. After cleaning, simply drop the burr in place, put the bean hopper on, and you're ready to go. My previous grinder had ground coffee everywhere in the burr chamber. It was cumbersome to disassemble, and equally frustrating to put together when cleaning was finished. The Capresso is a treat to clean, compared to the others.You can buy a blade grinder for $25 bucks. For some coffee drinkers, that's all you need. I occasionally brew coffee in a French press, and do most of my brewing in a (Bunn) automatic drip coffee maker. The Capresso does a nice job of grinding coffee for all brewing applications. It does take up some counter space, compared to a small blade grinder. The timer knob isn't high tech, reminding me of my Grandmother's egg timer that would "ding" when the time had expired. If you like flashing LED's and high tech, this may not be the grinder for you. If you love good coffee, and simplicity, look no further.
