review/summary: A great replacementreview/text: I don't iron, but I am responsible for replacing anything that gives out. We had a shark before this which worked fine until the sprayer button got hard to push. So far, the vice president of ironing is very, very happy with the model--gets nice and hot, moves smoothly over the clothes and the steam function is great. If she is happy, I am happy.
