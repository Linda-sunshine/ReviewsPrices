review/summary: Excellent Skillet / Fry Panreview/text: Great size, fairly lightweight, super easy to clean, heats uniformly, although it is 12.5&#34; all of my other lids fit properly. I have been a fan of T-Fal for years because of the durability and decent pricing of their cookware. This was a great replacement for another Wear-ever skillet.
