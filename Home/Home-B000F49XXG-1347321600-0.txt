review/summary: Great espresso!review/text: I received my De'Longhi EC155 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker about 2 months ago and I think it was a great purchase. It saves me money every time I make a coffee it because now I don't go out and spend $3-5 every time I want a fancy latte or espresso. I'm not a coffee/espresso snob/expert by any means, but I really enjoy the espresso this machine makes. It was a bit confusing to put together at first, but once it is together it is really easy to use.The only things I would change about it would be to make a higher clearance from where the espresso drips out to the platform as it is a very small clearance (I guess it was designed for espresso cups which I don't have) and The steamer works fine, although it would be nice for the arm to be longer.Overall I like this espresso maker and I'm happy I bought it. I think it is a GREAT product for the money. It has already paid for itself. I would recommend this to a friend.
