review/summary: Horribly rude companyreview/text: I had a Itouchless trash can for two years, and loved it. When the batteries started to fall out into the can and the battery holder kept falling off, I called the company. They were rude and insulting. When I pay almost $200 for a trash can, I expected some help. I ordered a new battery cover that must have cost 50 cents. It did not work at all, and the batteries kept falling into the trash. I called asking to have them refund the ridiculous cost of this little plastic piece and was ready to order a new can, but they refused to take back the little plastic piece without me paying for it's return!!! Very condescending. I will look for another brand of can, and make sure to find a company that respects it's customers!
