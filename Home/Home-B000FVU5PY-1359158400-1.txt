review/summary: Comfortable...very comfortablereview/text: I've bought those 1200 thread count sheets before and they were also nice, but they have nothing on these sheets. I truly believe the 400 thread count to be quite accurate.The sheets, after washing them, appear not to wrinkle very much, are extremely soft and comfortable, and have the perfect amount of thickness to keep in the warm without smothering.
