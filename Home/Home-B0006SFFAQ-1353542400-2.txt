review/summary: Horrid plastic tastereview/text: This coffee maker leaves a horrid plastic taste in the coffee. Even after running many pots of coffee, cleaning it with vinegar, and running water through it.This coffee maker is over a year old, but I've been drinking instant coffee cause the coffee this thing brews just tastes like crap. I decided to pull it out again, cleaned it with vinegar, ran water through it, ran a pot and tried drinking it again. Yuk.If you don't believe me, it's easy to test for yourself. Just clean it out, and run a pot with just water. Let the water cool and take a drink.For a while I could not figure out why the coffee just tasted off. I tried increasing and decreasing coffee and it always tasted, well, like crap.I have no idea how people say it makes good tasting coffee, unless it's just wishful thinking.
