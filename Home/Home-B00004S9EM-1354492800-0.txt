review/summary: Great design and functionreview/text: I recently purchased this food processor after my KitchenAid died, and after reading all the good Amazon reviews for this product. I am sure glad I listened! This food processor is so much better than my previous KitchenAid. The main things I like about it are:- There is no lip on the lid where food can get stuck while processing- It comes with a flat top that can be used during normal processing (not shredding/slicing). This is great for people with limited counter/cabinet space.The design of this processor is great, down to the details. It also works flawlessly so far. I highly recommend it!
