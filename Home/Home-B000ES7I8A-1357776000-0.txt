review/summary: Great electric kettlereview/text: We have used the electric kettle only a few times since I bought it but it works great. Shuts off automatically and it is only warm to the touch. The cover comes easily for cleaning and the cord wraps up in the base so it is out of the way when the kettle is not being used.. My wife and I are very satisfied with this product.
