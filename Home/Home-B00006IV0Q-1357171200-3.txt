review/summary: False Advertising. More like a 4 cup percolatorreview/text: I ordered this 6 cup coffee maker. That is what the description says and that is what it says on the box. But what I got looked like it might hold 4 cups with the inside parts & coffee installed. I got a measuring cup and it will not even hold 5 1/2 cups of water empty. False Advertising!!! The container cannot even hold 6 cups of water without running over--it can't possibly make 6 cups of coffee. I am really disappointed. It is cute--but it is so small it looks like a toy. I can't comment on function because I am returning it.Update: I returned the 6 cup--without a problem I must say. I then ordered the 12 cup which makes a good cup of coffee. It keeps the coffee hot longer than my old coffee maker.
