review/summary: I want the knife.....please.review/text: I exercise every day, so I don't need an extra workout when it comes to slicing and chopping.So this is my first chef knife, and I couldn't be more pleased. Whether I'm working on a butternut squash or a tomato, this baby is up for the task. If you want fast and easy, Victorinox is the way to go. All levels of chefs/cooks will appreciate this knife...and don't forget the steel!
