review/summary: Makes excellent coffeereview/text: I'm one of those people who thinks no other home brewed coffee can compare to coffee made in a percolator. After our second Farberware pot failed after just a few years, we decided to try the cheaper Presto model. It's great! It may take just a tad longer to perk, but the coffee it produces is HOT, rich, and mellow. Love this percolator. Pretty, too, and easy to clean.
