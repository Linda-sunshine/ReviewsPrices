review/summary: Good value and great for kidsreview/text: For the price, this is a great gizmo to have in the kitchen. I use a mix of zucchini, yellow squash, red onions, and red peppers with this for stir fries and also for pastas. You can slice onions for French Onion Soup with this much finer and faster than by hand and it's esp handy for making home fries and thin curly French Fries come out crispier than hand cut fries. It is a bit of a pain to get the food bits out of the crevices, but if you are cooking for four or more, this is a HUGE time-saver. By slicing the vegetables half way through length-wise, you get cut circles instead of spaghetti strands.My only real gripe is the plastic spikes on the turning handle seem a bit wimpy. Also this is a bit harder to use if you are left-handed.
