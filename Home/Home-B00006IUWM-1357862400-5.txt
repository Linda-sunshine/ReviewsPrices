review/summary: Can't be happier!review/text: I never write reviews. I read them for everything I buy, but never sit down and write one myself. That being said, I just had to write a review for this product. I got mine yesterday and sharpened every knife in the kitchen. WOW! What a difference. Well worth the 27.47 I paid. It's like having an entire drawer full of new knives without the cost. Hard to believe someone can get this excited over a knife sharpener, but this thing really is worth the money!
