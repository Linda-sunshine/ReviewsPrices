review/summary: A tip for those with cleaning issues...review/text: I have this model grinder and it's been giving me flawless service for 23 -- let me repeat that -- 23 years. I notice that the most frequent negative comment in the reviews here is from people who complain that it's difficult to clean.Here's a simple solution for anyone who would let a cleaning issue prevent them from buying this superior gadget: when you need to clean it, just put a small handful of inexpensive raw rice grains in the bowl of the grinder, and give them a few whirls. Pour them out, give the bowl a wipe with a cloth or paper towel, and you've got a clean grinder.Just don't grind them to powder, or then the rice dust will need to be cleaned out!
