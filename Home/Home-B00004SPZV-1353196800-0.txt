review/summary: Mistoreview/text: I just didn't care for this product. Yes, it is cheaper to use than say Pam but the oil spray just isn't that easy, for me, to use. If it isn't pumped after use it has to be pumped....I imagine others like this product it just wasn't something I would use. Gave it away....
