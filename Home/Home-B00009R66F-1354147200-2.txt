review/summary: Hoover SteamVacreview/text: I did thorough research on the type of machine I needed and within my budget. This machine has exceeded my expectations. It's very easy to put together - just follow manual instructions verses the quick guide. This machine is light weight and handles like a dream. I've used it twice already and my carpets look new again. If you're looking for a machine under the $200 mark and to do more than spot clean - this is definitely the machine to buy.
