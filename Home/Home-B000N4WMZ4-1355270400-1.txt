review/summary: Now comes with stainless steel knob, oven safe to 500F.review/text: I haven't actually used this new Dutch oven, but I had the same one in brown and loved it (lost it in a move). But this new one is even better because my old one had one of those black plastic knobs and the new red one I just received has a stainless steel knob. No need any longer to buy a replacement Le Creuset knob!
