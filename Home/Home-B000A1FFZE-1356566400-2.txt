review/summary: This is great!review/text: This is a really neat idea for someone with limited counter space and for just one or two people. giving the option of using it as a toaster oven or a toaster and using just the space of a toaster is a stroke of genius on someone's part. This also comes in a 4 slice size with a deeper toaster oven, which we don't need, but it's one of those crazy-sounding devices that is actually a good idea. We've been using it since Christmas morning, and it works just fine. Glad to have this.
