review/summary: Made to be compactreview/text: This pitcher fits perfectly in the mini-fridge in my office. However, while slim, it's still fairly tall. I understand it's made to fit into the door in particular, but some door panels aren't adjustable and simply aren't tall enough. Slim or not, no amount of slimness is going to get it to fit on the short shelf (or mini shelf) of your fridge.
