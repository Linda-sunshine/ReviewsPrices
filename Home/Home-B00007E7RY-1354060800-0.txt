review/summary: Best for the pricereview/text: I bought the Honeywell 50250 because I checked and it was rated among the best, but you didn't have to take out a mortgage on your home to buy it. I had read the reviews and they are correct it does make quite alot of noise. If you are going to be next to it when it is being used then it may be too noisy. I moved it across the room and I still have to turn the TV up, but this air purifier moves alot of air. I don't turn it on any higher than low for two reasons 1) the noise volume goes up as the fan speed goes up 2) It moves too much air, for me, when set on anything but low. I took it to a friends house for a weekend because they smoke and I don't. It moved the air enough so the smoke disapated and I breathed a little easier. I didn't notice it removing any odors from the air at their house but when I brought it home and turned it on I could smell cigarette smoke for about an hour then it was gone. I can't imagine how much smoke odor it had to remove from their house to have it linger in the filter that long. I would recomend this product to my friends & family.
