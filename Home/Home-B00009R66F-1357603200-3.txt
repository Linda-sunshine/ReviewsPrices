review/summary: Good for what I needreview/text: My carpet isn't filthy, so this is perfect for the occasional house carpet cleaning. The suction is really good which I like so carpet dries quickly. Its also very easy to use and not too heavy to operate (i have a bad Back so i am always nervous about lifting machines-this is perfect) I'm very happy with it.
