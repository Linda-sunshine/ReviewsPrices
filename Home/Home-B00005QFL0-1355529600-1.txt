review/summary: Panasonic SD-YD250 (Disappointed)review/text: We have owned a panasonic bread maker for years and loved it. When it gave up the ghost, we decided to purchase another Panasonic. They are not making them the same way, the quality control was non existant on the one we purchased. The unit made a terrible grinding noise, and almost shook it self off the table. It was so loud it was ridiculous. We sent it back to the seller. I would not recommend this product.
