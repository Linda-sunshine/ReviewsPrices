review/summary: Good enoughreview/text: The steamer seems to work well enough. Sometimes it can spit and sputter pretty easily, but if you keep the water levels as suggested and don't turn it horizontal at all you should be fine. Some of my heavier clothes it seems to have trouble with, but I'll admit I'm still fairly new using it so I probably have to just take the right amount of time with things. Still haven't used either of the attachments, hopefully those are useful! Overall a very good buy especially for how inexpensive it is and how quickly it can be used, but I don't think it can fully replace my iron.
