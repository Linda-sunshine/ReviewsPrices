review/summary: Great space saver!review/text: I've had numerous tie racks. Many of them weren't very efficient or too big and obtrusive when in the closet. I resorted to just laying on them on the dresser. This is definitely a step up and it's easy to pull the ties out and re-rack them up. I highly recommend this.
