review/summary: I love this mirror!review/text: I was so glad to see that someone still makes a makeup mirror with a plug in it. The plug outlet is tight but I can still get my blow dryer in it. It is a good quality mirror. I love that you have the doors for closing and to see the side of you face and hair. I will be buying more of these in the future.
