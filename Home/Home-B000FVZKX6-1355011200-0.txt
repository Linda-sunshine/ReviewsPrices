review/summary: Toasty warmreview/text: These are super soft and toasty. Perfect for winter. They have a nice deep pocket that is easy to get over our thick mattress, and then on top of that, they're a really nice color. They hold up well under washing, too, and remain soft and warm without pilling. Highly reccommend! (but not for summer! Man, that would be hot.)
