review/summary: Mighty Indeed!review/text: I love this vacuum. I just purchased it to replace my old worn out one. I have two large dogs that shed a lot, so I vacuum on a daily basis. This little vacuum is so easy to roll throughout the house because it's so light weight and has a very long cord. The attachment hose makes it easy to vacuum drapes and get any cobwebs in the ceiling corners. Very powerful too! Best vacuum I've ever used and highly recommend it!!!!!!!!
