review/summary: Best thing since the crockpot IMHO!review/text: This thing is GREAT! I always had a problem making consistent loaves of bread before I bought this machine. Not anymore! It makes a perfect loaf every time and SOOOOOOO easy to set up. 5 minutes of prep time and the breadmaker does the rest! Cleanup is a snap! Very well built unit...
