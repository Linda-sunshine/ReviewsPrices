review/summary: Love this air purifer!review/text: I use this in my daughters room instead of a fan for background noise as she sleeps. On the high setting, it lets out just enough noise. On the low setting, you can barely hear it. The quality is very very good. The materials seem to be high quality. It is pretty heavy and the hepa filter is sturdy and bordered with thick plastic(unlike some other hepa filters that are bordered by thin paper like cardboard). It also has a small foam filter between the filter and the vent itself to catch more debris. This was a great buy!
