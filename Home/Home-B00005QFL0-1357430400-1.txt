review/summary: Great Great Great!review/text: This is a great machine! I used to use an other brand's bread machine, but was tired of baking rock-like hard bread. I wanted to eat Japanese soft milk bread in US, and found that many Japanese bloggers living in US baked pretty decent bread with this machine. I am completely happy to have this machine! The yeast dispenser of YD250 makes baking bread easy and perfect! I also found a simple but perfect recipe from Japanese cooking site. If you like soft light crust, I recommend to push the stop button 10 minutes before the machine finishes baking.
