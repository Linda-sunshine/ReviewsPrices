review/summary: Worked fine but will trade up with replacementreview/text: I've had this grinder for a little over a year and it just died this morning. It's been fine for grinding the beans for my husband's morning coffee (he loves the fresh ground) but I won't replace it with the same. One thing that irked me was how much coffee stayed in the grinding bin after the grind. Total static electricity going on there and fine grounds would fly around when ever I'd take the lid off. Oh well, knew its limitations when I bought it, thanks to these reviews. However it's served its purpose and it's time to move on to a better one.
