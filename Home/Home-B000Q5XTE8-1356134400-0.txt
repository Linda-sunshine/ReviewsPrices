review/summary: Can't beat it for the price!review/text: Just got this chair for my new office in our new house. For the price you can't really beat it. At my office we have $1000 Herman Miller chairs that my company gives us. I wasn't going to drop that kind of money on an office chair. This chair is just as good and just as nice.Assembly - I took me about 15 min to put it together. i think I need 1 tool. Nothing crazy. The pieces are a little heavy so be ready to get some help if you can't lift 30lbs.The box is pretty big aslo.The chair has three controls to adjust it the way you want. It seems very well made also. I'm very satisfied especially when i have the rolls royce of office chairs that i sit in for 8 hours a day.
