review/summary: opens the can, but the lock doesn't work that wellreview/text: the lock is overrated. I have to use my hands to hold tightly on the handles while opening the can. the lock doesn't do anything except screwing up the opening of can. if anyone wants one hand opener, this is the wrong item to look at. lock is just an obstacle to open the can. not only that lock doesn't hold on to the can while opening the can, you can't separate opener and can without release that useless lock. I wouldn't pay more than half the price had I know this opener is marketing this serious design flaw for higher price tag.
