review/summary: So far, so good!review/text: My hallway carpet was pretty dingy because it is a high traffic area. I had to go over it several times but the difference is great! I think I did better with this machine than Stanley Steamer did 6 months ago. Also, sucked up water well so carpet is not soaked and dries quickly. Next time I will pre-treat the area to see if it can get even cleaner. Bottom line: great product if it holds up, go over area several times, well worth the price. Also, Amazon shipping was amazing!
