review/summary: Nothing Beats Cast Ironreview/text: I have three Lodge Logic cast iron pans of my own in different sizes, and I use them constantly. Nothing cooks as evenly as cast iron, and the cleanup (a quick scrub with hot water--NO SOAP!!!!) is so easy, no matter how messy the recipe was. Whenever I visit my mother, I rant and rave about her stainless pans, and so this Christmas I decided to put my money where my mouth is and purchase one for her. This is the medium size in my kitchen, and gets the most use. I've had my pans for years, and they're still perfect. And as a vegetarian, I assure you--they don't need to taste like bacon to be well-seasoned.
