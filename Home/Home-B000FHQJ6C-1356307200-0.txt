review/summary: I really wanted to like thisreview/text: I really wanted to like this product. I LOVED the vegetable juices it made while it worked, but the first one I ordered arrived cracked and then the replacement order started cracking after about a week of use. Which then allowed beet and carrot juice to run down and stain the countertop. The juices it made were AMAZING though.
