review/summary: Great Price and makes Great Waffles!review/text: I've bought 3 of these so far; 1 for me and 2 for family in Mexico and we all love it! It makes thick Belgian style waffles and the family in Mexico have never seen waffles made like this so of course the think it's amazing as well!Small and compact style makes it easy to store (and put in a suitcase for travel). Highly recommend!
