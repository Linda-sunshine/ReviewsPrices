review/summary: Must Agree...review/text: I read the reviews on this dehydrator before I bought it and I must agree with the 5 starers here. It out performs the Waring Pro I bought last year by a long shot. It has deeper and larger trays, has accurate number temp readings instead the "low, medium and high" as temp regulation to go by and the heating element on the top provides faster and more even drying. You won't lose with this one.
