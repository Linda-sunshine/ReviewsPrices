review/summary: Nice unitreview/text: Good for when home is closed up for winter or hot summer ac use. Unit effectively cleans air for a noticable difference especially if you have a smoker or pets in the home. have no opinion on the odor removing ionizer but using it in moderation shouldnt cause any resiratory problems as the ionic breeze ozone creators from shaper image will. I like! Its compact and works!
