review/summary: Veggie Noodlerreview/text: I love this product. It is a great way to add more veggies to a meal. It produces a product with a texture similar to pasta. I tried it with zucchini and then added a little garlic. After slightly steaming the veggie noodles and topping with tomato sauce, it was a winner with the whole family. I plan to use it often as one of the most clever additions to my kitchen.
