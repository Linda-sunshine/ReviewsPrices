review/summary: for get buying cooking spray from the store!review/text: Forget buying cooking spray from the store, if you buy this bad boy you'll fall in love! the can is &#34;small&#34; but that's ok, that means it takes up less space. something you should know that is not in the description &#34;half full&#34; is 1/3cup (3 ounces) and while that does not sound like a whole lot, remember your spraying a thin layer of oil so it may actually take a tsp (or less) to coat what ever it is your spraying.So far I have used this for olive oil to, spray cookie sheets, oil a bowl for dough, and a &#34;none stick&#34; pan for frying. It performs better than I had anticipated. I did &#34;cheat&#34; slightly by using a silicone brush to spread out the oil on the cookie sheets and bowl just to ensure even coat.The oil comes out super fine when pumped up full (10 pumps) remember the oil is &#34;aerosolized&#34; (particles small enough to float in the air!) so a little bit will go a LONG way in this sprayer (unlike say a pump or trigger sprayer you'd use around the kitchen for cleaning etc)A few things you should know. when you get this don't expect to use it that day. Like any other kitchen utensil you should clean it first. My first impression was &#34;wow that stinks!&#34; I think its what ever oils they use to machine the metal. I followed the cleaning directions (3 ounce warm water 1 drop detergent, pump 15 times spray 15 seconds, repeat with fresh water) but then I let it &#34;air out&#34; over night. The next day no more smell. filled up with oil and got to work! while the directions does not say not to do this, based on past experience with other sprays I would not submerge the pump its self in water if I could help it. The pump does have an O-ring type gasket which I think may be a future fail point, it would be nice if they had included a spare one of those.Other then that small nitpick I think I will be getting years of use out of this sprayer.
