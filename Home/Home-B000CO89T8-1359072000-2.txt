review/summary: CAVEAT EMPTORreview/text: I RECEIVED AN ITEM THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THROWN IN A DUMPSTER , AND SOLD TO ME AS A ACCEPTABLE WORKING ITEM, HMMM THEN WHEN BROUGHT TOO THEIR ATTENTION IT WAS BLAMED ON A NEW EMPLOYEE ERROR, CONVENIENT ! ?IT'S QUITE A LENGTHY ORDEAL AND IM SURE ITS NOT A PRODUCT ISSUE IN ITSELF JUST A CASE OF POOR AND IGNORANT MANAGEMENT...... I WILL NOT CONDACEND FURTHER BUT WILL DEFINITELLY NOT DEAL WITH WISEUP PRODUCTS EVER IN THE FUTURE AND SUGGEST YOU THINK TWICE BEFORE DOING SO......BUYER BEWARE, !!!
