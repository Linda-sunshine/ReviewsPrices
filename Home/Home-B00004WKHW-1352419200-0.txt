review/summary: IV'E ALWAYS LOVED THIS PRODUCTreview/text: Owned a Cuisinart dcl older modle for about 20 yrs. The motor was good, the blade perfect for years. But, someone visiting put the top in the dishwasher which was too hot and distorted the top. There is a source online for replacement ....Rather than do that, I opted to purchase this newest modle...Very pleased with this newer modle. even does a good job on hard cheeses. LOVE IT.. LOVE IT!.....PS. WASH IT BY HAND...
