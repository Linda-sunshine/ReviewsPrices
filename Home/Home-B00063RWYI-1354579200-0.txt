review/summary: Absolutely Wonderfulreview/text: I use my dutch oven for everything. It was a great addition during the Thanksgiving holidays. In the oven it is great for baking. I baked a lemon pound cake, with a cream cheese filling in the oven, and it came out perfectly. It is also a great slow cooker for chili, stews, soups and beans. I plan to purchase two more.
