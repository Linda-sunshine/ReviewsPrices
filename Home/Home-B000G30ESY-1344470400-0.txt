review/summary: Perfect everytimereview/text: Love this rice cooker! The black and stainless steel matches our kitchen perfectly and looks so sleek. It's also the perfect size for a 2 person household. The music it plays when it begins to cook and when the rice is ready is so cute! Although I wonder if I can disable it if I get sick of it. And of course, rice is cooked to perfection everytime! I recommend using Tamaki Gold rice for the best results. I also add enough water so it is just under the measuring line. I hate mushy rice.
