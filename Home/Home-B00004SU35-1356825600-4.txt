review/summary: BEST POPCORN MAKER EVER!!!!!!review/text: We are still shocked by how efficient this little popper is. It is like magic. You put in your 3 tablespoons of oil and 1/2 cup of popcorn and you turn on the heat, turn the handle and in no time (and I mean NO TIME) this thing has popped the BEST popcorn I have ever made. I have always enjoyed the old-fashioned method of popping corn and have been popping it for some 20 years in various types of pans. I was really upset with myself that I waited so long to find this little popper after seeing how effortlessly it popped the biggest, crispiest popcorn I have ever had. My partner and I have been using this a couple of months now and we still laugh every time we pop corn because it's so mind-blowing how easy and good this is. I can't imagine life without the Whirley-Pop now.
