review/summary: Doesn't work at allreview/text: The product didn't work from the beginning. When I tried to pump it, the top came up but the cylinder that was supposed to do the pumping slipped out of the top and remained stuck to the sprayer. I worked and worked with it and eventually gave up. I desperately needed a sprayer several days later, and ended up going to a local department store where I discovered the only available mister was the exact same brand! I bought one anyway, and found to my relief that it worked quite well. Guess the one I ordered online was just a lemon. I didn't bother to try to send the device back to the vendor, because I'm quite busy and it just wasn't worth the effort.So I guess it may be somewhat unfair to give the product only one star, since the identical product I purchased at a local store works fine. I'll retain the one-star rating, however, since this PARTICULAR product from this vendor was completely worthless. In sum: I have purchased two MISTO sprayers, with one working fine and one not working at all. You can arrive at your own conclusion about how to interpret these data.
