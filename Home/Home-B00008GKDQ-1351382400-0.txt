review/summary: Good griddle, takes a while to seasonreview/text: I use the griddle for cooking over a campfire. I seasoned it with crisco when it arrived just to be safe. The first two times I used it cooking bacon, the bacon had to be constantly tended to avoid sticking. After that, it works like a charm.
