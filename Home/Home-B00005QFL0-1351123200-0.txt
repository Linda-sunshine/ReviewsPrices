review/summary: An excellent productreview/text: After years of only partial satisfaction with automatic bread makers I decided to try again and bought the Panasonic SD-YD250 because it was a top choice on most of the review sites I viewed. I also liked its size, price, the way it adds yeast at a critical time, and its relative simplicity -- I am not interested in making jam and other products in a bread maker. I feel I have finally "hit the jackpot" with this bread maker. I am going through the accompanying recipe book, trying various types of bread before I go to other recipes, and every one so far has been so good that I am tempted to remake it instead of trying something else. The texture is excellent, the crust is good -- while the length cannot be a long as a typical "store bought" loaf because it is limited by the size of the pan, if you choose the large size choice from the recipes the loaf is so high that one slice cut in half is just right for us for a sandwich. I did toss out all of my old flours and yeast and ordered fresh white, wheat, rye, and spelt flours and yeast specified for bread makers, and I think that has added to the excellence of the results. And after reviewing the back and forth on whether to add whey protein, I have added one Tablespoon per loaf; while I don't have a comparison loaf without the whey, I note that with it the bread definitely has a longer shelf life than breads I have made without whey protein, although we eat this bread up so fast that shelf life probably is not going to be a real problem!
