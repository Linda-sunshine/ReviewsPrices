review/summary: Waffle makerreview/text: There is no adjustable setting. I prefer my waffle to be very light, not crispy, so I don't wait till the indicator light to be off. It says &#34;easy to clean&#34; but I'm not sure if I can wash it with water... It's been okay cleaning with wet paper towel but what if it gets really dirty?
