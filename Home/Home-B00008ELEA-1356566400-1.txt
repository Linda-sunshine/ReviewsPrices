review/summary: Another example of selling the brand while cheapening the actual productreview/text: I had a 4 cup Farberware perculator which was handed down from my parents, it actaully had the stone stem inside and it gave me years of reliable service. It finally breathed it's last breath a few years ago. A few days ago, the 2nd replacement Farberware Percolator [8cup] (the first one's cheap plastic bottom cracked within a few months) just died, it's been less than 2 years. I understand that's how things are made now, manufacturers would prefer you have to buy a new one every few years, but I guess we as consumers can control that by avoiding brands and companies that do that. I will not be going back to this for a 3rd time.
