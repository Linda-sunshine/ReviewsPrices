review/summary: Good product for the moneyreview/text: This is the second time I have bought this air popper. My first one lasted about 5 years. I probably used it once a week.Pros - Inexpensive. Works just fine. Lasted quite some time.Cons - Loud. No power switch. You have to unplug it, which results in a spark every time. Not recommended for children.
