review/summary: Perfect size, taking some time to seasonreview/text: This is a terrific size. I use it on my glass-top stove and the heat distribution is good. It is big enough to cook a wide variety of items--my most frequent are eggs, grilled veggies, and French toast. The seaoning it comes with is a good start but not nearly enough. I've baked it several times with coconut oil (we're vegetarian, so no bacon or hamburger for us) which has helped, but it still isn't quite where I'd like it to be. It will get there, though.I like that the handle doesn't get too hot at med-high temp, and I can still lift the pan off the burner without needing a mitt. At high temp though, don't forget that mitt.When I clean, I wait until it's a little warm, then scrape them pan off with a Pampered chef nylon scraper It works great to get the rounded bits around the edges, then you can turn the scraper over and use the squared-off end for tougher spots on the pan. After I rinse all that off, I use a Cell-O type scrubber to get the rest off. Another quick rinse, a dry with a towel, and it's clean. I give it a little spritz of oil and rub with a paper towel, and it's ready to go for next time. Overall, I'm very pleased with this versatile pan. Hard to imagine I've spent so many years paying big bucks for nonstick that only lasts a couple years when this will last forever and is healthier.
