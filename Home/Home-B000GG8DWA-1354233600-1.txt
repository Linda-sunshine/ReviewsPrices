review/summary: warm & pleasedreview/text: I was going to wait and see what our electric bill came out to, but right now I'm basking in the concentrated heat of the Optimus heater and felt compelled to review it. I have it at 400 W and it's enough to keep the one side of me (where it's placed, on a chair about 2 feet away from me) warm. I move it down to the floor when my feet get cold. Maybe it's not as luxurious as having heat circulated about me, but if it's energy-effective, I'm fine with it. Usually here in SF bay area my house gets to be 60F in the day time. I'm the only one home for the school hours of the day and don't want to heat up the whole house, so it's very nice to be able to work at my computer without feeling cold or guilty.As others have said, it's not a terribly sturdy-feeling device, and the cord could be longer-- my only complaints for now.
