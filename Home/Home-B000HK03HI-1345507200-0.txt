review/summary: Built a better mousetrapreview/text: The only reason I was skeptical about buying this is that it costs 3x as much as the cheap can openers I was used to buying, but really this will last you about 10x as long. You don't have to strain at all--just press the lock button and twist, and the top comes off incredibly smoothly. Definitely recommended.
