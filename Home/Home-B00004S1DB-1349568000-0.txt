review/summary: Screen Does Not Fit, Grounds in Coffeereview/text: I bought this for my husband to use while camping, and unfortunately the first outing was a week after the return "window" expired. The screen is too large, and makes 2 triangle-shaped folds when pressed down, allowing coffee grounds to get into the coffee. Needless to say, he doesn't like it.
