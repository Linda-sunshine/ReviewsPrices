review/summary: Good poppcorn, horrible construction.review/text: Makes great popcorn but the construction quality leaves much to be desired. The rotating mechanism failed after only 4 uses. The pot is made of very thin gage untreated aluminum and dents very easily.Recommend completely removing the top cover prior to pouring out the popcorn, the holding clip does not hold tight and the cover will fall off unexpectedly leaving a mess on your kitchen floor. if trying to pour out popcorn using one trap door don't, you will be sorry.Cleaning is not easy because oil, grease and seasoning tend to stick to the untreated aluminum. An alternative would be adding seasoning salt to the popcorn after pouring into a bowl. I prefer to clean the corn popper after use. Using a sponge and normal dish soap gets the job done but the top rotator mechanism requires a bit of effort to get into all the crevices. Wipe dry using cloth or paper towels and it's ready for the next batch.Would not recommend machine washing due to the flimsiness of the mechanism and wood handles.
