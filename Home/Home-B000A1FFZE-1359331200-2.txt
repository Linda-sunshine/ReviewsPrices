review/summary: Don't be discouraged by poor reviews.review/text: This is a perfect appliance for occasional use. I have made bagels in it nearly every day since it arrived. I have found no issues. It toasts evenly and quickly. I have heated up frozen food in the toaster oven and found it great for that that as well.I have read reviews about how its hard to keep this clean. I am not sure what this about. As with any toaster oven, if you put something inside that is going to melt and make a mess, you should wipe it down right away. There is a removable crumb tray that you can pull out and clean easily.I also read reviews about people saying that there is no easy way to cancel a toast cycle and that you have to manually pull up on the toast lever and then the toast shoots across the room. Perhaps that is on an older model. The toaster I have has an illuminated cancel button right on the front. If you want to remove the toast early, just press it.Perfect for small kitchen because it has a foot print and only does 2 slices at a time. Great for college student or single person. With this, you can eliminate your toaster and toaster oven and save space!
