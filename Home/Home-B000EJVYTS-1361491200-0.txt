review/summary: Love it!review/text: PROS: I'm now so spoiled with this thing (used it now for several months)! I've even been known to stand in front of our &#34;paper trash&#34; white plastic can with my hand full of paper trash and wait for it to magically open. Duh! They don't all magically open, doofus.Ours is hooked up all the time to the wall (outlet that we brilliantly had installed at the end of the counter when we built the house). Never have to buy batteries. Too cool! (Bought the adaptor from Amazon. Look under my former reviews and you can find it, in case you are looking for one that matches this particular can.)CONS: I shouldn't even respond here since my husband does all the emptying and cleaning. But,... here goes. It is a little troublesome because you have to lift it over to the sink to wipe off the debris that comes from dumping your garbage. But, DON'T GET IT WET with a spraying of water as you normally could a regular waste can. You can't get the mechanisms wet. Just wipe down the exterior surfaces that get dirty.There, you have it. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.
