review/summary: Nice Water Kettlereview/text: It takes a little longer to heat than I thought it would but it gets very hot. I like the automatic shutoff but learned that the lid has to be tight for it to work. I have had trouble keeping the filter in as it is a little hard to put it but I really do not need it. I had tried another kettle and the water tasted like plastic. This one has no aftertaste.
