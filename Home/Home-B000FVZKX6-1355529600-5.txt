review/summary: So Warmreview/text: My wife and I bought this sheet set for our bed along with a cotton velvet duvet & down comforter for the duvet. Its so snuggly warm under the sheets and they are incredibly soft. Likewise, its not so warm that you lose your mind. We keep our house between 70-72 in winter, and have a window open next to the bed because we smoke in the house. Getting underneath that duvet and the sheet makes it just warm enough, and if it ever gets to be too much just throw a leg out and you are fine. Best sheets I have ever owned in my opinion.
