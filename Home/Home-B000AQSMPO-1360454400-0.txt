review/summary: 1st problem started after 2 weeks.review/text: I thought this would be a terrific choice, after 2 weeks of 2 or 3 cups brewed each day I got a prime signalI followed the instructions for this. 2 days later it wanted to be primed againThis is a large hassle for me because I need to prime after almost every brew.I plan to return this to Dillard's.Too Bad because I do like the coffee variety they offer.I cannot justify a recommendation for this this product!Now I have to drive 30 miles to return it.
