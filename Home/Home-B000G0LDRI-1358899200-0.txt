review/summary: Similar noise to that of a blast furnacereview/text: Although I'm nor the fore most expert on humidifier, this one wasn't for us. It does output a ton of humidity however that is about all that I'm happy with. It is a fan based unit so it has a large filter and a fan. When the fan is on high it's very loud. You can feel the air coming out at a great speed but the frustrating part was the noise. I had to put it almost on the other side of our upstairs to make it bearable. Also its a higher pitched fan because of the size. I would no recommend this unless you had no other choice. That being said, I don't know of many units that can match the output and also hold enough water to go almost 24 hours without being refilled.
