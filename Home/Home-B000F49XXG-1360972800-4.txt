review/summary: de'longhi coffee machine makes great coffeereview/text: it makes great coffee/cuppucino. problem is i live in south africa where i need a step down transformer to be able to plug usa 120 v product into zar 240v outlet. cheapest transformer for 1100w machine is approx $100.you should not sell usa market appliances to 240v countries. you should supply zar from uk where i think voltage samei managed to get a very old transformer free but otherwise i would have returned it but postage from zar to usa also approx $100.it is not a proposition to send usa aplliances to 240v countries.
