review/summary: Cuisinart Mini Prep Plusreview/text: I have a large food processor and find pulling it out for small jobs to be annoying. I wondered if this product would work well. My daughter in law loves hers and thought I would like to have this item. I was not convinced until I was watching The Chew on TV when one of the chefs mentioned this item was one of his favorite appliances. I ordered one and love it. I use it not only for onions, but for pureeing canned fruits for my infant grand daughter.
