review/summary: HEPA Filter Good Bargainreview/text: This HEPA filter is not the quietest I've had, but it is very efficient. In high mode, it'll clean a large room in just a few minutes. Low speed is perfect if you leave it running while you sleep at night. We leave it in high mode during the day, then turn it down at night. Great bargain!
