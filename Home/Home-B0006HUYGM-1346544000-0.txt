review/summary: Love this little vacuumreview/text: This little vacuum works extremely well on small areas to extract pet hair and dirt from carpeting, and is excellent for stairway carpeting. It does tend to clog after several minutes, but I just rinse out the filter and let it dry out before using again.It is a great little vacuum, with lots of suction for small jobs.
