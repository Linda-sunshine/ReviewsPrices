review/summary: Used daily, worked very wellreview/text: I used this daily and it never wore out. I cannot say the same for the hamilton beach one I had.Overall it's very easy to use. Only downside might be the height. You can only fit small cups underneath, whereas other models have enough room for normal sized cups (if you are making say, a mocha). Also the milk frotheris set a bit low so you've got to kind've maneuver the milk frother in there. It does swivel off to the side, so that helps. Would be nice if spigot or plate could be raised and lowered or something. But with a bit of maneuvering, this gets the job done.So other than the low set prep area..the is machine is incredibly durable and makes a great cup of espresso.
