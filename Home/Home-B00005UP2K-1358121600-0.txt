review/summary: very happy with this mixer so farreview/text: I actually got the professional model one first but I have to return it because of the flat beater is rubbing the bowl. This model wasn't my first choice because reading the reviews here, made me think this model could not handle dough and not really for bread making. But for 1.5 months now, I've been using my mixer for 2-3 times a week. I usually make pizza dough, some dinner rolls/white bread and desserts like cookies and cupcakes every week since I got it. And it does an excellent job. Last week, I made homenade soft pretzels with it with no problem. I would recommend this product. It will be your new best friend.
