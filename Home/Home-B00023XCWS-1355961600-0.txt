review/summary: Works greatreview/text: This electric kettle works exactly how it is supposed to. The water boils quickly and automatically turns off when it is done. Some people complained about it being plastic... while it does smell like plastic, I have never tasted any plastic in the water since the first cup I've made. Just delicious tea taste! It is small enough to hide in my office so I can pull it out when I want to make some tea, and nobody would know! I would recommend.
