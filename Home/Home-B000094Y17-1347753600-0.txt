review/summary: Great replacement for bottled waterreview/text: I got this to replace my bottle water collection in my refrigerator. It does a great job of purifying the water since my tap water taste foul. I don't have the lid problem as other customers have, however i do notice that charcoal does float up to the staging area every now and then. The charcoal doesn't bother me as long as it doesn't find a way into the bottom storage area. I love the taste of the final filtered water and it has made my budget a ton cheaper. So far I have been using the same filter for two months and the filters seem pretty cheap if i only have to replace them every 3-4 months.
