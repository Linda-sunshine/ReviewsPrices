review/summary: Great bottle with some mini issuesreview/text: I bought several Thermos Nissan 16-Ounce Backpack Bottle. It works charm like everyone reviewed. But it is big and heavy if you put it in handbag and carry them around. I bought Zojirushi 12 ounce bottle.Comparing Nissan and Zojirushi bottle, they both work well to keep your drink warm or cold whole day, doesn't leak.Zojirushi has 12 ounce small version. Nissan doesn't. I wish it has. If it has, I would choose Nissan over Zojirushi as the internal material.The outside paint, Zojirushi works way better than Nissan. Nissan one is very easy to be scratched off. Not sure about its new version.I clean my mug very often. Zojirushi and Nissan are both easy to clean. But somehow, I feel Nissan's inside material is better than Zojirushi. Zojirushi you have to wash really really .... hard to get rid of the smell of dish soap.Nissan, you need to pay attention when you put on lid, the lid leak if you don't match it well.
