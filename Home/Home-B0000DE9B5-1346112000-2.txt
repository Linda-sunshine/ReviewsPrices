review/summary: Using for a Year and LOVE this Bormioli Rocco Frigoverre Jug!review/text: For the last couple of years I've been making my own milk with a powdered milk and I just LOVE this Bormioli Rocco Frigoverre Jug! It is a very solid glass jug that you don't have to worry about knocking around your fridge. It is not light, not heavy, but just right for a lot of regular use. This jug has a wonderful lid that TRULY IS HERMETIC! This thing will keep things cold but also very much sealed! Yes, at times the lid is TOO TIGHT and you have to pry it off, BUT I'd rather that than have any kind of air leak and spoil whatever is in the jug! Very well crafted and designed. Literally a year on and I use it every week and it has become a standard in my very active kitchen and refrigerator. I STRONGLY recommend this jug!
