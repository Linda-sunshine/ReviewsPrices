review/summary: should've got the 6-quart onereview/text: I prefer meat browned, and veggies either raw, stirfried, fermented or roasted, so I got this primarily for making bone broths, cooking legumes and cooking whole grains.I got the 4-quart as it's just me and hubby here, but I did not realize you can't fill this more than 2/3rd full. Now I wish I'd have ordered the 6-quart.Even though it's stainless, it's very lightweight. This is handy as I have permanent chest pain after surgery, so lifting can be difficult.It works fine. It makes very concentrated fast broths in the summer when I don't want things simmering on the stove for hours. Similarly, I can cook big batches of legumes and freeze in meal-sized portions fast. I haven't tried grains yet as I was on a risotto kick when this arrived, and then went on a temporary grain-free diet.I am quite satisfied, except I wish I'd gotten the larger one.
