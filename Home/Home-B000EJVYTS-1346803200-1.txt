review/summary: I love the itouchless auto trash canreview/text: The first one I recieved was clearly used and didn't work and had dents/scratches but Amazon was excellent in resolving my problem. Amazon had ups come out the next morning for a pickup of the old one and then They sent me out a NEW one and it works perfectly. It's an excellent trash can, holds more than my other trash can. Now I can actually fill up the bag instead of wasting 1/4 of the bag.
