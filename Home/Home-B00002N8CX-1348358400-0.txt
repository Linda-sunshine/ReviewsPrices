review/summary: Mighty Lite Model 3670 Canister Vacuumreview/text: This vacuum has big problems. I noticed black residue on the yellow part of the body where it meets the black. In cleaning it off I decided to wipe the whole thing down. The wheels were very black, and getting in the inside of them as best I could, they were filled with the black residue which looks like graphite. I am a very fussy housekeeper -- we do not wear shoes in the house so the dirt on the vacuum was not from my floors. I periodically washed the vacuum off and always had the residue. I finally found out the problem. Behind the wheels there is a vent where the air blows out -- so the graphite was coming off the motor -- when you are sweeping it comes out there and also the back. What is wrong with this picture -- you are sweeping up dirt and it is throwing it out!
