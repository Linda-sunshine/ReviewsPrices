review/summary: Paperweightreview/text: That's all it's good for. I purchased this radio after my last one quit working. I have confirmed MULTIPLE times that the SAME codes are correct and that the radio is in an area in which it can receive a NWS signal. I live in an area that gets a lot of violent weather events - April 2011 there were 20+ tornadoes that came within a 5 mile distance North / South of my home. In March of 2012 I watched a tornado pass within 1/2 mile of my home and this thing never sounded. Since buying this WR-300 it only seems to work when it feels like doing so. Today my immediate area was under a tornado warning 4 different times and this thing never made a sound. The user manual is not very well written and leaves a lot of information / instructions out. Emails to Midland only garner the standard cut and paste responses from their big-book-o-answers.
