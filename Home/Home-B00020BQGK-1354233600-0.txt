review/summary: Great Little Vacreview/text: I acquired my Flair from my late mother's estate so it was already about a year old and used. I've now used it for another year and it is still performing flawlessly. We use it for quick cleanups of our old house. We have wood floors with oriental carpets throughout so one is continually switching on the power head for the carpets and then switching it off for the wood floors. I've brushed out the main filter at each empty but have never washed it out. I've noticed that my Flair was getting a little warm when running it with the power head active so I started doing some "research". I discovered that I can wash out the dust collection filter. And for $15 (including shipping costs) I just ordered a complete set of filters for my Flair so now I can put in a clean set and then wash out the old set and keep rotating them like this. We were looking at the Dyson DC-44 but in the end decided it was practical for us and that we could buy 7+ Hoover Flairs for the price of one Dyson. I think I'll get another Flair for upstairs, though it's light enough to simply carry around the house, and one for my travel trailer. Great little vacuum!
