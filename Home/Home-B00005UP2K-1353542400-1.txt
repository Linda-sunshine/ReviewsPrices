review/summary: KSM150 not as good as 20 year old mixerreview/text: KSM150 mixer was initially incorrectly adjusted for height as all the tools bottomed out in the bowls. This caused the unit to lurch even with the head locked down. While this is an easy adjustment (for our unit it took over 3 complete rotations of the adjusting screw) it should have been set correctly at the factory. If that was the only problem we would have kept the unit. Unfortunately there were two other mechanical problems.First, the lifting head was very loose so that even when locked down it jumped around. Second, there was a rhythmic mechanical grinding noise inside the gear head area of the mixer indicating misalignment of the gears or poor manufacturing tolerances. It was quite obvious and should have been caught by factory quality control. Reading some of the other reviews this may be cause the premature failure some have experienced. Our old unit, a KSM90, was, and still is, tight and as quiet as can be.Frankly it is disappointing that the quality of a 2012 Made in the USA product is so poor. These things should have been caught at the factory. It may be that they actually power up only a small sample of the units rather than each one.We're returning the new mixer and bringing the older one out of storage.On a positive note the larger bowl is nice. Interestingly the old 4 qt. bowls fit nicely on the new mixer's base plate, but the new 4-1/2 qt. bowls won't lock into the old mixer, they are loose and just spin around. Something seems to have changed in the stamping of the bowl bottom or the base plate. I noticed that others have needed base plate replacements.
