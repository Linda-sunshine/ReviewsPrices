review/summary: Love itreview/text: Okay ladies. This thing is heavy. If you have bad shoulders like me you need to do one or two things. One have things where you never have to move this thing loaded. Or invite a friend to co-own with you! And you can help each other can!But really set it up where you don't have to move it!And the co-own might sound odd but it has worked out for us. Who needs a heavy pressure cooker all the time?My neighbors and me plant our beans, etc., few days apart now. What we all wanted was a very safe pressure cooker. This thing is not cheap! We talked and we have it! There has never been the first argument over it. Just a whole lot of helpers, new recipes, and ideas. We share it all now! We even help each other pick the beans, and prepare them.I have been learning to can chicken this winter! I'm really excited over this thing. Now when I want home made chicken and dumplings I can open a jar or two and wow toss in my dumplings! Oh another thing, if there are two or three of you owning this, you will never miss a sale at the grocery store again! Woot roasts are on sale! Chickens on sale! HA I hope you like this as much as we do.The one thing I will say, I believe it might be too heavy for the glass top electric stoves. On a regular electric stove it works great. The big thing we learned at my neighbors is that you do great using TWO burners. Use one burner to bring it up to pressure. Have the other burner turned on and ready to go to slide this thing over. Two of us do it to be really safe. A stronger person without shoulder problems would have no problem. But safety first! After a couple tries you will know exactly where the second burner needs to be set. Its best to go too low as you can bring pressure right back up.
