review/summary: Love the juicerreview/text: This Breville juicer is great. It's powerful yet fairly quiet. It's able to juice whole apples and other fruits and vegetables with no problem. Clean up is easy. I juice in the morning before work and I can get it done and cleaned up in 20 minutes. I would recommend this item without hesitation.
