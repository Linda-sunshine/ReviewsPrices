review/summary: Sworn Enemy of Dog Hair and Dirty Stairsreview/text: We have used this little vacuum for about two weeks now and so far have been very impressed with its ability to clean upholstery and stairs. Like most pet owners we have a problem with dog hair on the furniture, in the crevices between the carpet and the wall, and on the stairs. The suction on this Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum is powerful enough to take care of all these problems.We also like the length of the cord which really lets you get around quite a bit. It is long enough to let us reach the top of the stairs and all the furniture in the living room from a single plug at the bottom of the stairs. The refuse cup is easy to clean and the clear cover lets you know right away when it needs emptying. The smaller size also allows it to be conveniently stored so you can grab it to do a little simple touching up if you are expecting guests and you don't want to drag out a bigger machine.This powerful little vacuum has filled a niche in our home and has become a very useful thing to have around.
