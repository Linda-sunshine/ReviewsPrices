review/summary: Worth every pennyreview/text: I hate vacuuming the steps and this hand-held has made it so much easier! Very powerful and so much lighter than dragging my other one up and down the stairs. Also love that it is bagless. I have pets and this sucks up all the fur wonderfully. I highly recommend this product.
