review/summary: Reliable!review/text: I've had this thing in my college dorm for months now and it has worked without fail, even though it gets used on a daily basis. I just purchased a second one as a Christmas gift. It has always shut off automatically and it definitely heats the water quickly. For the price, I really don't think you can do better.
