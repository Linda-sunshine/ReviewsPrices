review/summary: Great for Futonreview/text: Because wanting increased space, I turned my bedroom into my office/clothes storage, and now sleep on the futon in my 'living' room. The hard futon was difficult to get adjusted to, and my sleep quality suffered greatly- I felt completely tired throughout the day. I was informed of these foam toppers, and after reading up on them, its best to go with quality over price (as with most things)Yes, this was a big investment to make on a product I've never seen or felt. I'm glad I did it though. I really can't talk it up enough- it was such a stark contrast to anything I've slept on before.To address the only CON (that goes away with time):You WILL need to have this aired out a few days before the minty aroma goes away. Since it was bearable, I slept on it the first night with several bed sheets, then removed them in the morning, and left the window open (it was the only way for me to get fresh air). Within a week the aroma was mostly gone. Since I sleep mostly in the middle, when I depress other parts you can still get a faint smell out of it.Otherwise great feeling. At the time of purchase, the full size cost $125 and the queen size was $100. What I should have done, is bought the queen, and then cut off the 4-6 inches I don't need so I could use as a seat cushion! Its great material
