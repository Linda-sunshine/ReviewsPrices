review/summary: Best French Press ever madereview/text: If you're (occasionally clumsy) like me, and you use a french press, you've probably broken at least one or two of the single wall glass presses that are common. This product performs every bit as good as those, and it will last a lifetime...Keeps your coffee hotter longer to boot. I've had mine for two years, used and abused it, and it still works just as well as the first day I bought it. Dropped it out of a tree one time, and a small ding was the only damage (long story...). Only recently did I need to replace the metal mesh screen, as the edges began to tear, after 2 years of everyday use (the same mesh screens that fit the bodum presses fit this press as well--I just swapped in a mesh screen from one of those that I had broken before I found the Nissan press).My only wish is that it could be completely sealed, like the Contigo travel cups, so that my press-o-hot-coffee could be truly portable (are you listening, Nissan, oh manufacturer of great cars and coffee presses??...)Buy one, you will not regret it!
