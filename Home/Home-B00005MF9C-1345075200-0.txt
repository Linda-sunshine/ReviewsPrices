review/summary: Perfect for a dorm or single personreview/text: I like the mug and the coffee pot. They both are attractive and feel solid enough. The pot does sometimes drip water out of the top during the brew, but it's not excessive. It's a cheaper coffee pot, so there's always a little give or take. It brews coffee fast enough, and I use it to heat water for tea as well. I also like that it has a permanent filter, that saves money and headaches when you forget to buy new paper filters for other pots. If you want something that's affordable and does the trick, buy this.
