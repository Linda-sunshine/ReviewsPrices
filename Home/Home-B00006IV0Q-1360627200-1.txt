review/summary: Not for everyday coffee makingreview/text: Bought this percolator based on the really high reviews. I love the size and I think it would be perfect for traveling, camping, or things like that. I wouldn't recommend it for everyday home use though. It's a huge pain to clean assuming that you don't use the paper filters. And if you use the paper filters then the coffee always seems to be real weak. We didn't mind having the few grounds at the bottom of the pot, just make sure to ground your coffee to the coarsest setting at the grocery store. We ended up just getting another drip coffee maker for everyday use which is much easier to clean and we can set for a specific time. We are keeping this and might try it out for camping or traveling though.
