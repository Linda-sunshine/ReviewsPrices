review/summary: Works Better Than The More Expensive Onesreview/text: All I can say is that the wife and I are very impressed and happy with this Kitchen Aid KSB560MC 5-Speed Blender. We make a lot of smoothies, and this machine is perfect! Five speeds is plenty. It works better than some 10 speed blenders we have owned. It consistently pulverizes and completely mixes . . . every time. The Polycarbonate Jar is high capacity, lite-weight, and easy to clean. We would definitely buy this one again.
