review/summary: Cuisinart Round Classic Waffle Makerreview/text: We read every one of the pros and cons for this product before deciding to go for the simple, inexpensive maker. We have been delighted with every waffle it has produced. The adjustment toggle is a bit loose, but has no effect on the doneness of the waffle. I use Arrowhead Mills Waffle and Pancake Mix and have no difficulty with the batter. I just remember to stir "gently". I like mine light; husband likes his crispy and brown, and we get both with this one.
