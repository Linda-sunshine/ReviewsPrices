review/summary: Perfect Conditionreview/text: I purchased my first dutch oven online from a brick and mortar retailer, and it was delivered with chips in the lid. After returning it, I purchased it from Amazon and had absolutely no issues. I have used the dutch oven for soups, mussels, wings, etc. and it works great. Very easy to clean, and I find 7.5-quart to be the perfect size.
