review/summary: My Hoover U5133-940 is a proreview/text: I have owned my Hoover U5133-940 bagged 12 amp vacuum cleaner for about 6 yrs now. I purchased it to replace a brand new whirlwind, baggless vacuum... I had the baggless one for about a week or so and although it cleaned the floor ok,I absolutely hated dumping the bin filled with all that dusty, dirty debris. Every time I dumped the canister all the insides would puff up into the air that I breathe. Disgusting.After my second or third time I just could not do it again. I through out the brand new vacuum cleaner because it really made me ill to use.I went out to the store to buy a new vacuum.. Not having a whole lot of money I purchased a refurbished Hoover upright, bagged vacuum. It was the U5133-940. I took a chance. Thinking, hey, maybe this one is going to work for me.In the last 6 yrs it has worked out to be very efficient. It, did it for me. In the last 6 yrs I have owned 3 dogs, two of them at one time. This machine cleaned up like a charm behind them consistant with all that you hear about the best of the best cleaners out there.My Hoover is a pro.My Hoover is a real pro.
