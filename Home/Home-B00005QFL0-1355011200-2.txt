review/summary: Loved the Bread Maker!review/text: The only problem with the maker is that my family doesn't like the shape of the loaves. They are pretty picky though and I would buy this item again. I found that I can assemble ingredient packs in advance and just put everything in the machine when I'm ready to make my bread. If I use my own ingredients, instead of boxed mixes, a loaf of bread costs about $0.35 depending on the size I bake.
