review/summary: Best HEPA filter out there.review/text: I've owned an older version of this model for over 2 years. It works, it's easy to clean and maintain. If you pay attention to the filter light there's no reason you should have to buy replacement anything. Just open it up and vacuum the pre-filter. It's well designed and simple to use.It is a little noisy but there's no way to move that much air through a small space without creating noise. I prefer to think of it as an air filter and a white noise machine.Did I mention it works? Smoke, smells, particles, etc.I liked it so much I bought one for my office as well.
