review/summary: Good Percolator.review/text: This is an Amazon verified purchase, but made by my sister. I asked for this percolator as part of my birthday list.Not 20 minutes ago, I plugged it in. I want to make my comments while everything is fresh in my memory. I plugged the percolator in at 2:17pm and within 30 seconds I heard the sound of water being heated. The machine took 12 minutes to make my first batch, which incidentally tastes just fine.I was struck by the curious sounds it makes while working. For the first few minutes the sound is a slow breathing and moan likeThunk-Ooommmm Thunk-Ooommmm Thunk-Oommmm. This gradually gets faster and quieter as the brewing proceeds. I was also struck by the lackof visible steam from the spigot. One small annoyance is that there is no glass bubble on top to show percolation. I hadn't noticed that before.At about 11 minutes I noticed a small amount of steam and then at the 12 minute mark the red indicator light came on. Almost immediately the brewing stopped and the percolator became silent. I did not waste twenty seconds pouring the first cup. It was perfect!It's now 2:48pm and the machine has been on for about half an hour. I still have the red "It's Ready" light and it remains silent on the kitchen counter. A few quick observations:The cord is too short, about 2 feet. Zip-cord costs 5 cents a foot, they really should have included a 4 foot length. Also, I already mentioned the missing glass bubble on top, however since the percolator has a ready indicator light, which seems to work beautifully, I don't think this is much of an issue. Some filter papers were included but they are crude and not very useful. I went strait to filling the steel coffee-basket itself. It works fine. I notice this percolator is rated No.1 with Amazon customers. As for me, I think this coffee maker is a winner. Just keep in mind you will need to be near an outlet.I highly recommend this product to you coffee lovers.
