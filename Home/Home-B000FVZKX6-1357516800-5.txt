review/summary: Soft, warm sheetsreview/text: These sheets are so comfortable that the first night I slept on them, I had a dream that I wrote an Amazon review about how amazing they are. I rarely review, but had to add my $0.02 on this subject. We washed our sheets before using, and admittedly, there was A LOT of lint in the dryer. Somehow, washing made them even softer! I feel like I get a warm hug every time I get into bed now. Strongly recommend.
