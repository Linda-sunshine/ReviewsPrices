review/summary: Great multi-usereview/text: I like these Pyrex dishes a lot. The set comes in sizes that are very useful. The price couldn't be beat. The lids can be a bit difficult to fit, but once they are on, they work well in the refrigerator, oven, and freezer. I would buy these again, or as a gift.
