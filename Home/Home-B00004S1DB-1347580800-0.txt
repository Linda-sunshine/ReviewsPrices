review/summary: Eh....review/text: It's nice, has a lot of room to brew plenty of coffee. BUT the filter is not that strong, a few uses and it looks like it's been used for years. My biggest gripe is with the plastic bottom. When you wash it water gets in either through the sides or through the bottom and it's impossible to get/shake the water out. You can imagine the mold that would develop over time. Because of that, I returned it. Going to splurge for the real good stuff, a Frieling Coffee Press.
