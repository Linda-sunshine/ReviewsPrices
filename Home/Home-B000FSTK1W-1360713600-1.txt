review/summary: Worked great for three months then hangers snapped off the backreview/text: I loved this caddy for shampoo in my new tub. It only lasted about three months though before the plastic hangers broke off the back. I only had two small bottles of aveeno shampoo and cond and one bottle of body wash not a ton of weight. Not sure why it broke but you cannot replace the hangers just the adhesive apparently so i am disappointed.In my other bathroom I have just one of the 3m single hooks holding a standard metal caddy and it holds double the weight as this caddy and has been up over two years with no problems.The hangers on this small caddy are tiny plastic and not strong at all.
