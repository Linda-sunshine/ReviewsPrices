review/summary: Great little coffee makerreview/text: Bought this Mr. Coffee 4-cup coffeemaker for my husband for Father's Day. I drink Decaf and he likes regular coffee. It works great. Haven't had a single problem with it. It really only makes about 2 mugs of coffee, but that's all he drinks a day anyway. When I need to replace my 12 cup coffee maker, I'll buy a Mr. Coffee instead of my much more expensive Kitchen-Aid.
