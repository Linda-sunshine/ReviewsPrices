review/summary: None So Blindreview/text: If you're an adult, don't be put off by the classification of this book as a teen novel.Jonas lives in a controlled drab community without realizing it. Much of that which makes us human - choice, wonder, beauty, the appreciation of nature, community, family, pain, love, conflict, memory - has been stripped by choice from the members of the community to ensure peace, comfort, and sameness.At twelve, Jonas is chosen to receive the community's memory, and with it he experiences pain, pleasure, and love. His eyes are opened to the wonder of creation and life, which of course are denied the others. He gains wisdom, including horror at the dehumanized state of the community.The conclusion of the book is sometimes said to be ambiguous. For the unreflective or ununderstanding, their reactions to the conclusion probably will reflect their own lack of vision. For those who, like Jonas, have eyes to see (or "see beyond"), the conclusion fits perfectly.I'm told by an ex-teacher that The Giver is taught in the eighth grade. The edition I read (Dell Laurel-Leaf, 1992) includes a discussion guide. Some of the questions would help understanding, but they won't take the reader to the deepest level.
