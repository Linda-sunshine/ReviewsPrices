review/summary: Sharpens my Cutco Knives perfectlyreview/text: Not the serrated ones, of course, but my paring and French Chef knives great. I've had other sharpeners and my wife was never happy with the edge, they never cut like they did when they were new. I got this sharpener and on the first sharpening, she said she thought she was going to cut through the cutting board. So, I'd say it puts a nice, clean edge on the knives. We're not professional chefs, but we cook every night, so having sharp knives is quite nice. I have no complaints.
