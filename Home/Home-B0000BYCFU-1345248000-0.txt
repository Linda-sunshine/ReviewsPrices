review/summary: Love itreview/text: This was pretty easy to use, even for a first-time canner like myself. As long as you follow the directions, you should be fine. I felt a lot better about food safety using a pressure canner instead of a water bath system, although this canner can be used either way. I haven't tried out the pressure cooking options yet, but it's next on my list.
