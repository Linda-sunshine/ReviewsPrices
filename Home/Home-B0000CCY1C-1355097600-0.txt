review/summary: Best cookie scoopsreview/text: I have used these cookie scoops for a few years now. Not just for Christmas cookies. Also, I use the large size one to scoop muffin dough to make uniform muffins. The handles are easy to use, I have arthritis and I find this very handy. If you spray the inside with cooking spray the dough slides right out onto the pan.I own all three sizes and they make my baking easier. I would love to have another small size one for holiday baking. It would make my baking go much faster if I had the extra scoop for a helper to use. In my opinion, these cookie scoops are a "must have" for the baker.
