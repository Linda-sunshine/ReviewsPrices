review/summary: They are ok.review/text: Pro:Has not pilled yet after soaking and washing 2-3 times, no sign of tear.Stays cool from body heat. (important for summer!)ThickFitted sheet stays in place for my Full mattress, and I toss and turn alot!Con:Feels rough, like paper towel, especially the pillow case. Not as soft as I imagined even after using Fabric softener soaking.Amazon maybe you can tell Pinzon not to put so much starch (or whatever they put on them) in these sheets? That's really the only complaint about them.Hopefully they get better with time. Only had them for a week or two.
