review/summary: arrived brokenreview/text: this is actually an OK product overall. but it arrived with one of the ergonomic control levers broken off, and it wasn't as if it had broken off while in transit. if it had, the part which fell off would have been somewhere in the box. no, this lever had broken off, and some person had decided to pack the chair up and sell it anyway. and that's the chair I got.shipping it back is too much of a hassle, but obviously I'd recommend you skip this and find a chair made by people who have standards and self-respect.
