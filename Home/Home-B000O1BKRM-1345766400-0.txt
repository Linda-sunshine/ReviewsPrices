review/summary: Perfect for freezing homemade baby foodreview/text: I bought these when I made the decision to make my son's baby food, because I figured it would be easier to remove the food after it was frozen with a flexible ice cube tray rather than a rigid one. So far, they've been great. The only complaint I have, which wouldn't be a problem for someone using them to make ice cubes, is that they are rather hard to clean. All in all, I would purchase these again.
