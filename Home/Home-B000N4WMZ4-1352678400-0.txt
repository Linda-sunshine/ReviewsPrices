review/summary: Don't buy thisreview/text: I've had this item a little less than a year. I also bought a smaller pot and a frying pan at the same time. All around the lid and the tops of both the pots and the pan rusted within weeks as they are not coated in that spot. I've been rubbing them with olive oil. The outside of all of the pots have chipped, and I am super gentle with them. I do not store them in a drawer or cupboard but one on each burner of my stove, so they do not hit against anything. No idea how they chipped, but they certainly did it easily.Today I was cooking chilli and had some oil, onions, celery and carrots going at a low heat to start it out. Suddenly I heard a loud POP! I looked inside the pot and I had a large, quarter-sized chip in the enamel. Had to throw out my food.I guess I cannot use this pot anymore? I seriously used it only a few times per month, so perhaps 12 times total. Waste of money. Not sure how/ if I will get my cash back. I heard they are a nightmare to deal with on returns.
