review/summary: Great juicer, but mesh filter piece is hard to cleanreview/text: I bought this for my mother, and it's SO powerful, quick and simple to use... It's easy to assemble, the pulp clears out without hassle, and the juicer comes apart easily, so you can put the pieces right in the dishwasher afterward.The ONLY disappointment I experienced with this juicer is in regard to cleaning the mesh filter piece: Even after using the brush that came with it, and rinsing the piece off really well with the warm water from the faucet sprayer prior to putting it in the dishwasher, there were clearly still veggie pieces left behind in the seams whenever it came out of the dishwasher. Because she lives in a place with a warmer, humid climate, I'm just concerned about it getting moldy.(If there are any suggestions for better ways to clean it, please add a comment to share the info!)
