review/summary: Powerful, big and heavy, unwieldyreview/text: This vacuum is a handheld on steroids - even the cord is one of those thick heavy ones you find on outside extension cords (though this is two-pronged). Powerful but heavy and a bit loud. If you are looking for industrial strength suction this is the one, if you are looking for a typical handheld, it is not. And insofar as doing draperies and anything vertical, you better have very good upper body strength cause it gets heavy and unwieldy very fast. Not to be sexist, but I think most women would find it hard to handle doing anything vertical with it ( I did). Only have had it for a few days so can't comment on durability. Worth the money if you specially want a heavy-duty model.
