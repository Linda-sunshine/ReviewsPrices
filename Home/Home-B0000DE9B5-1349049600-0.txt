review/summary: Nice Fridge Door Pitcherreview/text: Pros: Fits perfectly in my fridge door = easy access and no wasted space. Glass is great. Opening large enough for easy cleaning. Holds 2 liters (~1/2 gal).Cons: Wish came in larger sizes. Spout too small - have to hold glass right up to side of pitcher to pour. It would be nice if the lid could be partially loosened for pouring. As it is, you have to fully loosen the lid, and then remove or hold it in place with one hand, otherwise it falls off.
