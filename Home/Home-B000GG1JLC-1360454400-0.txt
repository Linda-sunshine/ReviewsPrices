review/summary: Just what I needed!review/text: I purchased this product since I needed something simple and convenient to hang my bras after I wash them. I was tired of hanging them on doorknobs and thought this would work. It certainly does the job and because it's made of plastic, I don't have to worry about rusting from metal. It comes in a flat padded envelope and it comes as two pieces that you snap together. The part that you hang your piece on spins wonderfully and that is a plus. Yes, it does come from I believe Hong Kong and you will have to wait for delivery and for me that was not an issue. Neatly packaged and if I find any other purpose for this, I will most definitely buy again. Thanks!
