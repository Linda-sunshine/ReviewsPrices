review/summary: Exellent Buyreview/text: I have just received my Breville and it was beyond better than I thought it would be. This is my third juicer I have owned and it is the best of all of them and for the price it is a deal. I always do research on a product before I purchase something and this was a juicer that was highly recommended and I can see why. The pulp is fluffy dry and this thing is poweful! I have shoved all kinds of vegetables and fruit through this in the short time I have owned it and it was great. It is not complicated to use those of you new to juicing and cleaning it up isn't that bad either. Althought the screen for the pulp takes the longest to clean since I do not own a dishwasher. I would definitly recommend this to anyone. Its great.
