review/summary: Love this air mattressreview/text: Bought this air mattress for an extra room when my Mom came to visit. It inflates and deflates quickly. It holds its air well too. We've left it inflated for months and it is still full of air. The mattress is really comfortable. Sometimes when I can't sleep at night I go to the spare room, and fall asleep immediately on this air mattress. It's nice to have an air mattress where you don't wake up on the floor surrounded by a deflated mattress.
