review/summary: Trusty coffee grinderreview/text: I bought this as a Christmas present for my dad after using it for a semester at school, where my three roommates and I grind and brew coffee almost every day in a Moka Pot stovetop espresso maker. It has been a trusty little grinder, requires little to no cleaning, and has been used for both coffee beans and spices.
