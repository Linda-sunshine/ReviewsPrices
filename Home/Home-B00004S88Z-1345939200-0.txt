review/summary: Great American Made Productreview/text: I have used my canner a number of times. It took a few times to get it right. You have to get the top even and then you have to turn the locks down very tight. I am using the canner on a glass top stove and so far, so good. I suggest you learn to use your new canner without anything but water in it. This is the kind of thing you can hand down to your children, very well made. If you are looking for a new canner, this is the one.
