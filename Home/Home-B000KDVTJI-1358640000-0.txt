review/summary: NO CHEMICLE TASTE!review/text: Finally a kettle that just boils water without imparting a flavor! I've been through a few which impart a terrible chemical flavor. Also, make sure the lid is properly closed or else it will boil forever without automatically clicking off :)Definitely worth the buy...
