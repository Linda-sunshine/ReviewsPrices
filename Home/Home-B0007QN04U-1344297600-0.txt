review/summary: Weaksaucereview/text: Very noisy. Do not buy if you live in an apartment. It gets way too hot, much hotter than my old Kitchen-Aid from the 80s. I "upgraded" to the bigger bowl and find the lack of power disappointing. Seriously, though, I cannot begin to describe how this thing moans and screeches even when under no stress. Welcome to the 21st century, people, where junk reigns supreme over quality and durability.UPDATE: The POS is done. Shipping her back tomorrow and intend to get a full refund.
