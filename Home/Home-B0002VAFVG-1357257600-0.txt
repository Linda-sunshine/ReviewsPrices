review/summary: I love this juicer!review/text: I received the Breville Juice Fountain Elite as a Christmas gift from my husband. This is my first experience using a juicer, but it's something I'd always wanted to try.So far, it has been fantastic! It's easy to put together, extracts a lot of juice and is easy to clean. The opening is large enough to feed larger pieces of fruits and veggies, which means less time cutting and preparing.The motor has two speeds, but I rarely have to put it on the high setting.When I'm done making juice, I dump the pulp in my compost container, rinse the parts off and place them on a mat on the counter to dry. You can also place some of the parts in the dishwasher, but I've been using it so much I find it's just easier to hand wash.I now crave juice more than coffee!
