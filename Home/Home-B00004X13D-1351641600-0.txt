review/summary: Waffle Up!review/text: My daughter recently married and did not receive a waffle iron during her showers. That meant she was always borrowing mine, so I decided to purchase her one of her own. The only problem with this waffle iron is that it make much better waffles than mine! :) Getting myself one. Highly recommend it!
