review/summary: Best Flannel EVER!review/text: I have had many sets of flannel sheets. My last bottom sheet wore out with a hole so I bought these. I wanted to find the thickest flannel and these are them. I have not found any other flannel that comes even close to this thickness. So soft and warm. I look forward to slipping into bed between these wonderful sheets. The color is darker then the picture. It's a nice brown mustard color that went perfect in my bedroom. I also have the 190 flannel duvet cover in Sage and love it as well. If you are looking for the best flannel that is soft and warm, and will last a long time, this is it! Washes very well. Not excessive lint in the dryer screen. Also, they don't need ironing. They come out of the dryer almost wrinkle free.
