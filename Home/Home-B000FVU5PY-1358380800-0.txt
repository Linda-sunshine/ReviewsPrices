review/summary: Beautiful sheetsreview/text: I got the blue sheets, and I was gasping as I took them out of the packaging. It's a beautiful color, and the sheen is perfect; not too shiny, but just a hint of silkiness. They are quite starchy at first, but I've bought these sheets before in another color and they soften up after a few washes. I've also read that if you wash them with baking soda, they soften up faster.The only real issue I have with these sheets is that if you put them in the dryer with a full load, they get twisted up and end up with a ton of creases, enough that it makes the sheets uncomfortable for the first few nights. These wrinkled right up on the first wash, and I ended up ironing them because it drives me so crazy. They don't iron well enough that you can't see the wrinkles anymore, but it loosens them up enough that they're comfortable to sleep in. To avoid this problem, make sure you don't load the dryer more than half full.
