review/summary: Great little heaterreview/text: Bought one, then a second....then two more a third time for the office. Love the 400/800 watt usage..each bar is 400 watts. Absolute silence, great pick up heat for drafty locations. Instead of having the thermostat set at 75 to stay warm in drafty locations, just turn down the thermostat to 68-70 and let these little heaters keep your immediate area toasty. I leave these on at the 400 watt setting, even at night....just keeps the area warm all the time. You could keep four of these going on the 400 watt setting in four various locations of your home or office and it would be the apx the same wattage as one 1500 watt heater (1600 vs 1500). There is no thermostat on these units but I rather like that, just turn on and adjust heat with main thermostat. I "marked" mine with black, blue and red markers just so it's easier to tell the heat setting. Also colored the white "arrow" black so it is easier to read. Don't know why the company doesn't address this. Even so a Big 5 Stars from me.!!!...don't know how long they last, but if they last for years, don't know how you can beat'em.
