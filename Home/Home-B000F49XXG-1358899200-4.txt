review/summary: very low quality and a bad designreview/text: I didn't get far enough to actually make espresso with the machine. Opening the box, I found that the handle on the water reservoir is cracked and non-functional.I decided to run some water through it to see the basic functionality. The machine vibrates so much that the cups rattle out of the way of the water (or espresso) output by the machine, so the water (or expresso) runs into the drain instead of the cup.Also, the machine is smaller than I expected. With the metal plate in place, you need expresso cups no larger than a shot glass to receive the coffee. As far as I can see, it's not just low quality, it's also a bad design.
