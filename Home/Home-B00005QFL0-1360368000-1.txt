review/summary: Makes Great Breadreview/text: I was a little skeptical about the claims for this bread machine but after using it a few times, I am more than pleased with the price I paid. The recipes for the different sized loaves was a little hard to decipher at the beginning but after the first loaf I began to understand it.One feature that I like about this machine is that when you hit the start button the machine does not immediately turn on and start mixing the ingredients. Everything in the bucket has to come to the proper temperature before the yeast is released into the container. Depending on where you live, it may take up to an hour before the mixing begins.Good product. I would buy this one again before I spent more money on the leading Japanese models.
