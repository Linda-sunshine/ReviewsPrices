review/summary: Amazling little toolreview/text: Simply works great. Sturdy, exceptional quality material, secure suction base, very easy to assemble for quick use and to disassemble for quick cleaning. The most positive thing I appreciated is the fact that the cup where you place and grind the food is transparent. To me, it is important when cleaning to be able to actually see inside where the food was grounded and assure no residues are left on parts surfaces assuring safe, sterile cleaning.
