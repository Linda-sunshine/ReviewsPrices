review/summary: Messyreview/text: This is my first juicer purchase and I won't complain too much. I do like juicing, however the clean up is a chore in itself. I use a plastic bag to put in the pulp catcher to cut down on clean up time. The tasking part for me is cleaning the actual filter that cuts up the fruit/veggie. I soak it in scolding hot water and then go clean it but the pulp is still difficult to clean off of it.If anyone has suggestions on how to properly clean this unit, it would be greatly appreciated.
