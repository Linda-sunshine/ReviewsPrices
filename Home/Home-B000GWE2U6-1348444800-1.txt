review/summary: Hazardreview/text: I originally purchased this so my frogs could have consistent humidity while I am at work and school. After a month of using this like a charm it stopped working properly and became quite a hazard. There are several reasons why it could have stopped working, but the main giveaway was the toxic smell of the inside parts frying. I noticed when I turned it on that the fog has been coming out from the bottom instead of the top. When I unscrewed the bottom to take a look inside everything was corroded. When I tried to reassemble it the screws where impossible to get back in.I am debating if I should have a crap product replaced with $15 shipping or recreate my own bludgeoning scene from Office Space.was it work the money I paid for? Absolutely not. personally, I am done buying from Amazon.
