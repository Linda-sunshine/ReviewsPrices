review/summary: more akin to total horse manure..........can't give the product zero starsreview/text: at least horse manure will help a garden grow bought this machine to help my new dog calm down when I need to leave him in his crate and leave the house. The AC adapter will not fit into its slot. When I add batteries and try and turn on sounds or the radio, nothing comes through the speaker.When you call and ask for customer support they ask for the model and serial number of the unit but this information is in raised plastic on the bottom of the unit. The frustrating thing is the company will not pay the costs of shipping the product back for servicing and the cost is just more money that I will pay from something that is defective from the start
