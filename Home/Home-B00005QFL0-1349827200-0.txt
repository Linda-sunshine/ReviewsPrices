review/summary: Love the choicesreview/text: I particularly like being able to make either a small (1 person) loaf of bread of a large (family size) loaf of bread. I have a need for large and small loaves and this bread maker is perfect. I have made the rolls and pizza dough also - they were both a hit.Very easy to use and with all the multiple of choices of loaf size, crust type, etc. it fits the bill.Worthwhile purchase and arrived in perfect condition.
