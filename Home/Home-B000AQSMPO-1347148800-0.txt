review/summary: If you are going to buy a kuerig buy this onereview/text: I love this thing. I know it isn't "green" but the B60 has replaced the coffee maker in our house unless we are having guests, then we break out the Zourishi. I saw a couple reviews saying it wasn't durable but we use the crap out of ours (at least 5-6 K cups a day) and it is a trooper. If you are thinking which model to get this is one (see my review of the B130 as to why you should pass on that)
