review/summary: I love this panreview/text: With all of your help and some of youtube's help I thought possibly I could season this right and I was able to! Thanks so much for all of your tips. I think I have used this every day since I got it for one thing or another. It's my first cast iron and just seems to cook better than my other pans. I bought it to use for the Artisan bread in the oven at high temp. and it works great for that too. It's plenty big for those small loaves, and much more economical than a pizza stone for that purpose. It's lighter weight too which is a plus for me. I also want to make tortillas and even small pizzas with it since it can take the high temps. It has been perfect for everything I've done so far and so easy to clean too. It gets 5 stars from me!
