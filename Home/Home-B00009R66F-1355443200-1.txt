review/summary: Worked Wellreview/text: I bought this to clean the traffic areas of only two rooms. I used it once and it removed a surprising amount of dirt. It was very easy to use and to clean up afterward. I thought it did a good job of sucking up the water from the carpet. I personally had a few questions while trying to put it together. I took it to my local small business store owner and he did it very quickly for no charge.
