review/summary: Ideal Storage Sets for Asian Spicy Foodreview/text: Earlier, I used Rubbermaid plastic containers. The plastic containers looked good initially but within few days of use, the surface became rough partially and it absorbed stain. The stains remained permanent on the surface and the plastic containers looked horrible. We cook Asian food with lot of spices. The spices generally have a higher tendency to stain the plastic containers.I have been using Pyrex glass storage sets for a while (several months) and I absolutely love it. We use these to store left over food in the fridge. We have no issues in heating the food in the microwave or in cleaning these in the dishwasher (lids in the top rack only). We have also used these sets for storing food in the freezer without any issues. These are easy to stack, hence it takes up less space in the cabinet when not in use. The Pyrex glass sets have no issues w.r.t. stain. These sets seems to retain the good appearance even after several months of use. Right now, we are using only these sets for storing food. I would definitely recommend these to my friends.NOTE 1: While heating the food in the microwave, the glass storage set gets really hot. Hence, pay attention while taking it from the microwave. Using a paper towel or cloth would solve this problem.NOTE 2: Some have complained about lid being too hard to fit or close. I haven't had any such issues. IMHO, it is quite easy to figure out how to close after trying a couple of times initially. Pyrex made a tight-fit lid to prevent possible leakage.
