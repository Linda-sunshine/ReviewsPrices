review/summary: Great Buyreview/text: Until we bought this electric opener we had been using the hand crank kind (from the simplest to the elaborate). Half the time they worked and the other half they chewed up the cork. Nothing worst than drinking bites of cork with your wine. And each required effort and a special touch. The Oster elimates chewed up corks and provides ease of operation. Place it on the top of the wine bottle neck (make sure you grip the base of the bottle or it will turn with the opener) push a botton and the cork is extracted quickly and efficiently. Once out reverse the botton and the cork is released from the opener. Simply, fast and clean. My single complaint is that it makes noise . . . not a lot . . . I just like my devices to work quietly. Go ahead and buy it.
