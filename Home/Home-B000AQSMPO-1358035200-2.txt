review/summary: Keurig Special Additionreview/text: They never spoke about the water FILTER system this one came with. I do not care about a filter system - I would just use distilled water. I will not use it - don't want the expense of buying filters. It did NOT come with a reusable basket for using my own coffee.I would rather have the reusable basket than a water filter.
