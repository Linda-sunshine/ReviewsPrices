review/summary: defective productreview/text: I got an Aroma Kettle about a month ago. It was working just fine for the first couple days but then it started leaking. A small rusty area occurred on the front side of the kettle. I returned the device and didn't ask for a replacement. I didn't want to get the risk o getting another defective product.
