review/summary: for delicate hands -review/text: A size smaller than a Braun. It takes some time to get used to ,especially to the short coiled up cord.Once you get the drill it works fine, does to coffee beans exactly what is expected. Too soon to know about longevity or not.Because it is of a small caliber, it grinds just enough for 2 cups of coffee.
