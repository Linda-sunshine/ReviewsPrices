review/summary: Best Coffeemakerreview/text: I have thoroughly enjoyed this product for over 2 years. It works as promised. We had the smaller version before this one for over a year, but wanted to have the following abilities that the smaller version lacked:Brew into a larger mugChange the temperature for a hotter cup of coffeeStorage of water for more than one cupWe always use filtered water. Keurig states that sometimes you may need to clean out the machine due to buildup, but with filtered water, we have never had any problems. The machine works flawlessly.The coffee is as good as the K-Cups you buy. Some I have tried have been great, others are not quite as good. I also have the reusable filter so that I can add my own fresh-ground coffee if I am feeling up to it.
