review/summary: Works Very Well - Highly Recommendedreview/text: This Brita "Slim Pitcher" does a great job making nasty municipal tap water actually taste good. My daughter goes to college in a city that has some of the worst tasting water imaginable, which is unfortunate since she drinks a lot of tea and 4C drink mixes. Rather than have her buy bottled water, we decided to to give this filter pitcher a try.Setting up the pitcher is fairly straight forward, but you really do need to follow the directions and soak the new filter for 15 minutes in cold water and then run two or three full pitchers of water through and discard the water (use for plants perhaps). According to the directions, the pitcher will be ready to use for forty gallons or for two months but we haven't had to change ours yet. This we did buyBrita 42432 Pitcher Replacement Filters, 4-Packfor when the included one needs replacing. Using the filter is easy enough and a full pitcher can be filtered in about 5 minutes or so. The pitcher itself is good quality and fits nicely in the small dorm-room fridge.My only issue would be the pitcher size since it would not be big enough for our full family, but it is just the right size for one person.Highly Recommended!CFH
