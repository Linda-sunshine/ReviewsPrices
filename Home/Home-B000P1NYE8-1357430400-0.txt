review/summary: prod reviewreview/text: This scale seamed to be accurate the one time I used it. And right before I used it I dropped it on a hard floor pretty hard, right on the corner. I was sure I broke it. But it works fine and is still accurate as far as I know. easy to use. But I especially like that the instructions are just inside the cover/tray with a smooth label. So you will always remember how to use it if the need arises.
