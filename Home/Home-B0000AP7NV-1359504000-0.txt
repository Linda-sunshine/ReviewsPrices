review/summary: hello?review/text: OK here's a tip. When filtering water, put the top with the filter sideways, so it sits on the pitcher but the filter is not in it. Filter a whole pitcher and bottle it. More water to store. Also, keep the filter wet!! That will stop the carbon granules from getting in the water. But it works great regardless. Just use that tip to get more water at a time.
