review/summary: Great Coffee Grinderreview/text: I have had my Krups Coffee Grinder for almost a year and I use the item about 2-5 times a week. It is very easy to use and clean out after using. Very compact and easy to store in my cabinet. I really enjoy the taste of freshness of being able to grind my coffee when I want to. I use this product with my french press and I rarely use my coffee maker to make coffee nowadays. I have not had any mechanical problems or issues with the grinder since purchase.
