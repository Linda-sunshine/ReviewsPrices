review/summary: Big Mouth Juicer crowd pleaserreview/text: I researched reviews of juicers in the lower price bracket. I have had several juicers in the past so I can compare. This rated as the number 2 juicer on Consumer reports. The number 1 was priced at $200 +... I am on a budget and did not want to spend more than $100 on a juicer. I am pleased to say that this juicer works great and I have been able to juice vegetables like Kale and get a decent/good amount of juice. This is my second one as I bought one for a friend and they love it also! For $59 and large amount of juice, mainly dry pulp. I feel this was a great value..
