review/summary: Best Microwave Cookwarereview/text: I have had mostly bad experiences with microwave cookware over the years, but I can say with all honesty, this simple egg cooker is beyond my expectation. I love it and can't see making my hard boiled eggs any other way. Great product. Priced right. It simply doesn't get better than this!
