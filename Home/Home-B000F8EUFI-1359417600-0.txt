review/summary: A Little Hard to Pushreview/text: Previous to this little guy, I have a Shark Navigator. After than busted, I decided not to buy another expensive vacuum. For the price, it does everything it needs to and then some. My only complaint is that the brush roll is not automatic (or at least doesn't feel like it). I'm not a weakling, but it took a bit of getting used to after my Shark.
