review/summary: Grinds coffee well, but there are quality control problems with the lidreview/text: I have no qualms about the grinding capabilities of this machine. It does its job adequately. The grind is fairly even, it works pretty fast, the motor is relatively quiet, and we don't have problems with static buildup that you see in some coffee grinders.However, the lid is just slightly too big for the grinding chamber. You must push down hard on the lid to get a snug fit (which is required to run the blades). Taking the lid off is worse--you must jiggle it back and forth while pulling relatively hard. When the lid does come free, it often goes very quickly, resulting in scattered coffee grounds all over the floor. We have tried cleaning the lid and the chamber thoroughly before and after each use, and, although this helps, it does not solve the problem.I am hoping that repeated use will wear down the plastic a bit, which should make taking off and replacing the lid a tad easier.
