review/summary: It works! Really Well!!review/text: Let's keep it simple: if you're looking for a hand-held vacuum, buy this. Don't waste your money on other junk; we've all made that mistake. It's light, very powerful, has a long cord, rotating brushes, and a handy tube for vacuuming between pillows, small spaces, etc. Did I mention it's powerful? If you live in a place with hardwood floors, but still need the occasional vac, this should be a no-brainer especially for the price.
