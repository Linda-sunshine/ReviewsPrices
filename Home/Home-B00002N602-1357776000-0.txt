review/summary: I'm a convertreview/text: I always avoided pressure cookers until a little over a year ago. I purchased the Presto 6-quart electric version. I love it, but it is annoying to have to drag it out when I wanted to use it. I saw this smaller size stove-top variety and hoped it would be as good as the electric. It's better! I never put it away because it has become my go-to pan whether or not I'm using the pressure cooking feature. It's a good weight, great heat distribution, NOT aluminium, and sturdy. As a pressure cooker, I find that I can turn the heat on my stove to between 2 and 3 and it works beautifully. From using the other pressure cooker once or twice a month, I find I use this one three-four times a week. Minor issue - yes - the screws do rust. One of these days, I'll take one to Home Depot so I can get a non-rusting version.
