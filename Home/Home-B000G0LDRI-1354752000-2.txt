review/summary: Lots of output but not as quiet as I expectedreview/text: We have a 2,400 sq ft home, this unit will do the job but you would not want it next to you in a living room or bedroom. We found a good spot that the noise generated from it will not affect us. Other than the noise, this is a super unit. It is very easy to fill and they made the unit easy to move around with it's castors.
