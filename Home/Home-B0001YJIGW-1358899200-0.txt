review/summary: Would be amazing if it stuck to the side of the tub.review/text: I have used this item with two different bath tubs. The suction will stick to one but not fully to another. The issue seems to be the tub material, rather than the contour of the tub. That said, when it works, I love the thing! Sometimes, I just press the better bath suction cups down while the water is filling over that area. The pressure from the water will often increase the suction. Having those precious extra inches of water makes a difference in my baths.
