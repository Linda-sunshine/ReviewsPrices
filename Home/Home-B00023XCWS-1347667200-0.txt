review/summary: Great little kettle for work!review/text: I bought this kettle for work - I wanted something cheap with auto-shut-off. This kettle is great! Its easy to use and fits perfectly on my desk! The cord is super short, but that doesn't bother me, as I have a plug right on my desk. I was worried about the plastic taste some people wrote about, but didn't experience this - even on the first pot. This is going to be a great little kettle for the winter!
