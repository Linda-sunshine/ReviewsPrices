review/summary: Excellent!review/text: I just love this juicer and use it every day. I can't imagine why anyone would care if it is made of plastic or chrome on the outside just as long as it works well and looks good. The working components are sturdy and easy to clean and assemble. It also makes pasta very easily. I don't know how I lived without it before.
