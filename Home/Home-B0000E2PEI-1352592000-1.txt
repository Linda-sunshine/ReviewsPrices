review/summary: Very happy with Taylor 7506 Glass and Chrome Digital Scalereview/text: All scales should be designed like this one. The surface is completely smooth making cleaning a zero effort.But note, the Taylor 7506 Glass and Chrome Digital Scale comes with warnings to not drop or jar so it may not be good for younger family members. Also, instructions state it should be used on flat, smooth surface, and not carpet.
