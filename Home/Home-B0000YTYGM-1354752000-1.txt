review/summary: Great while it lastedreview/text: This is our 3rd Cuisinart coffee pot. We think they make a great cup of coffee. We heeded previous dire warnings about getting the lid on correctly and have not had any trouble brewing coffee. Unfortunately, after only 2 months of use, the coffee pot quit today. I called Cuisinart and ran through the trouble shooting strategies (unplug for 1 hour to reset to factory settings and run a 50/50 mixture of water and vinegar through the pot). Neither strategy worked. Because it's past 30 days from purchase, I can't return it or exchange it with Amazon (probably the biggest downside to shopping with them) and have to go through the warranty program at Cuisinart. They are willing to replace it but I have to pay $10 to ship a new one to me and another $10 to ship the defective one back. In reality, I"m nearly buying another pot. Besides the fact that a coffee pot should last longer than 60 days, my biggest frustration is Amazon not helping me in this situation.
