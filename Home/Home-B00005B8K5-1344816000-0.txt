review/summary: They're smaller than they seem to appear on the picturereview/text: I usually cook more food than needed for the day so I freeze a lot of leftovers. Since glass seem to be a better alternative to plastic, I tried these. They're ok but the 2 rectangular ones are pretty tiny. I expected them to be at least twice their size, but, no they're small. And yeah, they're not made for baking...so they're mainly for storage purposes only. I think it's better to buy from Walmart since you can see the actual size of what you're buying.
