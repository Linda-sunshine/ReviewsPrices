review/summary: Really disappointedreview/text: Terribly noisy. I read some of the 1-star reviews here and thought maybe people were exaggerating or overly sensitive to noise. They aren't. You can't sleep with this thing on, which was a dealbreaker since I primarily wanted it to help me stop waking up with puffy eyes and a stuffy nose.
