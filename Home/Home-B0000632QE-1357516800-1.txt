review/summary: Amazing slicerreview/text: Easy to use, relatively easy to clean, extremely sharp. 2 years after purchase it still cuts anything I throw at it. It is stained, mostly from carrots, probably my fault for letting it sit a bit at some point over the years, but I haven't had any issues with it. Just watch your fingers, I'm grateful I've yet to have an incident.
