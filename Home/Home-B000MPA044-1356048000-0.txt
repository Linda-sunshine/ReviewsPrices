review/summary: Love it!review/text: I love this thing. I've never had a pressure cooker before but now I can't see myself being without. I originally got this unit for some light canning. I can't necessarily recommend it for that because, depending on your location and the foods you wish to can, it may not provide enough pressure to can all foods safely.. but it does for my location. It will also work in most locations if you're not doing low acid foods.Having said that, you can cook just about anything in here. I use it for things like rice, beans, quinoa, squash, pumpkin, etc. It is super speedy. For some foods like beans that you would otherwise normally buy in a can, it's awesome to be able to make straight beans with no added salt. It is also very fast. Dry unsoaked beans don't take much more than a half hour.The best part is, you can set it and walk away. The unit comes up to pressure, holds it according to the timer, and releases naturally. If you want a speedier release, you can use the valve.
