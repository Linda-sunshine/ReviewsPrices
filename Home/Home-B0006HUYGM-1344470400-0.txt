review/summary: Pretty Darn Good Little Vacuumreview/text: I wanted to get something dustbuster-esque, but with enough staying power to last beyond one use, especially with kids about the house. At first I was skeptical about getting a hand-held vacuum with a cord, but I'm a convert after purchasing this one. It's easy to use, does what it's supposed to do, and the cord stretches far enough to go from an outlet near the interior door of my garage to the back of my car to clean up interior messes with plenty cord to spare.Now, it does have some limitations. I found it doesn't really want to pull up all of the bits o' dried up grass or whatever left behind in the carpeted trunk space of my car from transporting folding chairs and sports equipment to and from the kids' sporting events, but that's a minor quibble for me (and may have to do with carpet texture of my particular trunk more than anything). More OCD folks might find it irritating.Also, should your 4-year-old spill an entire box of Lucky Charms on his bedroom floor in an attempt to eat all of the marshmallows and skip the cereal part, don't expect to be able to suck the cereal pieces up all at once with without clogging the hose. Should your 4-year-old create a similar mess, your best bet with this vacuum is to suck up the cereal about 2-3 pieces at a time, and empty the little bin about 1/3 of the way through clean up.All in all, I highly recommend this vacuum for spot clean-ups of dry spills, crumbs, etc., and for most car interior vacuuming jobs.
