review/summary: Poor Designreview/text: This coffee grinder is the worst grinder we have had. We use it for grinding coffee. The lid is a poor design -the grinds fall out when the lid is opened and the grinder does not have much power. There is no way to avoid making a mess.....not worth the purchase!!
