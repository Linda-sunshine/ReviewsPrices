review/summary: Best for my special dietreview/text: Since the doc says no salt, no sugar, I've been hard pressed to find canned goods that aren't loaded with preservatives or chemicals. With my discovery of pressure canning, I've since cooked large batches of low or no-salt recipes: beef stew, chicken soup, chili, salsa, mixed veggies, giardinera and grape jam. Once processed, I just leave them in my pantry and heat them up for a quick and fresh hearty meal instead of starting from scratch each time. I especially enjoyed the steampunk quality to the cooker with its latches, gauge and huffing and puffing on the stove!
