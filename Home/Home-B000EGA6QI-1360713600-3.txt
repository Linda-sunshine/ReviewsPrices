review/summary: Can't believe I didn't get this soonerreview/text: I hemmed and hawed for weeks if not months on whether I really *needed* an immersion blender. Now that I have it I don't know what I ever did before. It is a dream to use in soups - and does an unbelievable job on mashed potatoes. I can't believe such a small blender area does so much so fast. And it's super easy to clean.
