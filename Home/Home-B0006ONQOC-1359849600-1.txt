review/summary: Works great!review/text: This works really well. It makes really good ice cream! I'm not giving it 5 stars because when it is close to being done it sounds like the motor is working really hard and sometimes it will stop turning if it's really think. I don't have any other ice cream makers to compare it to, but it would be nice if it would keep churning a little more to make the ice cream fluffier and get more air in it so it wouldn't be as hard in the freezer.
