review/summary: Just what we wanted!review/text: We are very pleased with the Real Flame fuel for our log set. It provides us with a warm, realistic crackling fire with no odor or clean-up issues. Even though it is not marketed as a heat source, we have used it to warm our living room on a few chilly evenings. The listed estimate of burn time (three hours per can) is accurate, plus or minus a few minutes. I would have no reservations recommending this product to anyone with gel fuel application needs.
