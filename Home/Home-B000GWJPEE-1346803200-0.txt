review/summary: Cute, but not worth itreview/text: I actually purchased this in 2007 for my personal sinus issues. I used for maybe a year, until I saw how much better my boss's simple generic heated mister worked.The weak fan makes some noise, but the heated misters are absolutely quiet. The cool mist sink rapidly and I find it hard to believe it's moisturizing anything other than your carpet. You have to use distilled water or buy expensive tablets to easy the debris that accumulates in this tank. Speaking of the tank, it's awkward to unscrew the head, refill and reload. I have been much happier with the local drug store's generic hot air humidifiers for roughly $20, or this one I bought for my mother:Vicks 1.5 Gallon Vaporizer with Night-Light.If you need them to be cute for a child, then put stickers on it, I suppose.
