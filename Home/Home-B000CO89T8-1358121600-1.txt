review/summary: Works as promisedreview/text: It keeps drinks at a consistent temperature not scorching but slightly too hot for my tastes. Feel like I should give it a five star because I'd like it if it had maybe a slightly lower temp setting also, or an auto turn off feature...but it's keeping the five star because it's an affordable price and definitely worth the cost.
