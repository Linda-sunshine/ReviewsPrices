review/summary: So darn cute!review/text: This is so darn cute!!! It does a great job of humidifying my son's room. We were able to increase the humidity from 16% to 35% in one night. It used the full gallon in about 16 hours. It is a little tricky to fill because the tank is so tall (won't fit in our sink, so I use the tub), and it won't sit flat on the top due to the handle that is hidden under the penguin's head. I've gotten over that. I have had a problem with water condensing on the body of the penguin and running down the side. I have him sitting on a plate so that he won't harm any furniture, and that appears to be ok. One thing I wasn't expecting was that it came with a year's subscription to Parent's magazine. Bonus! :-) Overall: works great, and my son loves it!!
