review/summary: Pre-seasoned you say...not so much.review/text: If these are pre-seasoned, it must be a short season. After seasoning these myself, they operate far superior than when I first got them...them as in the two pans I purchased...this one and the 10-1/4&#34; skillet. 5-stars if they would have actually been fully seasoned. These things should have had a shine to them when opening them and perhaps wrapped in wax paper...not the case though.
