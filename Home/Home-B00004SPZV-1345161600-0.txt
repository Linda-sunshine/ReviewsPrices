review/summary: Works Great!review/text: The only thing I have used it for is Olive Oil at this point. I usually put one garlic clove in the bottle and fill it about have way full with olive oil. Works great for the grill, seasoning dishes or to cook with in my cast iron pan. Defiantly make sure you release the air pressure after using it but all the entails is unscrewing the cap. Some people complained about the nozzle clogging but I have not had that issue after about 6 months or of use about 2-3 times a week. I would just say wash it out with some hot water when you refill and you are gold. Nice little product to have especially if you use a lot of oils.
