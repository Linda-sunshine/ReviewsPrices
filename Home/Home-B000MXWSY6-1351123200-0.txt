review/summary: Sony ICF-C318 Clock Radio with Dual Alarm (Black)review/text: Nice alarm clock radio. Small compact size. I like the large numbers that you can dim. Easy to set and program 2 different alarm time settings. Radio sounds good and I get good reception with it. Big snooze button on the front top of the unit. Nothing real special about it. But, a decent alarm clock.
