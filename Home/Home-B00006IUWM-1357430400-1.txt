review/summary: Nice sharpenerreview/text: I bought this a Christmas gift for my husband. He used to sharpen his knives by hand with a sharpening stone. This is much faster and alot nicer. Once you get used to the positioning of the knife it is easy to use. All the knives are sharp now. I went by other comments about this one and I found them to be right. This is a great sharpener.
