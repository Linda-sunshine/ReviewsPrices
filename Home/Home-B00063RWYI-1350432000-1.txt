review/summary: I should have got these years ago, the are great!!review/text: I should have got these years ago, the are great!! Outstanding cookware built to last, quality casting, won't destroy your brain/memory after years of use as is the case with aluminum pots and pans - unless used as a direct blow LOL. To season simply warm up slowly with a little non-gmo vegetable oil (sunflower is generally non-gmo) and carefully spread the oil around the inside and outside of the pan with a paper kitchen towel while holding the pan with an oven glove. Off to write some very similar reviews for the other Lodge pans I just purchased. HIGHLY RECOMMEND these.
