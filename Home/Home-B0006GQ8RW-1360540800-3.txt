review/summary: Not as good as I used to got.review/text: From the package, I can't see any difference from this one and the one I used to got. But the water just does not tast as it used to be. After using it for 2 weeks, my water still smells carbon. And sometimes I even had to dump away my food after using the water for cooking. And I now using water directly from the tap, leaving those unused filters alone.
