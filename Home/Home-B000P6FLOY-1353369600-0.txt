review/summary: Used once and it broke.review/text: The buttons stick in the down position. The screen just stays on but doesn't allow you to select anything. A real lemon. Save your money. Get something else. I read a few reviews that said it wasn't good, but there were so many that were positive. Oh well, here's another negative!
