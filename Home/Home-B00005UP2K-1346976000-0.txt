review/summary: On My Wish List FOREVER!!!!!review/text: I have wanted one of these babies since I don't know when!! I love to bake and set right to using this mixer as soon as it was unpacked. It is everything I dreamed of; easy to use, efficient, easy to clean. Can't wait to get more attachments for it. I bought the silver grey model as it will match any kitchen color - a classic. Keeping it on my counter. The mixer was wrapped well and there were no issues with missing pieces, damage, etc. I love ordering from Amazon as they are always reliable. I would recomend this to anyone who bakes. Can't wait until Christmas when I do my huge cookie batches; this year it will be much easier.
