review/summary: Very attractive, makes good coffee, has a number of flaws...review/text: Bought this as a gift for my coffee addict of a boyfriend. He thinks the coffee tastes great, probably due to the charcoal water filter. However, as other reviewers have noted, this coffee maker has quite a few flaws. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this.1. Fingerprints - lots of them, and they're difficult to get/keep off2. The coffee grinds somehow get through the gold filter, so there's a fine layer of &#34;sludge&#34; at the bottom of the coffee. Gross!3. If you don't make sure to put the filter, etc, back in perfectly, the unit could possibly overflow4. You pour the water into the back right side, which is awkward, especially for lefties5. The unit takes up quite a bit of space on the counterIt does make good coffee and the auto shut off feature is great! I can't really comment as to the timer feature, as he never uses it.
