review/summary: Awesome, for a few months.review/text: It worked perfectly and very quietly for months, but then one day it just started making a terribly loud noise, and it never went away. I even opened it up and cleaned it/greased it. There's nothing I can do to fix it. I would love to buy another one but I'm afraid I'll end up regretting it in a few months like I did this one. Hopefully it was just a dud, if so then I recommend this.
