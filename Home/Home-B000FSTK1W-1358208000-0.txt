review/summary: A year later and I still love this large, sturdy caddy.review/text: I mounted this caddy OVER the pipe where the shower head is so it will accomodate my tall hubby. The tiles in the shower are not smooth, but the adhesive strips have held it well, even crammed full of giant sized bottles of soap and shampoo. I love 3M products.I wish it didn't look so white and plastic, but I value function over beauty, and for once my tub is not cluttered up with bottles. I also have the matching soap dish, mounted lower to accomodate me, which is holding smaller bath accessories.I made sure I gave the adhesive strips a day to set before loading up the caddy and soapdish.
