review/summary: Going strong since January 2011review/text: I've had several different food processors with an assortment of blades and all have been a pain to use for shredding, with unusable pieces either getting stuck on the top of the blade or large pieces falling over the side of the blade into the shredded food. I bought the salad shooter to use for grating cheese and carrots and have used it mainly for those two purposes. For lack of aggravation, great job, and ease of cleaning,this product deserves more than five stars. It's one of my favorite appliances. Only caveat is it's rather noisy, but I'm willing to put up with that for its positives. One interesting side note: The carrot leaves orange staining on the plastic, but the cheese cleans it off!
