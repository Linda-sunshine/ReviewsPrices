review/summary: inconsistent qualityreview/text: I bought one about half year ago for for my home use and it has been working (so far). So I decided to buy another for my office. After about one week of usage, it won't shut off after the water is boiled. This is not a big drawback since it sits at my desktop and I can monitor it all the time. But if you cannot monitor it, don't buy this one.another cosmetic issue: there is a filter near its mouth, just after a few uses, the filter won't stay in place.I am quite disappointed with the quality.
