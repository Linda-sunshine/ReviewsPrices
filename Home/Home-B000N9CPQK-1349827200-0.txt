review/summary: Not what was advertisedreview/text: I ordered a Honeywell HHT-011 with permanent HEPA filter but I received a modelHHT-016-MP with replaceable filters. This is not what I ordered. I had alreadyunpacked and assembled the unit before I realized it was not what I ordered.Also, it is not clear what, if anything the ionizer does. I can't see that itdoes anything but turn on a light.Very disappointed but will not go through the trouble of shipping it back. I'lljust not buy this brand or from this vendor again.
