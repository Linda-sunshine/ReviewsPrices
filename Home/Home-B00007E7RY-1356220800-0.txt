review/summary: Great little Air Purifierreview/text: This is my 1st air purifier, it does a great job of cleaning smoke, pet dander, odors, etc. But it is a little noisy when you use the highest speed, easy to clean the filter. I would recommend this to all of my friends, to clean households air quality up, once the initial cleaning is finished, using the highest speed, we turned ours down to the lower, more quiet running speed to maintain the cleaner air in the house, we've moved it around in the house's different rooms & cleaned any odors, smells out.
