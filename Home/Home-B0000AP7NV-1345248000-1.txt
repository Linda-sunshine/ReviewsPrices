review/summary: Filters the water quickly and fits right in my fridge!review/text: I bought this pitcher last week and it has been great so far! After months of buying gallons of water at the store I decided to just get a filtering pitcher. This pitcher filters very quickly. It is smaller than most pitchers so it easily fits into my fridge without taking up a lot of space. I got exactly what I ordered an it came quickly. I found the best price here on Amazon (about 30-40 percent off what I could find in the stores).I would definitely recommend this product!
