review/summary: Can't See Clock Numbers, Buttons Too Smallreview/text: This is terrible. The buttons are too small and the power button looks like all the other buttons so it is difficult to find. I bought this because I had been using the other Conair sound machine and thought this was a great idea that they added a clock, but the clock is useless because you have to be standing at just the right angle to see the numbers. So if you need your sound machine to have a night light, that is about all the clock is good for. I would recommend buying theConair SU1W Sound Therapy, Silverinstead of this one with the useless clock.
