review/summary: HAND CLEAN vs DISH WASHERreview/text: After reading some reviews, I feel this is an important piece to some of the failures of the mixer. In my instruction book (the one no one reads) On cleaning it stated DO NOT place in a dish washer, which is why mine failed after placing in the dish washer multiple times, the shaft on the blade end started to become harder to turn, thus when place together with the motor end placed greater stress on the junction between the two. (The plastic piece that strips/breaks) Causing it to break or fail. Not 100% sure if the rubber seals were effected or the metal shaft was effected in some way.Overall it was a excellent mixer, and if I just took the time to HAND CLEAN it, I'd still be using it today. Looking forward to trying this again.Just goes to show, taking a little extra time to take care of your kitchen tools they'll last longer, and read instructions - I did but was dumb and dismissed the hand wash line. Hope this helps all.
