review/summary: Best flannel sheets on the marketreview/text: This is my second set of these sheets. Bought the first set winter of 2012 and they held up to multiple washes... only bought this second pair because I didnt care for the original color that we bought. Did not pill. So soft! WOuld recommend this.
