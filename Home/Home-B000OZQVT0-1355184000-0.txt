review/summary: Not perfect...but still a great product!review/text: I have been using a ventless fireplace in our house for the last few years. I love the 'crackling' sound that these cans produce - it adds a great deal to the ambience factor. In addition, maintenance is very easy (i.e. remove the paper label, give the can a shake, pop the top, place in your fireplace insert, and light the can(s)!).Even though these are not primarily meant to be used as a heat source, I do have to say that they come in handy when our house loses power (as it did after Hurricane Sandy). The room that the fireplace is in is approximately 20 x 12 and having 3 cans lit (max amount that can be used in the insert) brought the temperature up about 4 to 5 degrees in the room.The only downside is that you can clearly detect an alcohol odor as the gel fuel in the can dwindles down - for me, I find that this happens after about 2 hours of use. On average, the cans will last 2.5 hours - however, keep in mind that the flame is very small in the last half hour or so.Overall, I love this product and recommend it to anyone who wants to add a little ambience to their room without installing a vented fireplace and wouldn't mind having a backup heat source in the house.
