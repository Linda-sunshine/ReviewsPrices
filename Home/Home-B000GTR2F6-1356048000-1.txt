review/summary: LOVE LOVE LOVE MY KEURIG B70review/text: I am soooooooooo happy with my Keurig...we bought it in Feb 2012 ...I was really worried about how long it would last after reading some of the reviews. Well we have had it for over 10 months...it is used daily and sometimes a few times a day. I am knocking on wood but we have not had ANY problems with it at all. Got a super price! Extremely pleased! I don't know what I would do without it :)
