review/summary: Simply amzingreview/text: I thought my previous Ginsu knife set was pretty good until I got this knife. You can easily cut thin pieces from this knife without much effort. Made in Switzerland. Note that the size is a bit on the large side. For this price, the quality and sharpness is top-notch.
