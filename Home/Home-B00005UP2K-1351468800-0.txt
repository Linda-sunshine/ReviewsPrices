review/summary: Not for whole wheat flourreview/text: I have been having trouble with my mixer's making a grinding sound ever since I used it for a double batch (8 cups flour) of whole wheat pizza dough. It sounds like it wants to quit every time I use it. It is out of warranty, so all Kitchenaid could do was tell me that the Artisan can only handle up to 6 cups of whole wheat flour (versus 9 of all-purpose). If I had known that before purchasing, I would have gotten a more powerful model. I had not seen the 6 cup whole wheat limit in the instructions, and the customer service rep found it for my on p.65 of the manual, along with a bread recipe.To me that is dirty pool, the whole wheat disticntion should be made clear in the product description.
