review/summary: It's the best!review/text: I've had this carpet cleaner for 1.5 years and used it three times, including the carpeted stairs. Of all the carpet shampooers I've tried over the years, this product works the best -- better than the Rug Doctor and better than the Kirby shampooer. It even does better job than the professionals I hired to come in and clean my carpet in the past for a whole lot of money.The directions are clear and it's easy to use. I love this product. I just hope it lasts for years.
