review/summary: the giverreview/text: What can I say, the book was well thought up. it seemed so real that is how wounderfuly written it was. i hope for a second book. the book is based on a time why after all of our genirations. were there is no war, color animals what so ever no pain or true feelings. That is all Jonas has ever known that is intell his twelvth year. when he is chossen to be the next reciver of every memory of time, color war love, loss, true emotions.
