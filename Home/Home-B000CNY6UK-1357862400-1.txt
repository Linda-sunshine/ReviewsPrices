review/summary: Works as Good as a Counter Coffee Makerreview/text: After 10 years, the coffeemaker died. I needed a replacement, but I wanted something small, compact, and not a monster like the old unit. It heats right up on the stove, rinses out easily, and is small enough to fit in a cabinet leaving the counter clutter free. The coffee also tastes the same as what was produced by the larger counter top unit.
