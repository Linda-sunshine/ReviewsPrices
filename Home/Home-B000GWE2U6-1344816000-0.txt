review/summary: Great for a year, then caught fire: WARNINGreview/text: Purchased the Crane humidifier - Cow (model ee-4140). It was quiet and worked great for the 1st year. But early this AM it started smoking -- luckily I noticed this before it became a fire, before it became a tragedy.I see many positive reviews for this product, but fire has been a problem reported since 2008 and 2009 and the company still has not remedied it because it's still happening. Crane is at best apathetic to this safety issue. Buyer beware.
