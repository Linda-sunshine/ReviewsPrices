review/summary: Love itreview/text: The Keurig B60 is a great coffee maker, easy and the choices of different coffees and teas are great. you can make a choice between 3 coffee cup sizes and adjust your brew strength that way.I bought my B60 special edition at Sam's club ($129.98). It included 36 K cups, the individual filter and to my surprise the water reservoir is 60 oz. It works great, always a fresh brew. you can set the timer for automatic turn off or stay on.I priced out the coffee K cups and (besides Sam's club)amazon has the best prices.
