review/summary: Good, Fragilereview/text: Pro-cheap-effective-easy-cord retractionCon-no size control-breakableI love great coffee from awesome local roasters, but god dammit, I hate using a french press. So, not being able to control the size is not a problem for me. This grinder is small, and the cord retraction isn't a pain in the ass. My only problem with it is that it keeps getting knocked over, and the lid keeps breaking. The top is flimsy. I mean... it's $10, so it isn't the biggest deal in the world. But, it would be nice if there was at least an easy way to replace the lids. Proctor Silex' website offers a replacement (I think, there's no picture so I'm not positive it's the top) for $8 but once the superglue gives out I'll just replace it with a grinder that has less thin plastic.
