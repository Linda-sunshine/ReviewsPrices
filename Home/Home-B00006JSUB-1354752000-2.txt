review/summary: terrible terrible pan!!!review/text: I bought this as a birthday gift on October 5,2012 and gave it to my friend as a present, they used it only 2 TIMES!! followed the exact thing it said to do before use and after. This is the worst pan I have ever used, everything sticks to it, it's a mess to clean and now I will probably have to just lose out on what I paid for it being it has been over the 30 days. Like I said it was a gift so I didn't give it to the person right away and so it was used just recently. I will contact Amazon on this but, it sounds as if they won't help anyone that has had these lousy pans. I read the reviews and it made it sounds ad if these pans were great and I thought with that many good reviews it has to be a good pan.WRONG!!!! I also read that some people contacted the company and it was just their tough luck from what others had posted. I have bought a lot of things from Amazon and this has been the worst ever!!cookieOk, update I did contact Amazon and they did come through for me, I talk to a great agent that was able to help me right away she sent me a prepaid shipping label and I get to send this item back for a full refund Good job Amazon!!
