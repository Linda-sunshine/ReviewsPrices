review/summary: Good product but...review/text: I like it and use twice a week. Eggs get medium hard in seven minutes in my microwave. The lid is not tight now as it use to be early. Lid has a design flaw...There is not click to close which suppose to be there in this kind of appliance. I am happy with it overall. No more over or under cooking of eggs anymore. Thanks!
