review/summary: Outstanding Egg Cookerreview/text: Having used the Nordic Ware Microwave Egg Boiler numerous times now, I'm delighted to state that not only does it cook hard-boiled eggs flawlessly each time out (9 minutes does the trick in my G.E. microwave), but it also yields an egg that always peels perfectly -- a process that frequently posed a problem when I boiled eggs the conventional way on the stovetop. At such a low price for a device that does its job so well, it's a true bargain.One additional fact about this piece of cookware that isn't noted in Amazon's description and that I haven't seen mentioned in any of the other reviews is that according to the manufacturer's website, it is BPA-free -- excellent news for those of us who care about our health.
