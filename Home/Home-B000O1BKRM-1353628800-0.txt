review/summary: Love it!review/text: I absolutely love my Tovolo Perfect Cube Trays. I have struggled with traditional, cheap plastic ice cube trays for years and seemed to need to replace them twice a year or so. Not anymore! The Trovolo trays work great, the cubes are easy to fill and easy to pop the cubes out once the water is frozen. There is not a funny plastic smell to them either. You can even stack two trays on top of each other, even if they are not frozen yet. Perfect for limited freezer space. Worth the purchase for sure!
