review/summary: Cracked after a month of using it.review/text: we were only grinding coffee for a month when a crack right in the middle of the outside plastic got a crack, the manufacture warranty sent us a replacement and we sold it on amazon. hopefully they fix that or it was just a defect. it did a nice job grinding though.
