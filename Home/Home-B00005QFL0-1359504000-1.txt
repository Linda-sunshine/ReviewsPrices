review/summary: I'm in love with this bread machinereview/text: This was the best purchase. Its so awesome! It is so cure when it make a little bread ball. I can make XXL size loafs to small loafs. I have made pumpernickel bread, wheat, gluten free bread, nut and fruit breads and the best white bread I have ever had. The best part is that a recipe book comes with the unit. All the recipes are so great I didn't need to buy an additional recipe book. I use this unit to make about 4 loafs a week. Its perfect.
