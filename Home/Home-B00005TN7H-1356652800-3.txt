review/summary: This has been a great investmentreview/text: I highly recommend using the wide-mouth jar sealer verses the regular. It seals the lids every time. I have found with the regular mouth jar sealer you need to heat the lids (for the first time use) in order for them to seal. Which adds to your time. I use them with the half gallon mason jars mostly. Great way to store ingredients that you only use once in a while.
