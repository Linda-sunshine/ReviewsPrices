review/summary: An Excellent Product!review/text: This is an amazing product! After some tinkering, we're drinking the best cup of coffee ever every morning. Several helpful hints, buy great coffee beans, grind them finely just before brewing, use two filters, wet them before putting in the fresh grounds. Stir for at least 15 seconds until you get a rich creamy brown foam before inserting the press. The components are well designed of high quality materials and seem to be destined for long lasting daily use. The Aeropress will truly change the way you feel about the a morning cup! It is the best value for a product we've ever purchased!
