review/summary: Aroma kettlereview/text: This is a good, inexpensive electric kettle. I have had it for over 2 years, and use it heavily - multiple times per day. I have had no problem with the on/off switch breaking, but have been gentle with it in light of other reviewers' comments. The outside of the kettle gets quite hot when in use, but, in light of the warnings of other reviewers, I have been careful handling it and never found the hot exterior to be a problem. Quite recently, the thermostat seems to be starting to fail. At times, the kettle boils away for some minutes before I eventually turn it off. Other times, it turns itself off as it should. I just ordered a new kettle since this one is clearly on the way out. However, given the low price I paid and the heavy use the kettle has seen, I don't feel like it owes me anything. For anyone looking for a basic, inexpensive kettle with a reasonably large capacity, I would recommend this one.
