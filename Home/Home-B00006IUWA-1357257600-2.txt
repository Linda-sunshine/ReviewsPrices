review/summary: Great little popper-beware of overheat protectionreview/text: This is such a great popcorn popper. It makes fluffy popcorn in ten-ish minutes. Hardly any kernels end up in your bowl because they stay behind in the popper (like most air poppers). One thing to note- if you overfill the popper at all, it freaks out and overheats. The popper has overheating protection so when you overfill it, it turns off and does something to your electrical outlet. I just realize what I did, reset the outlet with the little button, take some of the kernels out and restart it. I wish there was a popper out there that worked this well and had an on/off switch so there weren't any little spark jumps when you plug it in and take the cord out of the outlet, but they all seem to be like this.
