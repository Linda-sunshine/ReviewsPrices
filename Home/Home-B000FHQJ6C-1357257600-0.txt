review/summary: AWESOME !review/text: Bought in August .. Just now getting around to my &#34;'juicing experience &#34;&#34;&#34; LOL . What better time than the new year to start right?? AND I LOVE IT !! This is so easy to use .. and clean .. and does it ever have power!!!! I am so happy with it , and feel especially fortunate to have done my research , and to have read reviews . Because this is every bit as good as reviews say it is . For the money ( which is an unbelievable price for a juicer of this quality ) .. I couldnt be more pleased . Also .. glad I went with this one instead of the handles that are plastic( be carefull as so many reviews on this product with tell you ) you want this one .. NOT the plastic clip handle ones .. they are known to break .. However these handles in this model are die cast metal clips .. that will give you the longevity you want ! Would highly reccomend this juicer for beginners to expert juicers .AGAIN &#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; I LOVE IT!
