review/summary: Love this, use it every dayreview/text: I love this. Bought it as a little treat for myself. I love coffee and go out to buy it all the time, but I don't always need a latte or mocha. I love love love this.You can buy K cups in any flavor and they all taste great.This machine is wonderful. It is easy to use. You can pick the temp of the drink and then pick the size you would like. The smaller sizes are stronger and larger are a little lighter in flavor but I love this machine. You can purchase a water filter for the water holder if you like as well. I would recommend this machine. I use it daily for 1 - 5 cups and it is still going strong.
