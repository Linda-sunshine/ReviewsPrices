review/summary: Great coffeereview/text: I bought this coffee maker because the $80 Hamilton Beach individual cup coffee maker I bought was making weak and inconsistent coffee. After reading a bunch of reviews, I thought I'd risk the $25 to check out the Bialetti. I'm really glad I did, this thing makes excellent coffee, and it's simple and easy to clean.I use hot water from a hot water dispenser, and put this on my stove on medium heat. In about 5 minutes, I have a (small) cup of potent coffee. I wouldn't mind having a size a little bigger, but I think the 6-cup version would be too much caffeine for me.I highly recommend this if you want a consistently great cup of coffee, and you can always add water if it's a little too potent for your taste.
