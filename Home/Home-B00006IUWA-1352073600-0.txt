review/summary: Great popper, lasts exactly one year.review/text: Just placed the order for our third Presto PopLite. They rock the air popped popcorn, but each one has died after exactly one year--last year's was ordered on November 13. We would consider giving it 5 stars if it lasted even a little longer.
