review/summary: How to keep steady?review/text: The motor is powerful. The chute is huge. However, the juicer keeps dancing around once I turn it on. I always need someone to hold the juicer down. Otherwise, all the juice will just create a big mess on my countertop and floor. Last time I used it, some of the fruit/veg would even fly out of the chute!I'm very puzzled by this. I've watched YouTube videos of people demonstrating how to use the Breville Compact and theirs, while noisy, hardly move and aren't as messy. Any tips on how to keep this thing steady will be very much appreciated. Cleanup tips are also welcome.
