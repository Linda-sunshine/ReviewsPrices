review/summary: It's a vacuum, and that's what it does best.review/text: Pros: Sucks dirt like crazy. Wide "path" as advertised. Practically pulls itself forward. Dirt and dog hair does not stand a chance. Does NOT clog on hair like our cannister model did, for those of you not all that crazy about looking at your carpet's dirt in a clear cannister.Cons: Plenty of corners cut. Top handle snaps onto bag/base. Hose is inflexible. Attachments are cheap.So, why 4 stars? Because this thing sucks dirt like crazy on any surface in our house. The attachments, although inflexible, do a great job when you can twist them around. Finally, a vacuum that does not have a cannister that clogs with hair and such every 5 minutes. That's why we like this vacuum. It's got a wide base, practically is self-propelled, and is old-school bagged. Mr. Dyson can have his fancy filters and tight-corner maneuvers and showcase swirling dirt. We like our dirt where it belongs - out of sight in a bag that we toss into the trash. We got tired of digging stuff out of our cannister and having it spray dust all over when we opened it over the trash.The fit and finish of this vacuum will probably disappoint. The suction will make you forget your disappointment and will get your carpet clean. If you want to spend a lot of money to get something fashionable, buy something from the latest Zac Posen collection. If you want to get your carpet vacuumed at a great price, get this from the Hoover collection.
