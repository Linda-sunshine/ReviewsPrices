review/summary: Don't Buy This One!review/text: We had had this coffemaker about 6 months when it started steaming excessively and only brewing half a pot (if we were lucky). I called Cuisinart three times over a couple of months and they told me to run half water, half vinegar through it. I have done that several times and the problem is still not solved. When I told them I was done messing with it they told me I could pay $10 for them to ship me a new one (why would I want another one just like it?) AND pay whatever it cost to send the defective one back! I am pretty sure I will not ever buy another Cuisinart! I am far from the only person to have had this problem. They need to make it right. I will take my shipping money and put it towards another brand and put this one in the dump.
