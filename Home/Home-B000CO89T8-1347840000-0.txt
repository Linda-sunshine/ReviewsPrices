review/summary: Nice but not hot enoughreview/text: This product looks nice and is easy to operate but it doesn't keep coffee hot enough. I'm not one of those people who likes their coffee scalding hot either. It definitely does the trick but that's my only beef with it. It might work better with a closed-top mug.
