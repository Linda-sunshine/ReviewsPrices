review/summary: simple and effectivereview/text: picked up this item to be able to weigh small amounts of precious metals should i need to work a trade or make a purchase. I didn't want to bust the bank given that it would see little use,but did need a product which could be depended on.This fast weigh scale is the perfect compromise. Great price, small and compact (size of a cigarette case), and seems accurate. I weighed a few rings and bits and the scale seemed accurate. It does need to be zeroed. I allowed it to shut off and double checked weights which all seem consistent in reading.I have used a larger kitchen scale for measuring vitamins and stuff, which worked but was cumbersome for the minute quantities. This works better.I will keep this scale in my emergency supplies in the event that a bartering system should replace paper currency, but given the low probability of that occurring it will also double as my desk toy plaything and occasional vitamin weigher companion.
