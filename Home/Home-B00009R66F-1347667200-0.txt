review/summary: cleans well , but poor designreview/text: I chose this product because of the multiple rotating brushes. and I knew that I could put very hot water in it ,so not having a heater in the machine didn't worry me. our tap water is hot enough to get dirt out just fine.BUT when I opened the box and put the unit together, I was very disappointed at how flimsy and poorly designed it was!!!! a 8 year old child could /would snap the spine of this machine .easily. when in an upright position ,it is very fragile feeling , so I use a bungy cord to secure the spine of the machine when not in use.with very little pressure the lower part of the machine in the back , could break away from the up-er portion.when you go to snap the clean water tank back in , it doesn't always snap securely back in place.the surge shot is a nice plus for pet stains.if I had to buy again, I would find a different brand with the brushes, but a better designed frame work.the Amazon delivery time table is great.
