review/summary: Wow, These Were Horriblereview/text: I bought these after I had typed in the search words 'charisma king sheet set' because I love Charisma sheets but now needed sheets for a king size bed. These Pinzon sheets came up in the search results and their pretty plum color was just what I was looking for.These are horrible sheets. They are NOT sateen-like in any way. They wrinkle right out of the dryer and they are rough-textured.... what did someone else write? Like burlap? Pretty close! What a waste of money :(
