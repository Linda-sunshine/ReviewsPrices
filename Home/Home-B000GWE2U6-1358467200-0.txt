review/summary: Worked great, but two units have broken in under a yearreview/text: I have owned both the penguin and the elephant humidifiers in the past year. Both worked great -- quiet, lots of mist, basically what everyone else has said -- but both developed leaks within six months of occasional use. Water draining out of the base where the power cord enters the unit does not instill confidence in a product. Each unit was only lightly used, too; they would run at night whenever our child had a cold. After the penguin broke I bought the elephant, thinking it was a freak occurrence, but then that one broke too. We treated them very carefully, drained the water each day (well, usually) and periodically cleaned it with a diluted vinegar solution like the instructions recommend. I think we're through with Crane products... tonight I bought the Safety 1st humidifier so we'll see how that goes.
