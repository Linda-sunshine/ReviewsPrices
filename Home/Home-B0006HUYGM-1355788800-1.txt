review/summary: Hates Houseworkreview/text: I really love this strong little vacuum, except for one thing. I find it's impossible to switch off after it's been switched to the "spin brush" setting. Perhaps the engineer who designed the switch should have had someone who wasn't a gorilla test it. I'm a pretty strong woman (I rack up servers), but I have to vacuum with a flathead screwdriver in my pocket so I can use it to help me switch it off after vacuuming stairs. My thumbs hurt from trying to switch it off!Another thought - I'm dreaming of the day someone invents a hand vacuum that has a bagless cup that does not have a sticky dust-attracting inside-out envelope thing to catch the dirt. Why was that ever a good idea? Maybe it has to do with providing both suction and containment of dirt, but I think there must be a better way.Hey all you young women out there -- get into engineering and design stuff that you love instead of having to accept stuff that is just okay. I wish I'd done that!
