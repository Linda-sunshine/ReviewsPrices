review/summary: Does everything it needs to!review/text: My wife and I were shopping around for a water filter pitcher and were looking on getting a Brita. We were just not sure which size to get at first, but considering the way we drink water, a 10-cup pitcher would really be more efficient than something slimmer.The good thing about buying this on Amazon is that we had choice of all the possible colors, even though they were all priced slightly differently. This was unlike the stores we visited that only had the standard white and perhaps 1-2 other colors. Our bright yellow jug looks really awesome and striking.The main issue with this jug would be for folks who might not have enough strength to lift it when it is full or with storing it in certain compartments in your fridge, as it is pretty big!As with most other Brita pitchers, the water it serves is great and everything is easy to use. Would definitely recommend this product!
