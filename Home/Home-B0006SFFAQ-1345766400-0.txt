review/summary: You need itreview/text: My wife gave me a Brew Central for my birthday this past weekend. In two days I have used it three times already. It makes fantastic coffee (hard to impress a Seattleite!). I followed all of the instructions, including soaking the pre-filter (nice feature) in water for 15 minutes and running the machine with just wate the first time. Ever since then it has made great, full bodied coffee. The instructions are clearly written and the whole machine is very accessible and easy to set up and program. Try it, you'll love it!
