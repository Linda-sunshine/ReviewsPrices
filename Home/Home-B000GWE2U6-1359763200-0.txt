review/summary: Love my Frogreview/text: I love my frog humidifier from Crane! This is my 3rd winter using this humidifier, and it works as well as the first time I turned it on. I'm not sure why other people have trouble with them as mine has given me absolutely no trouble. I even have it running in our living room right now. While the instructions state it works in an area about 250 sq.ft, I have had it take care of at least 50% of our floor-thru apartment. It's helped me reduce the time I've had the cold/flu over the last 3 seasons, and it has helped keep me from ear/sinus infections.I love this product enough that I'm buying one for my mother's elementary school classroom, which is so dry that she can make kids be silent by threatening to zap them with static electricity.Make sure you clean as directed, and use a filter if you have hard water. Also, don't think that more vinegar will clean your humidifier better... it just makes your place smell like condiments... not that I found out the hard way.
