review/summary: A wonderful travel mugreview/text: I live in Northern Minnesota where the winters are very cold. We average anywhere from 0 to 40 degrees below zero in the winter. I fill my travel mug in the morning to sip on while driving my 50 miles to work. I work 8 hours, go back to my car and the coffee is still hot for my drive home. Even after sitting in an extremely cold car all day, I can still enjoy it on my drive home. The only travel mug you will ever need.
