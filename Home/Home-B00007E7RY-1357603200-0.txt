review/summary: I Can Breathereview/text: This is one of the few products I can say has improved my day to day life. Ive delt with a runny/stuffy nose basically my entire life up until I purchased this unit. I run it only at night, and its a huge help.Only con as stated a hundred times before me is the blue LED light.There is a user submitted picture which indicates how to disable it - do not be afraid, its much easier than it looks.
