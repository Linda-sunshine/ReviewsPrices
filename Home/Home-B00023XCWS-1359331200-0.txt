review/summary: Best water heater for this pricereview/text: I have used many different types of water heaters in the past.Some people smoke and some drink but I drink green tea and you will be amazed to know that I drink almost 15 to 20 cups a day.So I need a very reliable water heater that has to take a continuous load the whole day without fail. And this particular water heater is really good.For the last 3 months I am using this and this one has not ditched me since then.The price is very good. You can compare on the internet with other water heaters and you will find out its price is almost half of other water heaters.The only thing which makes you worried is that when you look at it closely you may not like the quality of the plastic.It seems that the material is weak; however, let me tell you that I have dropped this water heater twice and it is safe and still performing like a new water heater.
