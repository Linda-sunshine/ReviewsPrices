review/summary: Great for the price, but a few frustrations...review/text: I've owned this vacuum for about two years now. It is the newer model that does not have the headlight. For the price, I've been quite happy with the performance. It does a great job at sucking up dog hair from the carpet. It works equally as well on hard floors. It is fairly light and easy to maneuver. But at this price, you are going to deal with some annoyances. The first is that the brush does not stop spinning when it is in the upright position, so when you go to use the hose and attachments, you have to remember not to let the vacuum sit flat on a carpeted area just in case the repeated beating of the brush in the same spot does damage. The second major annoyance is the flexible hose. It is WAY too short, especially for cleaning things above your head. There are extensions, but they are inflexible tubes, so you can only bend and flex the hose and not the extensions. I will be purchasing a longer hose shortly because I am tired of having to lift the vacuum up in the air just to reach higher areas. Other than that, I've been pleased with this vacuum considering the low price I paid for it two years ago (close to the price it is at the time of this review).
