review/summary: Very pretty, makes cooking a joy!review/text: The color of this dutch oven is so pretty! Almost didn't want to cook in it! I leave it sitting on my stove all the time, doesn't be-long hidden in the cupboard! It does work very well for soups and stews, and in the oven for roasts and chicken.
