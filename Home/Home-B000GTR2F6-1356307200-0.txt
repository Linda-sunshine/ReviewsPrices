review/summary: Ever Wonder What Planet Some People Might Be From?review/text: I don't know where these ''problems'' that some are proclaiming from damaged parts to the simplest. Read the instructions first I guess is the best advice? Anyway, this is the best product and I've brought this particular version, the B70. AND cheaper at Khol's. Wait for it.......$149. Plus 20% off coupon they sent thru the mail!! So far, I've had no gripes whatsoever with Keurig brand. The reason I went for this one was because the amount of water this one held. Versus the ones below this B70 held much less and didn't want to keep refilling with each cup of coffee or two. Great buy. Especially the amount of money I've saved let alone for the price!! #WooHoo! :D
