review/summary: Uneven heat when using more than 5 traysreview/text: I bought this to replace my old AH dehydrator that died. My old unit had fan/heating element on bottom, which made cleaning harder than this unit. However, the heat distribution on my old unit was much better than this one. My old trays are compatible so my first use was 11 trays of jerky (manual says you can use up to 12 trays). The temperature difference for the top racks versus the bottom ones was significant. 4 hours into the drying and the bottom jerky was still wet. I had to keep rearranging the trays to even out the drying. This may not matter for foods that don't spoil easily but food like uncured jerky, the time to dry on the bottom trays is high risk of bacteria forming. The temperature on the top 3-4 trays were fine and if that is all the trays you will ever use, then this unit should work ok.The sound on this unit is about the same as my old unit, but perhaps a little louder as the fan sits higher on the counter. Checking progress, removing foods, etc.,. is less convenient than my old unit because you have to take off the bulky top with the attached cord in order to get to the trays. I'll live with this dehydrator and limit the number of trays and/or rearrange trays during first few hours but I prefer my older unit with the fan/element on the bottom.
