review/summary: I use this every dayreview/text: I love this food processor, it will leak if it's too much liquid in it, nevertheless it gets the job done! I've made all kinds of things in this processor, sauces, dressings, pie crust......It's great, do not regret buying this at all. I use it everyday, it's my favorite appliance.
