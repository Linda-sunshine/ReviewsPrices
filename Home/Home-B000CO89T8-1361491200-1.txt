review/summary: THIS THING IS AWESOME!review/text: I love my espresso machine and really enjoy my morning cup of coffee. Problem is I dont chug it gone but rather sip it slowly and enjoy it and by the time the cup is half gone its already cold. I hoped this product would allow my cup to sit on my desk and keep my cup of coffee warm down to the last drop and it does just that! I put it to the test for the first use, timing the start time of putting my freshly made latte on the warmer to the last drink and an hour and a half later my last sip was still warm. :) Now if only it will continue to perform for a good while...that will be the next test. If (when) it dies they sell this at bed bath and beyond (the exact same one) and they have life time replacement when you keep your receipt and the packaging (everything I buy there I take the receipt and stuff it in the box and stash it in the garage just in case) I will definitely replace it from there and always have a working product to keep my coffee warm down to the last sip. I could have gone to bbb upfront but ordered it here to get my sons item he wanted shipped free by spending the $25 needed to reach free shipping. We will see how long it last. I will update if it dies out quickly. I will be using it every day once a day for aprox an hour or so each day....
