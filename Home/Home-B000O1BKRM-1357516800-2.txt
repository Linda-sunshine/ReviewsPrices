review/summary: bad smell / tastereview/text: These trays worked well for a month or two, and then started making my ice cubes taste awful.At first I thought it was something in my freezer, but after making ice with traditional trays, it's definitely the silicone trays. I can't tell if it's a freezer burn smell, or a chemical smell like some others have described, but whatever it is, it's BAD! It will make everything you put the ice into taste yucky.Not worth the money
