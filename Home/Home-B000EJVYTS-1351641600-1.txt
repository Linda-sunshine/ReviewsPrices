review/summary: Just What I've Always Neededreview/text: I have a cat who likes to chew on the plastic bags hanging over the top of the trash can. My other cat likes to knock the trashcan over to find (among other things) the cat food can. And the fact I have the cans in there means the trash starts smelling almost immediately. This trash can solves both problems. The bag is contained within the trash can and the deodorizer really takes care of the smell. Since the cats don't smell the food they don't get into the can. Once the cats got used to the lid closing automatically (which I love) they don't run away when it does close. Really great product
