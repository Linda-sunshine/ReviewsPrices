review/summary: A good basic vacuumreview/text: I needed a vacuum but didn't want to spend a lot of money. This one was on sale for a good value. I like bagged vacuums, although a lot of people don't. It lost suction after about three years. I'm sure it's probably user error--I'm rough on vacuums! I don't know how to service vacuums so I sold it at a yard sale and bought another vacuum (I can't remember the brand). It cost twice as much and the new one is a piece of crap. The new one I bought is so complicated and has so many dials and the part where the dust is is hard to get out and seems to clog easy.The hoover tempo is not top of the line, but it's a simple bagged model and I really had no complaints while I was using it.
