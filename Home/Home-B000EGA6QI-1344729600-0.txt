review/summary: Great blender/smoothie maker!review/text: I make a smoothie most mornings, frozen apples, blueberries, yogurt, carrots, flax seed and an ice cube or two is my favorite. 3 minutes and I am good to go, and this blender has lasted me around 4 years. I have used it for creamy soups as well, but the 500 ml cup is the best device to keep the items to be blended in an efficient way, not using it is problematic. When I blended lentils for an italian lentil soup in a two liter bowl it was hard to get them all ground up. I kind of wish there was a slightly taller cup I could order, now that I have cracks growing in my original mixing cup. Anyone have any ideas on where to get a replacement cup or one slightly larger? The cuisinart page doesn't show any parts or replacement parts at all and I have scrolled through 167 Cuisinart items on amazon and not seen one replacement cup.But after 4 years of use, I can't complain!
