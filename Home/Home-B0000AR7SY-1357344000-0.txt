review/summary: A wonderful gift! Excellent when paired with a French Press.review/text: Okay, time to put my coffee hipster hat on for a moment.Pros:- Much quieter (and consistent) than the blade grinder built into my drip coffee maker.- The bean hopper is quite large, it will easily take a 1lb bag of coffee.- The burr mechanism is very well made. It's slower than other grinders I've used, but wonderfully consistent.- 16 settings, very fine (1) to course (16). I use a french press, and I have found that setting 14 is perfect.Cons:- As others have said, you'll find a fair bit of grounds left in the mechanism after a grinding session. The little brush that comes in the box will get plenty of use.- When I pulled the grounds basket out of the grinder after my first session, I heard a 'Poof!' and was greeted with a small cloud of coffee. Be careful! the basket catches on the bottom of the grinder, and will hurl coffee grounds at you if you pull it out too quickly.- Speaking of the basket, one wishes that there was a removable lid for it. It's quite a large grinder, and sometimes it'd be nice to grind some up to store (unspeakable, I know) for a few days' use.- The burr mechanism not the easiest thing to clean. Lots of spaces for grounds to get stuck.Overall:I received this grinder as a christmas gift. It has worked wonderfully, and makes a superb cup of french press coffee. I was pleasantly surprised to see that one can order pretty much any mechanical part straight from the manufacturer. I predict this grinder will have a long, happy life in my kitchen. 5 stars out of 5.
