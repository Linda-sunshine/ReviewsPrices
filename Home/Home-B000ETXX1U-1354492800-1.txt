review/summary: Guests Raved About Quality Sleep!review/text: Quick to inflate and the Sure-Grip Bottom means that the bed 'stays put' once it's in place. Easy enough to make up with standard linens, though we used a set that clung nicely to the surface, so no slip-sliding of cozy sheets and blankets. Our guests raved about how comfortably they slept, which was great to hear. (We sold our spare bedroom furniture in the last move, and didn't want to invest in a new, full-furniture bed for guests just yet.) The almost-standard height is especially appreciated by those of well, more advanced years. The raised edges would keep the over-zealous from accidentally rolling out at night, but are easily navigated by sleepers when they awake. Very happy with this purchase, which we made after reading positive reviews!
