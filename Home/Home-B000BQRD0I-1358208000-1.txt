review/summary: No more ironing!review/text: Bought for my girlfriend and she loves it. Takes about a minute to heat up and works great. Its tall, but has a very small footprint so we just leave it out in our bedroom and barely notice its there. We will probably be getting rid of the old iron/board. Great product
