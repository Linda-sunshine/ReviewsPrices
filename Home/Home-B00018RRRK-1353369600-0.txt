review/summary: 3+ years, going strongreview/text: Got this as a wedding gift in 2009. Use it 3-5 times per week. Grinding your own beans makes the single most difference when it comes to drinking coffee. This machine is a great candidate for kitchen real estate!Pros - Variety of settings for different grinds. Easy to use. Easy to clean. Attractive look. Good price point.Cons - Loud (Silly to point out since you are grinding coffee. With a machine.) Material attracts dust.Buy it. You'll like it.
