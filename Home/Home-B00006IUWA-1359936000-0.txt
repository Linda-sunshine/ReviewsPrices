review/summary: A question on power supplyreview/text: Presto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Popper, WhiteFrom the reviews, it seems this appliance is something popcorn lovers would like to have at home. However, I would like to ask if the popcorn gadget runs on 220 volts or only on 110 Volts. I wanted to get one but don't have 110 volt in my house outside the USA.
