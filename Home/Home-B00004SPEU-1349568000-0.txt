review/summary: Cleaning is a problem.review/text: We purchased this because of the excellent reviews. But once we opened the box, we opted to return it because the grinder cup and blade are not removable for cleaning. The product instructions emphasize the need to keep it clean because residual oils become rancid and spoil the taste of the coffee. But the only way to clean it is to wipe it out. There is no way to clean the blades, under the blades or in the tight places that we want to keep clean. Our last grinder had a dishwasher safe grinder cup and blades; we'll purchase a different model with the same feature.
