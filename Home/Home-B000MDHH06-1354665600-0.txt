review/summary: Nice juicerreview/text: Nice juicer, but not that easy to clean. I guess the same is true for all juicers. It takes a prohibitively long time to clean this thing right, like 20 minutes of detailed scrubbing. It juices like a son of a gun though. If you do get it, be careful not to put too much into the juicer. The pulp collection area tends to fill up if you are making a pint glass worth of juice.
