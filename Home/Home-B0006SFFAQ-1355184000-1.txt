review/summary: Great coffee maker, poor lifespanreview/text: I purchased this coffee maker about 18 months ago based on all of the good reviews. I was happy with the coffee maker, it has a self cleaning option and it looks good too. It does not seem to make the coffee scalding hot if that is how you like it. The worst thing about it is it just died on me after 18 months. The heater element seems to have burned out, the coffee maker light comes on but it does not process the water. I smelled an electrical burning smell when it stopped working. Hopefully I just had a bad unit and this is not indicative of the product.
