review/summary: Great dealreview/text: We own a &#34;famous french&#34; brand dutch oven in a smaller size that we love, but we didn't want to pay the super premium price again if we didn't have to, and I'm happy to say that this Lodge dutch oven is every bit as good as the french brand at less than half the price. Good and heavy, heats evenly, and has a metal handle on the cover instead of plastic. Very satisfied.
