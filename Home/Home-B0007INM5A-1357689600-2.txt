review/summary: don't care for thesereview/text: The main problem for me is that you have to use finely ground coffee. I guess I should admit that I am a klutz, but I have a hard time filling these without making a mess. You have to be careful not to leave any grounds around the rim. Once that is done, though, it is easy to use them in the coffee maker. SInce I use my little coffee brewer at work, I prefer to use the Folger's single serve bags. Still relatively inexpensive.
