review/summary: small in size, but sucks BIG time!review/text: I purchased this handheld vacuum a year ago, and until now it is still up and running very well. I use this on sucking up onion/garlic skins in our kitchen drawer. I also use this to vacuum our vehicle. The size of this is what I like the most because you can store it easily. Caution, it's a bit noisy, but it's not that big of a deal because it picks up mess very quick, leaving you finish on chores in no time. =)
