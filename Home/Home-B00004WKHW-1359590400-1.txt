review/summary: Cuisinart Mini-prep plus food processor/ Highly disappointed.review/text: I bought this mini processor for the specific reason of making salad dressings or vinaigrettes for all my pasta dishes; worked perfect first two times I used it; today I used it for the 3rd time and the liquid was just spitting out from the lid seal all around the bowl and top. What is the purpose of using this item if it spills from the lid seal (trust me, I kept removing lid and checking to make sure it was attached correctly and i had indeed placed lid and locked it where it is suppose to be)...I had to hold down the lid with pressure today just to finish up what I started and the mess it made...OH Goodness! Good luck with yours if you purchase one!
