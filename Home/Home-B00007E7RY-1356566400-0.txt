review/summary: Removes odors and keeps your house fresh.review/text: I bought this item since my husband is a smoker and friends and relatives are impressed by how well it works. He no longer has to stand outside in the cold when non-smokers are present. It keeps the room free and clear of smoke and smells. No more annoying relatives, who feign coughing when he lights up. It removes all smoke quite quickly. Definitely worth the price for cleaner, fresher air!
