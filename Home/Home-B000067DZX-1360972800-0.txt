review/summary: Decent Product, MADE IN MEXICOreview/text: Water tastes fine after filtering it through one of these filters. I cannot taste the difference from water filtered from one of these units compared to similar ones I buy in the store. I am not sure if all of these filters are Made in Mexico, but be assured these ones from Amazon are Made in Mexico. I only drink water that has been filtered and these are nice units. However, if the price gets much higher on these filters I will be switching to a filtration new system soon.
