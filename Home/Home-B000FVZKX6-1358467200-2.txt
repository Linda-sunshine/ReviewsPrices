review/summary: I love these!review/text: This is the second set I buy from them. I love the sheets. It is so comfortable and warm, and they become better every time I wash them. It is like you are between layers of velvet.When I first got it I washed 3 times to take all the lint. It is cotton product, so lint is expected. They are an excellent quality, superior of good brand sheets as L.L.Bean. I am very satisfied with my two purchases. They also come in beautiful colors.I recommend this product to anyone who wants quality flannel sheets at an excellent price. Thanks so much for offering this great product.
