review/summary: Nice!review/text: Pretty good! Needed It for school and ordered it used for cheap, Got sometime(s) later! Although the book its self was in Good condition, the shipping bag was TERRIBLE, It had looked like someone ran over it with an airplane! But Im not reviewing the bag Im reviewing the book! no pages ripped, No Writing, Scratches, Ok cover, Pretty Good indeed.
