review/summary: Quality product for the pricereview/text: This mattress pad is an excellent buy for what I paid for it. It could stand to be a little thicker, but for less that 20 dollars for a queen sized mattress pad, hard to complain. The way the pad stays on the bed and overall construction is excellent. If you are looking for maximum comfort I would recommend one of their thicker and pricier pads.
