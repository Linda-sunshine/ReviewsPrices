review/summary: Worked for a while then self-destructedreview/text: We had one of these for a while, and it worked. Then one day, the internal mechanism that drives the corkscrewdisintegrated, and, while the motor still worked, the corkscrew no longer did. So it was permanently dead. I giveit two star because it worked for a while and take the rest away because of cheap internal construction.
