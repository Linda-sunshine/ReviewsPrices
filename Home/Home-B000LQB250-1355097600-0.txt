review/summary: Better Sleep Now!!review/text: I love this product. I have not been sleeping well on this military issued bed, so I decided to purchase this mattress pad and it has changed my whole sleeping patterns. I now sleep a whole lot better. A minor dislike that I can live with is that it has this weird smell to it. I suggest others to probably let it air out on both sides before actually putting it to use or you'll have that weird mentholly smell for a couple of days in your room. Other than that, I'm satisfied. Thanks
