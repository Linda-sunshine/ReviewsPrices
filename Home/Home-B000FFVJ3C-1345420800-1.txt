review/summary: Works Great!review/text: This works absolutely great. I wanted an Excalibur, but couldn't afford it, nor had the space for it. As a 1st Dehydrator, this fits the bill.It fits in a little 18" x 18" counter space between the TV and the Toaster Oven... I put it on it's own a Surge Protector to turn it on and off.This Nesco FD-75PR 700 Watt dehydrates everything I've put in it perfectly, thoroughly and quickly.The sound is similar to and about as loud like the washing machine running in the garage (next room from the kitchen). You notice it but can easily ignore it...The round trays are fine for fruits, Kale Chips, etc, but are annoying only for Flax Crackers and fruit Rollups, in that you have to watch out for pressing or dripping the food into the hole. They do make a nice pie shape for the Crackers though.The design and quality are very good. The Trays are a little fragile, but it hasn't and shouldn't be a problem. I highly recommend the Clean a Screen Tray Protectors for Fruit and even Kale Chips, as it makes cleaning extremely easy with just a sponge.I would definitely buy it again, especially for a 1st purchase of a dehydrator, ...but if you *really *want *the *Excalibur, and have the extra dough, then I would recommend getting it!
