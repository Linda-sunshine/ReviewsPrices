review/summary: Excellent almost Pro Dehydratorreview/text: This is an amazing machine! I have own it all of one week & have turned it off twice since. I have dehydrated potatos, carrots, zucchini, celery, pineapple, oranges, okra, strawberries, green beans & okra pods for the seeds, chives, parsley and sage. I purchased "Quick-Fix Healthy Mix" book and have made so many meals in a jar, FoodSaver bags and prepping needs too. The Nesco 700 Watt is professional level. I did the thin sliced potatos in less than 4 hrs with all 5 racks full. No rotating, no over dehydrating and no two days of waiting and watching. I have placed these items in straight from the grocery store and garden, next I will attempt canned corn to see how it goes for experimenting purposes. If you want to get ahead on meal preparing and save a lot of money and waste nothing, you not only will love this machine you need this machine!
