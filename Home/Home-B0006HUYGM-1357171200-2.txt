review/summary: Great for stairsreview/text: Exactly what I needed for the stairs in our home. The attached hose is really helpful in getting into the edges. Only drawback might be that someone with a bad back will find this awkward. You do have to get up close and personal with the area you are vacuuming. Other wise, great little vacuum, easy to clean the filter and it works on upholstery as well.
