review/summary: Uselessreview/text: I thought I would like these but they are made poorly. For one thing they are not flat on the bottom, so you have to try to hold this little thing in your hand while carefully measuring coffee grounds into it, making sure not to over fill or underfill but still getting the grounds level with the very top. Oh and don't get any grounds around the edge because just one stray ground and the lid won't fit right. Speaking of the lid, it doesn't snap on, you just kind of press it into place and cross your fingers. Don't buy these
