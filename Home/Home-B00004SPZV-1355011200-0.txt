review/summary: don't make them like they used toreview/text: This will be our third Misto Gourment sprayer. The first 2 last a reasonable amount of time. This one broke the first week - plastic piece broke off almost immediately. What a piece of junk. Wish someone would make a durable mister as it is a great tool to have in the kitchen.
