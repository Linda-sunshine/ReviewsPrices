review/summary: rust hauntingreview/text: I liked the handles and the look , however ; I should not have thrown out the box so soon as I received it. I cannot return it now. I cooks good, but I cannot get rid of the rust , I tried and tried. It does not worth the $42.21 , which included shipping and handling. It is a waste of my money.
