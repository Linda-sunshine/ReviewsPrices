review/summary: Capresso 565 comparison with Cuisinart DBM-8review/text: For years, my husband and I used aCuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill. It ground coffee adequately, but it was extremely noisy. Its screeching and whining made us dread making coffee - so much so that we finally resorted to grinding beans at night so we didn't have to face the racket in the morning. When the Cuisinart finally died, we were quite ready for a change. Other reviews said that this model was relatively quiet, but we weren't sure whether the distinction would truly be measurable. Oh MY, what a big difference! This Capresso is significantly quieter than the Cuisinart model - I would say that the the noise level is reduced by at least half. The pitch is much lower, too, making it even easier on our ears.We found that the Capresso seems to grind more evenly than the Cuisinart model. The Cuisinart grinder seemed to clump and pack some of the ground coffee against the side of the collection bin, making it somewhat more of a chore to measure. The beans ground in the Capresso are even and almost fluffy in comparison, thereby making measuring more simple and consistent.We are very pleased with the switch.
