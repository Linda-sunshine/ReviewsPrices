review/summary: Greatly disappointedreview/text: My experience with percolators has been they make the best coffee and fill the kitchen with a wonderful aroma. This machine did neither. We use the best grinds and normally have great coffee but when my drip machine died I thought I would try a percolator. I think the elements are too hot as the coffee has an overcooked flavour. I stopped using it and relegated it to a cupboard.
