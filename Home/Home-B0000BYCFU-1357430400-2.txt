review/summary: Awesome!review/text: I have a garden and go to the farmers market for fresh produce (and low prices!). This canner handles large volumes of various sized jars. My pantry is always full of vegies, stews, soups, meats, fruits, and you name it. Also, the 3 weights that come with it are light years better than those idiot gauges where you have to constantly monitor the heat. Just listen for the jiggle and steam and you're good to go about your business elsewhere!
