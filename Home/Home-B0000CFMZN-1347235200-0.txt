review/summary: A miserable designreview/text: My old Pyrex 4 cup measure developed a crack. I ordered this replacement, never dreaming that it would be virtually unusable. The pouring spout is so tiny and shallow that liquid dribbles down the outside of the vessel. I have never seen anything to rival the stupidity and poor design. It will probably be adequate for dry material, but I will never try to pour liquid from it again.
