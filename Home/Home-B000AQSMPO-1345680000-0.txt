review/summary: Worthlessreview/text: My wife gave me this as a Christmas gift, and it worked fine for a couple of months. Now it no longer works at all. The little window says that it's brewing, but nothing comes out. I only turn it on when I'm using it, and it gets very light use - maybe four times a week. Considering the cost of the unit and the number of cups of coffee I've gotten out of it, I figure we paid over $4 a cup for the coffee it has made. I'm in the market now for a new coffee maker, but it sure won't be a Keurig. Until then I'll buy my coffee at Starbucks - it's cheaper than using this thing.
