review/summary: Because its unsuitable for my country's voltage use....review/text: Very disappointed in the fact that it is not suitable for Australian consumers. It should be stated in the ad that the voltage is 110v ..many countries use 240v. It is a lovely machine and I was certainly looking forward to using it. Had I used it with a global plug i would have blown the power/electrics in my home....Now I have a problem with returning the product. To do so would cost me twice its value. I guess it will end up in the trash. How sad. Had you said in the advertisement unsuitable for 240voltage....any thoughts on this Amazon??
