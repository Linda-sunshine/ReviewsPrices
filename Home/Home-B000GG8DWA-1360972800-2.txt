review/summary: Great little heater for the price and wattage, just don't expect miraclesreview/text: I've had this heater for over 2 months now and can definitely recommend it. Its really good considering it uses only 800w with both elements on. Seeing the craze some people have for it, I have to say that in terms of heat, you get what your wattage is. Period. It is an 800W heater, and it shall put out no more than 2,731 BTUs/hr at 100% efficiency, and nothing is 100% efficient. So it'd be wrong to expect it to put out equivalent heat of a 1500W heater. I also found that when I keep the house at 62F, I have to keep it much closer to me to get the heat. When the house is at 70F, I can put it much farther and the heat still reaches me. This is quite natural, but just saying because someone should not expect heat to travel from this heater over 3+ feet when its quite cold around. Contrary to what some other reviews said, I did not find it hot enough at 2 feet to 'burn anything'. It does not, which is a good thing and its safe. Besides that, its all good. It is quiet, and allows you to keep central thermostat down and keep the local area warm. Build quality is good too. And I love the option for 400W (single element) which comes in handy as well. All in all, a great heater. Thumbs Up!
