review/summary: Where do I start!review/text: I did a lot of research on Burr Grinders and noticed this being used at our local Starbucks. The pro's outweigh the cons for me. Many people on here say that you have to clean it after every use, remember this is a commercial grinder! It does make sense if you use it multiple times a day, like at Starbucks. I use it once or twice and clean it the burr and grinder out after the hopper is emptied. You do have to be careful about lining the burr and grinder up as well as the hopper. The dot is hard to see for my wife, so brush everything clean and put everything back together. Cost wise -- AWESOME! The one downside is the lower cup is plastic and there tends to be problems with static, but compared to the old grinders that you have to hold the button down and hope to not get coffee grounds everywhere, I can deal with a little static. I'll add updates with further use.
