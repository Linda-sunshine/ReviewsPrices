review/summary: Decent for the price.review/text: For the price it is pretty decent.However, it is off by a little bit. It comes with instructions on how to calibrate it, but you need a 500g calibration weight.I dont have it, but when I weigh a nickel it comes out as 5.1g and a nickel is supposed to be 5g.so it is off by a little bit, but i dont mind that much. I wish it was accurate out of the box like my old one was though.
