review/summary: Veggie 'Pasta' Heaven!review/text: I have never written a review for a product purchased on amazon before, but let me just say... this slicer is AWESOME! I think it's the best food prep item I've bought to date (and I have many!) I love the simplicity of it, and it comes apart really easily to clean, with the extra blade trays stored neatly below. The blades are very sharp so be careful, but that's common sense. I can get 'noodles' or 'strips' cut from veggies in literally minutes- you can't boil water and cook pasta in the amount of time it takes to slice a zucchini with this and put it in a pan with some EVOO! Also, coming from someone who is having to eliminate gluten and cut way back on starchy carbs, it is a miracle tool! I have made zucchini 'noodles' for meals the past 3 days, and my boyfriend couldn't stop raving about the 'pasta' I made - he said he didn't even miss real noodles!! For those with kids - I'd imagine it is a fun way to incorporate veggies into your every day meals. I can't wait to make sweet potato 'curly fries' next!
