review/summary: Quick and Easy!review/text: Hot water by the cup in less that a minute. Can't beat that! This is my second one of these dispensers. The first one was purchased in the early 90s and just recently stopped working properly. If you want a quick cup of tea or just need a cup of boiling hot water quickly, get one of these and I don't think you will regret it.
