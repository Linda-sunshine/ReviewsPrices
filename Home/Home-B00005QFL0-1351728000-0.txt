review/summary: Panasonic SD YD250--Quality at reasonable pricereview/text: Our second bread maker. Did lots of research, picked this one, and glad we did. Doesn't "walk" on granite countertop. Does create some thumping noises during certain cycles but nothing annoying. Each loaf comes out perfect. On one occasion, the yeast wasn't added (the machine thumps for yeast to be gravity fed through top feeder). Manually added yeast and it seems to come out fine. Subsequently cleaned out feeder hole with Q tip and rubbing alcohol. No problems since. We've never had a bad loaf. When measuring by weight, remember the milk is FLUID ounces so use a Pyrex measuring cup. I'm told someone didn't do this once.........Lack of a window doesn't bother us. Teaches patience. Recipe book contains good variety. Our favorite white bread recipe is Egg Bread. The raisin bread is also superb. We've had it for 11 months without any problems.PROs: Price, reliability, and result. CON: The loaves come out an odd size. The smallest loaf is 7" W x 5" H x 6 1/2" D (review won't let me add photo--bummer). One slice almost equals 2 slices of normal sized bread.NOTE: As fresh bread goes stale very quickly, we freeze the loaf in 1-2 gallon sized Zip-lock bags and defrost as necessary. No need for the expensive made-to-order bread bags.
