review/summary: Great value for small and light unitreview/text: Got this unit over the holidays, and have been using it for about 3 mos. Needed a small and light vacuum for our one carpeted bedroom where the stick vac was not enough.The first time I used this, I was appalled at the huge amount of dust it picked up in my one little bedroom! We had an old hoover that I'd been using, and apparently it sucked in a bad way because there was about half a container of dust after one use with this new dirt devil! So, this thing really works, and it's nice to see the progress in the clear canister.Works well on wood and tile too, though today, it seemed much weaker than previously when used on carpet. Doubt my arm has gotten stronger, so either the auto adjust height thing is failing, or the suction has simply weakened already. Hopefully it was an anomaly and it will self-repair.Pros:-light and compact (but this means narrow cleaning path)-effective (at least it was prior to today)-cheap price and simple features-I like how easy the hose is to use- just pull it up, no switches or attachments needed.Cons:-DIRTY FILTER AND CANISTER!!! It's a horrible design. I always end up breathing a bunch of dust and having to vacuum around the area after I dump and clean the filter. There's got to be a better bagless canister out there, and a less nasty filter. Not for folks with allergies or lung problems. This alone would make me not buy it again.-LOUD - I wear ear plugs, especially on wood/tile.-engine overheats easily if you get something stuck in the brush and pull (like the corner of a rug.) This is user error, but just be aware- turn off the machine right away if this happens before pulling stuff out.Bottom line: for less than $45 and limited carpet in your home, it's a great buy if you don't mind eating some dust after each cleaning.
