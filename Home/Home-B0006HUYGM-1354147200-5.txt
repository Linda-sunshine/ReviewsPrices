review/summary: Pretty Goodreview/text: Was very happy to receive the product and started to use it straight away as I had just had an attic done in my house. It was sucking away nicely for the first 10 mins and then just cut out. I tried to plug it in the wall again, however would not start. So thought maybe it had over heated, which it had done. 30 mins later I tried again and we were back to normal.The suction is amazing, the bagless design great and overall a good product.
