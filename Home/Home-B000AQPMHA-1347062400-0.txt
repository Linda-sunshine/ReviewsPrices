review/summary: Capable Coffee Makerreview/text: This coffee maker is a nice little Keurig system. It requires buying into the Keurig $.35-$1.25+ per-cup ecosystem. That cost should be factored in when buying this. If you're a heavy (coffee) drinker, you'll probably be spending about $30-$80 per month for those convenient little disposable cups. Throw the figure out over a year and you're looking at $360-$960 a year in coffee expense.There are a few coffee subscriptions that one can join to save a few dollars each month. Some offered through Amazon.The product works well but I didn't consider the monthly investment required after purchase. I might not have bought if I had. It's like those CD clubs that would give you 12 CDs for a penny but then you were sent a monthly selection at an inflated price.The cup of coffee that is brewed is delicious, though maybe a smidgen smaller than I'd like to see. The Brewing System has two settings of big and small, but both seem small for me.We compost in our household and it gets to be cumbersome to empty each cup indvidually into the kitchen compost holder. Coffee grounds end up all over the counter.This is a luxury item that can easily be replaced with our old stand-by: theHamilton Beach 47454 BrewStation Deluxe 12-Cup Coffeemaker.The Keurig B40 DOES make good coffee easily. For some people there's a convenience value in that.
