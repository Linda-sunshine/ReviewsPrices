review/summary: We love it!review/text: There's no faster and more convenient way to heat water than through one of these. I love it so much that I bought them several more for presents.Pros:when the water is boiling it turns off so you don't have to worry about monitoring it.It heats up water faster than the stove.It's safer than heating water in the microwave. Although extremely rare, water heated in the microwave can &#34;explode.&#34;I've used it for boiling eggs and it worked well. Though you can't do more than two at a time (I tried more and they broke) and you have to let them sit in the water for a while.Cons:The color white. I bought a stainless steel one for my sister and I really love how much nicer it is to clean.The cord is short. It's better to spend the extra money on the ones that come off the base so that you can take the kettle away instead of having to do all the pouring in one place (especially when having friends over for tea).
