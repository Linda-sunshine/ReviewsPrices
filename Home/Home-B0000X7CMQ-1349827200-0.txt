review/summary: Great coffee, but fiddly to make workreview/text: First off, this coffee maker makes really good coffee, probably due to the higher than normal temperature it heats the water to. The thermal carafe keeps it warm all day or longer if you rinse it with some hot water first to prime it.But.-If you put too much coffee in the basket, it'll overflow all over your counter.-If you try to use it with apermanent coffee filter, it won't drain fast enough and will overflow all over your counter. Useregular paper filtersinstead. They fit fine, but you may want to fold the bottom a little.-If you don't line up the carafe with the release valve, it'll overflow all over your counter.-If you do any of the above, you'll get grounds caught in the lid of the carafe, and it will overflow all over your counter, even if you quadruple check all of the above, until you clean out the lid of the carafe properly.All of these will happen while you're sleeping, or walking the dog, or in the shower. They will not happen while you're in the kitchen watching this thing like a hawk. Minus one star for being so fiddly.Once you get used to this coffee maker and its many quirks, you'll be fine, and you'll be enjoying tasty hot coffee all day long.
