review/summary: Lasted 6 weeksreview/text: I purchased this grinder solely to grind chicken wings for my older dog.We used it maybe 3 times per week but after six weeks the blade broke apart.I had had a cheap traditional grinder used in Latin America for corn. This had done the job over a decade ago when our dog was a puppy. But then we would break up the wings with his jaw and I gave the grinder away. Big mistake!
