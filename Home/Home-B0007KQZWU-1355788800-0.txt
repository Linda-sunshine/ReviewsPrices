review/summary: Absolutely love these potsreview/text: I really wanted All Clad but are you kidding? Not at that price. So read reviews online and was steered toward these. I have had them about a year and use them every day and love them. They are very heavy duty, and heat very evenly. Unlike pots that have the disk in the bottom, they can still burn on the lower edge if your flame is too high. These don't do that.Very impressed with the fit and finish, great cookware for the money.
