review/summary: so far so good, however doesn't handle thick bladesreview/text: I have a thick, serrated blade pocket knife and it is hard to get the blade down to sharpen it as the blade is relatively thick... also, the instructions say that it DOE NOT handle serrated blades, despite what I thought I had read prior in the description... But it does seem to sharpen blades quite well and it is MUCH cheaper than the ones I saw in stores in the Mall...
