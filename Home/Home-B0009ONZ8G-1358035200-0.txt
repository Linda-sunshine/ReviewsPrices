review/summary: Really great vacuum for the pricereview/text: My husband and I first bought this vacuum while in college having bought our first puppy together. Two years later, this vacuum still works pretty good. The motor is starting to crackle and the cord holder broke off a long time ago. Overall this vacuum did a great job picking up now two dogs and a cats worth of hair. The attachments were a huge bonus as I am constantly cleaning off furniture and corners with pet hair. It does struggle on bare floors, but still does a decent job. We definitely got our value out of this vacuum!
