review/summary: I love the moka pot!review/text: I just love my moka pot!!! Since buying my moka pot I don't even wanna buy a fancy espresso machine anymore. I had an espresso machine and used it for about 3 years and it just didn't work anymore. Money was tight though so I decided to get the moka pot to try until I could afford a new espresso machine. Well after trying a few times I finally learned how to make very good espresso in the moka pot. When used right this is better than any coffee shop! I find you must use fine ground espresso. Regular coffee grounds will NOT make espresso. I highly recommend Lavazza espresso with this moka pot. That is how espresso should taste. I will never go back to a coffee pot or espresso machine after using this! Its so simple to use, mess free, and usually only takes 5 mins. So much better than my espresso machine.Also I ordered the 6 cup one it produces at max 10oz water before brewed usually you lose an once through brewing, You can make it with less, I know others have said you cannot but I have with no issues. I usually make 8-9oz water to make 7-8oz espresso with no issues. Just tweak the water to espresso ratio to your liking. I like very strong so I use 9oz water to 22 grams espresso. Do what works for you. I highly recommend the moka pot for anyone who like espresso!
