review/summary: Filters clogreview/text: Clearly PUR has changed their product -- and the glowing reviews in the past are not for their current offering. The filters clogged and water could not pass after about 3 days (3-4 refills of the container). We had a four pack, so we tried all four of them using warmer and colder water, not filling it as full, etc. It did not work. We are contacting PUR to see if they will be reengineering the filters. Until they do, do not buy this product.
