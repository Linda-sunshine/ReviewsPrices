review/summary: Stopped working after using not more than 5 timesreview/text: Hi,I expected Black & Decker products to be sturdy and long lasting. However I had a bad experience with this product. The device stopped working after 5 uses in total. I am not sure what went bad but I am disappointed by the experience.I also just noticed that I am out of the return window that Amazon mentions, so could not even send this back.PS: After looking around carefully, there seems to be a small black switch on the underside of the top panel. In my case that switch looks faulty. I can make the motor run if I use a pen to press that switch, but it doesn't work in its own supplied Jar making the purchase useless now.Best,Ujjwal
