review/summary: Great product, but died in 3 months!review/text: Ok, I use this thing every day to make my protein shakes. Granted. But still, less than 3 months and the motor just burned out on me. This is the second time. I used to put nuts in the old one, and when it died, figured it was the nuts, and only use soft ingredients for my shake. Very predictable usage. Maybe I got a dud? Be careful about the life of this product, as amazing to use and clean as it is.
