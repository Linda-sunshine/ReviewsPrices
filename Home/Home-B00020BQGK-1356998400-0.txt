review/summary: Awesome productreview/text: I had gotten this product as a gift and TOTALLY loved it so I ended up buying one for my mom since I figured it'd be easier for her to use. It's so much easier to take out of the closet and use when needed instead of a larger vacuum. I love the dual rug and floor options. The one thing that's a minor issue is the small filter/cup which needs to be cleaned much more often than the regular vacuum but aside from that I had no other issues. And with all the other pluses, that one 'minus' was minor. I would definitely recommend this item.
