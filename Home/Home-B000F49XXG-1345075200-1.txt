review/summary: Poor quality parts and assemblyreview/text: Though designed in Italy, this is made in China, and it shows. The machine makes decent espresso, but you have to be very careful with the parts. The motor shakes the whole machine, so the cups shake out of position on the stand. Connecting the handle/holder to the machine requires a bit of force--while holding the machine steady. Then there's the plastic water tank. It got knocked off the counter accidentally and cracked. I tried to order a replacement from DeLonghi online, but their site doesn't have a traditionally secure payment page, so that's the last straw.
