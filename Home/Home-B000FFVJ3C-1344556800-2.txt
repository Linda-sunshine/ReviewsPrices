review/summary: Good Dehyrdrator for the pricereview/text: The Nesco Food Dehydrator is well worth the money. While my family and I mostly use this to dehydrate fruits and vegetables it was definitely worth the money. Clean up is easy and it is relatively quiet. This is a good beginner dehydrator and you won't be disappointed.
