review/summary: Great bread maker!review/text: This machine was purchased to replace a much used Breadman after 9 years of great bread making. After lots of Internet researching, I believed this bread machine was the best choice. After a month of making several recipes and about a dozen loaves, my husband and I love this machine. All of the loaves came out perfect with crispy crusts and soft insides and they are delicious. This machine makes better bread than our retired machine and is really easy to use. I highly recommend this machine!
