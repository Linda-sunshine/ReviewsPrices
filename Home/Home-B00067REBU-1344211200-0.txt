review/summary: Great bread maker except for one small issue.review/text: I ordered this bread maker a couple weeks ago and have used it a couple times and really do like it. I took the advice of previous reviewers and don't follow the recipes in the direction book ~ I ordered a separate recipe book for bread makers.However, I do have one issue and am wondering if anyone has had this issue too and if you have been able to fix it?Every time so far that I have made a loaf of bread, the little mixer lever that goes inside the machine bakes INTO the bread and comes off (it is removable as it comes in a separate little bag and you have to put it on) and it's pretty annoying to have to dig it out of the bottom of my loaf of bread every single time. I have no idea how to fix this though?? (short of super gluing it (And no I'm not serious ~ I'm not going to super glue it for real)Otherwise it really is a good machine. The buttons/menu are easy to use and so far I have liked it ~ like I said it's just that one issue that is really frustrating.
