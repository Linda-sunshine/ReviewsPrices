review/summary: 3-4 stars I don't regret but I would not buy it againreview/text: I like the product overall, i love having fresh juices at home it makes me feel great physically and gives me moral satisfaction! :)the reason I would search for another Juicer in the future is because I feel bad when I see the left overs of the fruits/ veggies in the waste bin and they are NOT FULLY SQUEEZED! I saw other juicers which would use every drop of fruit to squeeze it into your cup and leaving behind dry mass, not this one. I have a desire to manually squeeze the waste LOL...maybe it sounds picky, but I just do not like waste stuff ... yet for this price you still get good quality juicer not too hard to wash, and you feel healthier :)
