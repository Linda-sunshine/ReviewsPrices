review/summary: Works great!review/text: Works great. Exactly like you think it would. After each use I just swipe the grounds out with my finger, rinse and give a quick swirl with the dish brush. Done. Has to dry of course or your next scoop will be a mess! That's why it's good to get a double pack, or a 4 pack if needed. I think with gentle cleaning, this product might last a very long time.
