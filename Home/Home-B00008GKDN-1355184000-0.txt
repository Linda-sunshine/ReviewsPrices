review/summary: Lodge cast Iron griddlereview/text: No doubt this is one of the better Cast Iron Griddle but looks no body paid any attention for safety.I have used this griddle many times to make Indian Chapaties. It does an excellent job as axpected but HANDLE gets extremely HOT. I happen to almost BURN my hand by just adjusting the skillet on Stove.Please, manufacture, shall look into this concern and let me know, How I can be safe using this Skillet.Are there any GLOVES/Mitten to put on handle as pemanent unit so that it becomes a safe handle.
