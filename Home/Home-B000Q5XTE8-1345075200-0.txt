review/summary: I Like This Chairreview/text: Like it but don't love it. First few days while I was still playing with all the adjustments it hurt my tail bone. I either made the necessary adjustments for my sitting comfort or it just needed getting use to. The chair is very adjustable like all the reviews I read. I sit in the chair for 1-6 hours at a time with great comfort. There are a few other chairs I'd rather have but they start at $605.00. For the price I am very happy with the Lorell Executive High Mesh Back Chair. A mesh seat would be better but it's summer in Phoenix right now (115 degrees)and I'm comfortable. After purchasing, the price dropped, so I paid even less than I thought I would.Executive High-Back Chair,Mesh Fabric,28-1/2 quot;x28-1/2 quot;x45,BK.
