review/summary: Really good water filterreview/text: I gave this rating four star's, because of the container and how little it holds water. It DOES hold 18 cups of water, but if this is the ONLY source of good tasting and refreshing water, then it runs low pretty fast. Some reviewers say that the pitcher took hours to filter water. Thank GOD I did NOT have this problem. From those reviews I was VERY skeptical of buying this product. I think it could have something to do with the filter it comes with, not the container. If one reads the instructions on letting the filter soak fully submerged for 15 minutes, I think it would work just fine, or it could be a faulty filter that would need to be replaced.I was ALSO skeptical because other reviews said theirs came cracked, etc. Thank GOD, once again, mine came perfect! I was scared at first to purchase this product, but now I am very happy that I did!I have a water filter built into my refrigerator, but it has NEVER done a good job! I live near the ocean, so our &#34;drinking water&#34; can be mixed with sea water and become salty, plus all the minerals and deposits in salt water is terrible in coffee and tea's, but may add some flavor to meals (just kidding, it's awful!). This product eliminated ALL of the nasty tastes and MOST to ALL of the deposits and extras that's in our water system. Coffee tastes much better, foods are less scary to eat!Pros:Wonderful filterDoes what it saysPretty in the FridgeGives option to stream water, or gush water when one is impatient :)Cons:Some product reviewers received defective productsIf only water source, needs to be able to hold more waterI would recommend this to anyone that has scary water in their community, it eases the gross factor and it makes the water taste amazing (I think they add minerals to the filter for added flavor---just a theory).
