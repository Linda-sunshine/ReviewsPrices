review/summary: Best investment ever!review/text: I bought this earlier this year but was so busy with waterbath canning that I didn't get around to using it until it was time to get another side of beef and I needed to free up space in the deep freeze. To date, I've used it to can quarts of beef barley soup, roast beef and ground beef. This pot is a workhorse and I have had no issues with it whatsoever. Given the weight of the canner (my husband refers to it as the "Flux Capacitor" due to it's resemblance to the device in Back to the Future), I am hesitant to use it on my glass top stove, as I can't afford to buy a new stove. I invested an additional $35 buying a Waring hot plate that I use the canner on. The advantage is that I can use my waterbath canner to heat the jars, then set the filled jars in the canner. It makes for a very smooth process.I did end up inheriting a Mirro pressure canner and Presto pressure canner from my husband's grandparents. But, since they both need gaskets, I doubt that I'll ever use them, as this canner is so effortless to use.
