review/summary: Affordable Dehydrator.review/text: I bought this dehydrator originally to make dried fruit and vegetables for hiking trips and it indeed works well. Although it takes a little longer than I expected, and I do live in a fairly dry environment. I usually dry mangoes over a period of 14-18 hours in order to reach a firm consistency. It's also a little bit of a pain to clean, supposedly the trays are dishwasher safe but only if you take them out before the drying cycle. I've been hand-washing them. I've ruined too many things by washing them in the dishwasher.
