review/summary: Excellent Quality Excellent Cookerreview/text: I am new at canning, but I decided I wanted a pressure cooker with enough capacity to can my bumper crop of tomatoes and green beans. This one is somewhat expensive, but Amazon had the best price I could find. I like that it uses no o-ring for a seal. It is very sturdy, has a gauge and a very straight foreward locking system. There are a couple of things you should know before purchasing this item. It doesn't work with glass top, or ceramic top stoves. It says so outright. The second thing I found was the quality of water you use will affect the pot and racks. My hard water literally turned the rack black, and began working on the inside of the pot. This was solved by using Reverse Osmosis water, or distilled water to fill the pot with. After I did my first batch, I had no more issues. I also recommend using good quality water in the canned items; after seeing the effect on the pot. One plus I would like to mention is that it is made in America, and I have decided to put a little effort in buying things made in America when possible.
