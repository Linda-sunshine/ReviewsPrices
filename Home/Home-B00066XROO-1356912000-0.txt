review/summary: I'm glad I bought itreview/text: Now the cook can keep up with the eaters! Did not experience the uneven cooking as indicated in some reviews. I think the heavier cooking surface results in a more even heat as opposed to the lighter cooking surfaces of the smaller sizes.The only con I can think of is the larger size may cause storing it a problem.
