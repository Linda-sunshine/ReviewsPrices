review/summary: Broke after dozen usesreview/text: I used the product about a dozen times, and then it would not work anymore. After contacting customer service, they stated it is because the water was sitting in the reservoir, and the unit was not descaled. I find this difficult to believe since it was used only a dozen times. In addition, our office had a Keurig unit for over 5 years, was used by 15 people every day, the unit was never descaled, and functioned just fine. The office is now on a second unit, has been in use for over a year by over 15 people, has never been descaled, and continues to brew just fine. I think they sold a defective unit, and were more interested in selling a new unit than fixing my personal unit.
