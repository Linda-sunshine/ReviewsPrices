review/summary: Mr. Coffee's is much betterreview/text: I only use this for grinding flax seeds, an easy task when compared to coffee beans. Prior to purchasing this I used a Mr. Coffee for the same job. When comparing the two, the Mr. Coffee grinded the seeds quicker. After 2 months the tab on the cap fell off and I have to put it back on each time I use it. My advice for a low end grinder is a Mr. Coffee.
