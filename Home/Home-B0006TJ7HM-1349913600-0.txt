review/summary: Great Deal!review/text: I bought these knives for my son's college apartment. He wanted me to return them because he has Cutco knives which are higher quality. I pointed out to him that he didn't have steak knives and all the knives were nicely arranged in a wood block whose small footprint was a perfect for his limited counter top space. It also included a handy shears. I was impressed with the quality of the knives. I have no idea how Ginsu can offer this product at such a good price. This would make a nice housewarming or wedding gift that wouldn't break the bank.
