review/summary: Vibrates right off the counterreview/text: Got this item for Christmas...I like to make protein shakes after a workout.The blender crushes ice just fine, it has a very strong motor and my protein shakes come out smooth and foamy.The one problem I have with this blender is it vibrates like crazy, if I don't have one hand on it at all timesit will shake right off the counter. Really Kitchen Aid?!? What good is a blender you can't walk away from?So..if you are looking for a blender that is powerful but that you need to baby sit this is the one for you.
