review/summary: Marginalreview/text: The design with top controls cumbersome and non-ergonomic to say the least. While it probably chops as well as most mini choppers out there, the difficulties with cleaning outweigh that benefit. The center pin under the blades keeps coming out and if you are not watchful you'll lose it rendering the machine useless. While it can't be compared to full size food processor, I find it can only handle small amounts at a time and chops unevenly at that. My prior Kitchen Aid mini was superior.
