review/summary: Love Kettlereview/text: I am so tired of running water for tea through coffee pots, which just ruins the tea. I purchased this pot to take with me in my suitcase so I have hot water reliably available on trips for tea, coco, oatmeal etc. While it is a bit larger than I initially wanted, it is very portable and I love the reliability. I ran hot water through it a few times and it is fine and I do not taste plastic. I love this kettle and recommend it!
