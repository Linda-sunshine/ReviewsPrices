review/summary: This thing could survive in space!review/text: I have an old Mirro canner I have had forever. Wanted a new one so bit the bullet and bought this one and let me tell you it's a world of difference! This thing is made like a tank. Everything fits together nicely. Quality shows in every aspect. I have really enjoyed using it compared to the old one as it seems to be better to control the pressure. Expensive but worth it!
