review/summary: extremely disappointedreview/text: I purchased the De'Longhi EC155 after doing a great deal of research. Initially, I was completely satisfied with my purchase and really wanted to love it. However, within a few days of use the machine began leaking excessively through the steam wand. This happened while while it was warming up, while in use (watering down milk), and while it just sat there. It was a significant amount of water each time. There's damage to my countertop where it was before I noticed the leak. I contacted customer service, and they said the machine was still under warranty. Still waiting on my replacement. It's been over a month now (prior to hurricane delays). I wish I had spent more money and gone with something else to avoid all of this inconvenience and frustration.
