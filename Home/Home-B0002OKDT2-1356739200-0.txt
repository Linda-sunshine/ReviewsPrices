review/summary: If you are really serious ...buy this!review/text: One word; AWESOME!I was just tired of feeling tired and knew it was my diet.This juicer is just what the doctor ordered!Set-up and cleaning is so easy. Its sooooo quiet!I agree with some of the other reviews, chopping the fruits and vegs is a great mental relaxer.Its like getting your body ready for the main event! Yum!Things to bear in mind: (nothing to do with the actual machine)Soft fruits can become mushy and plug up the screen if not intermixed with &#34;cruchy&#34; veggies.Also...Personally, I tend to not mix my fruit/veg colors, otherwise it can end up with a brown looking glass of liquid. And while it may take and be good for ya, it sure does not look very appealing! :) and YES a little raw ginger makes everything taste better.Juice ON!
