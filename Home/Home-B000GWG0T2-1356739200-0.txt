review/summary: Hard Working Panreview/text: I subscribe to Cook's Illustrated and after reading their intense testing of several non-stick pans under $50, this one stood up and performed as well as the $150 non-stick pan they use in their kitchens. I have a high end stainless steel pot and pan set but don't care to pay a lot for a non-stick because no matter what, they all wear out. This one has proven to be more durable than the rest, and works amazingly for the price. Eggs slip right off the pan, and crepes come out evenly cooked. The instructions say you can use stainless steel spatulas and such but I don't in hopes it will prolong the life of the pan. I also only hand wash the pan. With those precautions it has held up great to use every morning to feed my family of hungry boys. :)
