review/summary: Wonderful appliancereview/text: I have had my food processor for over a year now, and I really like it. I use it about twice per week for chopping veggies, making salsa, and grating cheese. The base is very heavy, and we are careful not to lift the unit by the bowl handle but by the base with both hands when we need to move it. Grabbing the unit by the bowl handle can cause strain on the handle which may lead to breaking.The stainless finish is easy to clean and looks sophisticated in our kitchen alongside our other electrics and stainless appliances. The blades are easy to clean and store easily in a drawer as well. The included blades have remained sharp and cut through veggies, potatoes, and cheese with ease. The bowl comes apart easily and the parts are dishwasher safe.The unit has performed very well for our average-use needs, and continues to be reliable.We have only had one issue with the unit. The bowl cracked (not after a fall or any poor-handling on our part) after about 3 months, and a quick call to Cuisinart remedied the situation immediately. Customer service was very good, and our replacement bowl was in the mail the next day.The 9-cup capacity is good for small to medium size dishes or sides. I'd recommend the 11-cup version if you need think you might need the extra capacity. For our small family meals, the 9-cup size is perfect.
