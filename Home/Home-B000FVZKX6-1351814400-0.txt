review/summary: Great quality, but not deep enough to fit my bedreview/text: These sheets are great quality & very comfortable to sleep on! Unfortunately, they are not deep enough for my bed. For a 14 inch mattress (& topper included), these 16 inch sheets still do not remain in place & fitted sheet comes loose from underneath my mattress. I should've returned them for deeper pocketed sheets, but they have already been washed & used.
