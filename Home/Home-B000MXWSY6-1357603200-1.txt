review/summary: two seperate alarms, many options, radio, never need to reset time if power goes out.review/text: there are two seperate alarms which is nice when you don't get up at the same time as your significant other. you have the option of using a normal alarm or radio to wake you up and there are controls for volume. there is a normal radio to use if you like. once you have it set for the correct time zone, it will stay on the correct time even if the power goes out or you unplug it. you can move it from one part of the house to another and once you plug it in, it has the correct time. that is probably the coolest feature.
