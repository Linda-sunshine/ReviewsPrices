review/summary: great canreview/text: every time I use it I say to myself "I love this trashcan" the only thing negative would be that if you fill it and compact it down it's hard to get the bag out , A tapered liner would be a great addition.Still I gave it a 5 star because of the order control and sanitary use when cooking.
