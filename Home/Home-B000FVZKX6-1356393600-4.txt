review/summary: ahhhhhhhhmazing!!!!review/text: I have been looking for flannel sheets to fit my thicker mattress (18') forever. I didn't want to spend a fortune but still wanted nice, soft sheets.....these are wonderful!! I have slept on them for 3 nights now and it's like heaven. They fit my mattress perfectly and are so comfy and warm that I NEVER want to get out of bed in the morning!! I only wish I'd found these sheets years ago! I totally recommend these to anyone!! This is the very first review I have done for anything and have purchased many things on Amazon but I just couldn't let the opportunity go to rave about how great these sheets are. You will not be disappointed!!!
