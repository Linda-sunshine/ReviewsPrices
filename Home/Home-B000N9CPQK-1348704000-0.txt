review/summary: Works great, comes with extra filtersreview/text: I wanted this purifier to use when cleaning out computer systems because whenever you're spraying dust out of a computer it goes right back in the air unless you trap it. So I switched this device on high right next to the computer tower while I dusted and it worked quite well to trap the majority of the dust. To my surprise the unit came with extra filters so that was an added bonus. I'm very happy with the purchase.
