review/summary: Great little machine does exactly what it is supposed toreview/text: This is the first time I have used a stovetop espresso maker and frankly I don't know why more people don't use them. Time wise it is almost as fast as an espresso machine and the cleanup is much, much easier. We have gone through 2 very expensive expresso machines that died after a couple of years (each one was over $300). So I had my doubts that a $20 pot could compare to these fancy machines. I was surprised -the espresso comes out much hotter than any machine I have owned and the flavor from the beans is superior. Another positive -It is tiny, my 2 dead machines were huge and took up a lot of counter space. Noise -there is none with the stovetop. One of my old machines you could hear from outside the house. Cleaning: extremely easy and a snap. Very few parts to clean. Travel -this unit is so small and light it is easy to take camping or traveling if you have access to a stove.Cons: Only a couple of things, aluminum construction, if you don't like using something that is all aluminum you might consider another brand. If you are making a bunch of expressos you need to let this unit cool down between sessions. I would imagine there would be the potential for pressure buildup so you need to let it cool. I would not let the unit sit for days before you clean it I would imagine the aluminum would pit over time.All in all I would highly recommend this stovetop espresso maker. The pros far outweigh anything negative. Great product and I should have bought one of these before spending $600 on the full espresso machines. I would definitely buy another.
