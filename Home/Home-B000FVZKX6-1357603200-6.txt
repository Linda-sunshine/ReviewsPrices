review/summary: No joke, truly the best flannel sheets!review/text: It sounds like a common saying that these are the "best flannel" but to me it's true. I've owned Target cheaper flannel and LLBean high end flannel ($90+). To me, this set is the most comfortable and quickly induces relaxation and sleep. It's super warm, soft, and just the best bedding experience I've had. I use flannel all year round, in frigid Chicago winter and in summer when the central air conditioning is on. I am tempted to buy another Pinzon flannel set here so I don't have to use my cotton sets anymore. :)Also these deep fitted sheets are great, I have a thick mattress plus waterproof topper, and it all fit perfectly. No nail breaking making the bed! The sage color is relaxing and beautiful!I will update if there's any excessive pilling or wear.The only thing is I wish this exact sheet set and gram weight came in a twin, my son really wanted one exactly like ours. I ended up getting him Target flannel sheets and he's happy.
