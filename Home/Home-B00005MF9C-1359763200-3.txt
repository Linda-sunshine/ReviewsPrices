review/summary: Great little coffee makerreview/text: I used to use a 12 cup coffee maker, then I went to the 6 cup coffee maker, and then went to the Keurig. Well the Keurig little coffee cups were too expensive to use, and the 6 cup maker was more than I could drink every morning. So I decided to try this 1-cup (mug size) coffee maker, and it turned out just what the doctor ordered, perfect for me. The coffee taste is no different than any other maker I used. So I am happy with it. I still have the other coffee makers if I needed to resurrect them from the cabinet.
