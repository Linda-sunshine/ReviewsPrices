review/summary: Great Coffee Maker (and quick hot water maker)review/text: Purchased B60 Special Edition a year ago for my wife and she loves using it for coffee and just to boil water for a cup of hot tea! So much, that we purchased one for each of our parents this Christmas!! They absolutely love their Keurig B60 too.We have not experienced any of the mechanical or flavor/taste problems that others have reported.
