review/summary: Good steam vac!review/text: This is actually our second. The first one lasted 5 years but, the casing on the bottom cracked and didn't fit right. This was due to our teen aged son bumping it down the basement stairs to the storage, & not a defective part--be warned, CARRY it down stairs. Should be a no brainer, but it was part of our son's learning curve! To replace the part would be 90.00 at our local repair shop. We decided to recycle it and get another. We love it. The new one seems lighter, which is nice.I've read the brushes underneath don't spin--ours didn't either but it was a minor adjustment and they spin well. I think this is a great product for the money.
