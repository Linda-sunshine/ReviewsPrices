review/summary: Very pleased!review/text: these are great little jugs. The lid is very easy to use. I'm unsure why some people are having issues with these. You just turn the lid and it will tighten up the rubber ring below. The first time I recieved these both jugs were broken. One had a huge crack in the handle and the other's handle was broken off entirely. They were wrapped good. Makes me wonder if they were broken before hand. Anyway, Amazon was great. I put in a return request and I received my new jugs the next day. I can't complain.Thanks!
