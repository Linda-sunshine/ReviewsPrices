review/summary: Very sturdyreview/text: The caddy was very easy to apply and holds several bottles of soap and accesories. It doesn't seem flimsy and the water-resistant strips are dong a great job of holding up the caddy. There was extra strips in the package wich made me feel more comfortable about making a mistake, but the instructions were easy to follow. I held the caddy up to the location I intended for it to stick because I wanted to estimate where I should put the strips. I was able to mount it and didn't have to use the extra strips.
