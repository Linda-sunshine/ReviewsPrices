review/summary: So fresh and so cleanreview/text: Got this to replace my ten year old brita because it was growing mold on it and I needed something smaller to fit in the side of the refidge. So Far, so good. Water tastes fresh and clean. Way more economical and affordable then buying plastic bottles and why would you do that if you care about the environment? or even your health really, everything comes back around full circle and you have to think how many plastic bottles just wind up in the landfill. It doesn't store that much water if that isn't obvious, and it suggest not to go over board filling it up, but I do that anyway. Oh and the filter needs to be touching water because it will dry out if it doesn't, which is bad obv. because it won't clean the water, which is what you want. I think.
