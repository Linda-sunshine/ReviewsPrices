review/summary: The Great and not so great.review/text: First the great. Don't know that I've ever had a better cup of coffee. As smooth as silk and as strong as you care to make it. (I like mine strong)And now the not so great. I'm new to the French Press but I need a better way of disposing of the grounds. I don't want a spotless pot but getting the grounds out is a bit of a pain. Now when summer gets here I'll rinse with a little water and dump them into my compost/worm farm. Winter now and I am fighting it. Still, great coffee. Think Ill make a pot right now. Ummmmmm coffee.
