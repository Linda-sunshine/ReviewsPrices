review/summary: Satisfied customerreview/text: The listing said that this coffee maker was refurbished. Didn't really know what that meant, but the price was great so I took the chance. I couldn't tell the difference between this and a brand new one when I unpacked it. I cook for quite a few people every hunting season, so used it quite a lot in the past three months. It's held up well and makes great coffee, just as expected.
