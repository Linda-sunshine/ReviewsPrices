review/summary: Great productreview/text: I haven't had a chance to use all its features yet, like using the cutting disks. But, I have used it to make dice cold cooked meat and vegetables. It works very well. I have made tofu chocolate pudding and cookie dough. Everything comes out exactly as it should. A great, all-around, everyday kitchen device. Highly recommended.
