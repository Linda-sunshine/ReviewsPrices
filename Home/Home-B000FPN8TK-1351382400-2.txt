review/summary: Tea Infuserreview/text: What a great product! I was shown this recently when staying at a B&B; in Washington State. I've been a tea drinker for many years and really like loose leaf tea. This product makes brewing tea that much easier. You do have to pay attention to the temp of your water, but what a great product.My only critique is that it is plastic. I would have liked a glass container that won't react with some teas. I love Market Spice Tea from Seattle, which reacts or pits plastic.
