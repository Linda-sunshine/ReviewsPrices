review/summary: 20 Yearsreview/text: My wife and I have one working appliance 20 years after our marriage started: A Krups Model 203B grinder. For 20 years, working everyday and grinding coffee beans dutifully to make a great cup of joe. Alas, it is near the end - the cord is fraying slowly, But, I know the grinder reviewed here will be the one that I will buy.So, the five stars is for my soon-to-be-retired 203B model. You served us well! And I trust the new Krups grinder will live just as long....
