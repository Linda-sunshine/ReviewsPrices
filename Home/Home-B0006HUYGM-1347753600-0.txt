review/summary: Piece of Junkreview/text: You'd think from the reviews this would be a no-brainer, but you'd be wrong, Shortly after I started using it the filter on the inside clogged reducing the suction by half. I couldn't use it to even pick up popcorn kernels I spilled.Also, the unit is heavy and loud.
