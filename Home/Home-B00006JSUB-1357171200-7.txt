review/summary: Great Cast Iron Skilletreview/text: This is a great cast iron skillet for the price!!! I purchased it for the size as the one I have is too small if I am making more than 5 pork chops or chicken breasts. However, because its so big its really really heavy to pick up. I often brown my meat in the cast iron skillet on the stove top and then bake it in the oven and it is hard to lift it up to get it in the oven. Other than that this is the greatest skillet for the price. Cleans up really well and does what I need it to do!!!
