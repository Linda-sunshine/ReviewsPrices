review/summary: Good little itemreview/text: Was thinking I needed a &#34;heavy duty&#34; metal one like my mom and grandma before me, but this little guy does a great job when assembled correctly. Only had to take apart and reassemble once when a strip of tendon got wrapped around and kind of slowed things down. Can't wait to try it on some nuts, etc. Using partially frozen meat cut in strips was a great tip!
