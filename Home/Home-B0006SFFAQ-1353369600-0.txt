review/summary: Our Cuisinart 12-cup finally gave of the beans, bit the java, dripped it last.review/text: After almost 8 years of brewing 3000 pots of coffee the old Quisy 1 finally expired. We were so happy with it that we purchased a brand new one from Amazon named it Quizy 2 and placed it where the old Quisy 1 stood, it was sad but also happy knowing that she will be missed, goodbye Qusey 1 we salute you with raised cups.
