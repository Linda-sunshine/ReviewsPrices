review/summary: Subpar qualityreview/text: I very much looked forward to the spiral slicer and used it a couple of times to create zucchini noodles. However, when I used it on carrots, the plastic turn handle broke and this was the end of it. It looks like the slicer is good for softer vegetables, such as zucchini for example, but not as good for harder vegetables such as carrots although the picture on the product suggests otherwise. I wouldn't recommend this product.
