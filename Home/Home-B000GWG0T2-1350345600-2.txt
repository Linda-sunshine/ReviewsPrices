review/summary: Man What A Great Skilletreview/text: I purchased this for my wife since she was looking for a first class skillet to cook eggs, pancakes, and other breakfast items. This is the best non-stick surface she has ever seen! She loves the skillet, and I love the results she cooks in it. What more can you ask for less than $30?Update: She loved the skillet so much that I purchased the 10 piece companion cookware set of the 938 series. This is the best T-FAL we've ever seen!
