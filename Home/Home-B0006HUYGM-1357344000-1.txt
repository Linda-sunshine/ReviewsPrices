review/summary: best little vac everreview/text: this hand held vacuum has powerful suction; I use it exclusively to get dog and cat hair off my couch. It does this beautifully. It's not heavy so I use it on my stair steps as well. The little dust cup is easy to disengage, clean, then put back on. The rotary brush pulls in hair while pulling up the nap on my couch and stairs-- making them look fresh and clean. I love this vac.
