review/summary: Mixer - good and badreview/text: I like the size of the bowl on this mixer, but it is WAY more noisy than my older smaller Kitchen Aid mixer. Also, I find it doesn't mix small quantities very well. For cookies, once I get the dry ingredients into the wet, it mixes well. In the smaller mixer (4 quart?) I could do a batch of bread without a problem. You would think a larger mixer like the 600 series would mix a double batch of bread, but it often overheats when I try.
