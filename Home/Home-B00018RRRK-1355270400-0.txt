review/summary: Great coffee grinderreview/text: I had a small Krups for years and thought I was happy. Then I bought this mill and absolutely love it. It's true that it is a little messy - but it's not hard to clean. I love being able to adjust the grind the fit my taste, the coffee and the coffee maker - all can vary. Hit the button and presto - custom ground coffee!
