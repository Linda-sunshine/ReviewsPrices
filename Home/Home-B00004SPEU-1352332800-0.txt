review/summary: Coffee Grinder Reviewreview/text: Its ok; i like how it looks, how easy it is to use and how small it is but it does this thing were some of the coffee or oatmeal that i grind gets left over inside and i got to go in and force it out. Cleaning is also a hassle since it cannot be cleansed with water. Yup, pretty much got what i paid for. :)
