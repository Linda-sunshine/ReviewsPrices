review/summary: Quick Coffee Maker..review/text: The Bunn NHBB Velocity Brew 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer, Black is a must have for coffee lovers who can't wait for that first cup of coffee each morning. This coffee maker brews a full pot in less than three minutes. It has a nice appearance and the construction is solid. This unit has a swivel lid for the reservoir. Another previously owned Bunn Coffee Maker I had several years ago used a flip top lid on the reservoir. The swivel top hasn't presented any problem but I prefer the flip top because it's a little more convenient. This household model Bunn has a stainless water storage tank that keeps the water heated to 200 degrees as long as the hot water switch is turned on. When you add cold water to the reservoir, the heated water is used to brew the coffee as the cold water refills the tank. There are two separate On/Off switches, one for the heated water tank and another for the coffee maker. The basket filter housing is easily removed for adding coffee and cleaning. The lid for the pot uses a flip hinge and if you're not careful, you could spill coffee if the lid flips open while pouring. Using a little finger pressure on the lid while pouring will eliminate this possibility. Overall this is a very nice coffee maker. It brews a great cup of coffee and I would recommend it for other customers.After your purchase be sure to follow the manufacturers instructions, or you can inadvertently burn up your new coffee maker before it's ever used. This is because water must be added to the heated tank before you turn on the heater. The instructions provided are very easy to follow.Please rate this review if you found it helpful.
