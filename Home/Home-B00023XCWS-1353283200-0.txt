review/summary: Much faster than the tea kettlereview/text: Bought this for my tea drinking wife to see if I could reduce the boil-overs we kept getting on the tea kettle she kept on the stove pretty much all day. She really likes this, as it only takes a few minutes to get up to heat, and I don't have to worry about effects of boil-overs on the electric elements.
