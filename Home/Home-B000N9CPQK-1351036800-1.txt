review/summary: Permanent filter clogs and is unreplaceablereview/text: the permanent filter clogs, and I was not able to clean as directed with a vacuum cleaner- when doing so the pleats became flattened and continued to be noticeably filled with dirt. And after doing this the air output was not increased at all. Also the permanent filters are not replaceable so I am back trying to buy a whole new product
