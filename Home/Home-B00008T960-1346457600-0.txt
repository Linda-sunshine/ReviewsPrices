review/summary: Unstickablereview/text: This is one of the coolest products that I have bought for my kitchen. Nothing sticks to this, period. The stickiest of substances peels right off the silicone surface and it will always lay flat even after being rolled or heated. I store it rolled up in a drawer and as soon as I remove the rubber band it pops right back to the original shape!
