review/summary: Good Home Use Machinereview/text: I like this expresso and cappuccino maker. This is the first one I have ever owned and it was fairly simple to learn how to make a good cappuccino.It does take some time to heat up so you need to not be in a hurry. It also takes longer then I expected to steam my milk. But it does deliver a good product.Only complaint is that I can not seem to find the &#34;pod&#34; that the instructions say will work with the machine.Over all though very happy.
