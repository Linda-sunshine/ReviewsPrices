review/summary: Great single serving coffee maker!review/text: I was hesitant to get one of these for the longest time but really glad we finally caved and bought one. It is very convenient. I love that my husband and I can make the coffee of our choice rather than have to make an entire pot of something we don't agree on. It's also great for hot cocoa and tea. The water chamber holds a pretty good amount. We still have to refill a couple times a week but that is a really simple process. I was worried this would take up too much space on my counter, but it fits perfectly where our traditional coffee maker used to sit. I think the only downside for me is storing all of the little K-cups of coffee.
