review/summary: Deceived on How "BIG" it Really isreview/text: Very disappointed. Feel deceived. The "BIG GRIDDLE" is really NOT THATBIG". Actual physical dimensions and cooking surface dimensions arehugely different. They tell you how big it is in overall measurementsbut don't clearly tell you that a lot of the size is really just aplastic boarder around the griddle. The boarder IS the "Cool Touch"base. A cooking size deception. The issue is it measures out overall to396.75 square inches (2.75 square ft) but is only actually 285 square inches(1.98square ft). Actually it is 25 percent smaller than it looks.Meaning it looks huge, like 396 square inches (2.75 square ft) but youonly can use only 285 (1.98 square ft). I know, you ask, "Couldn't youtell by the box?". No, I bought it online thinking that there would beno deception from an old company like PRESTO. Also The Food NetworkSells the same item at Kohl's in a different box for $10.00 cheaperthan what I paid. They call it a 22 inch griddle. They lie there tooand say "Manufactured by The Food Network". Unless Presto and The FoodNetwork are connected.Advertised Depth: 23.0 inchesCooking Surface Depth: 19.00 inchesAdvertised Width: 17.25 inchesCooking Surface Depth: 15.0 inches
