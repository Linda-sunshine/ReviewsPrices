review/summary: Had to buy another as a gift so I could get MINE back!review/text: I hadn't seen this type of hand-held vac before, but I was impressed by the reviews. It's most unique and rivals the industrial hose vacs you see at car washes! My daughter and son-in-law borrowed it--they always had an excuse for not returning it. The day they finally returned it I had received this one, which I gave to them as a gift. Everybody is happy now!
