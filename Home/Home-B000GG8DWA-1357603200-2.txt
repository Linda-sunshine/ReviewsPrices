review/summary: This is a great little heater!review/text: We bought this after a lot of research. We live in Central Oregon and it gets cold here. We needed a small heater so we could climate-control one of our storage sheds on our property. We did not want it to get below freezing in there and this heater was perfect. We have used it now for a few months and it has done the trick. We will see how many winters it will last through, but I forsee no problems.
