review/summary: pretty and cut, but doesn't produce humidity!review/text: Yes, it's so cute as a humidifier, and it really makes a lot of fog. But, I felt very thirsdy and need to drink twice during a night! The same as without the kitty. So, the only way is to return it. And I am still looking for a good and effective humidifier now.
