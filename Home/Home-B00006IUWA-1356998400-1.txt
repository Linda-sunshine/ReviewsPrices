review/summary: This thing works!review/text: Small enough to store away, very simple design and virtually no clean-up involved. 3 1/2 minute popping time for a 1/2 cup of unpopped corn (which will fill a medium sized mixing bowl once popped). The kids love to watch as well. Great price for a great product! I'll never go back to microwave popcorn again.
