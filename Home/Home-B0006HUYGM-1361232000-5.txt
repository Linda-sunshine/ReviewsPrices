review/summary: I like it!review/text: Not one to usually write reviews, but I think you should know. It's very easy to use, the suction is great, easy to clean, and the roller on the bottom is absolutely perfect for car mats, the fiber ones that has everything sticking to it. Only downside is it's a bit heavy and off course the fact that it's not portable without plugging the cord in, but they say the cordless ones never come close in suction to the ones that plug-in.
