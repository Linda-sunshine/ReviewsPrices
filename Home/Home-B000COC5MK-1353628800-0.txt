review/summary: Great Purchase!!!!review/text: I have had this wine opener for about a month. We use it a few times a week and it works flawlessly! It comes with a little tool to cut the foil on the bottle first. Make sure you do this before using the opener,it will reduce the amount of stress on the device. It is very tall, but does not take up too much counter space. I leave it plugged in most of the time. I am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend it to anyone who drinks wine from time to time. Prime shipping from amazon was perfect as always.
