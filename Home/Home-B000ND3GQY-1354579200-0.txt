review/summary: This wok sits on my stove top perfectlyreview/text: The Cuisinart wok / stir-fry pan is just what I needed. Heavyweight stainless steel with the aluminum core base is stable on my stove and cleans up very well. The see-through lid is a nice touch, too. This wok is large and the best place I have found for storing it is on top of my refrigerator. Very glad I got it!
