review/summary: Over Rated Coffee Makerreview/text: The pros: coffee is always hot, and is not sitting on a hot plate.The cons: very difficult to pour, because it also drips out of the lid. Extremely difficult to clean the lid. Some coffee seems to stay in the lid, and takes too long to drain out. This product is not very consumer friendly, if you want to keep it clean.We always used a Braun 560 and loved it, but is not available anymore. We are very disappointed in the Cuisinart.
