review/summary: Bread makerreview/text: I have tried this machine twice. The first time I made the wheat bread from the booklet that came with the machine. It was very good the first slice then the rest cumbled into an pile of crumbs when I tried to slice it. The top of the loaf had large air holes. The second time I used the white bread recipe and the top had large wholes in it also. Please advise what to do about it.
