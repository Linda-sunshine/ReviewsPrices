review/summary: Excellent humidifierreview/text: This worked very well, and concentrated the flow of mist toward the person's face while in bed, which is what the doctor said a humidifier should do. After my son and his wife used it for several months on a regular basis for their baby, the fan quit working. I was disappointed that it quit working, as it was a good humidifier. But, they did use it a lot. I just thought it would last longer. My youngest, teenage son liked it better than another we got on sale later. I would recommend the penguin humifidier. I don't imagine others will use it as much as my son and his wife did, so maybe it quit because of their using it so much.
