review/summary: Great coffeemakerreview/text: The stainless steel carafe is light weight and pours well. Coffee remains very hot for hours!The brewing cycle is fast. I like the swing door to place in the cone filters. The stationary water dispenser works well as I use filtered water from a pitcher.My old coffeemaker, Braun, not longer makes coffeemakers (Loved it!); this has been a good replacement. I would have preferred a 10-cup, but the 12-cup received better reviews.
