review/summary: Customer service like it should be.review/text: Juicer worked great during about 4 months of heavy use. Then had an issue of the motor running fine, but the cutter-strainer basket not turning. The customer service was what really impressed me. They sent a replacement part instantly. I'm used to calling and getting a representative with limited knowledge and even less latitude. I didn't think of Hamilton Beach as a premiere brand at all, but they have premiere customer service. They're really friendly; they know exactly what they're talking about. They even have sample appliances right in the call center where they can look at exactly what you're looking at. The replacement part didn't fit because it had somewhat 'fused' to its connector. The supervisor determined almost instantly the mechanical problem that had occurred and, maybe because the unit was for an elderly person (whom I was helping), authorized a complete replacement. I honestly used to think of this company as just another Wal-Mart-level brand, but it's definitely in the running for future purchases based almost solely on my confidence in their support if I ever have an issue.
