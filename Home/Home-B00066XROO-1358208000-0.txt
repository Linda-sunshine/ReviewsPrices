review/summary: Plenty of space for French toastreview/text: This griddle is working out well for us. We needed something that wasn't too expensive but had room for plenty of food, and this fits the bill. In a perfect world it would be easier to store--it's unwieldy--but you can cook a ton of bacon on this.
