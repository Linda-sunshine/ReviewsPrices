review/summary: noisy but not badreview/text: It's very noisy, i can't hear the others talking with me while it is working. But as a function, it boils the water within 5 minutes and it keeps it warn also but not for a long time. It's very easy to grip and even not so heavy when it's totally full.To recommend it!! I don't know, actually it depends on.
