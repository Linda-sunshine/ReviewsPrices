review/summary: Bad designreview/text: The machine vibrates severely and makes loud noise during the coffee making process. The rubber feet do nothing to damp the vibration. If I don't hold the cup on the platform, the cup will drop to the ground. I've never seen such a poorly working coffee machine!It is almost unusable at home. I'll return the machine for refund.
