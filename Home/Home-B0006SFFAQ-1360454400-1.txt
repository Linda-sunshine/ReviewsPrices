review/summary: The best coffee maker I've ever had.review/text: I purchased this as a replacement for the same coffee maker that was worn out after 5 years of use. I absolutely love this coffee maker. I can choose the temperature I want the coffee to stay at. Not only does it ake wonderful cofee; but, I particularly like the fact that it can stay on for up to four hours before turning off which is a feature not available on most coffee makers. I've tried many other brands over the years and nothing comes close to this coffee maker.
