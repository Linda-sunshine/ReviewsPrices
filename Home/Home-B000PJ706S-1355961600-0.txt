review/summary: Excellent, don't listen to the othersreview/text: A beautifully-designed, solid, easy-to-use SUPERFAST kettle. I bought one for several people and they all love it. I experienced NO PLASTIC SMELL at all. Perhaps those folks didn't run a few kettles-worth of water before drinking it. I'm picky and I just love this product. It's definitely worth the money.
