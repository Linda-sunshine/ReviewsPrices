review/summary: Quality Builtreview/text: I received this the day after I ordered it. So fired it up and it works great. Very powerful motor and easy to clean. It makes short work of veggies and fruits. The manual that comes with it also has some recipes to get you started so I used a few of them.The fruit juice it makes isn't watery, its a little thick but not like a smoothie.I would recommend this to buy. We put it to the test with a lot of beets and several different fruits and veggies, no problems.
