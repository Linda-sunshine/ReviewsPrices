review/summary: Great For Fast Pickupsreview/text: I originally wanted a lightweight, easy to use, yet powerful vacuum for my carpeted steps.This product fits the bill. I've also used it on my furniture - it is less cumbersome and easier touse than my regular vacuum attachments. It works well for fast pickup in the kitchen and small messesanywhere in the house. The powerful suction impresses me.
