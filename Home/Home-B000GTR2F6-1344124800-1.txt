review/summary: Keurig b70... more trouble than it's worth!review/text: I received the Keurig B70 model as a Christmas present upon request. I was very happy and excited to use this brewer and k-cups, and it worked fine for approx. 8 months. I followed the cleaning and de-scaling instructions, but it would intermittently have trouble brewing. It would work after re-booting, but progressively got worse. The coffee maker lasted for a year and a half, and at that point it completely quit. De-scaling didn't work, and it seemed that the system sounded like it was trying to brew a cup, but the water would never come out. The support line was extremely unhelpful. All they recommended was cleaning the system, and unclogging the tips. After telling them I did this twice in one week with no help, all they could offer me was a $70 discount towards a new Keurig coffee maker since it was past the one year warranty. Spending $150 on a coffee maker that lasts a year and a half is ridiculous! Why would I buy another one?
