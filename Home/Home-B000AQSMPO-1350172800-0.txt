review/summary: Worked good for 15 months, then died and no longer under warrantyreview/text: I have had my coffee maker since 7/22/2011. It has been used daily to make anywhere from 3-4 cups of coffee per day. I am the only who ever used it. It has been descaled twice following the Keurig instructions and worked great.About a week ago I noticed hot plastic smells in the kitchen and finally realized it was from the coffee maker so I shut it off. I turned it on later and it worked just fine with no smell for about a week. I wake up this morning and it is completely dead. And Keurig has only a 1 year warranty.I'm sorry, but 1 year on an item that costs so much money is a major fail in my book. It should come with a 3 year warranty at the very minimum. I have enjoyed having the convenience of having any type of coffee I want with the change of a pod. But I cannot see buying another unit with a warranty that is so short. It looks like it's back to Mr. Coffee and gourmet roasts from the grinder for me.Anyone want about 80 pods?UPDATE: I emailed Keurig, they replaced the entire unit for free. No questions, no problems. It restored my faith in them as a company although I don't think it should have shorted out and stopped working. Please quit sending stuff to China to be made; things made over there DO NOT LAST.
