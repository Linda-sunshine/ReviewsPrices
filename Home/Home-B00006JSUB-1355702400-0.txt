review/summary: I finally have a cast iron skillet!review/text: I have been wanting a cast iron skillet, but have not had success seasoning them. This one comes seasoned and ready to go. 12&#34; size great for many recipes. My only criticism is the longer handle seems a little small for the size of the skillet, but having the smaller handle helps. Can't wait to use it some more.
