review/summary: Wonderfulreview/text: These are soft, beautiful, decently priced sheets. I purchased the smokey blue color which looks great with a powder blue bedspread. The first night I spelt in these sheets I did not want to get up in the morning, they were so soft and wonderful. They also went through the wash just fine, just use the delicate cycle!
