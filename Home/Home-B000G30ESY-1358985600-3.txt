review/summary: Love itreview/text: I'm not going to pretend that i'm an expert on rice cookers. I'll just say that this thing makes having rice as easy as can be. it does take a little time, but it's worth it to be able to just measure out the rice and water, set the machine and walk away. Keeps it warm for hours and hours. A little pricey, but i'm considering buying the bread maker too. If it's half as easy as this, it's a must have.
