review/summary: Awesome little popper!review/text: This popcorn popper works great! It is quick, leaves only a few unpopped kernels and never burns or scorches. It is a bit loud, but since it only takes about 2 minutes it isn't a big deal. I love that this popcorn is healthier and I can control the amount of butter and salt that is added. Very good buy for a much lower price than other poppers. Would gladly buy again. We have been using this at least once a week for about 6 months and have had zero problems.
