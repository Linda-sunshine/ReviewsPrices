review/summary: Yes, it's stainless steelreview/text: I'd imagine most are buying this particular kettle b/c it's made of stainless steel everywhere water touches (except, perhaps the &#34;mineral deposit filter&#34;, which can actually be removed). That just about the only positive (albeit a crucial one) for this kettle. The only other one I can think of is the fact that the lid is completely and easily removable if you ever need to clean the kettle (I've never needed to do so for many years I've owned electric kettles).Cons:1. Can't easily see the water level (ok, it's minor and we knew to expect it from product images)2. When you remove the working kettle from the base, the little switch does not go into &#34;off&#34; position like it does on every other kettle I've seen which utilizes this kind of on/off &#34;pedal&#34; switch (meaning you put the kettle back -- it'll be on again)3. Auto-shut-off takes at least 30 seconds after vigorous boiling starts, you do think at least 5 times that it's broken before the kettle shuts off. I'm coming from a Saeco kettle and a Brown before it -- both were shutting off within 5 seconds of water coming to a boil. I wonder how it behaves when there's no water and it's on -- does it cause fire before it shuts off?4. When pouring water with the lid closed (like you should) you should pour it very (and I mean VERY) slowly, otherwise the stream of water splits into 3 (the lid does it) with the distance between the left and the right exceeding diameter of many typical cups. I wonder if whoever designed this kettle ever tried to use it him-/her-self5. There's still some dripping (very little, but I tend to think it might get worse, like it did with Saeco this HB replaced)Bottom line: if I knew of another all-stainless-steel kettle, I'd return this one right away
