review/summary: So Soft, BUT!review/text: I decided to go with a four star review because these sheets are extremely soft and ultimately I like them. But they are not without a caveat, they pill and shed a lot. I bought the cream colored sheets and after I sleep in them I have small cream colored balls of lint all over myself and on the carpet next to my bed. I have washed/dried them twice now and the amount of lint being produced has only slowed a little. I would definitely empty your lint trap before/after drying these as it will fill it up! Despite an exceptional amount of lint loss, these sheets are still very, very soft, even after washing. Their lint problem is unfortunate but I think they are worth the trouble. WARNING: The cream color is a bit darker than it appears in the picture, knowing that I probably would have gone with white.
