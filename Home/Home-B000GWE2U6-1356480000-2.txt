review/summary: Cute and Functionalreview/text: We've been buying these humidifiers for my daughter's room for a few years now. Even though we have a whole house system attached to our furnace, she needs a little extra. This year she wanted the owl--perhaps because she is a Harry Potter fan--so that is the one we got! It has been working well, and we continue to be pleased with this product
