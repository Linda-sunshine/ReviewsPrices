review/summary: So far, so greatreview/text: I have only used this twice, but this Panasonic has made two great loaves of bread and it couldn't be easier to use.In contrast, the Cuisinart that I had tried didn't produce nearly as nice bread. Annoying, the Cuisinart's paddle also stuck fast in the loaf and had to be cut out. So far, no such problems with this Panasonic.However, cosmetically, this Panasonic had two light scratches: one on the glass and one in the liner. While I didn't dock any stars (I don't care about appearances that much), I was a bit surprised to receive a cosmetically flawed product from Panasonic.
