review/summary: Best electric kettle on the marketreview/text: I broke down and purchased this kettle a year or so after seeing and using it at a friends place for about a week. I've now owned mine for a few months. It boils water super fast and works flawlessly. For my money there simply isn't a better electric kettle on the market.There is a safety cutout that kicks in if you use it with water below the minimum level indicator. I believe that functions to protect the element from overheating if you try and use the kettle with the element exposed to air (above the minimum water level). I did read some reviews blabbering on about some kind of smell from the kettle and based on my own personal experience I'd have to say they're hallucinating. I don't regret my purchase one bit, and I'd buy it again if I broke it.
