review/summary: Excellent!review/text: My wife and I have had this kettle for four or five years now. It still works amazingly well. There is not a sign of rust or tarnish. It heats the water quickly. My mother-in-law has gone through three other kettles (different brands) in the same time we've had this one kettle. We use it every day. You can't go wrong with this kettle.
