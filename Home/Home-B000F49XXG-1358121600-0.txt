review/summary: Pretty standard espresso machinereview/text: I think this machine works well, but is a bit overpriced. The only thing that really bothers me about this model is that it shakes when it's making espresso, causing my espresso cup to dance all over the stand! I have to hold it in place when the liquid comes out. The machine does look very sleek though.
