review/summary: Won't even turn on. Worst Christmas gift I've ever given anyone. Seems like Junk.review/text: My friend and I are into cooking and healthy living so I thought this would be a great gift to send her for the holidays. I spend a LOT of time thinking of what to get her and always want to give people the perfect gifts. After quite a bit of thought and researching, I decided, even though this food processor might not be the most expensive/largest, that it still seemed decent enough to do the job. Wrong. I am so devastated to find out that upon my friend excitedly trying her new present, it wouldn't even turn on! She had added soft ingredients that even a cheap blender could handle, but it didn't even try. She was so upset to have to tell me that my gift to her didn't work - she tried reading the entire manual, cleaning it, plugging into several different outlets, and searching online for remedies prior to breaking down and letting me know. I've ordered several products from amazon throughout the years, and this is by far the most disappointed I have every felt in the history of my online ordering. This is the only one star review I've ever given. I just wish it would have happened to me and not someone I was trying to send a Christmas gift to half way across the country! Seems like a real piece of junk. Save yourself the heartache and do NOT trust this to work!
