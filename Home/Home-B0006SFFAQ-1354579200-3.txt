review/summary: Good Coffee Maker Until It Breaksreview/text: This coffee maker has been working well for a couple of years but, just today, the toggle switch stopped working. After much internet searching and a call to the customer service center, I have discovered that there is no way to fix the machine or have it repaired for a reasonable price. Of course, if the coffee maker weren't a gift and I had the receipt, I could've shipped the coffee maker to Cuisinart at my expense and had them fix it and they would've shipped it back at my expense. The customer service representative said that there was really nothing I could do to salvage the machine. She said just throw it away. So while the coffee maker is good otherwise, the absence of service options makes it a poor choice for a gift or for someone who wants a hassle-free experience.
