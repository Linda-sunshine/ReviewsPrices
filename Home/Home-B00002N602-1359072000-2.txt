review/summary: My first pressure cookerreview/text: The fist time I used this pressure cooker I was very anxious and nervous, because it was the first time I cooked or even knew about a pressure cooker. Easy to assemble, nice looking, everything fits (for a family of four), steam noise.So for my first experience, I cooked beans and came out delicious. Cut the time from 2 hrs and a half to 1 hr. couldn't be better. I am no longer anxious to use it, now I am looking forward to make more recipe in my pressure cooker.
