review/summary: Loved it so much bought 2 as giftsreview/text: I was a little skeptical about this ice cream maker after reading some of the negative reviews but bought it anyhow about 6 months ago. We love it! It makes great ice cream -- just keep the container in our freezer and it's ready to go. We've tried a variety of recipes and all have worked great. The ice cream is fresh and fabulous. WE bought two as Christmas gifts because it's such a great machine.
