review/summary: awful product. burned popcornreview/text: My mom has an air popper that works very well and this product strongly resembled hers. I just got the air popper today, and after trying it out, I'm extremely disappointed. I think that the problem is that the popper does not blow enough air to blow the popped popcorn out before it's burned, so that what makes it to the bowl is a bunch of burned popcorn. And only half of the kernels even popped. Maybe less than half. I'm extremely disappointed and I'll be attempting to return the product asap.
