review/summary: WAS great, until... danger!review/text: Wonderful taste, simple design, workhorse coffee maker since June 2010 when I purchased this coffeemaker on Amazon. Today, a holy hell of burning plastic odor, boiling coffee, plus black smoke frightened my household. The heating element seems to have overheated and melted down all the internal wiring. Thank goodness I was right in the kitchen as it was happening, so I quickly unplugged it and set it outside on the concrete driveway. I thought I had no recourse with Cuisinart since it is more than a year old, and apparently this is a common and known problem - based on a few more web searches. IF you have this coffee maker, please be careful! I am so disappointed, since my good old $20 Mister Coffee from 1994 is still going strong, and this $90 Cuisinart scorched my countertop and almost started a fire in my home.**UPDATE** I called Cuisinart customer service at 800-726-0190. Had to wait a few minutes, but got a very pleasant person on the line. Excellent resolution: Cuisinart made some heating element changes on models made after January 2012. All I need to do is mail them the snipped-off power cord with a note and the service number they told me over the phone. They are mailing me a brand-new model from an AZ warehouse, should be here in about 7 days. I gave back one more star for excellent customer service.Scary, but resolved well. If your DCC-1200 is older than January 2012, make sure it is off when unattended!
