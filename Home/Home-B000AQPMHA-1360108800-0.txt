review/summary: Not for a coffee-loverreview/text: I wanted to love this machine because it's difficult to get a good cup of coffee for just one person. The Keurig B40 seemed like exactly what I needed. Well, the concept is good, it works quickly and without any mess. The problem is the coffee that comes out of the machine. I've tried about a dozen different K-cups and they ALL taste like very weak instant coffee. I thought this might be because I'm used to grinding my own fresh beans every morning, so I bought a refillable cup and put my own freshly ground beans in it. Still tastes like water, even the darker roast beans, and even when I fill the filter right to the very top with grounds. I've ground them finer and finer until they were too fine to stay in the filter. Still watery. Also, the cup of water/coffee gets cold before I can drink the whole cup, and I don't linger over my morning coffee! The think the main problem with these machines is twofold: The water doesn't get hot enough, and it passes over the coffee beans too quickly to absorb any actual coffee flavor. It makes for a super-fast cup but not a coffee-flavored drink. I've replaced the first one I bought, thinking it was just that particular machine, but the replacement was exactly the same. My dad has the Mini B31 and his makes stronger coffee. I may try that one next but from the reviews I've read I don't have much hope that it'll be any better. One other thing - it has two size settings, the larger is supposed to be for a travel mug. Well even my regular coffee mug is only filled slightly more than half way when I use the larger setting, and of course it makes the coffee even weaker with more water running through it. Who's travel mug only holds 9 ounces of coffee? Even a regular coffee mug holds at least 12 ounces.
