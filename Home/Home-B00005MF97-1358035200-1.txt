review/summary: Major design flaw + hard to clean topreview/text: I like that this is a small food processor and can be used quickly for small jobs. However, there are problems with this chopper that I'm very surprised more people haven't experienced, which have left me quite disappointed with this product.First of all, I mostly use this to process almonds into almond flour. The chopper works by holding the lid down on the middle part and pressing one of the buttons to activate the motor to spin the blades. But when I put small items like almonds into the chopper, they get caught under the lower blade and I can't push the middle part down! It gets very difficult and annoying to place my food such that it does not get in the way.Secondly, if you're dealing with food that is thinner or more liquidy, beware that it will splash to the top and get stuck in crevices. The top is connected to the cord, so you can't wash it - only wipe it with a cloth, which isn't the same as being able to wash it.Lastly, this chopper does not combine food as well as a regular food processor. You might expect this from a smaller unit such as this, but I have had much better results using the smaller cup unit in a regular-sized food processor.
