review/summary: Fantastic Espresso Machine!review/text: This is great machine. I have worked in a coffee shop, so I know good coffee, and this machines brews it well! It's very easy to clean to. The site recommends you buy the tamper with it, but I don't it's necessary, the machine has one built in, but I did buy the 12oz frothing pitcher and it works perfectly with the size of the machine! I am able to switch on the machine while I'm getting ready in the morning and then brew an espresso in just minutes. It is very fast and easy to use, which I love. Before I bought this machine, I would purchase around 3 Starbucks drinks a week, and that really adds up. In having my machine for just about a month, i think it has already payed for itself. This investment will save you a ton of money if you are anything like me.One thing to be cautious of when brewing is that it is not automatically. You have to turn it off when you decide you've brewed enough espresso. The first few time I used the machine, I let it brew for too long and the espresso came out too diluted. Once I got the hang of it, it turned out much better!As far as machines go, I could not have picked a better one! I highly recommend it!
