review/summary: Great little tumbler!review/text: I don't usually write reviews for stuff I buy, but I felt this tumbler deserved it. This little guy is worth every penny. It keeps my coffee hot, not lukewarm, hot, for 3 or so hours. I haven't tried using the tea infuser lid yet, but the regular lid doesn't leak at all. It's a little smaller than the tumblers I'm used to, but it's the perfect size for the "large cup" setting on my Keurig.
