review/summary: Surprisingly, Amazon missing out vital informationreview/text: I purchased TWO of this appliance sometime ago based on the amazing reviews I found here. Had it delivered by Amazon to my Aramex account (as I'm from Qatar) and then had it shopped onto my local address by paying as much as the device costs; I though what the hell if its that good.I finally receive it, unbox it and look on the power converting switch yet fail to find any.I may not be the electric geek of this online community, but ANY device that operates on 110v either a) can switch automatically to 220v or b) Has a built in switch so you match with you power.Amazon absolutely failed to mention that it is strictly operating on 110/has no other option.Thanks to them, one is absolutely wrecked and I have to go look search for a convertor so I can gift it with the other one, if I won't just throw it away.I am sure Presto wouldn't be very happy knowing this story.This is not my first purchase through Amazon, but is certainly the last since they seem to not want to go outside the US Market. If you shop it overseas, put information for overseas users
