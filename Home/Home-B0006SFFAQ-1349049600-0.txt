review/summary: Deserves a minus one starreview/text: We owned this coffee maker previously, it lasted about 7 years. After being so impressed with the quality, we purchased the same maker again. It just died after 1 year. We did a google search on the maker, people have had problems with it catching on fire, the coffee ended up boiling while sitting in the carafe, etc. My husband took it apart and discovered the heating element went bad. I'm thankful it just died and didn't catch my kitchen on fire. Don't waste your money.
