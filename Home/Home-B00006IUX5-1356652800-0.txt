review/summary: Small, but works great for Herbs!review/text: Not a bad grinder for the value. I sometimes use it to grind some coffee beans, but it is a little small for that. Though it compacts up very nicely and don't see any problems with it working. Simple and easy to use. Though I did grind some hot peppers with it and it eroded the metal finish near the blades, so make sure to clean it off when you are done with any acidic or alkaline oils!Pros:-It grinds everything that I needCons:-Smaller then the average grinder-Finish gets eroded if not taken care of inside the grinder. (I am pretty sure that isn't good to ingest)Cheap, but works nicely for what I want.
