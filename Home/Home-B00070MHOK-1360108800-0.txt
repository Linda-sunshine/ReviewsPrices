review/summary: Super simple, travel friendly, and QUICK!review/text: This little steamer heats up quickly, is light weight and easy to pack, and I'm never concerned about leaks. Its super simple to use (unscrew cap, add water to line, plug in - DONE) and is powerful. I even used it to relieve some congestion I had by locking myself into the teeny hotel bathroom and filling it with steam :D Very versatile!I wish the reservoir was larger though, because I can't use it for more than a single outfit before having to refill it (which requires a five minute cool down first - and then a reheat). However, I'm sure a larger reservoir would cause the device to be larger and really the compact travel aspect is the most important.
