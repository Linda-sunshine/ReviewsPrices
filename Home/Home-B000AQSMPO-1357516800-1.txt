review/summary: Great Purchasereview/text: LOVE MY KEURIG! It arrived early, which is always exciting, and I have loved every minute of trying the different coffees and teas, and enjoying an easy, quick, no mess, and most importantly, DELICIOUS, cup of coffee!I drink 1-3 cups a day, usually never more than 2 in the morning, so, for me, it is the perfect solution. For the person who finishes a pot before even starting their day, the costs could add up rather quickly (I estimate its about 60 cents per k- cup).Very happy with purchase-- highly recommend!
