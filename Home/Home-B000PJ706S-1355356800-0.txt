review/summary: Works Greatreview/text: My mother recieved this for Christmas one year but gave it to me because she did not have any use for it. Mine has never put off the chemical smell that the other reviewers have experienced so maybe I am lucky. I gave 5 stars because it boils water VERY fast, faster than the microwace or stove. I use this to make hot cocoa and tea at least 4 to 5 times per week.
