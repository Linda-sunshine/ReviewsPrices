review/summary: Good for +/- 1 yearreview/text: This is our 3rd steam vac for home use. Our first was a hoover and it did a decent job for about 5 years. Our 2nd unit was a different brand that was less expensive, but lasted only about 2 years. So, we decided to get a new Hoover SteamVac with Clean Surge. After only 1 year, the brushes have stopped spinning and the cleaning solution leaks internally onto the carpet. Even worse, the hand held device is completely worthless. Leakage at the base unit leaves a big puddle, the spray will not turn off when not engaged and the suction is ineffective. Total frustration trying to work with this machine. I am in the process of researching for a better product. One that works as advertised and will hold up to more that 1 year of occasional use.
