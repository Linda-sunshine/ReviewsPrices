review/summary: Green tea smell is really strong but the mattress topper is still a great value!review/text: We love the memory foam topper. When I rolled out the mattress topper I was not impressed because the smell was so overwhelming. It wasn't as thick as I thought it would be until the next day. However, the first night sleeping on this mattress felt so comfortable since we have an old mattress it was such a good value because originally we were planning on purchasing a new mattress all together. This purchase saved us a ton of money. We felt like we were sleeping on a plush cloud. It's a great purchase I would recommend it to a friend.
