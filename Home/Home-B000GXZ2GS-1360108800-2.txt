review/summary: Makes GREAT coffeereview/text: Since I found the AeroPress, I have become much more intolerant of poor quality cups of coffee. The exquisite, smooth flavor which is the end result of the AeroPress process has pretty much ruined me for most coffee in restaurants. I have one large mug in the morning and my tastebuds are satisfied. Before I started making coffee this way, I would often drink an entire pot of coffee.You must pay attention to the directions; be sure to stir the coffee as directed, do NOT boil the water, slowly press down on the tube. I had to experiment with the grind to get the right one but now I have that wonderful, satisfying cup daily. I take this on airplane trips with me as well; it packs easily along with enough coffee to keep me happy!This was recommended to me by a chef and I have since found many baristas using this at home.
