review/summary: Great Value, great humidifier!review/text: This is the 3rd humidifier I purchased for my baby's room. And after dealing with leaky and loud humidifiers I was at the end of my rope. Bought this based in CR reviews and value. IT'S PERFECT! Super quiet, holds a lot of water so I can put it on high for our large room and it lasts all night. Great buy plus it's cute!
