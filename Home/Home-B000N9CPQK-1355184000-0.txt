review/summary: Works for my needsreview/text: I've never needed an air purifier for allergies or the such so I have no expertise in that area. I primarily bought this because if I don't sleep with my windows closed, it gets ridiculously cold during the night and I'll wake up feeling sick, but if I close all my windows, my room smells kind of musky after a few days. Thus I thought I would buy this to alleviate the musky smell. It works for the most part and provides a nice "white-noise" that I really do not mind, although some light sleepers may have issues with this.One thing though. I stopped using this for about a week, and I noticed that ants had invaded it and made a nice little nest. Not sure what drew the ants to the filter, but had to clean them out of there.
