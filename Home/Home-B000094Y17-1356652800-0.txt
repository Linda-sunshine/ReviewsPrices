review/summary: Good pitcher, a little strange at timesreview/text: I have never had a Brita pitcher before, as I had great well water, but now with city water, I wanted one. It hugely improves the taste of the water. It is a little odd to use, however. As the large pitcher, it is rather heavy when full. Also, when you fill it, the filter is rather slow to process the water, making it top-heavy for a while. If you put enough water in to automatically refill for a while, when it is easy to have water spilling out of the top.
