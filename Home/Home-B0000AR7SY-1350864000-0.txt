review/summary: Typical Italian Equipmentreview/text: I purchased this grinder about 6 months ago along with a Moccamaster coffee maker.The former has been a troublesome addition to our kitchen. Coffee grinds somehow find their way into the inner works and prevent it from engaging the grinder gears. It then needs to be taken apart and cleaned out. This has happened about 20 times over the 6 months and caught me in the wrong mood this morning when I was looking forward to a quick cup of joe. It went straight into the garbage bin. I doubt I will buy Italian anything again after this and a previous Italian coffee maker which met a similar fate.
