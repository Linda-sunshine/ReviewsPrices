review/summary: Not as good as an antique Wagnerreview/text: This is fine and works well out of the box. I use it frequently. The out-of-box seasoning leaves a lot to be desired, but that is easily fixed with a couple of hours work. I'm on the lookout for a larger Wagner (I only have an 8 inch Wagner skillet, too small for many uses) to replace this with. The older cast iron had smoother cooking surfaces, so it seasoned better and was more non-stick.If you're on the fence, buy this. It is a great introduction to cast iron cooking.
