review/summary: Suck! This vacuum can really suckreview/text: I bought this vacuum with one goal and that was to clean my car without going to the car wash and use their vacuums. I couldn't believe how much power this little guy has. Its amazing and the brushes do an extra great job. I use it to clean my couch, cracks in the couch, crevices on my wood table corners and steps. I had no idea that this vacuum would be this great. I also think it has more power than my regular vacuum (now considering replacing that with a eureka). Never thought i would love a vacuum...............
