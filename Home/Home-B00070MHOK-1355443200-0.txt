review/summary: Fabric Steamerreview/text: Not impressed with this steamer. I returned it thinking it was defective in some way. All it did every time I used it was spurt out hot water and soaked my clothes, instead of hot steam and steaming my clothes. Also, there wasn't a button to control how much steam came out.
