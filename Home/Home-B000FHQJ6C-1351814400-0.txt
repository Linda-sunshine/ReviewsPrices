review/summary: 3 years old and still works great!review/text: Was scared to get a juicer on the cheap end, but this one does just fine. I usually run the pulp through two or three times, by the third time there isn't much moisture left in the scraps. Boil the scraps and strain, ya got a great broth or tea for later. It is important to clean this thing thoroughly after each use if you wan't it to last. Only complaint, sometimes the pulp catcher can slide away from the motor due to vibrations during use, can get messy.
