review/summary: Outstanding, best have ever hadreview/text: I was skeptical of this, but with so many good reviews, gave it a try.I was amazed at how good this can opener is. As others gave pointed out, it works flawlessly with no hands, it is very quiet indeed, and the simple press of a button removes the mechanism for cleaning in a dishwasher. Well worth the price.Last of all, something I thought I would never say about a can opener: this thing is really handsome! Nice addition to our counter.
