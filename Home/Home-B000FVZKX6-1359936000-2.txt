review/summary: Very soft and cozy!review/text: Our flannel sheets had been looking pretty shoddy, so, based on the good reviews here, I decided to order these as a replacement. They are so soft and cozy!The flannel feels more like a velvet than flannel sheet sets we've owned in the past. They are really warm, and the sage green color I ordered looks exactly as it does in the photo.The care instructions say to wash these in warm water on delicate cycle, and tumble dry on low. I've been washing them on delicate, but have been using medium heat to dry since I think that it would literally take hours to dry these on delicate.The Cal King size also fits our deep-pocket mattress perfectly.The only problem? These make it hard to get out of bed on a cold morning! :-)I'll update my review to let you know how they hold up, but, for now these are great and are really nice quality!
