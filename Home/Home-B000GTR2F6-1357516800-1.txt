review/summary: So far 5 machines for the price of 1review/text: I am now on my 5th machine replacement B70. Most of the machines lasted 6-8 months and usually suffered from short cup syndrome. One we had , displayed the prime message, but was fixed with turning it off and on.I finally realized why they are so willing to send you a new machine so easy. Think about all the money ,they make off the K cups. Too bad we use the adaptor to use our own coffee. In all my years using this I will never attempt a descale again as it is a waste of energy and vinegar as it has not helped me one bit, but drain my wallet.I kinda wonder how many replacements I will get down the road from now!
