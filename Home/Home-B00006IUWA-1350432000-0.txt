review/summary: Pop! Pop! Popoptptptptptptptptppptpttttptptptptptptppttttptpptpptptreview/text: I love popcorn. I get it from my Dad. Every movie, baseball game, basketball game, or event we went to we had a giant bowl/box/bag of popcorn. We used to have an air popper, but I always thought that thing was a pain in the butt. So began the era of eating a lot of microwave popcorn.Then my co-worker called microwave popcorn "cancer corn" one day. I asked "Why?" Yeah. It sure is. There's a whole lotta junk in that microwave popcorn.So, in trusting the good reviews of this popcorn maker, we decided to invest in an air popper. Boy were we glad we did. This thing rocks. Doesn't take long to pop a huge bowl and few kernels go un-popped. I just love that sound "Pop! Pop! Popoptptptptptptptptppptpttttptptptptptptppttttptpptpptpt!"I have to admit, however, the butter melter-cup-thingie on top doesn't work very well. You're better off zapping some butter in the microwave.Thanks Presto for making an awesome kitchen appliance! We use it many times a week!
