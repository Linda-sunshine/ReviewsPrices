review/summary: Not as impressed as I am with my old...review/text: CRESTWARE scoop. The Crestware scoop is solid and it's 'action' is smooth and quick. The OXO is ok, but it hesitates a lot while scooping. I don't think it will, but it feels as if it is on the verge of breaking sometimes, where the CRESTWARE has always felt secure and steady. Unfortunely, Crestware only makes one size. I am glad I got the OXO medium size scoop at Kohls with a $10 off $10 coupon. So I guess I got what I paid for...
