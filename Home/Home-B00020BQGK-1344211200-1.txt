review/summary: So much easier!review/text: My Hoover Flair is now my best friend! I got so tired of dragging around a 20+ pound canister vacuum cleaner, banging into furniture. I have a pet rabbit who loves to make a mess, tear up newspapers and play with paper bags. So much fun. But between me and her, we're messy. I can easily take my Flair and vacuum the living room in two minutes, then take it into the kitchen for a quick sweep. It is easy to empty and clean the filter, too. It turns easily and gets pretty low so you can get under things. BTW I read alot of the reviews on Amazon for similar vacuum cleaners and decided against a cordless. I'm glad I did. This is the best thing I've purchased all year!
