review/summary: Horribly Rusting Productreview/text: This pot had rusting all over when I received it. I tried to follow the instruction carefully during the first use. I tested out this pot by making some steam rice. The rice color was changed due to rusting. The bottom of the lid where the steam stayed became rusting heavily. The pot is very heavy, but I was able to manage its weight; however, the rusting really made my eyes sore. Their Customer Service (this is the third party vendor not Amazon) was not helpful at all. In order to return the product, they asked me to take pictures of the pot and sent those to them. Once I asked for their return policy, I found out that I would just need their RA# (authorization) for the return since the product was within 30-day warranty. I then asked them to generate one RA# for me. I was then asked by them to pay for the shipping costs (for almost $28.00 from UPS). It is their policy that the customer has to pay for the shipping costs both ways. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It was a really bad experience for me. Please be cautious before you make your decision. Hope it helps!
