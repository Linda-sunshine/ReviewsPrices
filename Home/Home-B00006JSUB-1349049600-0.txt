review/summary: A+review/text: I bought this as a birthday present for a friend. I have been a fan of cast iron cookware for some time now, and my friend had been most complimentary of my cast iron at our dinner parties. I thought I would use their birthday as an opportunity to introduce them to the world of cast iron. The look on their face when they opened it was absolutely priceless, they were so excited.I know seasoning is a big deal, and a lot of people are not thrilled with the pre-seasoning that these pans come with. As I see it, I understand the need for the pre-seasoning so that your pan arrives without rust. Once through the oven on the clean cycle with a brief scrub afterwards will clean the pan of the pre-seasoning and ready you for the five to six coats of your chosen seasoning. Just make sure that you choose a seasoning that handles high temperatures well. This chart should give you some idea of what can be used: [...] Lard has historically been used a lot, butter not so much with its lower smoking temperature. With the right seasoning, you should have a non-stick skillet at least on par with Teflon.The shipping and handling price is a bit steep, but understandable considering the weight, and with the sale in place when I made this purchase I felt like I got a good deal even after the shipping had been added in. At this point in time, the 12" was by far the best deal, and the pan itself is nothing to sneeze at in terms of size.
