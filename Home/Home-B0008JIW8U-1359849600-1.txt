review/summary: Great Coffeemaker!review/text: We've had one for a long time, and we recently bought a replacement (our original was getting a little old). We drink from coffee mugs that hold two regular cups of coffee, and we get up at different times, so for me, the machine makes two mugs of coffee, then one (later) for my wife. The coffeemaker is simple to use, easy to clean, and reliable. It always produces a great tasting cup of coffee, and it is fairly quick. Between the ease of operation and the very reasonable price, you can't go wrong.
