review/summary: Works great!review/text: I looooove my immersion blender. I finallly can make soups and chowders in my crockpot without having to splatter and burn myself attempting to blend in my traditional blender.The orange color is great - matches my Rachel Ray pots and pans! Can't beat the price on Amazon either. There are lots of more expensive immersion blenders, but don't waste your money - this one delivers at a fraction of the cost!
