review/summary: Indispensable non-stickreview/text: Every kitchen needs at least one decent non-stick pan. This 12.5 inch one meets the test. While the cooking surface is smaller than that it is likely the most functional size for most cooks. Easy to use and cleans quickly and completely. No problem with flatness of pan. Really allows for healthy sauteing in little or no fat. Need to ensure you purchase this model line not the cheaper TFal lines. Check Cook's Illustrated for their review too.
