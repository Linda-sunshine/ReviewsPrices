review/summary: takes too long!review/text: I just got this yesterday and have only used it 2x. Coffee is good - nothing extraordinary yet but I've yet to learn the nuances - but it takes too long. The manual suggests 'pre-heating' the machine for half an hour before making coffee. Half an hour! Really????? My stove-stop maker takes far less time.While searching for a good and inexpensive replacement to my old machine, I read hundreds of reviews including many dozens on this particular model and not one ever mentioned such an unreasonable wait time for espresso (in fact, many have indicated how quick the machine was). Either people aren't following manufacturer directions and still getting a great cup or the manufacturer has inexplicably redesigned a great product into something less.In any case, I'll experiment with timing and report back, but I am not pleased at the moment.
