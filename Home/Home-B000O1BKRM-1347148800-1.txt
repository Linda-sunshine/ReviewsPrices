review/summary: amazing- easy to use.review/text: These ice cube trays are great. Recently moved to a new place with out an ice maker. I always hated using ice cube trays because of the mess they make. The hard plastic ones seem to send ice cubes and shards of ice everywhere. These DO Not do that. In fact it is easy to push one cube out from the bottom. I also like the square cube shape, it makes the drinks look more appealing. The size of the tray isn't too large, I was afraid they would be floppy when filled with water and might make a mess, they are easy to handle when unfrozen as well.
