review/summary: Best pizza panreview/text: Heats evenly, makes a very crisp crust and unlike pizza stones, you can clean it thoroughly, even crusted on cheese. Care for it just like any other cast iron pan and it will last for a very long time...Generous size too. Plus we can put it on the grill, or use it for pancakes on the stove top.Definitely recommend.
