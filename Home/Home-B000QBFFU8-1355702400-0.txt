review/summary: Overall satisfiedreview/text: Been using this product for a year now. Overall we are happy with it. Only thing we have noticed is the mesh can get clogged depending on what you are juicing. You have to stop and rinse it out or the motor starts smelling like it is overheating. But that fine mesh is what keeps the pulp out so I'm not sure that could be remedied. It is good and sturdy and does the job well.
