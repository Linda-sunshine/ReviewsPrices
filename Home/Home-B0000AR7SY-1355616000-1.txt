review/summary: doesn't grind very wellreview/text: we got this to grind turkish style coffee. it's very slow, constantly blocks up even with very little amount of beans, and allows unground chunks of bean to fall through.yick. switched back to our 30 year old bladed grinder held together by duct tape and a prayer.
