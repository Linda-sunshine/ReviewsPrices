review/summary: Medium Capacity, Lots of Powerreview/text: This is my first juicer and I received it as a gift. With about a month of use on it, I am very pleased with it. After reading up on other juicers I have come to realize that this machine has a lot of power for its size. The liquid output will give you between two and three glasses of juice before it needs emptying. Clean up takes less than 5 minutes and is very easy to perform.For a first time juicer, I am very happy with this machine.
