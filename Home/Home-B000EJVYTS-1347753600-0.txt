review/summary: we love it!review/text: We bought this trash can a few months ago. I wanted to wait and write a review so i could be sure to REALLY know how it works out. Pros: square design keeps trash bag from falling into trash can, hands free design keeps the trash can TOTALLY clean, built in filter system keeps smells to a minimum. Cons: and i'm not even sure this is really a con.....more like a very slight annoyance....but nothing you can't get used to pretty quickly......there is a small delay and you have to be consistant with where you wave your hands to get it to open. we bought the ac adapter and have it plugged in all the time. i suggest you do the same. all in all....we are very happy with it! well worth the money!
