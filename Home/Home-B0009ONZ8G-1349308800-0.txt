review/summary: So far, so good!review/text: After years of less than acceptable vacuums and trying to save a buck on the $40 Bissell at Walmart I've had enough. I seen this Hoover and thought ok a little more money but it's a HOOVER and it was worth the extra money paid. The biggest issue I've always had was the "suction" power and so far this vacuum has been as good as a shopvac suction wise. My only complaint is the hose itself, is not long enough and keeps popping out. The attachments serve their purpose and it's great for hard to reach places, it really does a good job, so far I am very pleased and would highly recommend. The noise does not bother me at all.
