review/summary: The Giverreview/text: The Giver, written by Lois Lowry enables readers to take a direct look at an environment that has been completely modified by the demands of a dictatorship supremacy. Imagine what it would feel like to have no control over decisions that are made in your life; you can choose your spouse,occupation, or a specific religion to follow. Life as far as you know it is a puppet that is pulled by the strings of a higher authority. This is what life seems to be for an adolescent named Jona,his family, and other members of the society that they live in. Jona and others have been given a false perception that the life chosen for them is the perfect life, simply because every decision has been made for them effectively by a group of elders so that they will make no mistakes. Children ranging from the ages of 4-12 have been given a premature rights of passage, meaning that they are assuming the roles of adults before they can fully understand them. Jona, due to his intellectual ability and strong personal characteristics assumes a role given by the elders as a receiver. Jona is responsible for disregarding all of the negative memories consumed by the people in his society in order to keep their world in perfect operating condition. In meeting the demands of this position, Jona is left to wonder about his own personal sanity and the people who are colse to him. The Giver is an unique tale of a struggle between individuality and direct supremacy. It gives the reader a precise look at the effects of a society that strives to mainstream life experiences into one category. Lowry provides in-depth look at an alternative lifestyle that many people in America and some other countries across the world are accustom to living.
