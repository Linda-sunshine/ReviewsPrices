review/summary: Has lasted quite well with proper carereview/text: While I haven't found the "Thermo-Spot Heat Indicator" too terribly useful, the non-stick surface has held up quite well for the past 15 months. (I use an infrared thermometer similar toRosewill REGD-TN439L0 Infrared Thermometer.) The T-fal is definitely a better product than other non-stick pans!
