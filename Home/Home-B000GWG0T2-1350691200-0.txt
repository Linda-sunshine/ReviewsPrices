review/summary: I should have listened to other reviewersreview/text: Same exact complaint as most other reviewers. The pan is bowed. When cooking anything with oil (or any other liquid), the oil instantly retreats to the perimeter of the pan to create a ring of oil with a dry center. I recently tried to cook seafood and steak, both obviously unsuccessfully. I consider this pan useless for my purposes (or any purpose) and intend on buying something else. $30 down the drain.
