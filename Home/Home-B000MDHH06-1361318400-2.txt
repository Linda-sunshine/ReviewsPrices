review/summary: not so goodreview/text: I purchased this, reading lot of reviews here. However, I am not very satisfied using this. I do lot of veggies and fruits on this machine. Some of them dont go very well with this..such as carrot. I left with small chunks of carrots on the pulp container after I am doing jucing it. Also, the carrot juice sometimes will still have some fine pulp on it, and you can feel it while drinking.
