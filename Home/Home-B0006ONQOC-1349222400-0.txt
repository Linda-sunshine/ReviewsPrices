review/summary: cuisinart ICE-30BC ice cream makerreview/text: The cuisinart ICE-30BC pure indulgence ice cream maker lives up to its name!!! The ice cream is pure indulgence. I had to hide the ice cream maker from myself for a while. I was making ice cream every other night and eating it all myself!!!! It is very very easy to use and very convenient. Just keep the bowl in the freezer and it is ready when you are!!!
