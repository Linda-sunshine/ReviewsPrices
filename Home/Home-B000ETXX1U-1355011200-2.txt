review/summary: nicereview/text: The bed worked fine by me. I tried letting it inflated for a month and almost no air has escaped from it. As it has a sort of elevated borders, sometimes the middle part settles way more than the rest of the bed, but it's still comfortable and nice. The bump is a little bit noisy but nothing out of the ordinary.
