review/summary: Great with some design flawsreview/text: I got this about 6 years ago when working the off shift and sleeping during the day. Great for drowning out lawn mowers, kids, etc. Liked it so much I continued to use it all the time and the wife likes it also. Some of the sounds are just not condusive to sleep. I have my fav few that I use and that's it. One big flaw however is the backlight on the clock. It is way too bright even on the low setting. I'm severly dissapointed that the designers have not corrected this. After 6 years I'm getting renegade noises from it randomly and want another but I will not buy it with the same backlight on the clock. For 6 years I've been living with a piece of paper in front of the clock, but no more.
