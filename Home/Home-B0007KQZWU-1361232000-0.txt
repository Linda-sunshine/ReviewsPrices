review/summary: Great Set, But a Little Disappointedreview/text: I'm no chef. Cooking is not my business, but like everyone else, it is a big part of my family life. I got these on sale, so very happy with the set for what I paid. I do believe it is a great value. But, the one major question I had was, will food stick to it? The most popular reviewer said not a problem. I disagree. Even keeping it away from High temp setting, food still sticks, and sometimes sticks on really good. Since food sticks anyway, I use Barkeeper's Friend to clean off stubborn stains. My other sticking point that wasn't so obvious, is that the lids are not see through. The lid is so shiny and reflective, it looks like it in the pictures, but they are not. For these two reason, I knock off a star.How does this set cook? Really well! The three ply works great and foods seem to cook evenly. No disappointments here. Since food sticks anyway, I now have no problems using high heat settings, but be careful, as you can easily burn things. I mainly do this boiling water and starting up, only if I'm attending and paying attention.The set looks gorgeous. Just having these out will transform your kitchen into something classy. Keep them polished, and they will impress. They are heavy and feel solid, built well and feels like quality.I have used the pan in the oven. No issues. The handles don't get hot on the stove, but coming out of the oven, they retained the heat a long time. Be careful here.I have no regrets buying these, even if I wish the food wouldn't stick. But, it performs so well, and looks terrific, that I'll live with the shortcomings.
