review/summary: I Love This Panreview/text: It's was on my mind for a long time that I wished I had cast iron pans like my parents had when I was a kid, but I had tried them before wasn't able to get the seasoning right. When I found this pre-seasoned pan with a price point of less than $20 I decided to give it a try and I'm so glad I did. I've had it for about 2 weeks now and it hasn't left my stove top, except to be scrubbed in the sink, since the day it was delivered. I have successfully fried potatoes and eggs in it, my true test for how a pan lets go of food. I plan to buy at least 2 more in smaller sizes and a dutch oven. If I had any criticism it would be that the handle is shorter than I'm used to, but it's a heavy pan and the short handle helps make it stable.House rules say that only I wash my pans, and I always follow the manufacturers directions so this one won't ever see soap. I rinse it out, and use a brush that hasn't ever had detergent on it, and then dry it right away and wipe it out with vegetable oil.I absolutely recommend this pan to anyone who is willing to take care of it the way it needs to be taken care of.
