review/summary: FUMES GAVE ME SKIN RASH....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HORRIBLEreview/text: THIS PAD GAVE ME A ITCHY SKIN RASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!First of all, I am not the type of person that writes reviews. I have ordered many things from Amazon, but this is the first time that I buy something for my bed without looking/feeling it (in store).This pad is HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!Yes, its soft, BUT......................I received it yesterday, unpacked it and put on my mattress. Put the sheets on as normal, then waited for bed time. The first thing I noticed was the smell! It was almost like a gas/mint/chemical smell. THAT CANT BE GOOD!!!! It kinda stayed under the sheets while I was sleeping!I woke up at 5 am, HOT from the warmth of the pad and itchy ALL OVER my forearms, shoulders, a little on my legs and abdomen! I have NEVER had such a reaction to any kind of bedding and have NEVER had bed bugs, this is the only new thing I brought into my bedroom!I took a antihistamine around 3pm today and thought it might be something else, but I Googled and it seems many people have this issue with, "memory foam pads".I thought about sleeping with it one more night, but WHY!!!!! I dont want to risk it! I just stripped my bed, will be washing everything tomorrow, flipped my matters, and TOSSED that HORRIBLE pad out!!!!As I type this (12:27am!) I am still itchy and HOPE that it clears up by tomorrow.I plan to sleep on my couch tonight!I wouldn't recommend this item at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
