review/summary: GREAT PROCESSORreview/text: Recently purchased the Cuisinart DLC-10S from Amazon. As always, Amazon shipped item and I received in 2 days. Immediately unboxed the items using the unpacking directions on the box. Everything arrived in good condition. First thing I did was watch the video, recommend you do this first, explains everything in detail and gives some excellent recipes. Cleaned and set up the processor and used first time to chop veggies. EXCELLENT. Next, I used the bread kneading attachment and made a loaf of pumpernickel bread. Directions explicitly state to use NO MORE than 4 cups of flour so if you can make a single loaf with a recipe using 4 cups or less of flour, do it, kneaded the dough beautifully and in minimal time. Bread rose nicely and baked beautifully. Did find that when you start mixing bread, using the pulse setting for a few times to mix ingredients first then run on full processing worked well. Using the pulse setting is an excellent way to mix your ingredients first (about 2 or 3 time) then use full mixing power really works well for most recipes. Next, I made cornbread using the recipe in the booklet. Came out nice but a bit dry and tasted like something was missing. Next time I will try making it in the processor using my own recipe. All-in-all, I found this processor well worth the money spent and excellent time saver for those of us who bake bread, etc. The only drawback I found is the top chopper cover is difficult to clean since the parts are not totally removable but since I used a small, round brush I purchased new from a pet store (used to clean aquarium filters) makes cleaning those parts much easier. Even though parts are dishwasher safe, due to very hard, mineralized water, I only clean the sharp blades in the dishwasher to avoid cutting myself (blades are very sharp). All other parts are cleaned by hand thus the need for the brush. I definitely recommend this processor to everyone.
