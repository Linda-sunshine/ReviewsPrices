review/summary: Nice size and easy to remove a single cubereview/text: I purchased these ice cube trays to freeze some herbs we have in our garden for later use. We have lots of basil that grows faster than we can use it, but that will be gone after the first frost in the winter. So I picked a bunch of it and blended it with a little water in myBreville BBL605XL Hemisphere Control Blenderand then poured it into these cube trays. When frozen, I just popped out the cubes and put them in a plastic bag for use later in the year. (And a week later the basil has grown almost back to where it was before I harvested it!) These trays make nice square cubes and seemed to set up pretty quickly. They take up less space than the old fashioned hard plastic trays and it's easy to remove a single cube at a time. I also like that the cubes are perfectly square and that they're 1 oz. each.The only drawback is that they tend to retain odors from the food you are freezing. I could really tell this with the basil which is so aromatic. It took a lot of detergent and soaking before the smell of the basil went away. (Not a bad fragrance, but I want to do mint next.) Of course if you're only using them for water, this isn't a problem.I've made some great cubes with a mint leaf or two in each cube to use in drinks or just water where you want the taste of mint. I've also put just a few mint leaves with a lot of water in the blender to chop the mint more finely and made that into cubes for a refreshing drink when added to water. Even when I buy herbs at the grocery store, there is often more in a bunch than I need to use at one time. So blending with water and freezing them is a good way to make use of the excess at a later time and still get the fresh taste.
