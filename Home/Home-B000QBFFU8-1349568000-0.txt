review/summary: Avoid refurbished modelsreview/text: We bought this juicer, new but refurbished from Amazon and it wouldn't turn on the moment we received it. The juicer was of bad quality and I would avoid this model. The knob that dials the juicer levels is flimsy/cheap. We ended up going to Bed, Bath and Beyond and purchased the less expensive Breville Juicer model J E 98XL for $129.00 with our 20 percent coupon .....it works great and seems more durable. Avoid buying any of these juicer products from Amazon. The Amazon customer service rep said via phone that shipping this item can cause damage. It's cheaper and actually works if you go to Bed, Bath and Beyond but avoid any refurbished products sold by Amazon and this model juicer.
