review/summary: Good Skillet, Cheap Pricereview/text: I love this skillet. I have always wanted a cast iron skillet. I've used it a few times and the things I have cooked in it fryed up beautifully. When I would use a more expensive skillet, there would always be hot spots, not with skillet. I would recommend this to everyone.
