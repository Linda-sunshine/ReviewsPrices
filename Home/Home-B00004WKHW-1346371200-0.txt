review/summary: Product does not lastreview/text: I bought this chopper and was very satisfied at first. However, after 2 months the motor ran but the blade stopped turning. I contacted Cuisinart who would replace it, but I had to pay to ship it back along with a $10.00 replacement fee -even though it was still under warranty. It would in total cost the same price if I just bought a new one, which I did, but not Cuisinart. I found out through the internet that many consumers had the same problem. Very poor product.
