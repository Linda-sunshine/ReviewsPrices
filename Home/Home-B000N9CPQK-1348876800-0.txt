review/summary: works as advertizedreview/text: This product was easy to set up, easy to use, easy to clean and adds a nice freshness to the air. I placed it in my office where I spend eight plus hours a day. It has relieved many of my allergy symptoms. The machine provides some background noise but I see clients and make phone calls all day and the sound of the machine running does not interfere with my business. I only run the ionizer occassionally and haven't noticed any irritation from its use. Overall I am quite pleased with this purchase
