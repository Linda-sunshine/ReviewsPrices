review/summary: Works great...exactly what I needed!review/text: The previous reviews about this hand vac are well deserved. It works great...which does explain why it IS loud. It is easy to use, easy to clean out and works exactly as it says. I use it mostly for cleaning our sofas since we have three dogs. I have also used it to clean out the car and have had no problems.
