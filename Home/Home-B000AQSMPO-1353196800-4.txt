review/summary: Worst coffee machine everreview/text: Poor from the start, then got worse. Should have kept that receipt. Always keep your receipt. This thing drips, says it needs water (when the resevoir is full - or half - or 1/3, etc,). Always need to deflect the spring loaded stopper for the heating resevoir to finally fill, dispenses diferent amounts of water, .... Count on spending forever to get a cup of coffee. I should throw it out but it cost soo much I can't seem to do it ... figuring eventually it'll work with all the time I spend fixing it. Repeatedly clean, but this made in China stuff is just too poorly designed to do anything with it. Bottom line - Buy any other brand out there but this one.
