review/summary: Great scalereview/text: We really like this scale--it looks nice and works well. The only drawback is that the feet are set in from the edges and every so often we accidentally step on the edge of the glass, which then in turn launches the other edge of the scale up in the air and the whole thing bangs down on the bathroom floor. We recommend it though. I think we have replaced the battery in it once in the 1 year and 10 months we've owned it.
