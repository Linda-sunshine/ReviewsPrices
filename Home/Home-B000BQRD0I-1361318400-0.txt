review/summary: I will still have to ironreview/text: I was disappointed, as the steamer did not make the crisp no wrinkles my iron does, and rayon does not work at all with this. Only cotton and wool. Not as easy to get going as an iron, and it takes warming up, and then it goes for like 5 minutes, and takes time to warm up again. Sorry, you will still need to iron.
