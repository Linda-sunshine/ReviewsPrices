review/summary: It was great while it lasted....review/text: We loved our Keurig brewer for a few months while it worked. But then the problems started, as everyone else stated on this website. We lasted as long as we could, and thinking we may have gotten a lemon, we bought Keurig Brewer #2. More expensive than the first. We figured we'd go much longer with it than the first one (which lasted about 2 years off and on). We were foolish to think this. The Keurig Platinum lasted us less than a year. I de-scaled it until the cows came home, I gave it the "love tap" like many suggested, I even removed the bottom of the unit, blew out the air valve, and sealed her back up. To no avail. I will not be buying Keurig #3. Time to move on. It was wonderful and convenient while it lasted. But just too expensive to keep trying to make it work.
