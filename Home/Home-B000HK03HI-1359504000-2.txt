review/summary: The Can Opener World Championreview/text: I have been through 8-10 manual can openers, they either break or won't open the can. I researched and read review after review and I have to say the Zyliss is the best. It really works and is easy to use! I don't cringe when I have to open cans and it fits perfect in the drawer. What a great product!
