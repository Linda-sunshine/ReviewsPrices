review/summary: Nordic Ware Microwave Egg cookerreview/text: I recently bought the (made in USA!) egg cooker. It looks cool... it cooks the eggs great (I have used it twice now)... yeah, its a little clumsy to handle because there's nothing to grip, but thats ok. It was a little too tall to fit into our small microwave door opening, so I just put the bottom in first, and then added the top, as it is larger inside my microwave than the door opening. Yes... it gets very hot, so I am patient and leave it set for about 5 minutes or so before I take it out. Something not mentioned by other viewers is that you have to be careful to drain the water out of the lid when cleaning, as it accumulates in between layers, and must be drained out via the only hole. Much easier than cooking eggs on the stove, and cooks them better! Soft center or hard boiled! I only cooked 2 eggs at a time, and that worked very well for me.
