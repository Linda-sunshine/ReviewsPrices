review/summary: Definitely, Plastic Top!review/text: This is a pretty nice stainless percolator coffee pot. The quality is good and it makes good perc'd coffee. There seems to be some confusion as to whether this unit has a plastic or glass knob on the top cover. I was hoping for glass since the description clearly says (at the time of ordering and the time of this review):"To fully maintain the finish, the percolator should be hand washed, although the filter basket and GLASS cap can go into the dishwasher."Well, take it from me the knob on the stainless top is definitely plastic. I called Farberware and they said they do not offer a glass knob and the top is plastic. For about 5 bucks, I ordered one of the glass knobs just as a backup. Overall for $25 (pot and extra knob) it's still a good value and I would still recommend it. However, a glass knob would have gotten the unit 5 stars.
