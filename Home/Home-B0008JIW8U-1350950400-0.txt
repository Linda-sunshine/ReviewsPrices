review/summary: Good for boiling waterreview/text: I don't usually drink coffee. The reason I favored this over electric/stovetop kettle is because this coffee machine only boils water when I need it and the water doesn't taste plastic like the other kettles of the same price. I don't know how well it can make coffee, but it's absolutely awesome for just boiling water!
