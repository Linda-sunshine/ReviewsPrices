review/summary: Juice'n Fun!!review/text: I love, love, love my Breville Juicer! I've had this gem for a few weeks so far and have not had any issues. I would like to make a couple of comments on the mesh screen that I have seen quite a few complaints on: In order for food to not stick to the mesh screen, it needs to be washed immediately after use. The mesh screen IS fragile, however, if you do wash it right away, you shouldn't need to scrub too hard. You have to be careful when inserting your veggies because if the blades are spinning and you put in your veggies, you will experience the fibrous fly-aways-----and I don't care how quick you are. This is the only reason that I have it 4 stars.This is perfect for the beginning juicer, it's inexpensive (in comparison to all the others), but really powerful! I will definitely recommend this products to anyone who is interested in having fresh juice.
