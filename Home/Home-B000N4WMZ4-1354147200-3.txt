review/summary: LOVE it!review/text: This pot ROCKS. I love love love it. I've made all kinds of soups an stews in this thing and it rocks. We have a crock pot, but frankly, I like this better. every thing cooks evenly, no scorching. its easy to clean. it retains heat for a long time after you turn the burner off. I doubt very seriously that a Le Cruset is any better than this. we even fried chicken in it once. came out fabulous, though I became concerned about the enamel so we didn't use it for deep frying again. I've had it about 2 years now, got mine at Target on a whim. it may be my favorite pot...
