review/summary: Brita filters from Finest Playreview/text: Unacceptable - 3 of the five filters are unusable - deteriorated. These filters are to be replaced every two months. I used two with no problem, however the remaining 3 are unusable. They all have carbon sprinkled throughout the plastic casing around each filter. That is a sign that they are expired.
