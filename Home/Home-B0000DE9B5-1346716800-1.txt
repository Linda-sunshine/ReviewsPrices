review/summary: Almost Greatreview/text: I make tea for the family by the gallon to put in the refrigerator and glass is the best for cold storage. When I ordered this pitcher I really wanted a gallon size but none are available on Amazon or elsewhere that I have found. So I bought two of these pitchers. So far it has worked out for the smaller size is easier to manage and fit into the refrig. The pitchers are not heat rated to pour boiling water into but a few minutes on the counter for steeping the tea seems to be enough. I would still like to have a gallon size that is heat treated, hence the 4 star rating.
