review/summary: Small, quiet and effectivereview/text: My poorly-insulated, 70s-era apartment tends to get very damp in rainy winter months. I bought this small unit for a closet that's had persistant mold issues due to the damp. It worked very well to keep the air dry and prevent mold growth. It worked so well I bought another to put in the bedroom where it's run nearly non-stop for six months. It works as well in a 12' x 12' bedroom as in a small closet, filling the reservoir in 2-3 days when it's very rainy out. Good for year-round use; in the summer to reduce uncomfortable humidity and in the winter to prevent dampness and mold. While the fan isn't silent, it's very quiet. My boyfriend finds it soothing, likening it to "brown noise". The petite size means it fits comfortably on a dresser or side-table.
