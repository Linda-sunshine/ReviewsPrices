review/summary: Works well and easy to usereview/text: Our old can opener just didn't work any more, got old and rusty. We don't like electric can opens. So we looked for one of this type of good quality. This one does a very good job and is stainless steal. Will do another evaluation in a year to let you know how it has held up.
