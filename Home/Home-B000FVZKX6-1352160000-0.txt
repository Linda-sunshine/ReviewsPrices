review/summary: The softest butteriest sheets you will ever own!review/text: I got these in the cream color. They are almost a butter color. They are hands down the softest flannel sheets I have ever had the priveledge of sleeping on. I have purchased some of the best flannel sheets out there and these are the best in my opinion. I sleep like an angel on these. I have washed these several times and there is no pilling at all. They fit my king size bed perfectly even after washing and drying in a hot dryer. There is no shrinkage. I will definately buy another set of these sheets but I am trying another color. You will not be dissapointed in the quality and softness of these wonderful sheets.
