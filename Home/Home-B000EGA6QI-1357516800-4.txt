review/summary: Great hand blenderreview/text: I bought this to make baby food for my 6 month old. It has been a great purchase. I used it for about 6 months and am getting ready to start using it for my daughter. It's easy to use - I never used the cup because I was making large quantities of food and then freezing them - but the mixer itself is great!
