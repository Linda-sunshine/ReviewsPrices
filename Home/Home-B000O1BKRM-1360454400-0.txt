review/summary: Perfect for homemade baby foodreview/text: I use these trays for my son's homemade baby foods, and they are perfect for it. The frozen cubes push out easily and stack nicely in a freezer bag. 2 cubes is about the same amount as a Stage 2 jar of baby food so the size of the cubes works well for the purpose I use the trays.
