review/summary: I love this Coffeemaker!review/text: I read most of the reviews, many negative, before purchasing this product. To be honest, I felt I might be purchasing something questionable. I guess that is the kind of thing reviews can do - give wrong impressions.Cuisinart has a great product, again, in this coffeemaker. The thermal carafe keeps coffee very hot for hours. On Sundays I like to take it easy, watch the news, read Facebook, etc, and as I go through the morning into the afternoon, have a little coffee from time to time. I used to make a couple of batches because the first would get "burnt" after about an hour. Now I have one big pot that stays hot all day. It will stay hotter if you pre-warm the carafe with hot water, just like a thermos.As far a the valve/lid goes, no trouble here. You install the lid in the closed/pour position and make coffee - you never have to touch the lid again until you rinse it out when you are done. As loose as the ball sits in the valve it is hard to see how it gets so mucked up and sticks (previous negative reviews) unless they never rinsed it out. Yuck.Great tasting coffee, easy to use timer, what else can I say? It's great!I use this every morning to make a thermos of coffee to take to work. I have had it for about 10 days so far.
