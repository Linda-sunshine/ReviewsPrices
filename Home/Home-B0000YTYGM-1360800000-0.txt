review/summary: Water Capacity exceeds Coffee Capacityreview/text: A #4 filter doesn't hold enough coffee to make 12 cups. Not to my liking in any case. Get a ten cup machine that takes up less space.The occasional overflow problems associated with brew pause are readily solved by removing the brew pause valve. A small rubber washer in the bottom of the filter holder keeps it in place. Taking a cup out of the brew disturbs the balance of the pot. Remove the valve and be patient.
