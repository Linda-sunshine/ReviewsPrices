review/summary: No more store-bought treats for my pets!review/text: I love this dehydrator! I'm glad I'm came across this thing while browsing in Amazon while I was looking for chemical-free treats for my cat and dog. Thanks to this product, my pets are now enjoying and crazy about chemical/poison-free fish and chicken jerkies. And I've made several batches of beef jerkies, too, for me and my husband. The only thing I kind of regret about this dehydrator is the shape. I think the square one is better and has more space. I find arranging the jerkies a bit of a challenge because of the shape. Anyways, I'm still giving it a 5-star because it does a very good job when it comes to drying whatever I want to dry.
