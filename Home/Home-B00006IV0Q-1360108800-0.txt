review/summary: Great Coffee Maker that does not Disappointreview/text: I was always a big fan of Farberware, but over the years, their life expectancy dwindled..they lost the ability to heat well..So, the last time I needed a coffee maker, I got a Presto and loved it..it lasted for years..now I needed another one and I got a Hamilton Beach one in a local store..it was difficult to make the top fit and close. Not a bad pot, but it was heavy and as I said, very difficult to close..so we ordered a trusty Presto again and it did not disappoint. It makes delicious and hot coffee every single time. We still have the Hamilton Beach one for the weekends when we entertain a number of people for brunch..it works OK and is getting easier to get the top on..but for the money, the Presto is the best..it lasts for years, it works well and makes great coffee..enjoy it..
