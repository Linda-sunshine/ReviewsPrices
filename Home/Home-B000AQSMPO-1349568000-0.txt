review/summary: Not a happy customer...waste of moneyreview/text: My husband purchased this Keurig as a Christmas gift for me in December 2010. In September 2012 my Keurig stopped pulling water through, the LCD display kept flashing, then it quit working altogether. I called Keurig and was told "your machine is not repairable, I can sell you another one for a discounted price" Then he proceeded to give me a list of available Keurigs for discounted prices and said "so which one would you like to purchase?" My response "NONE!" How ridiculous is it that my husband spent $150 on this maker and in less than 2 years its done. We have been married for 16 years, got a $20 coffeepot that is still working to this day. I guess making a good, long lasting quality product is not a priority on Keurigs list of things to do.
