review/summary: I love my Whirley Popcorn Popperreview/text: After using microwave popcorn for years and reading about the chemicals added to the product, I decided to pop my own. Read the reviews of this popper and ordered it. I love it......I put a little more than a tablespoon of Canola oil in it and add 1/2 cup of popcorn and in about 3 minutes I get an overflowing pot of popcorn. What I don't miss is all the un-popped seeds from the microwave kind. Every kernel is popped in this popper. I have used coconut oil and bottled popcorn oil but the canola oil is healthier so I use it. I don't wash it very often, just wipe if out with a paper towel and put away for the next time.
