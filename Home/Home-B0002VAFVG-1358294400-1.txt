review/summary: I love it!review/text: Alright, I know very little about juicers aside from how to use and clean this one. I've never had one in the past and have had this one a month. After researching them I decided on a Breville and I would have bought the best one because that's usually how I do and I plan on juicing for at least breakfast indefinitely, but I got this one for $220 and I felt it was the better deal since amazon was only offering $20 off on the better model. So far this thing has been running perfect with no signs of wear, my buddies are juicing now too and are all jealous of my juicer compared to theirs. I wonder sometimes how much better the better model is, but I'm happy about my purchase.
