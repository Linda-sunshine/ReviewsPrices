review/summary: Well Worth It!review/text: I bought this juicer in December after watching "Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead", but at first didn't really use it too much because juicing and cleaning the machine before work seemed like a hassle. In April I started working with a nutritionist who urged I start juicing every morning even if it was just carrots, or if it meant doing it the night before and freezing the juice for the next day. I finally got in the habit and started juicing every morning and this machine has never let me down. It is so powerful that it can get through anything. When I want to do leafy greens I tend to wrap them up together and run it through level 1 and I am amazed at how much juice it extracts. I used to be a green smoothie fanatic, but the difference in my health since juicing blows smoothies away. Definitely worth every penny!
