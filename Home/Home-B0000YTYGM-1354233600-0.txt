review/summary: A great coffee potreview/text: I love this coffee maker. It looks great & brews great tasting coffee. The only downside is its taller than most & doesn't fit under my cabinets so I have to place in a different area than I'd like. But other than that, I'm completely satisfied with this purchase.
