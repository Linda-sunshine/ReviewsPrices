review/summary: Works well but not for the carreview/text: I bought this vacuum with the intention of using it to clean the car. As a vacuum it works very well, and is not as noisy as many claim. After all, it's a vacuum it has to make noise. It's easy to clean and works well. Though it's a bit on the heavy side for such a small vacuum.It does not work with the car. I attached a converter plug to use with the car, but it would not even start. I figured that it simply needs more power. So I attached the converted plug into 150w power inverter but it still refused to start. So you can't use it for the car, but it certainly works well if your intention is use at home.
