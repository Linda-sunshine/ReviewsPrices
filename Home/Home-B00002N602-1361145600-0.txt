review/summary: Having a blast "pressure cooking"review/text: This is truly the perfect size for one or two people- I've done 4 large chicken breasts in it a few times, and they have come out so juicy and tender...10 minutes-can't beat that. Tonight I'm trying a 3 pound beef roast- looking forward to it....Extremely easy to clean, soak a few minutes in hot soapy water and it cleans right up! Nice heavy pot which I know I will use in other ways too! I feel this was a great price and I believe that Amazon can't be beat for pricing on anything!
