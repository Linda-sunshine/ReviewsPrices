review/summary: Well Built and Efficient Food Processorreview/text: First food processor I've purchased and I'm very happy with the quality. It performs admirably and clean up is pretty easy, though there are a lot of parts that are removable, so you have to really get into some nooks to clean and dry the machine well. I've mostly use it to process vegetables, so I can't comment on any of the other abilities it has so far.
