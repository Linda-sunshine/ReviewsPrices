review/summary: Best purchase of the year.review/text: I was doing some research on juicers, which would fit my needs, and what prices were. I kept coming back to this one. This juicer is everything I had hoped it would be and then some. I am very pleased with how well it extracts such a large quantity of juice from whatever it is you're juicing. It is so easy to clean up. As long as you rinse every thing off after use, you never have difficult cleanup. The only thing that needs detailed cleaning in the filter basket and you are provided with a handy cleaning brush for that specific purpose. This juicer outperforms most commercial juicers that I have seen and it's about a 1/3 of the price. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
