review/summary: Need An Awesome Glass Water Kettle?review/text: I purchased a Capresso Glass Water Kettle about a decade ago and thought I would never find a retail outlet who could replace my 'old' one that I've enjoyed for so many years. Then, Eureka! Amazon.com! What a pleasant surprise just as my old kettle's cover hinge broke apart from one too many openings. I immediately ordered an identical (in design) new Capresso glass kettle. Looks the same, works the same, and still does an awesome job heating morning tea water! Highly recommended to all who want to enjoy a quick and efficient cup of hot water any place, any time.
