review/summary: Fire place gelsreview/text: Have a fireplace that uses the Flame Gel. I like it very much, actually takes the chill off of the room which came in handy after Hurricane Sandy. --- no heat! Got to remember to take off the paper wrapping. The only think I don't like which all the brands of Flame Gel/fire gel/fuel gel, whatever the name, when the flame goes out you get a soot smell and after the winter season I notice my curtains and windows are grey.
