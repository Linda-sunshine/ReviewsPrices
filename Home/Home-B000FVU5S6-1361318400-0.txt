review/summary: Beautiful sheets!review/text: There's nothing worse than buying a set of sheets, spending $50 and have them feel like they aren't going to make it through the first wash.These not only went through the wash, they came out beautifully and are the BEST sheets I have ever purchased. They feel wonderful, very tight weave and high quality. The fitted sheet has elastic all the way around unlike the cheaper sets from the big box stores. The edges are nicely finished and the size of the sheets are generous enough that they easily fit my queen size pillow top mattress.No more struggling to get the fitted sheet over the corners and I don't get short sheeted since the top sheet is larger than average.I'm absolutely ordering another set of these!!!
