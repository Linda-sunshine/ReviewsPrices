review/summary: (After 4 months) this iron burnt itself while in usereview/text: It was fine for 4 months. I was loving the way it had electronic display and easy to set the temperature. Look was good too and was easy to use. I thought I found my right iron and I will settle with this.As I was feeling comfortable about it, thinking that it would never burn anything as it turns off after overheating or not using for few minutes, this is what happened - Was in hurry to iron some of my office clothes on Sunday night for whole week. I ironed 1 cotton shirt(with setting 6) - it was good. I should have ironed polyester shirt first(with setting 5) but I realized later. I ironed that shirt - it was good. Next I started ironing a cotton shirt (with setting 6). When I was in middle of ironing it started sucking my shirt. I thought what was happening?? as I had steamer on and setting 6 was right for a cotton shirt. But it just started heating itself and after 10-15 seconds smoke started coming out. I was clueless whats going on. I immediately removed the plug and watched it. The smoke just kept on increasing. Without thinking twice and before the smoke alarm went off I put this burning iron under water in the sink. That's when it stopped burning. It could have been a real big hazard hadn't I remove plug and put under water. I had other clothes kept near by the iron!!Not sure if this product is bad. It may be just one-off issue with this item and may be my fate. But its sure that I wont buy Black & Decker again. Giving 2 star as I liked features and ease of use.
