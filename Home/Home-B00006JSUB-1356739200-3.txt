review/summary: Excellent skillet & a great valuereview/text: This skillet is easy to use, cooks food very evenly, and cleans up easily using just hot water and a scrub brush. As long as you dry it after use on the stove (at low to med temp), then add a few drops of oil and spread it around with a paper towel while the skillet is still hot, and let it cool that way, you're good to go. Excellent quality, and the extra handle helps because skillets are heavy.
