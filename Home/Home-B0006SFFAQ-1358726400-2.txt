review/summary: Best coffeemaker I ever ownedreview/text: I recently purchased our second Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew Central 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker in Black after the first one, purchased on August 7. 2007 in Black and Stainless Steel, was clearly on it's last leg. Considering we have hard water and clean it, maybe, once a year even though we brew 8-cup pots 3-4 times a day during the week and at least 5 times on Saturday and Sunday, I'm very happy with its longevity. Other pots we owned over the years (Mr. Coffee, Black & Decker, DeLonghi) were not only very short-lived in comparison but couldn't touch the taste of coffee brewed with this particular Cuisinart. In my opinion, it's worth the price although I did buy both when they were on sale.
