review/summary: work beautifully, I wish they had an Xtra Small - 1 tspreview/text: These are new and I obviously didn't see the measurments on the different sizes when I ordered; I thought the small one be one tsp, the med. a tsp and a half, and the large one tablespoonfull..for cookies those are the size I want. Having said that...I just used the smallest for the first time to scoop and bake a really soft/runny/messy batter for a soft spice cookie. With two spoons this recipe makes a TERRIBLE mess. the small scoop took two squeezes of the handle to release the sticky dough, but they came out nice and neat and uniform sized. Scrape them against the side of the bowl to level them. I can see that I'll get a LOT of use from the small one (I make small cookies!) and will read some of the ideas for the larger ones. Muffins? all the same size? oh I think that would be nice! I'm glad I bought them.
