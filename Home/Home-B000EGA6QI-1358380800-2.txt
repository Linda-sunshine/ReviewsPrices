review/summary: Love it!review/text: I bought this specifically to make &#34;chocolate pots&#34; an English dessert. I also use it to blend & craem soups, like french onion for gravy etc. AND I also used it for eggs. This type of blender does not whip in air, so eggs & creme brulees do not have bubbles and are not frothy! It can be used in a hot liquid over the stove as well! I wish I bought one sooner & pink is my favorite color, so it is now my absolute favorite kitchen tool, remaining in an easy access cupboard
