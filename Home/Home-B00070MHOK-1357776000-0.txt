review/summary: make sure you empty it - moldreview/text: I made the mistake of not emptying the water - and it molded over on the inside of the machine. the machine itself is great, i steam all my dresses now, but i couldnt find a way to get in with a sponge to clean it, so im hoping the boiling and letting it boil outside killed the mold and put it to the outside air... hopefully?
