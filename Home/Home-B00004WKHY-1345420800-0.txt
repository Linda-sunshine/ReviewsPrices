review/summary: Cuisinarts handling of problems is SO negative!review/text: Since August 9, 2012, I have used the Cuisinart food processor (9-cup) in the first place for shredding lettuce, cucumber etc. Fantastic. Having it for 2 weeks I tried a recipe from the Cuisinart instruction booklet, during processing the machine blew up, thick smoke coming from the motor. Via the suborganization from Amazon I contacted Cuisinart and told them the experience, they were not helpful at all. It came down to ....send us the machine....at my own expence (both ways). The Cuisinart person I talked to was not better than a taperecorder.Amazons' intermediate organization was fortunately very helpful and gracious and solved the problem.A last thing about Cuisinart products I am familiar with they never gave me a reason to complain.
