review/summary: It has a lot of wasted spacereview/text: I purchased this because I needed a measuring cup with a wide mouth which measured ounces. This definitely has that and should last forever, but I'm disappointed with the cup overall. The measuring lines only go about half way up the cup, leaving the upper half of the cup useless for anything else than telling me the cup is may of pyrex. The cup would be much more useful if it were half the size with the same marks or the same size with more measurements. Find something else unless you're endeared to pyrex.
