review/summary: best bottle everreview/text: Worth every penny. The only Texas-proof waterbottle I've found. When it's been over 100 degrees in TX, I've had this in my car for about 2 hours with a single ice cube in it. When I returned there was still ice.Stays cold forever without any condensation. I don't drink hot liquids so I am new to the thermos. Needless to say I am far too excited over a water bottle.Buy, buy, buy.
