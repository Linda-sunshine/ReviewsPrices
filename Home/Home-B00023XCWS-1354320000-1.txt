review/summary: Excellent kettlereview/text: Good design that provides the right &#34;heft&#34; when picked up. Everything works as promised, which means that I can turn it on and turn to something else in another room, knowing that the automatic shutoff will activate when the water boils. This is important for someone as absentminded as I am. I&#34;m not sure that it heats quite as fast as advertised but it heats fast enough to make it a thoroughly satisfactory product.
