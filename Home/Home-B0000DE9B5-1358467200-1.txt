review/summary: Has plastic top and it doesnt fit too tight.review/text: I bought this to stay away from plastic!!! But the lid is plastic :/ and it appears not to seal as tightly as I want it too but it does seal without drips. I wouldnt say its air tight, but I havent tested it's ablility to hold air.
