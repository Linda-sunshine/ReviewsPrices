review/summary: Rustyreview/text: These knives are decently constructed and are fair value. Unfortunately as others have said, these rust quite badly. It was after only 1 use and one cylce (on normal/regular) in the dishwasher. For that reason, I cant reccomend this product. Spend the extra money and get something that will actually last.
