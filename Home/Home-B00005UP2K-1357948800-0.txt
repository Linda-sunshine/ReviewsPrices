review/summary: Makes baking so easy!review/text: I grew up using my mother's KitchenAid stand mixer then used my sister's when we lived together. I made due with a hand mixer for awhile, but once you use a standmixer you just can't go back to a hand mixer! I finally saved up the money (plus some Christmas money) and invested in my own standmixer! Can't go wrong with this stand mixer. Also I love the color (imperial gray - matte medium dark gray).Another reviewer made a great point that yes you will get some dry ingredients stuck at the bottom. You can adjust the height of your mixing assembly.... or you could simply use some common sense and mix them up. I take a rubber spatula and mix in the leftover dry ingredients at the bottom at the same time I scrap down the sides of the bowl. Problem solved.
