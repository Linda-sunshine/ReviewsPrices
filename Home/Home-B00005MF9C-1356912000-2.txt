review/summary: Affordable Way to Make a Single Cup of Coffeereview/text: I wanted an affordable way to make a single cup of coffee. The K-cup solution seemed too expensive to me both in the initial investment as well as the price per cup. This does the job cheaply although not as cleanly as the K-cup.The first issue I have with this machine is the length of the cord. I bought this to use on my desk at work. Obviously the short cord was intended for a kitchen counter top because the cord didn't even reach the ground. I had to buy an extension cord to reach the outlet.I know that in theory a reusable filter is supposed to be better but I don't like it. I hate having to clean it out and after a while I find that it dulls the taste.I use the provided mug to fill the machine and then brew directly into my regular, large-sized coffee mug. I wish it were a little taller so that I could brew directly into my own travel mug though.For the price, it's a handy way to make a cup of coffee.
