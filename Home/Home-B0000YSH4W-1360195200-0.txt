review/summary: This Book was in poor conditionreview/text: Very disappointed with the condition of this book. I chose this one because it said GOOD condition. I wanted it for my son to follow along with in school and make his own notes. The cover was beat up, the pages were ragged and just about every page had notes and marks on it. The seller contacted me via email and discussed a possible return or replacement, and I never heard from them again. Very disappointed.
