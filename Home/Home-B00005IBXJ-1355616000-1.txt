review/summary: best appliance we ownreview/text: We love this thing. In our house it is the &#34;pizza-a-nator&#34; and is used for pizza, mozzerella sticks, chicken tenders, warming up day old bread and leftover pizza, making quesadillas. It's great because it cleans up easily and heats up quickly.
