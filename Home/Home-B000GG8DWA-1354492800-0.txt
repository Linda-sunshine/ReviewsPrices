review/summary: 1 appartment nice and toastyreview/text: I LOOOOOOOOOOVE it, I live in Qu&eacute;bec and it get's cold...but I start the heater on 800w then turn it down to 400w I use NONE of my baseboard heater, (except my room)I just put it on the floor between my kitchen/dining area and living room and it nice and warm...and the heat feels different,not dry, and the heat's uniform and nice, also in my kitchen there's no more noise 'cause of the wall heater has a fan...I've got one, I might get another...only if this one breaks down....GRRRREAT!!!
