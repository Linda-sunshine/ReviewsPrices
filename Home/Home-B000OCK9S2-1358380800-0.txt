review/summary: White noises are pretty good, alarm clock radio... not so much.review/text: I thought it would be nice to replace my alarm clock, but after setting the alarm time, I couldn't change it. After reading the instructions and setting the alarm time, there are no instructions to RE-set the alarm time. I finally figured out that you have to unplug the unit to be able to change the alarm time. The sounds are pretty good, but with the difficulty of using the alarm on the clock radio, I prefer to use a seperate sound machine,and keep my old clock radio.
