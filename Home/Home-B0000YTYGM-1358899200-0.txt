review/summary: Nice coffeemakerreview/text: This is a very nice coffee maker.The first thing we did was run three pots of water to get the factory dust etc. out of the unit and carafe. I checked the temperature of the water with my thermometer and it was 203 which is just about what it should be for extraction of flavor from coffee grounds.The flavor is quite good. Not quite as good as my chemex coffee maker but the comparison is really apples and oranges. As for flavor this exceeded my expectations.This unit does require the funnel shaped filters. I keep a supply of chemex funnel shaped filters and they fit the unit well if you push the filter down just a bit.As others have stated this coffeemaker is a little tall. I have high upper cabinets so this is not an issue but others may need to pull it out from under the upper cabinets to make coffee.The design is simple and somewhat elegant. The clock and buttons are large enough to see and use quite easily but small enough to avoid that left over from the 1960's space program look that is so common with the current middle of the market coffee pots.The carafe does keep your coffee warm for a long time. I have made coffee in the morning and come back from work to find the leftovers still warm. The lid opens and closes quite easily and the pour while a little slower than other similar carafes is really not an issue unless you have the patience of a gnat.Overall I have to give this one an A. I still use my chemex coffee maker on weekends for true gourmet coffee but for a daily brew before work this one gets it done..
