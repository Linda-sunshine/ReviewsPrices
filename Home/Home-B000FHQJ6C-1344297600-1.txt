review/summary: Good juicer for the pricereview/text: This is my first juicer and so, I cannot really compare it with any other items. That said, this is a well thought out product. It's easy to clean, and simple enough to use. I tried Tomato's, Pineapple, Carrots, grapes and apples in this. Excepting apples the rest of them tasted great. Definitely beats buying flavored sugar water in stores. The machine does leave a lot of pulp though and that's the reason why I am giving it 4 stars.
