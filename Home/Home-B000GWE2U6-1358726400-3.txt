review/summary: Super Cutereview/text: Works well and is super cute in our little boy's room. We weren't sure where to put it. The closest plug in was behind dresser that doubles as the changing table. The kid kicked it off one day during a change and broke the bottom inside piece and now it leaks so we can't use it. Up until that unfortunate incident, it worked well and he loved trying to catch the mist if he was under it while it was turned on.
