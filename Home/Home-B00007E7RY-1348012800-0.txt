review/summary: Honeywell 50250-s is GREATreview/text: Wonderful purifier. It's not as quiet as some, but does a great job. I've had one for 3 years and just bought a second one for my daughter's room. I've had no problem with the first one and the second one seems just as great so far. I love that the filter doesn't have to be changed; you can just vacuum it when needed.
