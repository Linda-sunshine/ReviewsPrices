review/summary: A piece of junk!review/text: I used my brand new Nesco dehydrator ONCE to try to dry some herbs. It appeared to work for about an hour, got real hot, then just quit. A DAY later, and my herbs are about as dry as they would be if I just left them on the counter, and the machine is stone cold. I can't find my receipt, so I'm just out the money. I will NEVER buy a Nesco product again. NEVER.
