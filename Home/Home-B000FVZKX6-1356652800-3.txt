review/summary: These are beautiful.review/text: I had another set of sheets in this brand, only not flannel. I read reviews that they didn't wear well and I don't agree at all. We used them a lot and washed them in hot water often and they are still beautiful. Like I said, this is the first set of flannel I've bought, so we'll see, but I'm optimistic. They are beautiful and very soft. I used them for the first time last night and they are very cozy in the cold weather.
