review/summary: Second one's a charm--review/text: First off--this item ships in it's original box and it's not really cushioned well enough in my opinion which is why the first one I received was damaged and quit working after one day. Secondly--the customer service through the actual manufacturer and Amazon was perfect. I was very nervous because I've never had to return anything and especially nothing defective but it was great. The first guy (David) from Honeywell had me do some tests and in doing so a small piece of metal fell out from the motor. Problem solved. I then had to call Amazon and talked to Debbie who took care of everything. She two-day shipped my replacement and all's well! Now--I've had MANY humidifiers over the years and this is the first I've had that shuts off while there's still water in the bottom. At first I thought I had a lemon but then realized if you fill at least one of the tanks it will cycle back on. Keep that in mind and I think you'll have a great humidifier. It puts out a lot of moisture and you can set the humidity level which is nice. It is loud when run at high fan speed but that's to be expected. I did take away one star on this review because of the packaging.
