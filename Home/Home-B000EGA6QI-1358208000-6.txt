review/summary: it does it!review/text: this is a sweet SmartStick! I had a Braun for more than 20 years and it finally stopped dead! so I ordered this one and I do like the features--comes apart for washing, the color is FUN... It is still "new" but I expect to give it good care, and get many years' service from it.I gave 4, not 5-star rating, as its handle attaches/seats onto the base with PLASTIC contacts. so we will see some thoughtless owners jamming forcing and breaking and COMPLAINING--what's new!
