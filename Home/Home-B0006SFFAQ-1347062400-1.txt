review/summary: DO NOT BUY - FIRE HAZARD!!!review/text: We purchased this in April 2010, and used it for two and a half years. It is a great coffee maker, provided you are not afraid of burning your house down!This morning, a few minutes after brewing a pot, the carafe was sitting on the warming plate in the machine when we started to hear popping and sizzling noises from the coffee maker. I noticed the red indicator light for the warming plate had gone off, which was strange, so I went over to see what was going on with it. When I got close to it I saw smoke coming out of the warming plate area and smelled a foul acrid electrical burning smell. I quickly unplugged the machine and put it outside on the concrete patio. It stopped smoking, did not actually ever catch on fire with visible flames, but something had been burning inside of it based on the smoke and smell that came out of it. Thanks god we were home, if we had been out I do not think our house would still be standing.Do not buy this machine, it is sadly a fire hazard.Not sure what to buy now to replace this machine. This unit should be recalled and pulled from the market.
