review/summary: It looks like I got unlucky againreview/text: It looks like about 90% of the time you get lucky and get a good machine but the other 10% of us get the duds. I got a dud. I popped 2 bowls of popcorn before mine gave out. Unfortunately it was a gift and we can't return it so it was a $30 waste....and now I am on the lookout for a new popper once again...I've had 3 in the last year.
