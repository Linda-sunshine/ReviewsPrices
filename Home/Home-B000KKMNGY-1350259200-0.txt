review/summary: It does the job.review/text: Depends on what you are looking for. If you are not looking for anything super sturdy to last you the next 20 years, this item should suffice just fine. There are definitely nicer, more elegant and expensive racks you can also buy if that is what you are looking for. For me, I needed to stick these in the laundry room, where the matched my preexisting white racks. Haven't run into any problems so far. A tip - before you buy you want to measure the depth of your cabinet and make sure these will fit.
