review/summary: AMAZING PRODUCTreview/text: I have been using flannel sheets in the winter for many years...but I have had such negative experiences, both with sheets I paid more and less than for these.I needed gray and some years ago I bought sheets from LLBean which have worn out..they were a lot more expensive than these sheets and no where near as wonderful. Last year I bought a set of flannel sheets from Costco which were so poor that I had to return them...These sheets are soft and cozy and luxurious and just wonderful. I have used them for a month or so and LOVE them. How sad that they are no longer available..I sure hope that they become available SOON. I also got the duvet cover which is just as wonderful. They are also roomy and go onto my thick mattress really well..We keep our bedroom quite cold in the winter at night and between the sheets and the down comforter with the duvet cover and then a hand knit mohair afghan on top we are wonderfully toasty warm...which we were not with our old sheets...This is one of the nicest products I have ever bought from Amazon....so...THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THEM....
