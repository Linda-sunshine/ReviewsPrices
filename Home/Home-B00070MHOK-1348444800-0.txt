review/summary: No Control over Steam Settings, Gunky Water Tankreview/text: While the water in this steamer heats up very quickly, there is no control over the steam settings. Be careful and don't leave this appliance unattended as the water will soon boil off. While initially the quick heating seemed to be a big plus, I realized that the lack of control settings (i.e. high, medium, low) was a minus. An even bigger minus was the fact that the way the water tank is designed (a plastic tab inside the tank obstructs ventilation), it never dries out completely. Also after one use, there was some sort of gunky white stuff on the bottom of the water tank. Tried the vinegar rinse, but the gunky stuff remained. In short, this appliance lacks control settings and it needs a redesign to allow for better drying between uses.
