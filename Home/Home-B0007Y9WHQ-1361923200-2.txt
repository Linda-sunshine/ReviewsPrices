review/summary: Great kitchen tool!review/text: I really like this veggie spiraling tool. It's absolutely essential for making zucchini &#34;noodles&#34; for my grain-free diet. It also makes awesome spiral-cut french fries. I haven't really done a lot else with it, but I'm sure it does a bang up job of spiraling other veggies if it can handle a potato. I had previously been making zucchini noodles on my mandoline, but there is almost no way to avoid cutting yourself unless you throw away 1/3 of the zucchini. With this tool, the only &#34;waste&#34; is just the small core of the vegetable, which is mostly filled with seeds in zucchini anyway, and you would really have to try to cut yourself on this. The blade is recessed in the plastic blade-holder insert, and as long as you use a modicum of safety and common sense, you shouldn't ever slice your fingers.However, there are two reasons I'm not giving it 5 stars. One, it's big and bulky and hard to store. I live in a condo with a small kitchen, and this device currently lives on my counter top. I wish it broke down a bit more so I could store it in a cabinet more easily. Two, as other reviewers stated, the plastic handle doesn't feel like it's going to last forever, especially if you are spiraling a lot of dense things like potatoes. For the price, though, this is a pretty darn useful and well-designed kitchen tool.
