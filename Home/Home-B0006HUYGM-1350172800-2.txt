review/summary: Most suck out of a small packagereview/text: This little guy packs a lot of sucking power. Exceeded best expectations. I purchased this based on recommendation, which came out to be true. Package arrived well ahead of schedule. The only flaw is that the corner attachment when not in use does not have a place to be stored on the unit, it has to be taken out and you might lose it if you are careless. Overall 99/100
