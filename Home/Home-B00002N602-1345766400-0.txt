review/summary: JUST GREAT!review/text: I am a newlywed and wanted so much to buy this pressure cooker as cook in it makes everything easier and quickly. The 4-quart is just perfect for cooking for 2! It was very easy to assemble, it doesn't take much space to storage and for now I have used it a lot and is just great.
