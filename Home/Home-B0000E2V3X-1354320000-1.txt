review/summary: better results, twice as fast as using my pizza stonereview/text: The cast iron pizza pan takes up heat so much quicker than the pizza stone I have been using. Pre-heating it even 20 minutes in a hot oven (450+ degrees) is enough to get a beautifully crusty pizza. I can never get a comparable result from the stone without pre-heating it at least an hour. Top Marks to Lodge for this one!
