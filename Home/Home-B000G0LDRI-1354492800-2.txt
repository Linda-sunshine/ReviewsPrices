review/summary: Didn't work as hopedreview/text: After researching humidifiers on the Internet I settled on this Honeywell model due to its good reviews. Now I'm wondering if those reviews weren't from Factory Reps? The humidifier was louder than expected and didn't adequately humidify my small home (&#60;1200sf). I don't recommend purchasing this item.
