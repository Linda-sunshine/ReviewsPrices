review/summary: Hot, hot, hot!review/text: I am always cold but this item heats up so much I couldn't sleep. This is despite the fact that the temperatures in our room are probably at their coldest right now given that the autumn nights are crisp and the central heating has not come on yet. I can't imagine what it would feel like when the heating kicks in or during the summer. We are returning it and looking for something that is truly ventilated.Incidentally, while a lot of memory foam gets hot, there is variation in brands. Our Nature's Sleep memory foam mattress does not heat up. It is a tad firm for my liking so I bought the tooper to make it softer but until I find something better, I'll take firm over hot anyday.
