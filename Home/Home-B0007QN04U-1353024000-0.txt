review/summary: Mixer to end all mixersreview/text: What else can I say about this thing? It chews through mashed potatoes and cookie dough like a pack of piranha on a wounded gazelle. This kitchenAid monstrosity was an upgrade from the tilt-up smaller version for me and worth every single penny. Not to say that the smaller one did not serve me well, but with 4 people in my family, it was either upgrade the mixer to make more bread, cookies and potatoes or unleash a small cannibal horde upon the unknowing masses. All in all a good product.
