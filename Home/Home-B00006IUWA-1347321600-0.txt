review/summary: Presto PopLite Hot Air Popperreview/text: This is a very neat little popper. After the popcorn is popped, I spray it with Canola Spray and sprinkle Cardia Salt (which is a salt-tasting salt substitute that I purchase from Amazon) over the popped corn. I then enjoy a high fiber treat.
