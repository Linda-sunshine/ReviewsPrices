review/summary: Way too expensive!!!review/text: The gel fireplace we bought holds three cans at a time and makes for a nice crackling fire. However, burning three cans at once equates to approximately $8+ (approximately $2.65 per can, not including sales tax, if applicable) for 2.5 hours of burning. When we bought the fireplace, the gel was much cheaper and having a nice fire was more affordable. We are looking for alternatives such as burning one can at a time, sometimes combined with candles, to eliminate the high cost. If the cost goes up any more, we will stop buying because it's not worth it.The cost of the gel is certainly something to consider before you buy a gel fireplace.
