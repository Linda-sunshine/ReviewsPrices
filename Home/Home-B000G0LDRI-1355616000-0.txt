review/summary: I have no faith in the human race..!!! Excellent Productreview/text: If you would read about this product.. before you purchase it, you would know the specifications.. Instead of purchasing it and then giving a bad review... Quit being a moron.. I live in an almost 200 year old house that is very dry and very dusty, This product is fantastic it hydrates the air quite efficiently once it catches up to regulate humidity. The combination of the two 1.5 gallon tanks are filled before bedtime and last through the afternoon. Then the next day the tanks are filled again and is working perfectly. The color of the filter is black and hairy this thing gets all the dust out of the air and some apparent floating dog hairs from our yellow lab. It has been running consistently everyday I think about a month now. I am ordering replacement filters Ive had to wash this one twice now.
