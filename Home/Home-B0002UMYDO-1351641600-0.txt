review/summary: Great Buy!review/text: I purchased this can opener after carefully checking on the reviews at consumer reports. They rated this can opener as the best and I truely agree. I received it in a timely fashion and it works great. It's tall so it accomodates all can sizes and operates quietly. I love how you can store the cord inside the unit. I don't leave it out on my counter and I must say it is light weight and not combersome to bring out when I need it. Thanks for offering a super product and for delivering it quickly.
