review/summary: haha, make sure it'll fit over your drain!!! :)review/text: This would be a classic example of: don't order things late at night without really thinking it through. I bought this for my deep claw foot tub so I could put more water into it... what I didn't figure was that my drain is wedged right underneath my faucet so there's no way I could fit the cover over it (DUH!!!). So, this may be an excellent product but I'll never know because I was a dope and didn't double check the size and layout of my tub drain :) Only wrote the review to potentially save someone else the hassle - will make a great gift for a family member or friend if I can find someone with a tub this will fit over! haha... oh well
