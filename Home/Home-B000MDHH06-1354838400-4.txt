review/summary: Doesn't juice fullyreview/text: You can actually waste food with this juicer. What I've notice was when you put pear, apple, or anything hard food that's good for juicing, at the very end a piece of the food will fly to the carousel and it made a loud snap sound. I don't think that's normal. The carousel hold all of the waste after juicing. When I remove the waste out of the carousel I can still feel the juice in it.You need to clean this juicer right away to keep it from stain. The little container should be the first thing you should clean because it's where the juice came from. I was planning on returning it for something else, but missed out on the return date.Other then those major problems, it works as it should.I was amazed the first day, but disappointed just a few days after.
