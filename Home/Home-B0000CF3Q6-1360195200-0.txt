review/summary: I think it tastes good, is fun to make and makes me feel like I'm back in Europe, so I love it!review/text: I'm an American, but my Italian and Argentinian friends all rave about these things and so I decided to give it a try. I never really liked American coffee, but this is easy to use, quick, easy to clean (don't use soap!) and the coffee is good. Be aware, they don't make American super sized coffee cups, but demitasse sized. I get about 2-3 cups each time. Also it's not &#34;true&#34; espresso as some of my Starbucks coffee aficionados have pointed out. I think it tastes good, is fun to make and makes me feel like I'm back in Europe, so I love it!
