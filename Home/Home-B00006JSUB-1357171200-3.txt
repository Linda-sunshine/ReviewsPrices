review/summary: GREAT SIZEreview/text: I really like this size. I have the 8 inch and this size is much better. I cook everything from vegetables, eggs and meat. I seasoned it in the oven over 5 times with flax seed oil. I have no problems with the food sticking. Cleans up great. I also bought the lid to go with it, which makes for each quicker cooking time.
