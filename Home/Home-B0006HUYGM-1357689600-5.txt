review/summary: so little and so powerfulreview/text: I researched several days before ordering this little vacuum. It's great for quick jobs around the house and so portable. Worked great on the car, too. I have a long-haired dog and this little vacuum grabs all the hair on the couch and dog bed. So, much better than the cordless vacuums which often lack the power needed for most jobs.
