review/summary: I really can't express what a waste of money this heater is :-{ I love Amazon, but I don't like this heaterreview/text: I did research and compared heaters, I took my time and I thought "OPTIMUS" brand and this particular heater was the right choice for me. I bought it last winter 12/2011 & it worked fine. I pulled it out this winter 12/2012 & it DOES NOT WORK!!!!!! I bought two(2) of this particular heater. In total I bought three (3) OPTIMUS brand heaters last winter and all three have stopped working after one(1) season of use. :-{
