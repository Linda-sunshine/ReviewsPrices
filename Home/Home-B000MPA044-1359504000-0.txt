review/summary: It is magic!!!review/text: I dislike to cook and I don't have much time or patience for it, but I have 4 teenage sons so I have to cook.I rarely plan ahead, and I get distracted doing a million other things at home so I have burnt quite a few dishes in my time, once almost the kitchen. I've always been terrified and fascinated by pressure cookers, afraid that they would explode and amazed by how fast the food is ready. I was recommended this pressure cooker and I love it. I cook a lot in it. Just 2 days ago I put a frozen roast in it, I did remove the plastic wrap... Added cajun seasoning and put it on high pressure for 99 minutes and I left to run errands, 2 hrs later it was ready, moist, soft and quite tasty. My guys liked it and they don't care much for my cooking ;-). OH, I did NOT burn the kitchen or anything else. I highly recommend it !!!!
