review/summary: Purchased for single cup drip coffee. I would recommendreview/text: Purchased this as a birthday gift. The idea was to provide the individual with the ability to brew a single cup of coffee with the least amount of hassle/waste. So far this is a winner.Pros:1. Cheap device ($26) for brewing coffee and simple to operate.2. Easy clean-up. The rubber grommet cleans the sides of the tube when depressing. Once fully depressed the coffee grounds with filter pops off as one &#34;puck&#34;.3. I am told the coffee is very good from this device. Those using this device find most coffees from the Keurig pods too strong for a single cup so they usually use one pod to brew to cups. With this device they can adjust grounds to their tastes.Cons:1. Only used it for about a month. So far it is holding up but some reviews have mentioned the plastic deforms from continually running hot water through it.2. There needs to be some way to guide the plunger down the chamber while depressing. It can flex side to side while initially depressing it.3. Care must be taken when depressing the plunger such that the user is depressing it from a completely vertical position. Depending on the cup shape this may be since it could tip. It may benefit from some way of using one hand to secure it while the other hand can be used to depress the plunger.Overall I highly recommend this product for this price to anyone looking for a way to brew drip coffee one cup at a time.
