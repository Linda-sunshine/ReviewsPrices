review/summary: It does the job as a spice grinderreview/text: I bought this one to grind herbs in order to make my own herbal tea, and it works perfectly well.I use Keurig single serve coffer maker to make tea, and in order to make it work well with Keurig system, I have to grind the herbs I use to make tea into fine powers. No matter what kind of herbs I grinded, it only takes about 5 seconds to have the job done. The only draw back to me is the amount of the herbs I can grind at a time.
