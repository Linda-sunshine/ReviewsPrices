review/summary: Second season, still like newreview/text: We just love these sheets, in fact, I have ordered them for my sons and daughters-in law and am now ordering again for my guest room. I feel guilty knowing that my guest are sleeping on so-so flannel when I'm sleeping on a cloud! Two years and showing no sign of wear! As comfy as the first time I put them on our bed.
