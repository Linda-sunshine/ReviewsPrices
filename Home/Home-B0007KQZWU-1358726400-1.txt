review/summary: Great investment and professional qualityreview/text: These pans are by far one of our best Amazon finds. We've gone through several high-end brands, including Teflon Calphalon pans. After using these for a week, we knew we'd be using these for many years to come. They are very sturdy and solid, and of professional quality. They can be difficult to clean when food gets burnt, but learn to love Bar Keeper's for sure. A good cleaning and they restore back to brand new. As with most pans, the area around the rivets and above the handle on the exterior are very hard to clean, so those become the dirty spots. Nonetheless, these are high quality pans at a great price. Pick these up for sure if your looking for new pans. Once you go stainless, you won't go back :)
