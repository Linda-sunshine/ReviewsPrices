review/summary: Great Valuereview/text: I discovered this little gem when I was staying at a 17th Century villa in Umbria Italy. It's a great simple machine. I also received a $20 rebate. One complaint: the pump makes it vibrate and the vessel you put the espresso in may move around on the stand. I'm not sure if it's normal. The manual mentions the water reservoir may be loose, but mine is not.
