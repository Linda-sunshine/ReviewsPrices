review/summary: EcoPOD Saved my Seseo from the trashreview/text: I had always loved my Senseo and became very dissappointed when their coffee pods vanished from the supermarket shelves. I was considering buying an expensive new machine and throwing out my Senseo. EcoPod saved the day. I was skeptical at first and even thought the plastic was a bit pricey. Since the alternative was an expensive new machine and even more expensive pods for a different brand, I tried the EcoPod. I have been using them twice a day, every day for six months and have more than gotten my money's worth. I highly recommend it. Six months and the plastice is holding up fine. If and when they fail, I will buy them again.Peter
