review/summary: Six and a Half Years of Faithful Service and Still Running Strongreview/text: I bought this vacuum in mid 2006 to keep my Peterbilt clean. At the time, I was "team" driving with my wife and our cat Rex. Two people and a cat cooped up in an area the size of a small bathroom 24 hours a day for several weeks at a time can really make for filthy living conditions if you don't make cleanliness a priority (which I do), and this little vac really made housekeeping a cinch.As other reviewers have commented, the beater bar / brush is very effective at picking up pet hair. It was so effective in fact, that nobody who had been in our truck would believe us when we told them we had a cat in our truck because there was no residual cat hair anywhere to be seen.Some reviewers have commented that the vacuum is a little bulky, and to some extent that is true, especially when compared to less versatile and less powerful competitors; but all that suction has to be generated somewhere, and I think the designers did a good job of packing as much power and versatility as possible into a package that is still relatively maneuverable. The short hose and the included crevice tool (which stores neatly in the exhaust port) make it possible to reach most places in my truck and home. There is an accessory pack available that looks like it would address most accessibility issues, but I've never felt the need to buy it; and the extra long cord means you can almost always find an outlet that will allow you to reach the area you want to clean.Emptying the dirt collection bin is literally a snap, and the filter is perhaps the most durable I've ever seen. In fact, I'm only now replacing the original filter after six and half years of regular use. I liked this little vacuum so much that I bought it a second time, after our truck was stolen and we lost everything in it, and I will buy another one if my current model ever fails.
