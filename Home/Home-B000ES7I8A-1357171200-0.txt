review/summary: should have bought one of these a decade ago!review/text: Seriously. should have bought one of these a decade ago. A friend of mine had one and I didn't see the wisdom in it until recently. I am so thrilled with this that I bought a second one for a family member. Auto shut off is the most appreciated feature of this kettle. No more dry water kettles on the stove. Heats water faster than any other method. Fills a large teapot.Solid seamed stainless steel so there is no plastic touching the water while it boils.
