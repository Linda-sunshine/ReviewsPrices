review/summary: Works for me!review/text: After reading mixed reviews, I decided an experiment was in order. First, I put hot tap water in the thermos for about 15 minutes (as instructed on the package), then I emptied it and refilled it with hot (112 degrees Fahrenheit) tap water. I also filled a regular glass with hot tap water to serve as a control. After 3.5 hours, the water in the glass was 72 degrees and the water in the thermos was 100 degrees. That's only 12 degrees of heat loss in 3.5 hours. Works for me. I can't wait to send hot food to school with my son! So many more options!
