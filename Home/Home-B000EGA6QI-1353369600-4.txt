review/summary: Love it!!!review/text: Handiest tool I have in the kitchen! Works great on hot soups. For cold stuff - dressings, etc, I like to use a wide mouth mason jar. I put it in the dishwasher - ours must be too hot - it damaged it. I called Cuisinart's customer service - and they shipped another shaft out free - had it within the week. Hand wash now - but not a big deal - simple rinse in soapy water and then clean water. Highly, highly recommend.
