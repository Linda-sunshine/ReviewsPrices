review/summary: I use it on a daily basis!review/text: I love this for making tea or hot cocoa, which is every day. It is light weight when empty and is great for traveling with. I'm not a coffee person and found that hot water brewed in a hotel room coffee maker still tastes like coffee. This offers the perfect solution. You can also use the boiling water to make cup-a-soup. I like it so well that I have one at home, one in my classroom, and just ordered this same one for a friend's birthday. I use filtered water from my fridge to fill it so I don't have to worry about deposit build-up. At work, I use bottled water. It heats very quickly. It doesn't whistle which is nice. It boils and then clicks off.
