review/summary: Fine Juicing, Terrible Messreview/text: This juicer did a good job at juicing carrots and other dry vegetables. For some reason there is a small hole in the top of the lid where the pulp goes, so when you juice harder items like carrots little pieces spray up in the air. I covered the hole with a rag which worked, but I am so disappointed with the mess that I am returning it and buying a more expensive juicer. Also, it is too loud and does a terrible job juicing leafy veggies like spinach and juicier fruits like kiwi.
