review/summary: Challenges our way of life and thinkingreview/text: This was one of my favorite books growing up. Our teacher read it to us at lunch in 4th grade, and I've read it quite a few times since (which is a big thing, because unless I'm reading a series and need to remind myself of what happened, I NEVER reread books). Unfortunately, the end always left me wanting more of this great book. I thought I would get this from the next two books in the series, unfortunately they didn't quite involve this exact time and place.It was the first book that introduced me to the dystopian genre and really made me think about our way of life. What is right, what is wrong? How does human nature shape our way of living and how would we live without pieces of it? This is a great learning novel for older elementary kids!
