review/summary: Disappointed on product, happy with Customer Servicereview/text: Received this pot for Christmas 2011 (wife bought it inspired by my wish list). We thoroughly enjoyed it for soups, chili, stews, pot roasts, and others foods. Used it on the stove (gas) and in the oven. We really enjoyed cooking with it.Then a couple of weeks ago my wife was making a pot roast when I heard her scream. The enamel lining had exploded sending pieces of white porcelain/enamel everywhere on the stove, floor, and countertop. After cleaning it up and salvaging most of the roast, I read the reviews, especially those complaining of the same problem and the disappointment with the customer service offered by Lodge.Sent a choicely worded email to the "Contact Us" address from their website expecting little. Two days later received a personal reply with the expected "Did you follow use & care and were you cooking empty? Send picture." Without getting too excited, I retrieved the pot from the trash, took a couple pics with my phone (took me over a week to get around to it) and replied "Yes. No. Attached." and sent it with the pictures. The next day I got a reply (with a realistic sounding name and a phone #) saying they were sending a new one, shipping in a week.Received the replacement today - four days before they said would ship it.Very satisfied. Hope they have solved the product problem as their communications implies. Looking forward to using it.
