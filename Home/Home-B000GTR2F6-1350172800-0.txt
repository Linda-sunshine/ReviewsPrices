review/summary: Only a coffee-snob would hate this machinereview/text: This machine is fantastic!I have it set up to turn itself on every morning automatically. So when I wake up, all I have to do is slide my mug under it, insert a K-Cup, and hit the button. 20 seconds later I have coffee.And if you put the creamer in first, the squirting action mixes it as it pours.Simple. Easy. Fast. Delicious.The K-Cups are expensive at the grocery store, but they are cheap on Amazon. And there's tons of flavors/brands to choose from.I recommend buying a sample pack of K-Cups so that you can try the various brands and see what you like.And if you want to brew your own locally-bought coffee, you can buy reusable cups to do just that.I only have 2 minor issues with the machine:It could be slightly taller to fit to-go tumblers, even though the tray at the bottom is removable.And the cup-size settings run pretty small. I drink out of a somewhat large mug every morning, and the largest cup-setting fills it. So basically I've never used any size smaller than the largest, which means there are 4 other sizes that I'll never need.This machine has changed my morning routine for the better. I love it.
