review/summary: Don't Even Think About It!review/text: Although I've washed and sanitized these linens six times, there is no way to get rid of the chemical smell in them. While they were very inexpensive, it's not worth the low price to purchase these. The only thing I can do is throw them out. I would not wish these linens on anyone.
