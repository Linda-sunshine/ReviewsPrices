review/summary: Haven't used it yet; it's sooooo BIG!review/text: I have a glass top electric cooktop. The pan goes way over what the burner is....but then, I was thinking about it and it would be way over on a gas cooking area too.....so I guess the pan will be okay on my stove.....am I right, or should I send it back and get the 10-1/2????......I'm a single person who loves to cook for my grandkids, etc.
