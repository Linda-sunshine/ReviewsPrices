review/summary: This is the best Thermos food jar so farreview/text: I have bought two other kid's thermos food jars, and one wouldn't close right after a few days, not sure why, and the other my son just grew out of the character. I like this one because it works still and the food stays warm, and looks neutral so I know he will not grow out of the design.
