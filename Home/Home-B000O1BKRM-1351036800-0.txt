review/summary: Great ice cube traysreview/text: I use these trays to make ice cubes out of plain and tonic water for drinks. Ice cube machine cubes have too much surface area and melt too fast, these are just nice 1" cubes that don't melt as fast while looking better.I don't understand how people have such trouble removing cubes from this tray. Yes, it is *kind of* more difficult than a regular ice cube tray that you just twist and most fall out (but not all, and some stick, and some crack, and the entire tray cracks sometimes...), but it is not difficult. You simply slide each cube out, one at a time. There are 15 cubes and it takes 1-2 seconds to take a cube out, yes folks...a whole 15-30 seconds, hardly impossible or time consuming.I have not noticed strange flavors in the cubes, and I use these for plain water ices cubes, so they have either fixed the issue or my taste and "smell" buds are not sensitive enough. I really like these trays and would recommend them without reservation.
