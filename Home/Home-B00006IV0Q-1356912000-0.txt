review/summary: Presto 12 cup Percolatorreview/text: Drip makers do not last long in my house it seems. I make about 2 or 3 pots of coffee a day with them. I purchased the Presto on the advice of a friend. They have used the same Presto percolator for 5 years. This pot makes a rich cup of coffee every time, the coffee stays piping hot as well. I do use a cupcake coffee filter in the basket, it seems to keep the grounds inside the basket better.
