review/summary: Unsatisfiedreview/text: Purchased two of these, one for myself and one for a gift. Both did not work correctly. Pushing the button to twist the corkscrew into the cork appeard to work, then when pushing the button to remove the cork, it did not remove the cork, only raised it a little. Had to re-do the corkscrew, 3-4 more times and then had to physically pull the cork out of the bottle by hand when it raised enough. Same problem with the one given as a gift. Tried it several times, and different people doing it, in case it was operator error. Functionality not good for the price. I cannot use it, and would return it, but do not still have the paperwork.
