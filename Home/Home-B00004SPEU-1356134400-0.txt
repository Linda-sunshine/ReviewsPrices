review/summary: Great for Small Apartment - Single Person Usereview/text: This little machine is great.Currently I use my Keurig machine the most, with the french press in a distant second. I started using the french press more for display since I didn't own a coffee grinder. The coffee grinds I would get from Starbucks would go stale in 2 weeks!I was cruising through Amazon.com when I found this little machine for $20.This is perfect for a person living by himself needing to make fresh coffee grinds once in awhile, without compromising any flavor from the coffee beans. Its small and light enough so you can move it around and not make it a permanent fixture in the kitchen. It can grind anywhere from coarse to fine. Surprisingly quieter than I expected. Also requires you to place the cap on top so you won't chop your fingers off by mistake.I guess the only small, tiny gripe I have is that no part of it besides the cap is removable for easy cleaning. However, I use it as a dedicated coffee grinder, so I like to keep it dry and generally just clean the cap and tap any excess grind out if using new beans. Not too much of a problem.The cord is also short as other reviewers point out, again not a problem for me who lives in a small apartment.Using it with the fill-your-own keurig cup adapters make pretty good and strong coffee. Haven't tried it yet with the french press but I have no doubt it will yield good results.Cheap, powerful, space efficient, and yielding good results. Can't complain.
