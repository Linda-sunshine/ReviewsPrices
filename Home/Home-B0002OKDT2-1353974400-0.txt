review/summary: Great Masticating Juicerreview/text: I am a big time researcher and spent over a month checking out juicers. I narrowed my search down to a masticating juicer since I wanted to juice greens, including wheatgrass. I had not juiced before so everything was kind of foreign to me so I kind of felt like I was taking a stab in the dark. But, after all of the great reviews I was hoping to not be disappointed. The juicer has not let me down. I juiced everything and it goes without a hitch. I have enjoyed many wonderful juices and have now had the juicer for over a year. One small complaint is that the large, main plastic container got a superficial crack in it the first month after purchase. It does not affect the juicer at all, but it is a little but of a bummer. All in all though, great juicer!!!
