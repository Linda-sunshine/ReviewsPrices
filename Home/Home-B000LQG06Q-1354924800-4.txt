review/summary: I love this thing!review/text: I read a lot of reviews of toppers and also looked at them in various stores before buying this one. I really like this one a lot. It's the perfect thickness in my opinion. It's very comfortable. We've only had it for 2 weeks so I can't attest to how it holds up over time but so far, so good. My only complaint is that it did smell when we took it out of the box. It smells like mints! Be prepared to let it air out for a few days before putting it on your bed. It also looks really weird when you first get it - it's all scrunched up in plastic wrap and it looks so small and deformed. But after you unwrap it and lay it out, it takes on a normal shape in just a few minutes. It is just as good, if not better, than the ones I saw in higher end stores.
