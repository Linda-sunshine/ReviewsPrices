review/summary: so far, so good...review/text: Received the vac a few weeks ago, and it works quite well. I like its light weight, maneuverability, and suction. The power cord seems a bit bulky and stiff, for some reason, and I am very careful when winding it back up. Also I have not rotated the top cord hook. It seems somewhat stiff and brittle and I don't want to tempt breakage.I am using the vac on the kitchen vinyl floor and hardwood around area rugs... also the hardwood in the hall. Soon to move, I will have much more hardwood and the purchase was really made for the new house. My real negative comment concerns cleaning the filter (yes, I read the complaints). It is rather nasty and dust billows about, even when careful, but unfortunately, that comes with 'bagless'.With technological advances in many different arenas, I really don't understand the lack with these cleaning products. Cordless are handy but don't last, this works well but the cord is bulky... and there OUGHT TO be a better way to empty out these things!I guess this will have to do for my hard surfaces, until something better comes along. One can only hope.....
