review/summary: Nice but a bit messyreview/text: This is an excellent grinder in terms of performance versus consumer cost. My only complaint is that cleanup tends to be a bit of a chore due to the amount of grounds left inside the grinder and also those sticking to collection bin due to static electricity. Minor complaint aside, this grinder (along with a french press) has enabled me to brew the best coffee I have ever had. Great purchase.
