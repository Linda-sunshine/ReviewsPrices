review/summary: great look, a little more hasslereview/text: I recently gave my Breville Juice Fountain to a friend with cancer. I knew I wanted to buy another Breville juicer to replace it and decided to give the Compact Juice Fountain a try. My kitchen is very open and most applicances stay out on my island.Pros: The juicer looks great and I love the smaller foot print.Cons: The pulp collects in the basket, which helps with the smaller footprint, but it does make clean up a little more of a hassle. I juice mostly greens, and I don't think I get quite the same yield from this juicer as I did with the larger Breville model.
