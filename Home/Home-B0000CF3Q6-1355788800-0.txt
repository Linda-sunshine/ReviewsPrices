review/summary: This is my new &#34;espresso machine&#34;review/text: This espresso maker does a great job of producing a fresh cup of espresso in only a few minutes. I've had it now for about 2 months and it hasn't let me down. I used to go to Starbucks 3-4 times a week, but I've only gone twice (during travel away from home) since purchasing this Bialetti. It is important to note that this will not compete with high-end espresso makers, but for $20 you can't complain. In order to get the best out of this maker, I recommend using filtered water, and fresh, evenly ground coffee. I make latte's using a milk frother and vanilla syrup at home now and saving a ton of money!
