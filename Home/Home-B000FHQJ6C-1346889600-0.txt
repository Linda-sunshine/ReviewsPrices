review/summary: The juice extractor vs juicing in generalreview/text: There are two issues purchasing this product brought up:1) The Juice Extractor- this was my first. It works fairly well. I think it is a good value. One issue is cleanup. The extractor creates a large amount of waste quickly. You must clean the basket frequently if making more than one glass at a time. It takes a while to disassemble and clean after using. Not efficient for a quick morning drink.2) Juicing in general - I had no idea how much waste juicing (at least with this extractor) creates. My first thought was "no wonder Odwalla's cost so much!" A large amount of the veggies are not used. If you compost at least you can do something with the unused stuff. The main thing this extractor taught me was why a Vitamix or Blendtec is the way to go (if you can afford it).Conclusion - this is a decent juice extractor, but all extractors waste a great deal of the nutrition and fiber in the fruits and veggies you pay for.
