review/summary: Its just okayreview/text: I have been looking for a sharp kitchen knife that cuts thru most everything easily. I saw this knife being reviewed on the TV show, &#34;America's Test Kitchen.&#34; It got quite rave reviews along with it's good price point. When compared to the high end/high priced knife in it's category, it was practicially an easy match. That is the reason I ordered it. The jury is still out whether I would re-order it again, but it was in high demand for Thanksgiving prepping by the &#34;other chefs&#34; in my kitchen that day.
