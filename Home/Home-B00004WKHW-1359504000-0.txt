review/summary: Good little processor, but doesn't do what I had hoped.review/text: This is a good -- albeit VERY SMALL -- food processor that, I'm sure, works for what it's intended, but, alas, it doesn't do what I'd hoped it would do. I own a frozen yogurt bar and bought this to chop up some of my harder toppings to add to yogurt shakes -- things like M&Ms and Reese's Pieces would cause my shake machine to chew through my cups. Unfortunately, these candies prove to be too hard for this food processor to chop. So while it seems to be a perfectly decent food processor, it really isn't much use to me as I have a larger processor that I use all the time for things like pie crust, grating cheese, etc.
