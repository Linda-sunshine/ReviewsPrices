review/summary: Very Soft and Cozyreview/text: I bought these as back up sheets when I am washing my Sheex sheets. But when they arrived, they went into rotation with my other set especially in the cold winter months. These flannel sheets are so soft and cozy that you really don't want to get out of bed.The set comes with two king size pillow cases, a flat sheet and a deep set fitted sheet. They are very soft and after we washed them we did find some lint, but nothing extravagant or major to talk about. We put them on the first night and felt very comfortable using just the fitted and flat sheets as blankets. They are so thick and soft, yet light enough that they do not tend to pull you down.The color seems to hold and I have no pill to speak of. At $65.00 a set, this price point makes these an excellent buy. I am going to run these through the wash a few more months and see how they hold up and if they keep impressing me like they are right now, I will most likely be buying a few more sets for next winter.
