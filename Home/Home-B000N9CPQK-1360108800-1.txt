review/summary: Honeywell hit-011review/text: Compact air purifier. We have birds in our home so I wanted something to help us with all the dust. I hadn'tBought one before so I wanted to start with something small. If the house is quiet it seems loud but I do leave it run constantly. It's been working wonderfully still considering another larger unit. I've had no problems and love the washable filter.
