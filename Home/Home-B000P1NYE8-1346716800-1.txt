review/summary: Inexpensive, works as intended and portable - Perfectreview/text: Scale functions quite well and is very easy to use. A lot of people are judging its calibration but I have not run into any problems when weighing small items. I love this item and you cannot beat the price. I highly recommend this product - it gets the job done inexpensively and easily.
