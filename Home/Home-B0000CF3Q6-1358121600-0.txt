review/summary: Perfect espresso!review/text: I purchased this espresso maker as birthday gift for my husband who's a coffee afficiando. The pot is of a nice, solid weight and stays balanced even on our gas stove. My husband tells almost everyone who will listen, how much he enjoys having fresh espresso every day. I'm not a coffee drinker, but he claims it makes a perfect cup every time.
