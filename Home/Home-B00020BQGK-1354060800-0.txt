review/summary: I Have Lost My Flairreview/text: When I purchased this vacuum I was elated. It was perfect. It did exactly what I expected. Unfortunately, the power nozzle lost its power after only one month. In good news, Hoover was quick to send me another one within days. In bad news, 2 months later the power nozzle again lost its power. This vacuum was used periodically in my kitchen on dry light dirt (used primarily to catch dust bunnies from cat hair). I LOVED it when it worked, but I offer this vacuum only one star because because i could not count on it to work. A tool that is not reliable is not a tool. I will not be requesting another nozzle.
