review/summary: Not bad, but not greatreview/text: We purchased this blender earlier this year to replace a much cheaper Hamilton Beach blender. Overall, this one wasn't much of an improvement. We had the leaky cup problem reported by the other reviewers, and finally called Kitchenaid to complain. They immediately sent out a new cup, no questions asked. So far, the new cup has not leaked, but everything looks the same as the old one, so I'm not sure why the other one leaked and this one does not.We primarily use this blender for fruit smoothies, and the performance has been somewhat disappointing. The motor has plenty of power, but we have to frequently stop the blender to push down the frozen ingredients into the path of the blade.
