review/summary: Nice Dehydratorreview/text: I found this dehydrator very easy to operate and it works great. Not very loud, just a small blowing sound from the fan. It heats up rather quickly and does a good job of drying your jerky. Easy to assemble and not real hard to clean. I have made several batches of jerky with excellent results. My last batch had two different flavors of meat seasoning and I numbered each tray, 1 though 5 with a magic marker so I could keep track of which tray had what flavor. It came in handy when I was switching trays around during the drying process.I'm well pleased with this dehydrator and would recommend it to others interested in making jerky.I've seen complaints that it did not have an on and of switch. I don't see a problem with that and it is probably a safty feature to make sure you don't have power to it when you break it down. There is not much difference in pulling a plug and turning a knob from on to off. No big deal and it's probably for your own protection.No regrets on this purchase at all.
