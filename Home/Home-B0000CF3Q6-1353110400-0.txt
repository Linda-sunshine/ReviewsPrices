review/summary: Perfect coffeereview/text: I got the three cup Bialetti Moka Express. The 3 cup really makes three shots of espresso if that. I didn't even buy different coffee to try, I just used my medium roast and it's great. Like the other reviews, I am only rinsing the pieces and cleaning up the grounds for cleaning. I keep the pieces separate for storage. I also am using low heat, so it takes about 10 minutes for the coffee to be ready. Add a little frothed milk and you will not be disappointed!
