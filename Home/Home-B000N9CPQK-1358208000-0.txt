review/summary: Not a HEPA filter - only a HEPA-Type filterreview/text: The product name is (as of this writing) :Honeywell HHT-001 Compact Air Purifier with Permanent HEPA FilterThis is inaccurate and thus I must rate this product 1 star for false advertising. The HEPA certification standard is there for a reason, and people look for "HEPA Filters" by name as opposed to the "HEPA-Type" filters which already piggyback on the HEPA name. This may very well be a good air filter, but it does not come with a Permanent HEPA Filter, so it is not the product advertised by the product name. There is a big difference between being certified to trap at least 99.97 percent of test particles and just claiming to trap an unspecified amount between 0% and 99% ("up to 99%").Update: I have been using this unit for a while - it's noisier than I expected on the lowest setting, certainly not using anything higher than that. When my coworker who smokes sat down and I had the "clean" air directed at me I got a blast of smoke smell as it sucked up the odor from his clothes and blew it in my face.
