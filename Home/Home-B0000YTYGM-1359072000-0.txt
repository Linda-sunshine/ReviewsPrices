review/summary: Best coffeemaker we have ever had in over 35 yearsreview/text: We have had two of this model for 3 years now and love it. It makes wonderful hot, great tasting coffee. We have two so we can have plenty of coffee available at family gatherings. We also like the convenience of having one to use while the one is being cleaned through with vinegar.The pot will overflow hot coffee and grounds on your counter maybe spilling on to your floor if you don't pay attention to assembly or keep the coffee maker clean. The 3 problems that could come up that will cause the overflow are:1. The lid isn't properly lined up.2. The lid assembly parts aren't kept clean.3. The little spring mechanism on the bottom of the filter basket is missing.Remedies are:1. Be sure to thread the lid carefully and evenly on the pot, check to make sure it is properly threaded.2. Keep the lid clean by soaking in vinegar periodically then soak several times in fresh, clean water.3. Check each time that the little spring mechanism thing on the bottom of the filter basket is present. Always be careful when emptying the filter basket that you don't accidentally knock it off. If you do don't use the pot until you get a new filter basket! That spring thingy slowly filters the coffee into the pot, if it is missing the coffee and grinds will gush out instead and cause an overflow of hot coffee and grounds onto your counter.OxyClean works great to remove the black coffee stain in the pot. Be sure to rinse all cleaners and vinegar thoroughly with plenty of fresh, clean water following the manufacturers suggestions.
