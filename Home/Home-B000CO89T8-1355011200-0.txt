review/summary: Two bad design featuresreview/text: The thing works well enough to keep my coffee warm. I've had several different brands and models of these in the past, and this doesn't seem to work any better or worse than its competitors. It does look nice, though; most others I've had looked more &#34;industrial&#34; or &#34;shop-made&#34; or something; not very polished. This one looks OK on my desk.However, there are two flaws that I just don't &#34;get&#34; that drop the rating from 5 to 3 stars:1) The &#34;on&#34; indicator lamp is on the back, by the cord. This means that it's impossible to tell if it's on or off when a cup is sitting on it, so I'm forever forgetting to turn it off because I don't notice the light. It bakes that last little bit of coffee in my mug down to a crusty paste.2) The switch is also in the back, so it's hard to get to with a cup on the platter. It's also a slide switch, and the switch takes more force to slide than the device weighs, so the whole device just slides when try to operate the switch; it actually takes two hands to work the switch - one to hold the gadget, and another to slide the switch. It's just plain annoying. A push-button would have been far preferable.
