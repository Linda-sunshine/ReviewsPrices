review/summary: These work GREAT!review/text: I've always had a warmer on my desk and in my family room. But finally one died. I didn't really like them because you had to use a tapered cup, as a full size mug wouldn't fit on it. I bought a pair of these on chance and I'm glad I did. They keep your coffee, tea, or other hot beverage hot. It won't heat them up, but will keep them hot/ warm enough to drink. And, not too hot that it makes your coffee bitter. And, you can use a regular mug, it'll fit. I highly recommend this.
