review/summary: Fantastic Juicer for Fruitsreview/text: I wanted to wait a while before I wrote a review on this juicer. I ended up buying this juicer from a local store versus Amazon because I wasn't sure what I would do if something crazy happened to it. So far, I've had this juicer for about 4 months and I love this thing! I first bought it so that I could make a bit of juice in the morning but now I currently use it for my juice fasting (lost 30 lbs so far)! I also have an Omega 8005 that I bought because my boyfriend kept telling me that masticating juicers are better and Amazon had it on sale for $150. With the Breville,I was juicing about 3 liters of fruit and vegetable juice per day and it yields a decent amount of juice. HOWEVER, I must admit that with leafy greens, the Omega comes out ahead with more yield, but with fruits, it kinda blows. Across the board, the Breville will give you a good amount with both fruits and veggies BUT if you plan to juice a lot of herbs like cilantro or wheatgrass, you would be better off with a masticating juicer like Omega. With me, I make a juice blend of 50% fruit and 50% veggie juice so I use the Omega for the veggies and the Breville for the fruit (and hard stuff like sweet potatoes, squash, and beets and ginger).I don't regret the purchase however with the high RPM, some fruits can bounce back at you if you don't cover the opening with the food pusher (or hands) and can cause a sticky situation if you're juicing things like beets. With leafy veggies, it takes technique in order to yield the most juice out of it with the Breville but it's do-able with very dry pulp as results. Also, if you're going to juice larger amounts of juice, you'll have to dump the pulp more than once (about 1x per liter), which can get a little annoying :( anyway, for $99, (I bought my boyfriend one for $89) the Breville will give you a solid juicer definately worth the money and will give you some delicious juice.
