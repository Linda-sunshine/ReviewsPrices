review/summary: Broke after 6 weeksreview/text: Stopped working after 6 weeks. For the 1st 6 weeks it worked ok but really did not hold enough coffee for my 12 cup pot also it is a stupid design you have to hold it upside down or the coffee spills all over the counter top when you are done grinding.
