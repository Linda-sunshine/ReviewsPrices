review/summary: Amazing!!!review/text: I've seen a digital weighing scale from a friend. I remember it was a glass scale too and it looked pretty cool. She loves it very much and said lots of good things about it. When I decided to lose weight I thought about buying my own digital weighing scale. I thought I should buy the same weighing scale as my friend's but I could not remember the exact brand name. So I searched anyway and this one came to my attention. It looked pretty much the same as my friend's so I bought it. I remember opening the package...it looked better than the picture. I so much love it because of it's accuracy. It has lbs reading and kilos...amazing. I read the manual. It says place on even floor. Unfortunately my floor is not even anywhere in the house and the first readings were suspicious. So I took it to my office where the floor is perfectly even...and voila!!!! Welcome accuracy, where have you been?
