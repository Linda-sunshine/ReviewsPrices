review/summary: Great Topper!!!review/text: I purchased this topper as an additional layer to my queen sofa sleeper mattress. The original mattress that came with the sofa sleeper was so uncomfortable. After placing this mattress topper, I could not feel the metal framework of the mattress. This topper is so comfortable, and it even still allows the sofa sleeper to fold up. We actually thought that we have to remove the topper everytime we have to fold the sofa sleeper. The only issue we had was that topper has a smell and it was a little bit longer than the size of our sofa sleeper mattress. You can actually cut out any excess by using kitchen scissors. I highly recommend this Foam Mattress.
