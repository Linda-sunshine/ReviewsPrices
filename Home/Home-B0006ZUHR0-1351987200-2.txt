review/summary: an excellent ironreview/text: My older, lighter weight Black & Decker iron stopped working. This is a lot heavier, but really does the job right. Before, I had to press & press to get wrinkles out of cotton. It is fast and easy with this new iron. I like all the features. Easy to fill, easy to adjust to different settings, and the steam works great. Glad I read all the reviews on different irons and selected this one.
