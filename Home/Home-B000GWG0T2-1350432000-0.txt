review/summary: Why did I wait so long?review/text: my old pans were so tired and I waited way too long to replace them - these are the bomb. Great feel in your hand, heats evenly and a snap to clean up. The hook on the end of the handle fits perfectly on my pot rack hook - a nice plus for such a cushy handle.
