review/summary: Makes great coffeereview/text: Makes a three shots of great tasting "espresso". I use a grind halfway between drip and espresso. Found starting with hot water makes a much better brew - less time on the stove. Steam and water leaked between the chambers the first couple times I used it. Took the seal off and carefully cleaned it and the threads; problem solved. Easy to clean, too.
