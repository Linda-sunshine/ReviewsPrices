review/summary: Heaven in a form of sheets!review/text: I have been looking for years for sheets in a light flannel that does not pill or ball. I have been through so many sheet sets I lost count over the years. I had a gift card and thought eh I may as well try another set and decided to go with these.The reviews seemed pretty good so i felt a bit more confident then just going to my local store and buying off a shelf.When they first arrived they looked like any other sheet, they were a bit stiff from being packaged in a square for so long and had a bit of that &#34;packaging&#34; smell to it. Off to the washer and dryer they went for the first test; how much fuzz would be left in the dryer tray and how much balls would appear.I am happy to report that the fuzz tray was not all that bad. It had average amount of lint from these sheets, but nothing like others I have seen. As for fuzz or balls, I saw nothing. The first test passed.Getting the sheets on the bed went good. I have a bit larger bed with a thick pillow top, so finding sheets that actually fit the bed and are not hanging on for dear life is a challenge. These went on fine and were not so snug that the mattress curls.We wash our sheets weekly so after 1 week of use happy to report the wear and tear went fine, no balls - no pills. Off to the washer/dryer they went for wash #2: it went great! no balls, nothing! Not much fuzz in the tray either.We are now a good 6 weeks into these sheets and have washed 6 times and I am sooo happy to report that they are still as nice and soft as they were when I first had them on the bed. They have not pilled, balled or anything. There are no wear spots on either side of the fitted sheet and the color has remained nice.Overall: I am super impressed with these sheets! I will purchase more in different colors and I may try their regular sheets since I had such a great experience with these.
