review/summary: Lifesaverreview/text: I must say this has been one of my best purchases ever...I do not use it on carpet or upholstery. I use it to clean tile, laminate, and wood floors. I put whatever cleaner I need in it: Murphy's oil for wood and laminate... Pinesol and vinegar for tile. You really don't even have to sweep first either.. I love it because it sucks up all the dirty water instead of just smearing it around with a mop. It cleans better in such a shorter amount of time that I could. I do use a towel to get up any extra water left behind. I will never be without one of these!!!
