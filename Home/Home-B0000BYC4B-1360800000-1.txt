review/summary: ~GOOD STORAGE CAPS~review/text: I was very surprised to find Ball Wide-Mouth Plastic Storage Caps, I didn't know they existed, since I'm not into canning however, I like Glass Mason Jars and got the Half Gallon size for my almond milk and I was using them with the double piece canning lids until I found the Plastic Storage Caps, what a pleasant surprise.The white Storage Caps works Great on the Jars, I shake the Jars to mix the milk and I haven't had any problems with leakage, they come 8 reusable Wide Mouth Plastic Caps in the Box, BPA Free, they are Dishwasher Safe Top Rack, I wash them by hand. Ball Plastic Caps come in all sizes, they are very Strong, I really like them and the Price here, can not be Beat! ...Thank You
