review/summary: This works well...I'm shocked to know about stuffs in municipal waterreview/text: The municipal water here taste awful. So I became a loyal customer of Nestle PureLife bottled water for some time. My friend suggested this option and I decided to try it. After a month of use, I'm pretty happy about the purchase.The other option I shortlisted was PURPUR CR-4000 5 Cup Pitcher with One Pitcher Filter. PUR uses activated carbon which works on the principle of adsorption. Brita uses ion-exchange resins in addition to activated carbons (but for some reason costs less?). By the way, water from both taste good.Now to nit-pick, I wish the lid could be closed completely. Also the lid falls off sometime when I pour water.Well, the shocking park of my experience was when I boiled the municipal water in a pressure cooker. I observed highly visible precipitated white sediments left over after the boiling. (Please check the image I uploaded) Then I boiled the filtered water from this pitcher and there was not a trace of precipitate this time. I assume the water contained the divalent hard water salts (Ca2+/Mg2+??) in high amounts.
