review/summary: Brews a really smooth cup of coffeereview/text: I was skeptical of the Aerobie,but it really does brew a nice cup of coffee. I really like that I can make a little pot of concentrate and add hot water for a fresh cup of coffee when i want one. The only downside, is that it takes up a lot more cabinet space than my old coffee press did.
