review/summary: Wife loves itreview/text: My wife loves it! I don't drink coffee, but she says it's a convenient and easy way to have a hot cup of coffee whenever she wants it, quickly, without any cleanup or mess. Set up was a piece of cake (that was my job), and it's easy to refill the water. The price I got on Amazon was cheaper than at Target and may have been better than Costco as well. Shipping was very fast.
