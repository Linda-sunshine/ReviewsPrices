review/summary: Great product!review/text: I'd never owned a dehydrator before, and chose this one based upon the reviews and ratings. I was not disappointed. It works great and isn't that noisy - I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and have no complaints. It seems to dry evenly even when all 5 trays are in use. It comes with 2 mesh tray liners and 2 fruit rollup liners - if you are drying sticky fruits or small items, the mesh liners are a must.Like other reviewers, I find it mildly annoying that there's no &#34;on/off&#34; switch, but on the plus side that's one less thing to worry about breaking...
