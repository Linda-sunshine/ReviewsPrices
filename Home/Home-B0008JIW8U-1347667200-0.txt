review/summary: nice!review/text: Good price, reliable delivery and a simple coffee machine! It's perfect for a quick cup in the morning before heading out if you're not a huge coffee drinker. I share it with 2 roommates and since we have different times it works out well. That's because it's more of a 2 cup maker though and we don't really have more than one cup.cleaning and everything else is easy, haven't tried out the timer yet. Recommendable!
