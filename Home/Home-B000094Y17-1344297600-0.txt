review/summary: The Lid to the pitcher comes off while pouringreview/text: The lid to the pitcher comes off while pouring. I'm thinking about returning the pitcher. Having a lid not come off while pouring is the most basic of order qualifiers. I don't understand how Brita has been so successful with this poorly made product. I have to make sure my hand does not knock off the lid when pouring.
