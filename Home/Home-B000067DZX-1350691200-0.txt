review/summary: Doesn't last for the time specifiedreview/text: The literature that comes with this product indicates that it should last at least 2 months, or a specified number of gallons. Since there are only two people in our household, and we live in NYC where the water quality is superb, I am thinking that the filters should last 2 months. They don't. After only three weeks the flow slows to a crawl. After 4 weeks they are useless!!!I have contacted customer service which referred me to the literature that comes with the product sent in an email. They offered no explanation and no replacement of the filters.I am switching back to Brita.I definitely would think twice and read some other reviews before reading this.
