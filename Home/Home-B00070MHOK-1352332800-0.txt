review/summary: Works well for the money. Not spectacularreview/text: I got this product in May 2012 to clean out my wool suits and sweaters. I have even used it on some shirts. All in all, this product does what it says. If you do not have a steamer, get one. I've been mostly happy with this one. One of the things you should realize when using a steamer is to use distilled water, as tap water WILL cause mineral buildup. I have been lazy about that, but the mineral buildup does not affect the steamer's performance too much.I would recommend using this with a clothes brush to first remove the bigger debris, and then steaming it with the attachable brushes to kill microorganisms and remove smaller debris. Again, if you own a suit but don't have a steamer, buy one. You won't go wrong with this one. It pays for itself by saving you unnecessary dry cleaning bills.
