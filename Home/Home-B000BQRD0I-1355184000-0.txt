review/summary: Works wellreview/text: This is much faster than ironing! I had resorted to just wearing wrinkled shirts for that last few weeks until this came.I've had the steamer for several weeks now and have had no problems with dripping, etc. Like any device that uses water frequently (irons, fountains, coffee, espresso machines), don't use tap water (often, hard water), as calcium deposits will build up. I bet that's what most people experience after months of use. Use osmosis filtered water to be on the safe side.
