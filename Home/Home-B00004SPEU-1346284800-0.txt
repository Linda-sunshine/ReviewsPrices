review/summary: Great replacement.review/text: My mom's Braun coffee grinder of 20+ years finally bit the dust, so I bought this as a replacement after seeing all the positive reviews. We like our coffee grounds on the finer side, and that's where this guy excels. Another reviewer mentioned buying another one just for spices, and I'm pretty tempted to do that as well.The only issue is that when you get the beans too fine, they stick to the bottom of the grinder and you have to scoop them out with a finger. That's probably unavoidable, though. Just buy it! You won't regret it.
