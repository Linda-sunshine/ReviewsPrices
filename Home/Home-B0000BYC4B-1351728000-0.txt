review/summary: Great Lidsreview/text: These lids are great for dry storage!! Best item I purchased as it really is a good thing and worth the money.But please note one thing. These lids will NOT seal, if you use it for liquid and don't have it standing up you will wind up with a mess. I ordered both the wide mouth and the regular as I use the Ball Jars for backing goods storage as I buy most things in bulk at Winco. For that purpose these lids are really great!
