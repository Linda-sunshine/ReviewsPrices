review/summary: Love it...just don't soak beans in itreview/text: Not sure what I was thinking..I was making chili so I soaked my kidney beans in it....duh..turned them black..and hard...had to start all over again. You can cook the beans in it but no soaking...and its great for baked beans and making artisan breads in the oven..
