review/summary: Brita 42629 Slim Pitcherreview/text: I bought this as a gift for my buddy Bubba after he fixed my chain saw. Bubba only drinks beer ,but I drink water and his water tasted all RUSTY and had a few little wigglers in it. BUT now I can have great tasteing water at Bubbas and at HOME because I got him the pitcher and some extra filters. I have a slim pitcher of my own at home and you just get used to good tasting water.It works pretty good on making the city water taste good too.
