review/summary: Finally, hot coffee in the morning.review/text: I didn't realize how great a truly hot cup of coffee was, first thing in the morning, until I ditched my Mr. Coffee drip and replaced it with &#34;Mr. Perky.&#34; Wow.Coffee tastes better, it stays warm in this coffeepot for my second cup when I'm ready for it, and it's made entirely of metal. No plastic.I remember long ago, my Aunt Wilma had a percolator similar to this one but about three times as big (or at least it's huge in my memories). She used that thing for years and years and years. Always had a pot brewing, and whenever someone came in the door, she was ready with a cup, a saucer, and her percolated brew.Today, I'm using mugs at my desk but I'm thrilled to have my own percolator. It's made my mornings a wee bit better, and I think you might like having a percolator in your home, too. Good coffee, dependable and fast.Complaints? The only thing I can report as a disappointment is the sound. Aunt Wilma's percolator was made by Corning Ware, its body was white with the little blue flower on it, and it made a cozy perking sound as the coffee brewed - and you could see the coffee as it brewed through the little glass dome handle on the top.I can't see or hear the brewing. Miss that.Love my Mr. Perky, though! Highly recommend it!- Reba Kennedy
