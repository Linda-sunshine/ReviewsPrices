review/summary: Best investment EVER! (Didn't expect to use it so much!)review/text: I figured I'd juice a little here and there, and boy, was I wrong! In six short weeks, this has become my best medicine and favorite device ever. I can't imagine life before juicing and see myself making juice every day for the rest of my life. Seriously!I got this mid-sized version of the juicer because of the size of my kitchen. It's awesome, but if I had more room, I would have gotten the bigger one with the pulp-collector on the side. If you're deciding between the two, and have the room, spend a little more and get the big one. Otherwise, this one is AWESOME!
