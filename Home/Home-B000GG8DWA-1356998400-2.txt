review/summary: Consider HOW this works before buying.review/text: This is a radiant heater. Think of standing in a sunny spot on a cool day. The sun on you feels warm but the air around you is cold. If you step out of the sun you will feel cold; step back into the sun and it feels good and warm. But the air is still cool. So this is best used when sitting at the computer or in front of the TV. It won't really heat up the bathroom if you put it in there and close the door and come back in 15 minutes. However if you stand in front of it after showering and while drying off it will feel good. Obviously it will warm air slowly- if just by heating objects that eventually give off their heat -but I would not intend to use this as a space heater. So why bother if it doesn't warm the air? Well it is relatively inexpensive to run. With two settings- 400 and 800 watts (it has two tube bulbs like you find in most toaster ovens) it uses about one half the energy as a typical 1500 watt heater on high. I use it in Florida on those cold 50 degree nights while writing reviews like this one on the computer. It is light as a feather, not bad looking and simple. No moving parts. Just a can holding two bulbs with a reflector behind them and a switch for low/high/off.
