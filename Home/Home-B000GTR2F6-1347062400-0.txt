review/summary: WHEN it works...review/text: This product is amazing...WHEN it works. This model worked for less than a year before showing signs of breaking down. Once it started, the machine started brewing less than the desired cup size or did not brew at all. It was really hit or miss whether or not the machine would work on any given day. I've descaled, unclogged and only use Brita filtered water. After over a year and a half, my machine has basically stopped working altogether which is a real shame because when it worked, it was an amazing and convenient machine. I loved the quickness of the machine and the variety of K-Cups I could use. I will be investing in a different model the second time around (I have boxes of unused K-cups to use). I've had experienced with the B40 model which heats and brews quicker than than model. Hopefully the problems will not repeat itself...
