review/summary: Why did I wait so long?review/text: I've just started using my new immersion blender and I'm astonished that I waited so long! I've used it for soups and sauces to far with great results: it takes seconds to puree soups--without all the mess and fuss of using a food processor or blender--and the two sauces I've blended with it came out smoothly in just seconds. I did pick up a piece of bone, which jammed the blade--my &#34;bone-headed&#34; move--but with very careful prodding, it popped right out. It is very powerful and the blades are very sharp, so do be much more careful with it than with other kitchen tools. Oh, and unless you want your kitchen redecorated from floor to ceiling in pea soup, so remember to turn it off when lifting it out of the liquid. Seriously, it's an easy to use, easy to clean, helpful tool.
