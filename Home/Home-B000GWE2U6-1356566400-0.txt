review/summary: Adorable, Quiet, and Functionalreview/text: I love how quite this little guy is! He's very efficient, too. I barely have to turn the dial a third of the way to avoid waking up with a scratchy throat, which happens almost every night regardless of the season. The only drawback I've had is that I didn't realize I needed a filter, so filling it with filtered water has been a bit of extra work, but well worth it!
