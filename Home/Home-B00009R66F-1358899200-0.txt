review/summary: Had to buy the exact same one I purchased in 1989review/text: I clean carpets and furniture a lot and previous one lasted 23 years. Just a bit of cosmetic changes, but works the same. The previous one I bought was still working great, but apparently a tube going to the upholstery cleaner was loose somewhere and would dump water on the floor instead of the upholstery. So I gave it to my son who needed one and it will work great for his carpets.
