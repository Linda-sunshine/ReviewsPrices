review/summary: Love at first juice!!!review/text: So worth the purchase I have so far juiced carrots but the pulp was so dry and the juice itself tasted amazing , I didn't know carrots could taste so good. I'm really glad I got this instead of another more expensive brand. It is super easy to take apart and put back together for cleaning.
