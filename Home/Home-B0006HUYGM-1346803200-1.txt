review/summary: Handheld that does the job.review/text: I researched quite a bit before buying this vac, and am pleased with it's performance. I use it for picking up birdseed around the cages and primarily for the stairs. I have a dyson and absolutely love it, but it's too heavy to drag on my stairs. I wanted a corded vac because all the rechargable ones seemed to not have enough time on a charge, including a portable Dyson- which I returned. The only downside as I see it was cleaning the filter, which could get messy. Now I noticed that there are a washable ones available and I'm going to give them a try. This little guy really does do a great job of cleaning though, and I'm sure with washable filters it will only add to my satisfaction.
