review/summary: A good, all around coffee maker.review/text: This makes our third in more than ten years. Works well, won't flood your counter unless you don't pay attention to the insertion of the thermal pot into the housing. Easy to clean, makes good coffee fast. Have tried others, always come back to this model. Highly Recommend.
