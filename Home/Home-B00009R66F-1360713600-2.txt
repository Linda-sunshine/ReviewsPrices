review/summary: so far so goodreview/text: I've been using the SteamVac for a couple of months now, and so far I've had no problems with it. It seems to do a fine job, even with just using plain water as I've been doing. The other reviewers are correct that the tanks aren't huge, but then I clean my carpet in sections anyway, because I get tired, so for me it's really no big deal. It holds plenty to clean each area thoroughly. I have no complaints.
