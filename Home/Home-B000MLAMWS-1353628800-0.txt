review/summary: Love it!review/text: I love to bake! This mixer saves me a lot of energy by mixing all of the ingredients for me. The various speeds allows for the sugar and eggs to mix well before I slow it down to add the flour and other items. I've heard that you can make other recipes using the mixer, but I have yet to try it out.
