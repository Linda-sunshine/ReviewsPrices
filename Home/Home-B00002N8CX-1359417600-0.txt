review/summary: Best for smaller home, hard surfacesreview/text: Since I have mostly tile floors, I like the fact that the floor tool is not motorized (and so doesn't throw bits around the room rather than sucking them up). I'm very happy going back to a bagged machine -- cleaning the filters and canisters in my no-bag hepa vacuum was getting to be a real pain. On hard surfaces I have had no problems with the unit turning over while dragging it around as some folks have complained about. In fact it is light enough that sometimes I just pick it up and carry it. The only thing I really don't like is the combination tool. I use the brush and find that the hard nozzle tool on the back side gets in the way when I'm trying to get into a tight spot. The hard nozzle side is a bit redundant as well -- I find the longer and thinner crevice tool more useful. I always have trouble with black plastic and/or rubber bumpers from machines marking things up, so I generally wrap the tools with a bit of masking tape. This unit will mark if you aren't careful, but not nearly as bad as some, especially the ones with rubber bumpers.
