review/summary: Melts Wrinkles Like Butterreview/text: Previously used a small, handheld Joy Mangano and while that one still works, I thought it was time for an upgrade. I love how quickly this heats up, can be broken down for transport, and very easy to clean. They do recommend using distilled water, I believe, so you won't get build up in the tank. I have never done this so I can see a lot of mineral deposits in the reservoir since I use Los Angeles tap water. Thankfully, all I have to do is unscrew the 2 connections and take it to the sink where I run water inside through the other side until the water runs clear.My only concern is that unless I hold the steam tube upright, the steam runs slow. This can be a problem for dresses and skirts. Had I known this beforehand, I might have reconsidered my purchase.
