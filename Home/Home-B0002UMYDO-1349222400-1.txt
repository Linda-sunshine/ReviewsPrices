review/summary: Why?review/text: is it that they can send a rocket to Mars but NOBODY can manufacture a lasting electric can opener. I've had two of these West Bends: first one lasted 7 months; last one lasted 10 months. I just ordered another. Why? Because all the other brands I bought didn't even last that long. Somebody, please make a good electric can opener that will last for 20 years like my last one made in America did!
