review/summary: Great starter juicer!review/text: When I purchased this juicer, I was looking for something that was inexpensive (as I had never juiced before and I wanted to know I'd like it) and easy to use. It works great! I read a lot of reviews before deciding on this particular model, and they had a lot of helpful tips such as not pushing down too much on the Food Pusher so as to get as much juice extracted as possible. If you push down too quickly on the pusher, the pulp will be pretty wet and you're just wasting juice! My only complaint is that there is a little slot on top of the shield that extends over the pulp bucket and I have pulp flying out of that! Annoying, but I have found that if I put a grocery bag in the pulp bucket it doesn't do that. (And clean-up is a lot easier as well!) For the inexperienced juicer on a budget, this one is perfect!
