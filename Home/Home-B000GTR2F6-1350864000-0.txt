review/summary: Keurig customer service ROCKS!review/text: I have a Keurig B77 that I purchased from Costco. It is at least 2 years old (maybe 3?) with heavy daily use from 3-4 coffee drinkers. Yesterday it started overfilling the cup, water just kept pouring out and you had to turn the machine off to get it to stop. I called Keurig customer service today. He asked me to try a few things such as cleaning out the puncture needles. Turned it back on and he could hear the water pouring out. He immediately said "I will send you a new machine." Now I realize they want you to continue to purchase Kcups but I still think that is awesome customer service. I just have to mail them back the cup holder piece. I definitely think I got my money's worth and more!!!
