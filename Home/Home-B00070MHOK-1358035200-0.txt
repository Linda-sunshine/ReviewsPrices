review/summary: Perfect for my purposereview/text: I have read a lot of bad reviews about this product. I have had it a few days now and all i have is good to say about it. Obviously it is not going to be used on my entire wardrobe with one fill of water. It will get me up to maybe 4 articles of clothing total per fill. Depends on how wrinkled the clothes are and how OCD you are.For those that rated this product horrible I think they held their expectations too high. This lil guy is a convenient travel mate or a quick steam in the morning before work. The instructions say it should take two minutes but not even close. In under a minute its ready to go. Its perfect for the purpose of my use. If your looking for a longer lasting and are planning on steaming your whole wardrobe - get a bigger clothing steamer. If you just want a quick fix.. this product will not disappoint.Jay D
