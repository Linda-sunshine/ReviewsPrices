review/summary: LOVE LOVE LOVEreview/text: My son has recently been diagonosed with Night time Asthma, and allergies. He is 3 and loves Thomas, so we decided we would give this a try. We have spent the past two weeks listening to him cough all night long, and get very little sleep. We tried everything, from even giving him cough medicine every night before bed, and using Vicks, and nothing worked. I showed him the Thomas Humidifier, and he loved it from the beginning. The nightlight is great, it is amazing to kids that the "steam" comes out. Last night was the first night in over 2 weeks that my sweet son slept great, and I didn't hear him cough once. Definitely worth the money! No complaints at all. Obviously, it is a cool mist humidifer, so the floor was a little moist, but that is to be expected when you have it on High for over 9 hours.
