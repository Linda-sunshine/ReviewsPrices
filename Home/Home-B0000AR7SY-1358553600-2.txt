review/summary: Does not work as advertised on Fine Grind or any Grindreview/text: Oh my gosh. I had read so many reviews and considered getting this grinder a big splurge. I sure was disappointed. Stopped working on the first fine setting grind in the middle of the grind. Stuck beans I guess. I had to empty it out clean it and start again. 4 different days later, I switched back to my old grinder. Every day was a challenge and I don't think it really do a good job on what it did grind. My coffee came out weak. I love my Krups Burr Grinder and will continue with it. I thought I might be stepping up on a good cup of coffee, but I sure was wrong. This is the most finicky Burr Grinder ever! Not worth the effort. I returned this item. Does not work as advertised.
