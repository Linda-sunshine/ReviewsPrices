review/summary: Low capacityreview/text: This grinder looks good and grinds well. The cord even retracts for easy storage. As with most grinders there is a metal cup around the blades. This is the first grinder I have had with no room above the metal cup for beans. I would not buy it again I would like it to have more capacity.
