review/summary: Best Nonstickreview/text: I have a 15 year-old frying pan from my freshman year of college that has outlasted every other pan in my kitchen and STILL retains its non-stick properties. One day I went searching for the maker, T-fal, to see if I could find more of these wondrous pans and I landed here, on the professional line. All I can say is, "Wow." The Professional Total Nonstick is the best nonstick pan I have every used, hands down. Food glides off this pan. Liquid beads up and runs away. It's excellent and in terms of current performance a big improvement over the 15 year-old pan I was still very happy with!
