review/summary: I just hate it!!review/text: Well I read a lot of the reviews of this bread machine and I needed one as my Regal Kitchen Pro died. I had it since 1992 and make a lot of bread and pizza dough. Well reading the booklet, the weights to make bread are weird. Since when am I to measure 4 7/16 cup of flour. Really, 7/16 cup!! So, any way I am sending it back. Also, I made a pizza dough and it was a gooey mess!! Almost like dough soup!!
