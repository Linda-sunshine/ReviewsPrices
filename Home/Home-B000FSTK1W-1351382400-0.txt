review/summary: Kept Fallingreview/text: I ordered this hoping to organize my bathroom. I was looking for something that I could put in the shower and the water-resistant. I set it up on one of the shower walls, wiping it down with alcohol as the directions said and the next day it came crashing to the ground (after only one shower!). I loved that it had cleared up so much space in our shower/tub but it didn't hold up at all unfortunately. So much for water-resistant.
