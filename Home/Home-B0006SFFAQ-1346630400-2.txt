review/summary: Warning: My Cuisinart DCC-1200 caught on fire this morningreview/text: I have had this coffee maker a little over a year. It has been well cared for. The water filters have been changed and it has not been abused in any way.This morning Monday September 3rd 2012 it caught on fire just after making coffee, the smell of something burning and smoke alerted us. I had been in the living room. Catching up on some email and drinking my first cup of coffee.I am glad my wife and I were at home on this Labor Day holiday. I am not sure of the outcome had this been allowed to burn for a longer period of time.I did a Google search of the "Cuisinart DCC-1200 " and was surprised to find many others who have experienced the same thing. Most after about one year of use.This Coffee Maker is a TIME BOMB waiting to set your home on fire. We were lucky, I hope you are too. Please ask your friends and family if they have this coffee maker, if they do, tell them to quit using it immediately. Better yet buy them another brand and trade it for the Cuisinart DCC-1200 then smash the Cuisinart with a sledgehammer before someone dies or their house burns down.AMAZON: Please be responsible and stop selling this product before it kills a innocent family.BUYERS: Pass the word and talk to your family, if they have this unit remove it from the home before you suffer a tragic loss.
