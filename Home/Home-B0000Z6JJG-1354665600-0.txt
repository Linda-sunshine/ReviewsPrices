review/summary: Great kitchen tool!review/text: We have food allergies in our house, so there are many foods that we can't just go out and buy. This thing makes my life so much easier and saves us money! I make home made potato chips, shredded hash browns, crinkle cut veggies to make them more exciting, shred a few carrots for salads, and I have more on my list to try. We've been using this at least once a week in our house for the last 6 months and its still in perfect condition. I love that I can fit most potatoes in this without having to cut them up first, like I did with my mom's smaller salad shooter.
