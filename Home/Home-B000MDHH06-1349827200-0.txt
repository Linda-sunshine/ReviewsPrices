review/summary: Alkalize Your Lifereview/text: Easy to juice, easy to clean, and easy to alkalize your body. Besides exercise, if you seek optimal health then juicing is a no-brainer and so is buying this Breville juicer. Brilliant design, relatively compact, and priced right. Get one and let your wallet and body thank you. Juicing green leafy foods will do you the most good. Fruit turns into glucose (sugar) in the body and is considered by some to be nature's candy. I load in things like spinach, kale, celery and add maybe a couple of apples or carrots to give it a nice taste (otherwise can be bitter).Juicing really can have a HUGE impact on your life and sense of well being. Chances are if you are an American and don't watch what you eat - you are either pre-diabetic or already there. It's nearly impossible to eat out and not end up eating things like processed foods and bread, and more bread, and more bread. All these flower products are building up acidity in your body and chances are your body is trying to speak to you in some way. For me it was acid indigestion, irregularity, and extreme fatigue. "But I thought food was supposed to give me energy?" To feel alive you must consume energy from an "alive" source, and by juicing veggies you're getting the liveliest source of food on the planet because it's fresh and loaded with micro-nutrients.The food industry has let us down so we must watch what we put into our bodies. Eating food is quite simply a transference of energy, so if you are eating processed dead foods then how do you expect to feel afterwards? We are meant to feel good and look good, so just remember that you truly are what you eat. Flip your food pyramid back around and get to juicing!
