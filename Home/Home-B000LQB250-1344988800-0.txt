review/summary: Great for deploymentreview/text: I put this topper on a twin bed while deployed. The beds you get are rock hard and this product, being 3 inchs, has made a huge diffrence in the sleep I've been getting. It cannot compare to my bed back home but I think this is the closest thing to a pillow top feel without the actual pillow top mattress. My Husband also got one for his twin bed, he loves it so much he has been having trouble getting up to go to the gym. It has a slight sink and leaves you relaxed and wanting to hit the snooze. Great buy.
