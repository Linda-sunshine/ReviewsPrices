review/summary: You Get What You Pay Forreview/text: The overall construction seems wimpy. The slide control is very sloppy. The red/green lights might be accurate for someone else. If you open the lid after the green light comes on, you are likely to get burned by the steam. So far, because I don't drive, Amazon is convenient, but 50/50 when it comes to overall quality.
