review/summary: Very Nicereview/text: Bought this for my Mother. Her very, very old and outdated, nearly 20 year old digital alarm clock, finally died. She needed a clock she could see from across the room, without any trouble. This alarm was easy to set up, easy to see, everything you need, and with the smart set up, she never has to worry about trying to remember how to change the time for daylight savings. Very nice.
