review/summary: Where were you all my life?review/text: Like many reviewers stated, this is a wonderful machine. Most pros and cons have been covered. No need to add to these.I bake at least twice a month, much more for holidays. For the longest time I thought it is unnecessary item in my already crowded with gadgets kitchen. I have Kitchenaid 9 speed hand mixer and it was enough to produce countless cakes and cookies. I was so wrong....It is so much easier and nicer to bake with this mixer. The machine does the hardest work while I'm left with a lot more time left on my hands. I got it for Christmas so I can't comment yet on longevity of this item but thanks to it, I baked 9 different types of cakes and pastry for holidays.I highly recommend it.
