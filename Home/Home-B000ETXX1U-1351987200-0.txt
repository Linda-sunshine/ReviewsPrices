review/summary: Good confort and fast to inflatereview/text: My biggest impression is the speed to inflate and deflate it. In like 5 minutes you can inflate/deflate and enjoy your bed. The noise to inflate is not extremely high, is almost the same of one aspirator.The confort is ok, you can make it more soft or hard, separated of the height. So, basically they have 2 parts, one is the height and other is the "cover", which is really to cool to customize based on the person/couple.When done, it grips to the ground and do not move.The only downside so far is the sides inflate more than the middle, which is not great for people that like to put the feet out of the bed.
