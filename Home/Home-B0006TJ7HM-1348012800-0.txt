review/summary: Recommended for Startersreview/text: The affordability of this set makes it a great buy. The knives are sharp, simply styled, and make cutting easy instead of a struggle. However, these are not top quality knives, and you should already expect that. A little more TLC will be necessary to make sure these knives last longer.With most stainless steel items, oxidation will occur and you will start to see rust. These knives are no different, but don't think that you are going to be getting giant blotches of rust out of nowhere. No, that doesn't happen. A tiny spot will appear eventually, and when it becomes an annoyance to you, go get some Bar Keepers Friend and clean it off. Looks new again, that easy. To help prevent rusting, dont leave your knives submerged/wet for long periods of time. Hand washing and hand drying often will definitely slow the process down.So if you're on a budget, a college student or in need of a starter kit... then this set is probably perfect for you.
