review/summary: West Bend 77203 Electric Can Openerreview/text: I bought this for my father so I don't know yet how he likes it. He had the cuisinart electrice can opener before which the magnet dropped out of. But I am glad that you had it among your inventory after reading the postive reviews and also seeing the cheaper price.
