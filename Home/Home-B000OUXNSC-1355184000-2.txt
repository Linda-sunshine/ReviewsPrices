review/summary: Only a little better than what you can get at Targetreview/text: The quality is so-so but the price is in line with that for the most part, maybe a hair over priced. My real WARNING here to other buyers is it's claim to fit mattresses up 22" deep, that would be a major negative. We have a 12" memory foam and it just barely meets the bottom edge of the sides I can not imagine how it would stay put on a much deeper mattress. Also take care in washing and drying like other reviews have mentioned.
