review/summary: Well, this is easier.review/text: For the amount I've spent on stupid thermometers trying to avoid buying this "expensive" kind, I could and should have just bought one of these to begin with.My only complaint is that my oven isn't metal so the magnet doesn't help me much. Otherwise, it's wonderful to be able to set it for my goal temp and leave it in the oven, and it lets me know exactly when to take out the food. No more guesswork!
