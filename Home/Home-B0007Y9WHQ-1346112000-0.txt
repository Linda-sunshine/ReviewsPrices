review/summary: Fun & Fastreview/text: What a neat little kitchen gadget! It really does make long noodles out of vegetables. I can make a big bowl of pasta with just one medium sized zucchini. It's simple to use and cleans up in no time. It also has suction cups on the bottom so it doesn't slide everywhere when in use.*The reason I gave this product four stars instead of five is because 1) the instructions are not helpful at all and 2) there's a safety issue. There are only two slots for storage. So one blade has to be exposed all the time.Also, for the blades that do have slots... Instead of pulling the blade out, push the button to release it. It's really easy. I make vegetable pasta with this all the time.
