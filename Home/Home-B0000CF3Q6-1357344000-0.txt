review/summary: Makes 2 cups of good expressoreview/text: Now it's not the frothy expresso you get from a large (and expensive) machine, but it makes 2 good cups - just right for an afternoon pick-me-up. And perfect to start the evening with a friend. By purchasing the extra spare gaskets, this can continue to produce good expresso for years. I have one that is going on 4 years now, having replaced the gaskets twice.
