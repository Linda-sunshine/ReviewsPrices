review/summary: Sensor stopped working in month 13 (12 month warranty)review/text: We loved, and I mean *loved* our iTouchless automatic trash can. Our big dogs were too puzzled by it to ever even try to get into it. It was easy to throw stuff away without touching a nasty trash can. And it was undeniably cool, and everybody who used it was fascinated by it and wanted one.However, after about 11 months the sensor started to get flaky, and it would not open when we waved near it like it normally would. Fresh batteries helped a little bit, but it was still unpredictable. Over the next two months it went from sporadically unresponsive to sporadically responsive to completely unresponsive.So I contacted the manufacturer, explained the situation, and inquired if they could be flexible on the warranty due to it having begun malfunctioning prior to the warranty expiring, and also due to the fact that it was only one month out of warranty.No dice. They do, however, sell a replacement lid, which we will be purchasing. However, I would not recommend this product unless you're prepared to spend another $45 every 13 months to replace the malfunctioning lid.This is a great concept but a poor execution.
