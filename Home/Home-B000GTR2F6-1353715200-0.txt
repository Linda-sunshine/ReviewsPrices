review/summary: Love this Keurigreview/text: I put it in the walk-thru panty to decrease traffic in the kitchen and let family & guests help themselves. Everyone seems to love it. I really does make a great cup of tea or coffee - of course, choose the brands of K cups that you like best. I've tried a large assortment and found favorites already - but this machine brews any of them very nicely. It's getting a lot of use & working perfectly after 2 months so far.
