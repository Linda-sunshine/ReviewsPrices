review/summary: My mistakereview/text: I needed to replace an old Black & Decker hand-held vac, and ordered this Eureka because I knew it would be more powerful. It is, but the inconvenience of the cord, plus difficulty in storing the cord after use, makes it less desirable than a hand-held. I know it's my own fault. Overall, this is a fine little machine, just a little too heavy and inconvenient for small cleanups.
