review/summary: LOVE IT!review/text: The best hot air popper I have ever had! Easy to clean, pops all but about 3 kernels, Hint: if you don't use the butter melting cup you don't have to clean it each time! Pops store brand and more expensive popcorn equally so it saves money at the grocery store. LOVE IT! We use it almost every night.
