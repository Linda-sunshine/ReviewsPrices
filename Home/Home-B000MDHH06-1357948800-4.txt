review/summary: Breville BJE200XL Compact Juice Fountain 700-Watt Juice Extractorreview/text: Yes I would recommend this product and I would recommend looking at the &#34;used, like new&#34; products. I did my research and decided on this juicer. As many of us like a bargain and want to get the best price, I looked into Amazon's definition of &#34;used, like new&#34;. The majority of the time what &#34;used&#34; means is that the box is damaged. In my case that was it, a couple of dints in the box.As per Amazon's policy, staff are required to unpack and repack the product to ensure the &#34;like new&#34; claim. Again, in my case, the product was &#34;like new&#34;. It was obvious someone had been in the box, however, it was obvious the juicer had never been used. For $70 and free shipping, I feel like a got a good deal compared to all other prices I saw at the time.On to the juicer....I like it! It is powerful, efficient and easy to clean. I had considered many other juicers during my research but kept coming back to the Breville. As others have noted, the pulp is still damp, but it is better than my previous juicer. I have no complaints with this juicer. I agree with the other positive reviewers on the juicer. I had planned on buying the bigger sized Breville juicer, but when I discovered they made a smaller version I was sold. I have a small kitchen and it sits in a counter corner comfortably and has an appealing look about it. Makes you want to juice. Here's to your health...and get juiced!!!!
