review/summary: Really nice vacuum for many different purposes!review/text: This things has better suction than any handheld vacuum you will ever use... it is impressive. The only issue that I have ever had with this product is that the black hose clogs every so often near the area where it connects on the front. It is great for cleaning out cars, cleaning up small home improvement projects, and cleaning inside couch cushions. It is a must have, especially for the price!
