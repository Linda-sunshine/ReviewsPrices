review/summary: A Can Opener that Opens Cans!review/text: Well made opener. Have not run across a can it would not open - yet!They could have designed the lever to start the can opener better. It has an edge to it (not sharp edge) so you push on an edge instead of a more ergonomic flat surface.Very pleased so far - I have never had an electric opener I have liked - this one I like!
