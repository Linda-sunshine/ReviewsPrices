review/summary: Very prettyreview/text: It was kinda tough with all the reviews saying it smells or tastes bad but l had bought one a number of years back at Macy's so l knew what they meant. I got one home and it both smelled bad and didn't work too well either. Called Capresso and they set up a pick and a new kettle. This one has worked very well and didn't smell bad from the start. This kettle is used a lot. I'm from England and drink tea all day. I bet this is used 6 to 8 times per day easily. I've had one for around 4 years and it has taken a licking. The top cap, chrome plastic part, came away from its black plastic under piece but still worked like usual, just not as pretty. The plastic joint just above the switch began to go in two different directions. Didn't look good but still worked. I finally decided to get a new one when it began to take longer to boil. Still boiled fine, just took about half again as much time. Which is still so much faster than most kettles anyway. I'm taking the old one into work with me. The new one looks good and so far smells fine to me. Take a chance on having a very pretty kettle.
