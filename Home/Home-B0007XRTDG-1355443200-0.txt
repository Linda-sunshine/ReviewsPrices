review/summary: Good Electric Skillet!review/text: A little on the large size making the large glass lid a tad unwieldy when removing to stir the food and the temp runs a little higher than indicated on the setting. Easy to clean and the size allows me to handle larger amounts of food. Overall a very good appliance.
