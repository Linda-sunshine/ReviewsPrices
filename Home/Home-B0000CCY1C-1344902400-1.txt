review/summary: Making cookies a breeze with this; less messy.review/text: Even though I've been a kitchen gadget collector all my long life, I always thought a cookie scoop was unnecessary, when I could just use two spoons. I've had to reconsider some lifelong cooking habits since I moved into a much smaller space. I decided to forgo a full size kitchen stove to save space and so now get along with a Breville oven (wonderful) and numerous cooking appliances. Because I can't cook as many cookies at once as I did in a regular oven, it made sense to make them more uniform. I love OXO products and this thing made me think I had been crazy not to have bought one long, long ago. I love it.
