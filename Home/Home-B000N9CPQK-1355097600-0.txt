review/summary: good product for the pricereview/text: I live in an older house, which i rent, i was getting sick all the time with respiratory infections and the doctor said told me that it might be from mold in the house i live in. i contacted the owners and they denied any mold being in the house (of course). i decided to buy an air purifier based on recommendations of friends who have has similiar problems. Months later i have not gotten sick again (but my roommates get an infection at least once a month). I have to clean out the filter every two weeks cause it is always full of dust and who knows what else. I love that it is a removeable filter that can be resused. The only problem is that even on the quietest setting is that it is still loud.
