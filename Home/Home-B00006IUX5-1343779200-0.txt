review/summary: Good for the pricereview/text: Seems pretty good for the price. I love anything with a retractable cord now. Makes it a little easier and cleaner to store. As others have mentioned, it doesn't hold too many coffee beans. I have to make about two batches. It doesn't seem like it grinds down very good either. For the price though I would say it is pretty good. I also like the design. My mom has had a Proctor Silex coffee grinder for years so I hope this one holds up also.
