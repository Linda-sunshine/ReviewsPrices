review/summary: My son is terrified, but my carpets are cleanreview/text: I've tried several small hand-vacs, including the Dyson one. I love my Dyson upright, but this Eureka Hand Vac is the best hand vacuum I've tried, by far. It's powerful, it's maneuverable, it's not too heavy, and it terrifies my son. My hope is that eventually he'll figure out that dumping trail mix and/or goldfish on the carpet = mom gets out the scary yellow monster, and he'll just stop dumping his snacks in the first place.
