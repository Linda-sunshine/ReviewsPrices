review/summary: Great Productreview/text: This item was purchased for the thermos feature. We use in in a busy independent auto repair facility where several service techs have various schedules and may drink coffee all day. The thermos keeps the coffee hot and it doesn't continue to &#34;cook&#34; as it would in a non-thermos version. It works so well that I've even noticed that if the coffee isn't totally consumed, it will still be warm the next morning. The DTC-975BKN is easy to use and makes great coffee. After a few weeks of usage, the inside stailess steel does discolor a bit even when scrubbed with a bottle brush/sponge, but it doesn't affect the coffee taste whatsoever.
