review/summary: great for casual coffee drinkersreview/text: I had wanted a Keurig for a long time, but couldn't rationalize spending so much on a brewer that requires special cups to work. It sounded like once you bought one part of it, you'd be opening a floodgate for k-cups that start at over $1 for each use.I happen to be the type to only drink one cup of coffee, and then switch to tea later on- again, the perfect reason to purchase a keurig because it brews coffee, tea, iced coffee/tea... etc (everything I could need and more). But it wasn't until I saw it sold at a.a.f.e.s. and n.e.x. for $90, that I decided to buy it.My recommendation to anyone in the market for this convenient yet frivolous coffee maker is to check every store- even military ones... because not even Amazon has the best deal on this model. Also I read where there were only 1-2 cup sizes... now there are three! And if buying expensive artisan k-cups is putting you off (like it did me initially)... they sell reusable k-cups that you can fill with your normal/everyday coffee.
