review/summary: So far, so goodreview/text: I bought this for my wife who is a coffee drinker. Let me say that I am NOT a coffee drinker....mainly because I am lazy and don't want to fill up a filter with coffee, blah blah blah. This Keurig has made me a coffee drinker! It is easy and with a cup in about 15-20 seconds it is just too easy. It might be a little more expensive than regular coffee, etc...but it is cheaper than Starbucks, faster, and tons of different flavors. We leave it on all the time so the water is ready to go no matter when we want a cup of coffee, hot chocolate, apple cider, latte, whatever.We have not had any issues yet but if we do I will be sure to edit this review to reflect the issues.
