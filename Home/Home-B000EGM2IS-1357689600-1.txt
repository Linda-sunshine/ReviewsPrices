review/summary: Useful and nice lookingreview/text: This unit heats up water very quickly.Two downsides to consider:1- Takes about 20 secs to empty the water heater. Previous models allowed a faster emptying.2- The button to empty the water heater is plastic and WILL fail (failed on a previous model). Be ready for a repair after about 1 year of use. Do not pay more than 20 dollars for a thing like this.However, this is awesome and much faster than a kettle.
