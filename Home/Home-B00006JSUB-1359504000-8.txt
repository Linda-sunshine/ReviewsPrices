review/summary: Nice pan, easy to use, worth the $review/text: For me, it's hard to provide all that detailed of a review. I've only used it once and it performed very nicely.A big T-bone went on the stovetop, then in the oven. No issues at all, cooking was perfect.The handle is a bit small and makes it tough to hold. It is heavy.
