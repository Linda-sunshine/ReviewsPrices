review/summary: The filter works!review/text: There's a noticeable difference in the taste of water with and without the filter. While I find commercially available Spring/Distilled Water to be marginally better, this water filter makes sense in the long run.The only downside I can think of is the absence of a latch of sorts to keep the lid from falling off when pouring water - it frequently falls off as a result. Over time though I've learnt to hold the lid with one finger so it doesn't fall off. Still, it may have been a good design decision to have a latch.
