review/summary: RAW PET FOOD reviewreview/text: I purchased this item to use in making raw cat food with bones. As some reviews on Amazon mentioned it worked well with bones, I believed it would.It really doesn't.I used the grinder several times to grind up chicken thigh meat, liver, hearts, skin, and bones.The grinder had little problem with the meat, liver, and hearts, but could barely process the skin and bones. I tried everything. Smashing the bones with a meat mallet as much as possible allowed most of the bones to go through eventually, but it required constant re-positioning of the bone fragments to go through. It jammed up regularly. In addition, the bones seemed to get jammed into the poorly-designed and weak plastic crevices.In the end I had no choice but to throw the thing away. The bones had simply lodged themselves in the outer part, making it impossible to remove it for cleaning.As I know that grinding bones is not exactly the specification of this product, I won't give it the 1 star it would deserve if it was. This review is simply a warning to those who wish to use this for pet food, as it simply is not up to the job.
