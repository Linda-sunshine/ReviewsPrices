review/summary: Newbie Juicer and Loving Itreview/text: Sooooooooo much better than my naked/odwalla/Arden's Garden green drinks. I've been buying green drinks for over a month from the various vendors, but my homemade green drink beats theirs hands-down! Juicer came a day earlier than indicated and I'm so happy it did. Set up is super easy and any complaints about cleanup must be from those who don't wash dishes on any kind of regular basis.Yes, it's only been two days, but I'm excited every time I think of my next juice!
