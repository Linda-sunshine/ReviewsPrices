review/summary: Great for the pricereview/text: We had the self propelled version before this one. I decided to get a less expensive model after the old one broke after 7 years of use. This model is light weight and sucks just as well as our expensive model did. It is so light weight I don't even miss the self propelled version. I like the bags to keep dust down when emptying it. It has a few minuses, like the tools fall off, but I just keep them in the closet and get them when I need them.
