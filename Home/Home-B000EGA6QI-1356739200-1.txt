review/summary: Powerful blenderreview/text: I was concerned if this product would be powerful enough, turns out is exceeded my expectations, and the price was totally affordable. This has all the power I need to blend and puree soups and make smoothies, I haven't yet explored if it can mash potatoes but I don't see why not. Love this, it is easy to use, easy to clean, and powerful.
