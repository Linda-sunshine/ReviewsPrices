review/summary: Not Made Like They Used Toreview/text: I can't tell you how disappointed I am with this KitchenAid mixer. They used to be considered top of the line but I don't believe they're made for the long haul. I bought mine knowing it would be handed down to my kids but now it sits collecting dust while I figure out if it's worth repairing. I was able to get a few good years out of it but then the motor began straining under the pressure of a double batch of cookie dough and there is a definite burning smell emitting from the top. The lift no longer glides up and down but drops with a thump and the paddle seems to be hitting the bowl in one area. I have tried adjusting the screw to no avail. The finish held up remarkably well so that's a plus but the mass manufacturing of KA will be their downfall. I can not recommend KA Pro mixers if you want a quality product for years to come. It has been a huge failure!
