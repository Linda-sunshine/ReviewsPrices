review/summary: Great for beginnersreview/text: I expend a lot of effort into making nutritious food for my family, but in the process I forget to give time to my own health and nutrition. One evening last week I realized I had gone an entire day without any fruit or vegetable intake (sadly, fries and ketchup don't count). I decided to take some practical steps and the 200XL seemed appropriate. I wasn't sure if juicing would be something I would take up long term and if a time consuming clean up would deter me.. After using the Breville for 2 days now, I believe I am hooked. I have had more fruit and veggies than I can usually consume during the work week. My husband has caught the juicing bug too (unfortunately, not badly enough to want to make the juice himself, but its a start). Cleanup wise it requires some work, taking apart, clearing out the pulp, soaking and scrubbing the basket, washing the parts which I do by hand. But it juices a carrot, an apple, an orange in seconds. I save the pulp and have used it in a banana quick bread and tomato pasta sauce.I did read the comments on cleaning the basket being a hassle. It is. I soak it in soapy water for a few minutes then hold it under running hot water while scrubbing with the brush in circular motion. I've only juiced once a day since I got the Breville but I intend to increase the frequency and then I can see how it might become a hassle. But I'm doing this for my health and I have the time to do it.Overall the Breville is great and I look forward to better health and energy.
