review/summary: good for rolling out doughreview/text: I don't use this for baking, but it's really good to working dough on the counter. I did slice a cut in it with cookie cutter, but that was poor judgement on my part. Since the cut is at the edge, I just avoid placing food on that portion and use it anyway. I have ordered a second one and will be more careful in the future.
