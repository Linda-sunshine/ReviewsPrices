review/summary: LOVE IT!review/text: Just used it for the first time and it was so easy! Made our own ground chicken breast and it worked beautifully. Easy to turn, great suction on the countertop, and super easy to clean! What more could you ask for?Looking forward to grinding all our own meat and knowing exactly what goes into it. Might also save a little money, the chicken breast was .99 lb., including skin and bones, but still much cheaper than ground chicken breast ($3-3.50 ish lb.) even after trimming.Great gadget, wished I would have bought it sooner.
