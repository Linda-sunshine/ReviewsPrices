review/summary: Inconsistent Readingsreview/text: I had a similar Taylor scale for several years and was very happy with it. I replaced it because it wouldn't work even after trying a new battery but it had what I considered a reliable and useful life up until then. I bought this Taylor scale in September and it has been very sporadic with its readings. I always take two readings to double check my weight. Sometimes I can stand on this scale three times and get three different readings. Some days the same reading will show twice as it should. This time I got a lemon.
