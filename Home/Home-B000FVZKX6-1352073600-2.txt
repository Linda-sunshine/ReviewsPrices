review/summary: Very warmreview/text: This is my first set of flannel sheets. I'm very pleased with their warmth and the way they tend to "stick" to other blankets (there's really nothing sticky about them, it just seems that if I make the bed they don't get bunched like lighter cotton sheets do). The cream color is a few shades darker than pictured, thus the 4 stars.
