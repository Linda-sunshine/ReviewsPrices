review/summary: This is just perfect!review/text: Works great for home use. It's not heavy which is a plus. I had to add more water to cover a larger area, but that is easier than pushing a heavier machine. It cleaned a very dark entrance area to perfection. Cleaning and drying the machine takes some time, but not much. It's easy to do. Price was perfect, specially when compared to heavy duty machines. Delivery perfect too.
