review/summary: Don't hesitate to purchase!review/text: I bought this space heater 2 years ago. I keep my thermostat set low to keep heating costs down, and this heater is exactly what I needed. I have a small "tv room" that I spend most of my time in, and it heats this room up beautifully. I also take it into the bathroom in the morning to heat up the room before I get in the shower. Again, it does the job! It is completely silent and has 2 heat settings. I am thinking about getting a second one so I don't have to move it from one room to another. If you are looking for inexpensive heat for a small space, you can't go wrong with this heater.
