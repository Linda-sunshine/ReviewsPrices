review/summary: A year of great coffee and countingreview/text: This is my second espresso maker. The first cheaper one didn't work for long but I've had this one a year and its still going strong. I don't use the steamer for milk because its inconvenient to keep clean and if I'm impatient and try to steam before its heated up I get a stream of hot water. I never let it heat up the full 15 min or whatever the recommendation says but my espresso is always plenty hot. I do be sure to perform the recommended monthly cleaning. This is definitely a good product for those of us who can't afford a fancy one.
