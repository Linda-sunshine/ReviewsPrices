review/summary: Piece of Junk wine bottle openerreview/text: I received it as a Christmas gift and have had it for about 6 weeks and opened exactly 2 out of 20+ bottles correctly. Most of the time it stops before the screw gets all the way into the cork. sometimes it breaks the cork. I have had to revert to the hand type openers most of the time. I keep it in the charger so that cannot be the problem.Oster FPSTBW8207-S Electric Wine Bottle Opener, SilverWhat a hassle. It is now back in the box under the bar sink until I can figure out how to return it.
