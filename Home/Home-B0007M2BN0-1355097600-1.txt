review/summary: So Easy!review/text: Ok, I know hard boiled eggs are so easy to make, but I fell for the draw to buy this microwave egg boiler anyway. I'm so glad I did since it's so much easier to cook a few eggs for my salad or for a quick meal using this tool. It goes faster and I don't have to be watching it to make sure it doesn't boil over or cook too long. The first time I used it, I had to experiment to see how long my particular microwave needed to cook the eggs the way we like them. It takes exactly 8 minutes from cold and then I leave it sitting for two minutes and then finish cooling them under cool water from the tap. Easy!
