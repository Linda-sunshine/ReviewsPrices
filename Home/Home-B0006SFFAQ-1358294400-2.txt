review/summary: Brews tasty coffee, but more importantly keeps coffee hot for 4 hours or more.review/text: This is our third of the same unit. We bought our first unit because we wanted a unit that kept coffee hot for 4 hours, and this was the only one we found that was reasonable priced and also brewed good coffee. One feature I like is that you can extend the warming time by another interval by turning the unit off for a few seconds, and then back on. Our first unit lasted over three years, and then the keypad would not work correctly. Our last unit lasted only 9 months before something burned out and it would no longer heat the water for coffee.
