review/summary: SHARPreview/text: This knife isn't balanced very well and the handle seems pretty cheap. But it is SHARP and does the paper test flawlessly. Time will tell it's build quality and how long it will keep this razor edge. I would call it a fantastic starter knife if you don't want to spend the money on a fancy German or Japanese knife.
