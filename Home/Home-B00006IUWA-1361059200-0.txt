review/summary: Great Popcorn Popperreview/text: I have always used my microwave to pop my pop corn... Now I am no longer able to use that microwave and not able to purchase a new one at this time.II love popcorn and missed making it.. So I checked out popcorn poppers and the reviews that went with them. I decided on this one...I arrived on Friday February 15, 2013. I made popcorn that night... It was great.. just leaving two kernels unpopped. The popping was super fast just like they said...Tonight I used a different brand of popcorn and that was even better. It popped every single kernel.I am very happy with this popper...I wish that I would have bought one years ago.
