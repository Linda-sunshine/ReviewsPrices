review/summary: Lids Were Very Poor Qualityreview/text: I purchased this Pyrex set thinking they would be similar to an older set of Pyrex I own, and I was wrong. While the glass parts were the same, the lids are much thinner and half of the lids came deformed. I was able to snap the rectangular lids on just fine, but have yet to actually be able to use any of the circular lids.In the future I will purchase any Pyrex physically so I can make sure the lids aren't unusably bad.
