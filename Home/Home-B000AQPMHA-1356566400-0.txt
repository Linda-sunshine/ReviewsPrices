review/summary: Great Coffee!review/text: I love the product. I purchased one two years ago and wanted to get one for my Dad. He absolutely loves it. It is simple to use and easy to clean. Also purchased the filter so that he can save money using his own coffee grounds or purchase the Keurig ready to use single serving packs. He loves Starbuck coffee and that is now available to purchase for this coffee maker. Not all the machines are able to use the special filter, but I researched the products on-line and discovered that this one did. It's a great machine.
