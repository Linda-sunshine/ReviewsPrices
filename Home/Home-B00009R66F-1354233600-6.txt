review/summary: It's a pretty great home-use carpet cleaner...review/text: So, your dogs run in, muddy feet.Your kids come chasing them, shoes are disgustingly filthy.OMG, you just tripped and spilled your coffee all over your carpet.Not your house? Well, it is mine. Perhaps a few modifications here and there. Mostly, I cannot stand dirty carpets.And it gets so very expensive to have a professional come in every week or so...This thing really does an awesome job...it's so easy to use... and, I can use it to clean the grout on my kitchen tile - Holy Grout, Batman! Yes!!!Why did I give it 4, not 5 stars? Well, I wish the electrical cord were longer. That's superficial. But additionally, the little plastic piece that holds the machine upright, and I do mean little plastic piece, snapped off almost immediately. It's a pretty heavy machine to have such a tiny little thing holding it upright. It does not affect it's use or my ability to have clean carpets. I tjust means when I store it, I have to prop it against the wall. I probably could have called Hoover and complained, but I didn't.
