review/summary: Good enoughreview/text: Comparing the price for what you get I found it fair. At first it's too hard if you have it in it's cover so I used it without the cover for the first 1-2 months. Then I put it in the cover and so far feels good. As the time passes is getting softer and I don't know how it's gonna be after one year or more, since I have it for only 3-4 months.
