review/summary: LOVE THIS JUICER! A happy skepticreview/text: LOVE this juicer! This is my first juicer so I checked out a bunch of reviews before settling on this one and I couldn't be happier. Since I bought it about two months ago I have used it at least once nearly every day and it still works great. It's super easy to use and clean especially for the price (which I thought was perfect as a first time investor who was unsure how much I would end up actually using it but didn't want to get a one too cheap in case I did end up using a lot :P) Anyway, don't heed the bad reviews, I have found them all to be untrue.
