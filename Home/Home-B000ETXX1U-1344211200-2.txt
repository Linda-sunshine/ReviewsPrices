review/summary: Worst Sleep Everreview/text: Sorry to say.... This mattress was very painful to sleep on. You and your partner tend to roll to the middle so you have to over inflate to prevent that. The outcome is a way too hard bed that causes aches and pains all night long. I am considering returning the mattress, if that is possible.
