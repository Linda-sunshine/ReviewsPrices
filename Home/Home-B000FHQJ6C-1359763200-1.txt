review/summary: LOVE IT!review/text: I looked at many brands and models and decided to go with this one from the customer reviews. It's fantastic! It's easy to clean and we are making juice on averge twice a day. I use to have an old Champion Juicer which I really missed - and with the Champion,you can make nut butter and frozen banana &#34;ice cream&#34;. But I purchased this one for $59 and it does a great job - it's well worth the money.
