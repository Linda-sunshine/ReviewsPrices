review/summary: Can't Believe I Didn't Buy 30 Years Ago!review/text: I use this mixer to mix thick cookie dough. I mix the dough on number 3 speed and the mixer barely bogs down-mixes the thickest doughs with NO PROBLEM. I am kicking myself for not buying this mixer 30 years ago instead of burning up two Sunbeam stand mixers within 5 years. Love, Love, Love it. It is heavy duty and quality-made.
