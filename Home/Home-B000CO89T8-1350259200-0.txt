review/summary: Underwhelmed and lukewarmreview/text: I'm underwhelmed by this mug warmer, but perhaps that's the best we can hope for.Pros:Switch is in the base, not four feet away in the far reaches of the middle of cord.Light tells you it's on, when not blocked by the mug.It has not yet burned house down when I forget to turn it off.It still works after I forgot to turn it off.Cons:It does not turn self off -- wasting electricity.Short cord barely reaches existing electrical source at a desk with a multi-plug power strip.Lukewarm is it.Has lasted two months.
