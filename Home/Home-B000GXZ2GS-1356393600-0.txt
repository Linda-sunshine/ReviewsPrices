review/summary: Nice, but just nice (not excellent)review/text: I think this product is over rated and over priced, although the coffee it made taste decent, but the material it used really does not worth $26.Compared to normal French press or Espresso machine, the coffee it produced is &#34;flat&#34;, I think it has a lot to do with the paper filter it used. I think at the price they charged for this product it should at least include a permanent filter (stainless plate with arrays of finely drilled holes).With the combo as it is right now, I think it is only OK, definitely not a great bargain.
