review/summary: What's not to love?review/text: This Cuisinart is a pretty yellow, so I keep it on the counter, making it handy for me to use. It does the job neatly in de-lumping gravies, & I've used it also to puree a portion of my 13 bean soup in order to thicken it. That works beautifully, too. I'm sure to become more creative as time goes by.
