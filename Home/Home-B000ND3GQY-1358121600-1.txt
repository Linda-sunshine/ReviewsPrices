review/summary: first qualityreview/text: I purchased this pan for my wife who is a professional cook. It was a great price with all the specs she had asked for. After it arrived I was pleasantly surprised at the weight of the stainless and the size of the pan itself. The glass cover with surrounding stainless was equally well made. This has now becomew my wifes favorite pan, Her favorite part were the well made handles that were cool to the touch in operation. A great item at a geat price.
