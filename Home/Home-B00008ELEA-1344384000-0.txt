review/summary: Disappointment about Faberware Productsreview/text: Hello,I am writing to you about a Farberware product # FCP240 2-4 Cup percolator I purchase July of 2011, that is not working any more.I would also like to let you know that I have a 2-8 cup perc. Model # 138-TZ serial # 1513998, and have a 2-12 electric coffemaker Model V-R 142B . these coffee pots I received as a Wedding present in 1961 Yes 50 years ago , I use them constanly and they are both working well.The only difference the two I received as a wedding present were made in the USA. And the one I purchased last year waas made in China.I think this country needs to bring back products that are made in the Usa.ThankyouPatricia Cullitypo Box 663Pembroke, Ma 02359
