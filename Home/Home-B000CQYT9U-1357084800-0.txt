review/summary: My personal ratingreview/text: Our niece finally called to tell me she dearly loves the figurine,"Quietly". She has two adult sons and this brought back so many precious memories. I have the manger scene and I keep it up the year round on my mantle. An exquisite work of art!!!Susan Lordi is the best!Lucille E. Giles
