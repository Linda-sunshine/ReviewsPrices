review/summary: Glassware Measuring Cup - No Complaintsreview/text: I ordered this Pyrex glassware measuring cup because I prefer glass over plastic which is the measuring cup I currently have. I have not used the Pyrex measuring cup for long so I am not sure about the durability. The lines on the measuring cup is easy to read and convenient because you can easily measure liquids in different units without having to convert. The measuring cup also pours liquids very well with no mess. I did not notice any discomfort with the handle. Overall the measuring cup is great and no complaints so far. Will definitely buy another one if need be.
