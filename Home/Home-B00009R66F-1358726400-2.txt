review/summary: Gets the job done with ease.review/text: We recently moved into a six-year old home that, obviously, had not been cleaned thoroughly in a long time. Bought the SteamVac to replace our daughter's old one that we ran to death. The F5914-900 operates very easily, is easy to push and pull, (we're in our seventies) and, in general, did a great job cleaning the carpets in three bedrooms. The collection tank looked absolutely nasty when I pulled it off to be emptied and cleaned. Makes you wonder why people even have carpet if they're not going to care for it.We are extremely pleased with the machine as is our daughter, who tried it the instant it hit her house. Had a little problem putting it together but worked it out eventually. Our carpets certainly look better and smell better.
