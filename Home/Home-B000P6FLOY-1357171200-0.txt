review/summary: Good for Turkeyreview/text: I needed an over thermometer for the turkey this year and forgot until the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. Amazon Prime to the rescue! The thermometer has all the normal functions, works as a timer as well, and most importantly for a well cooked bird, it has a temperature alert so you can set it to go off when the probe gets to the right temperature to prevent overcooking.
