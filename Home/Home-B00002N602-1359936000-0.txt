review/summary: Presto Stainless Steel Pressure Cookerreview/text: This was purchased as a gift for my daughter. I have owned a Presto pressure cooker for years, but mine is aluminum, but I purchased this one for her, because she really likes stainless steel cookware. Hopefully she will enjoy hers as much as I do mine after many years of use. It makes the best beef stew ever.
