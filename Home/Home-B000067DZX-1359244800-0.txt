review/summary: Good deal on these, all things consideredreview/text: The PUR 2-stage water pitcher filters used to last for MUCH longer (like 5 or 6 times longer) but they've made some change such that now the water flow begins to slow down fairly quickly with a new filter, and will soon thereafter simply stop flowing. They've found a way to force the consumer to buy new filters by creating some sort of blockage within the filters. If not for deals like this, I would've chosen to go with another brand and type of water filtering, because I feel like what PUR has done is a ripoff for the consumer and I prefer to not give my money to companies like that. At $6+/filter, I still think that's too much for a month or two, so will probably be switching to another brand soon.
