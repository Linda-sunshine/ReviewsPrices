review/summary: baked bread is excellentreview/text: My first bread machine, 1989, was a Panasonic. I Ioved it! Since then I have &#34;worn out&#34; two other (not Panasonic) machines. I was unable to find another Panasonic in stores and went on-line to find a seller. There is one problem which I can't fix - It squeaks when it is kneading the bread. This squeaking noise continues the entire time it is kneading. My daughter has the same machine and her's does not make the squeaking noise. The finished product is excellent so I will continue to use the machine.
