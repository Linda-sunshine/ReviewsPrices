review/summary: Great canner. Very impressed with quality, best canner especially for the price.review/text: We have used this canner a few times now. This pressure canner holds plenty of jars. If you do the pint size, you can fit two layers of jars at once. This canner can not be beat for the price. Easy to figure out how to use. You must read the instruction manual to be able to use it the right way. We have canned chicken/beef/chili and potatoes in the last few weeks. Every jar sealed perfectly! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to start canning/or needs a new one. You cannot go wrong for the price.
