review/summary: Norpro Meat Grinder, Mincer and Pasta Makerreview/text: After my old cast iron meat grinder was lost after lending it out, I decided on buying the Norpro Meat Grinder. I use it mainly for grinding liver for liver dumplings. It does a woderful job, is very easy to clean, and I am very happy about it.
