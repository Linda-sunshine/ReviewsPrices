review/summary: My New Black & Decker Brew 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker w/Travel Mugreview/text: I am one week into using this product and find that it works quite well. I purchased it because I am the only person in my household who depends on a morning cup of coffee. I find that I get a more consistant cup using this product, as compared to using my 12-cup brew system.Additionally, this product is fast, compact, amd easy to transport.
