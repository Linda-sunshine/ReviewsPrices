review/summary: good quality and great taste!review/text: water tastes great! the dispenser is solid too. build quality is excellent.My only issue is that when gaining access to it (opening the fridge door) the fridge will have to spend more energy (and emit more noise) to cool up again. something i did not really think of till i started using it.would still recommend it!
