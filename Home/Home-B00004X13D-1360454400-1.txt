review/summary: Works as a great giftreview/text: (+) Durable, cooks evenly, does not spill over (small risk of overfilling because of the very deep pockets), nonstick surface even if you do not spray it with oil. Very sturdy, somewhat heavy for its size and larger than expected (I'm comparing to the Cuisinart waffle maker) but can still store easily standing up(-) I wish it had an indicator to tell you when the waffles were done. Not that big of an issue though as it has a low risk of burning your waffles.
