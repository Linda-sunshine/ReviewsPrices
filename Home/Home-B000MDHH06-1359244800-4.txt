review/summary: super wasteful idea, juicing is another fad/scamreview/text: There is no magic pill people, you just need to eat healthy and exercise. It's a liquid vitamin that your body cannot properly process. The end result is that your remaining expensive organic fruit and/or vegetable matter get's wasted. Your colon needs the fiber that you are throwing away. You don't need this product, just your mouth and teeth if you still have some.
