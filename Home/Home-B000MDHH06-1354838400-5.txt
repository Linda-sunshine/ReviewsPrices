review/summary: amazedreview/text: i saw the documentary fat sick and nearly dead and NEEDED to buy a juicer. i was hesitant because I didn't want to fork out more money than I could afford for a juicer, but upon reviewing juicers I came across this one. amazon sent me an email about top juicers and this was ranked 7 out of 100. i was pleased because it was a decent price and it juiced a lot. i've juiced leafy greens such as kale and spinach and i was surprised with how dry the pulp was. i've recommended it to many and i hope this helps with your decisions.
