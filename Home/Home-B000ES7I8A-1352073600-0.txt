review/summary: Picky Parents Approvereview/text: My husband and I researched every kettle type available. We wanted a thank-you gift for my parents. We chose this one for three good reasons: 1. Stainless steel; 2. NO water indicator (water eventually leaks through); 3. cool to the touch. My parents are extremely happy with it. Even my 86 year old grandma enjoys using it. Definitely recommend this kettle!
