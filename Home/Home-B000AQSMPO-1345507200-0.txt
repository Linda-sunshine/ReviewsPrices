review/summary: Easy to use!!review/text: Love this machine! Holds plenty of water and can make a cup of coffee anytime I want. We are a family of 5 and having this allow us to all brew our own favorite blend. Easy to use and no longer tossing out coffee no one drank from the old coffee pot.Understand that this created more waste... and I hope future k-cups (pre-made i.e. Starbucks, Green Mountain) will solve this.All that said, its easy, no pot to wash and plenty of blends to buy everywhere :-)
