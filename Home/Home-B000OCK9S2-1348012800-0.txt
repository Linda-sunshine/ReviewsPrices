review/summary: Interesting product - Poorly engineeredreview/text: Although inexpensive and interesting, I cannot recommend this product for a number of reasons. I bought it primarily for its nature sounds to help mask my tinnitus when I go to sleep. While the sounds are OK, the sound loops are not very long and are therefore annoyingly repetitive. The quality of the sounds vary. The worst are the heartbeat and the thunderstorm. Why a company would include a heartbeat as a background sound is a mystery to me. The thunderstorm is unrealistic probably due to its lack of sufficient bass. Also, the waterfall sound is too loud and the summer night sound sounds just like my tinnitus!The forward-most button on top dims the clock display just a little and behind it is the power button for the radio and the sounds. I think the buttons should have been reversed, but maybe that's just my take on things.My biggest issue is with the clock display --- perhaps the worst I've ever seen on any product! The numbers are black on a blue background. Unfortunately, the blue background is too dark and too bright to provide contrast with the numbers and therefore they are hard to see. Also, like some flat screen TV's, the viewing angle for the clock's display is limited, especially in the vertical plane. Finally, the blue background is much too bright even when dimmed. While it's not bright enough to read a book with it, it does light up the room too much and interferes with falling asleep. It even bothers my cat! The only solution is to face the entire device 180 degrees away from you, but not against a reflective wall. Unfortunately, you cannot tell the time when you do that.
