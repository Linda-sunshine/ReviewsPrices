review/summary: Great Little Coffee Maker!review/text: I've been using this item for a few months and I'm really pleased. It sits on my desk at work and I brew directly into a regular coffee mug since I don't like drinking from travel mugs if I'm not on the go. This is a nice feature because some machines require contact between (what serves as) the carafe and cone to work properly. The coffee brews surprisingly hot, tasty, and strong. I also use the machine to make hot water for tea. I use paper filters for brewing coffee (I cut #2s to fit since I have a surplus of them). I'm very happy with it!My one complaint - the plastic cone used to hold the filter retains coffee odors more than any other machine I've used. It requires a thorough scrubbing daily to not impart an old coffee taste onto what I'm brewing. I hope maybe this will go away with time as the machine becomes &#34;seasoned&#34;.
