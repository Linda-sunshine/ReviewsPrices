review/summary: Fabulous flannel sheets!review/text: The best part of winter is snuggling up at night in cozy flannel sheets, but I've bought a lot of them over the years only to find all of that soft flannel in the lint trap of the dryer, and soon the sheets are pilled and rough. THESE sheets are so amazing that I bought two more sets after the first and got rid of all the other flannels sheets in the house.They are wonderfully soft and wash up beautifully, and are a very ample size for our high, pillowtop mattresses. Love them!
