review/summary: PUR Dispenserreview/text: I just recently bought this dispenser with pitcher, approximately a month ago, and I couldn't be more pleased. I recently moved into an apartment. I am very health conscious so I wanted filtered water. I only use bottled water when I need it for convenience. I read the reviews on the various filtered products and this seemed like it would fit my needs perfectly. I keep a pitcher of water next to this dispenser. When the pitcher starts getting low I fill it with water from the dispenser and then refill the dispenser so I always have cold water. I have had no problems with the filters, as some of the other reviewers have had. The water taste perfect; no taste of impurities at all. I very highly recommend this product.
