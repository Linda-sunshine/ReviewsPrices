review/summary: I received a knock offreview/text: The product I was sent was not a real Bialetti even though it came in a Bialetti box. Around the third time that I used it the espresso maker stopped working properly. Only about one cup of very strong disgusting metal tasting coffee came out and the remainder would not come out. I have a one cup Bialetti that I purchased in Italy and the one I got from Amazon does not even compare. The Bialetti from Italy is made of good quality metal and makes great tasting espresso. The Bialetti from Amazon has to be a complete knock off. I returned it as defective.
