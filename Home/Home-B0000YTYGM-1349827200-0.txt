review/summary: Critical flaw - WARNING to those with staggered wakersreview/text: We purchased the Cuisinart 12 cup coffee maker so that my cup of Joe would be ready when I wake up at 4:00am and the thermos would keep the remainder hot for my wife when she gets up at 6:00. The problem is that when my coffee is brewed the Cuisinart lets the entire household know with a VERY loud and sustained beeping. It wakes up my wife and two kids. There is no option to turn off the alarm, which gives me no option but to go back to the French press. It's hard to believe I'm the only one in the world in this situation.
