review/summary: Bangin'review/text: This juicer is pretty tyte. Only problem we've had is with small leafy greens (ie. parsley, cilantro.) If you sandwich them between some celery stalks they get juiced a little better, but I would suggest getting a masticating juicer if you think you will use a lot of parsley/cilantro.Otherwise this juicer rules!!!!
