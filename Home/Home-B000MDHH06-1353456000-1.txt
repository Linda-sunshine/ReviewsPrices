review/summary: Great juicer, very easy to clean.review/text: I wanted to wait and write a review for this product after I had owned it for awhile. This juicer is very easy to use and clean. It has good extraction for a centrifugal juicer. I typically juice about one gallon every day (for a family of seven) and have had no problems or complaints. I have found it to juice kale and other leafy greens quite well when juiced with oranges or other soft fruits. Great value for the price and as I mentioned before, super easy to clean.
