review/summary: The Bestreview/text: I can't boil eggs correctly. It takes too much time, too much effort, I hate having to watch them to make sure they don't boil, etc, etc.And when it's all said and done, they still don't turn out right.This cooker is great! Just put the water in the bottom up to the line, Put up to four eggs in the middle section, and then snap on the lid (mine doesn't always snap so I turn it until it does).Set the microwave for the proper time (I like hard boiled for salads and egg salad sandwiches) so I set the microwave for nine (9) minutes on high and walk away. (Sometimes I set a kitchen timer for eleven (11) minutes, that includes the two additional minutes that they are supposed to stand in the microwave.) I can even leave them longer if I get hung up.To finish up, just remove the entire container from the microwave using hot mitts (this thing is REALLY HOT), and set it in the sink. The top has a hole in it, so then I run cold water in the top for a minute or two. Then pull off the top and let cold water run over the eggs.It's just that easy. No watching, no wondering...Now I can have hard boiled eggs any time I like. It's super simple.
