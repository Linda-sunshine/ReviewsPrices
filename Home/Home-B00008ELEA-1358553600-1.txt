review/summary: Try a different brandreview/text: I have been using these coffee makers for many years and they use to have a reasonable lifespan. Then I bought one that completely stopped working after a year. I replaced it assuming it was a fluke. After almost exactly one year, that one stopped working. I will not buy another.
