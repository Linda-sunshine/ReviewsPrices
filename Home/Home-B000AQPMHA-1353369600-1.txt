review/summary: Excellent Coffee Maker - Just One Caveat w/ a Solutionreview/text: I am your usual cheap coffee drinker. I prefer good old fashioned Folgers to Starbucks, and I'm not going to pay $4 for a cup of coffee. I was at a friends house who had this machine and I found it to be interesting. In their case, they all had something different late in the evening. I found that to be pretty cool and useful. I am not a pot of coffee a day guy, but rather I may have a cup or two at the most. So, I bought the Keurig B40 Elite at a local store and have made numerous cups of coffee, hot chocolate, hot tea, etc.. I have been impressed by the brewing system, and it works perfectly in my opinion and for my use. Now, the only warning I would give is simply common sense...the K-Cups make each cup of coffee from .35 to .60 each. So, if you plan on drinking 10 cups a day, it will be more expensive than your old fashion coffee maker, but still cheaper than buying coffee at a store or cafe. However, I have also seen a filter where you can use your own coffee instead of the K-cups, so that problem can be resolved easily. Overall, I am very happy with the Keurig. Yes, it's pricey...but if you love coffee, tea, cafe style drinks, or having a hundred choices to choose from, you will love it!
