review/summary: Why would you spend more? Great quality.review/text: I really love Lodge products. I have a frying pan and a non-enameled Dutch oven and both get almost daily use. This one was a great addition to my kitchen. It's beautiful, with a deep red color (less bright than it appears here). The color has gotten darker on the bottom after a year of thrice-weekly use, which I think adds to the character of it. The inside does get discolored, as noted by other reviewers, but I don't mind that. It's a great workhorse that has lasted so far!
