review/summary: Best inexpensive thermometer - but not rated for high-heatreview/text: I bought this thermometer 2 years ago and it worked great for oven use, cooking Thanksgiving Turkeys, etc. I used it on the grill and after that, the temperature stopped reading. I bought a replacement thermometer, which worked until I used it on the grill (again!). I then spent a lot of time researching thermometers - and apparently the heat range rating matters ;) This thermometer will not work on the grill or other high-heat conditions. If you're looking for a serious thermometer, check out thermoworks.com. They have excellent (but expensive) models that can handle extreme heat, or have hypodermic needle-size prods.
