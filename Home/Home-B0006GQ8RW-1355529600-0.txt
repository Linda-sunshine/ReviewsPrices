review/summary: Water filtersreview/text: Glad I found these. Our city water is pretty bad so I have not been drinking it. I do not liek buying water at the store so I keep the Brita pitcher on my counter where it's handy and I can grab a glass as I pass by each time. These are so much better than buying water in plastic bottles.
