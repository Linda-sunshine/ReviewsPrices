review/summary: Works really good..review/text: This really works good for grinding up left over Turkey. So far it's all we have had the chance to use it on, but I'm sure it will do just as good for other things as well. Sticks really good to the table, and didn't move a bit when doing the grinding. I gave it four stars only because the handle is so close to the base that if your table has any rounded lip around it, it's hard to get a flat spot close enough to allow the handle to clear the table itself. I wasn't sure about a plastic grinder, but the right parts that need to be metal are, so will see how the rest of the plastic holds up over time.. Well worth the money, and does the job very well..
