review/summary: Great for a 1/2 gallon of milk!review/text: I buy milk in half-gallon bags, and this jug fits a half-gallon with a little bit of room to spare. It fits great on the door of the refrigerator, too! It is great that it is dishwasher safe, and the lid seals very well. I saw other reviews saying that the lid was worthless - I think it is great, if you put in on correctly. You have to hold the outer lip, and turn the inside handle clockwise to tighten. When you do this, it makes a great tight seal!
