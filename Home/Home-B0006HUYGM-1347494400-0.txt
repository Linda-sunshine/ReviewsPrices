review/summary: Great little vacuum, awesome price!review/text: I ordered this vacuum after getting a light tan rug and two light colored kittens, both of which shed like crazy all over my dark brown microfiber couches. If I want to keep my couches looking normal I have to vacuum everyday, which I don't mind at all with this vacuum! It picks up fuzzies and cat hair, is easy to maneuver on on my steps, and the hose does a great job in corners and along walls. My only complaint is that it is a little bit heavy, and makes my arm tired after a little while (I would maybe give it 4.5 stars for this, if I could). It's really not bad though, and I would buy it again in a heartbeat!
