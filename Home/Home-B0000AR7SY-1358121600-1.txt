review/summary: Never grinds fine enough for espressoreview/text: Leaves too much ground coffee in the housing(poor design). Never ground fine enough for espresso . Grind is uneven. No shut-off switch. Cannot grind Extra Fine despite the setting being present. If you r using espresso machine avoid this unit. It might be ok to use this grinder for drippers.
