review/summary: Great Product, Great Customer Servicereview/text: I gave up the iron almost a year ago and have not looked back since! I steam every work day for my dress pants, blouses, sweaters, and even the pleated skirts that would be impossible to iron with.I find the hose to be a bit unwieldy sometimes, but it's worth it. It is also small and compact.The best part is the customer service. My steamer hose broke about 10 months after I ordered the steamer and after checking amazon.com and other websites, I couldn't find the replacement part. I went to the company's website, chatted with them online, and within a minute of explaining what I needed, they offered to send the replacement hose--at no cost to me--no questions asked other than for my name and address.A week later, the hose arrived as they said it would. It has been a long time, since I've had such great customer service!!
