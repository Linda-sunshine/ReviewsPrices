review/summary: Under shelf organizerreview/text: I wan't sure about this product when I bought it, but when I love it. It fit easily and is wonderful. I plan to order more. However, it only holds about 4 products. I have 2 aluminium foils and 2 baggies in mine. I like it because it give me a place to put the foil and baggies, instead of piling them up in the cabinet. It also allows for more room.
