review/summary: Fine, but loud and doesn't get edges wellreview/text: This vacuum has a TON of power, but I don't feel like it works well in corners and on wood or bare floors. It's a little over a year later and I am already looking for an upgrade. I would like something quieter, and maybe a little sturdier. The hose with this is too short and I got the longer hose. Even with that, the vacuum falls over when I try to reach more than 4 feet from the vac. It's strong and not a terrible purchase for the price, but you definitely get what you pay for. I want a nice grown up vacuum now!
