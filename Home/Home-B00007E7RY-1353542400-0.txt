review/summary: Replacement pre-filters are wastefulreview/text: When you go to replace the pre-filter in this unit,(Honeywell HRF-APP1), You will have to cut to fit, which is not a big deal, but you will have over 1/3 of the material left over; not enough for another filter. You will have spent $15+ and end up throwing away $5. What a waste. If you replace the pre-filter three times a year, that really adds up. They really need to address this issue.
