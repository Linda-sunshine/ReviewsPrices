review/summary: Will not even consider a different brand!review/text: I was introduced to the Borner slicers about 12 years ago. My cousin had one she got at a fair from one of those booths and absolutely loved it. I was able to use it since we were making Thanksgiving dinner and I couldn't believe how well it worked. When I got back home I immediately ordered myself one. Fast forward to December 2012, my sister was in town for my annual girlfriend Christmas party and while getting the food and drinks ready I was using my slicer for a various items. She was fascinated and I showed her how fast it could slice up different things and the different sizes. I asked her if she would like one for Christmas and she immediately said &#34;YES I DO!&#34;. So this purchase was for her Christmas gift.The slicer stays sharp and makes even slices very quickly. There other inserts are great for making Julienne strips and comes with two different sizes, french fries are a breeze to make!I think every household should have one of these! The quality is excellent and the storage sleeve is wonderful for all the pieces.
