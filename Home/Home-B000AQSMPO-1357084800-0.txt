review/summary: Great! ---- while it still worksreview/text: We got our Keurig about13 months ago. We LOVED it! We talked four of our friends into buying it. Sadly, about 2 1/2 weeks ago, it stopped makinga full cup of coffee. Instead, it'd make about half of what it should have and send the rest of the water back into the reservoir. The machine has a one-year warranty; apparently that's all the time it is built to last for. After reading about others' experiences when calling Keurig, we opted to go back to our trusty automatic drip coffee maker. I do not recommend giving this company any of your hard-earned money.
