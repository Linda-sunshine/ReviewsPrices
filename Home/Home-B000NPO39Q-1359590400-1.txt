review/summary: Great but little unstable.review/text: This is wonderful and works well with the nativity set we have from same company. It surprised me how big it actually was once we got it in the home. Earned good points with wife since this was a Christmas present for her. Well made, looks great, only drawback is that the pieces fit together rather loosely. The shelter itself simply sits on a slotted section so a good bump can force i to fall. With four small kids, this happened more than once. Luckily nothing broke, but could have. Could glue it but then it would lose it's ability to be easily stored away off season. Perhaps next year I will use some Velcro to better secure it.
