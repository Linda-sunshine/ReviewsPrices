review/summary: Works as well or better than other one-cup coffee makers!review/text: I am the only person in my household who drinks coffee so a one-cup maker was a must. I came across this nifty little machine while browsing on Amazon and was amazed at the positive reviews. For the price, I figured why not give it a try and have been hooked on it now for over a year. It works like a charm and churns out coffee that is good and hot. I like my cup of joe to start out hot. I will say that I do not like the filter that comes with it as it leaves residue in the bottom of my cup, so I purchased #1 filters but really they are too small and coffee grounds can spill over the side. So I simply use #2 filters that are easy to find at the store. The filter will seem a little large but isn't, just nestle it in there and it works just fine. In fact, being a little larger than the cone, it will keep any grounds from spilling over. You can take scissors and trim the top of the filter a little if you want, but it really isn't necessary. I highly recommend this little jewel!
