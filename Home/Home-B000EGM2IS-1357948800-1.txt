review/summary: Excellent product for near-instant hot teareview/text: I bought this item for the office to make hot tea. It works exceptionally well. All you have to do it pour a cup of water inside, press the button, wait about 12 to 15 seconds, and release freshly boiled water back into the same cup. You must use small mugs with this appliance, however. Most travel mugs will not fit underneath.
