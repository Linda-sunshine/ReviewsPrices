review/summary: Don't buy from Hoover.comreview/text: This review is not for the Item but for the service by Hoover.com on purchase of this item.I bought the Hoover Steamvac F5914-900 recently from Hoover.com and they shipped me a broken piece. To return it they require me to pay the shipping. This is a terrible service on part of hoover.com shipping broken items to customers thinking someone would just use a broken piece instead of returning it back because of shipping charge.I would suggest everyone to keep away from Hoover.com and instead buy from Amazon which offers free returns.
