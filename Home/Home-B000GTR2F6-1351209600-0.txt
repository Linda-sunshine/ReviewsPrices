review/summary: Not reliable at allreview/text: I bought 3 KeurigsKeurig B70 Platinum Brewing SystemB70 Platinum for the offices - All 3 of them failed within 15 months - I used gallons of white vinegar to clean them up - I wasted hours trying to reset them - They would work for other 2 months... then back to needle and vinegar... - The last one felled to rage taking over - It didn't like being smashed to pieces...I would definitively recommend this product if you need to estimate the ultimate limit of your patience - Trust me you will find out!
