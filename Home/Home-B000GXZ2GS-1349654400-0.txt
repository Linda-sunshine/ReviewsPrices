review/summary: best coffee maker in the worldreview/text: I consider myself a coffee snob and have tried coffee from capsule makers (Nespresso, CBTL Caffitaly, Keurig), a fully automated Delonghi Magnifica espresso / cappuccino maker that grinds - brews beans, froths milks, and cleans itself up with one touch.Dollar for dollar, Aeropress makes the best tasting coffee - creamy with no hint of bitterness. Easy to use, clean, and transport, I have found myself relying on this handy device more and more.
