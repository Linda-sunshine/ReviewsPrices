review/summary: Excellent for Rice Cookreview/text: I just bought this rice cooker and I love it. It is so easy to cook rice. And I really love the taste, the rice tastes so soft. Also I use this to cook porridge nearly every evening. The only thing I am a little disappointed about this cooker is that it takes a long time to cook brown rice for about 2 hours. So if you want to have brown rice for lunch, you'd better cook it in the morning.
