review/summary: very comfortable to sleep inreview/text: Takes pressure off body when lying on it. At first when we opened it up, it seemed/looked like it was defective but the instructions said to let the foam re-expand for 24 hours, as it was compressed in a box for shipping. We did so and it did indeed expand and working fine. Would re-order again in the future. Good item for the price
