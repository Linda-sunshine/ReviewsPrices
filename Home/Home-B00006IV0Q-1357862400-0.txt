review/summary: Makes Delicious Coffeereview/text: I am so happy with my Presto Coffee Maker. As I write, I am enjoying my first cup of Folgers with this beautiful pot. It was not as large as I expected overall, and I made only 4 cups this morning, so I shall have to see if the 12 max on this unit does the job when we have company. The taste is rich and the coffee hot even for less expensive coffee. Time from start to finish (assembly and brewing time) was less than 13 minutes.Be sure the follow the directions in the manual step by step (they are easy to understand!). The included filters seem to have a lot of excess paper so I just stuffed it all in the basket as directed and hoped for the best. Well, there was not one coffee ground in my first cup, will have to see if that holds to the last drop. This is a great product if you want something fast and elegant on your kitchen counter. That was important to me.
