review/summary: Never using a sauce pot againreview/text: This thing works perfectly. It is a little slower than I thought it would be, but I am still very pleased. Others complain about a plastic taste. I do not think that is the case, but I also do not have a very keen taste perception. If you are peculiar, then buy a glass or stainless steel one. If you're like me and want a nice product for a decent price, this product is awesome.
