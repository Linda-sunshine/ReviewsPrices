review/summary: This is a beast of a juicerreview/text: After having watched a documentary by an Australian businessman and his struggles of being fat and sick; and the steps he took to turn his life around I too took on the challenge. I wanted to replicate as close as to the documentary as possible, so I purchased the Breville 800JE. WOW! This machine can blend really well, meaning it can provide more juice with very little fruit. I had made the mistake of buying a cheap one earlier; cheap meaning 100 dollars from a local department store. Boy was that a mistake; I noticed I was spending tons on fruits and vegetables because the cheap juicer was not actually extracting much of the juice. So I took the plunge by getting the Breville, and I firmly believe in the saying &#34; you get what you pay for&#34;, well, for this device at least. I have read in many articles which state that the pulp which is left after the juice is extracted should feel practically dry to the touch, otherwise you are wasting money by throwing away juice still left in the fruit or vegetable. I recommend this juicer to anyone who is seriously considering changing their life around and dropping some serious pounds or kg's, which ever system works for you :o)
