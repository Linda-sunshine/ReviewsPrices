review/summary: Works Well After Some Timereview/text: If I had NOT read the reviews, I would have sent this back. Very few directions came with this, or helpful hints. You definitely have to be careful that the HOSE is straight, and that you hang the garment on the correct hook. After a few tries, I really like the steamer. You have to be sure to empty the whole thing after you are done. I use diustilled water, and if I have some leftover in the plastic tank,I leave for the next time. If you do not empty the steaming unit, you will collect hard water deposits (even from distilled water!!) . Once I got the knack of using this, it saved me a half day of ironing, etc when taking my winter clothes (many sweaters) out of storage bins. It is worth the cost, stores well, and seems to be great for the $$$.
