review/summary: Good price and they fit wellreview/text: I have a thick mattress (about 14 inches) and have had trouble with bottom sheets that fit. These do and look and feel like the quality I expected from the thread count. My only complaint is the top sheet is shorter than I would like. I have about 2 inches that I can tuck into the bottom of the bed.
