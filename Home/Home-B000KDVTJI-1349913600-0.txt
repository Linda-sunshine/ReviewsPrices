review/summary: Works fine but has flawsreview/text: I've had this for 1.5 years. The kettle works fine. However, the filter tears easily when trying to be cleaned of hard water flakes and deposits. Now the inside black plastic is breaking up, we've seen black particles floating in the water. Nothing lasts forever.
