review/summary: Love, Love, Love it!!!review/text: I can't say enough good things about this water pitcher. The water tastes great and has a silkie quality. I don't know how water can be silkie, but that is the best way I can describle the quality of the water (isn't water just water?). I love drinking the water from this pitcher. I can't explain it, but my body just seems to crave it. I look forward to drinking the water from this pitcher. I can't say that about the bottled water I was buying before. I was so impressed with this product that I bought another. One I keep in the refrigerator for cold water to drink on hot days and the other I keep on the kitchen counter for water to use to make tea and for cooking. Highly recommended!
