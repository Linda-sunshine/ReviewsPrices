review/summary: Fantastic softness!review/text: Ordered these as a second set of winter warm sheets, as we have been having pretty cold weather lately, and it is nice to turn down the thermostat and snuggle under the sheets. These really fit the bill for soft, warm and cuddly for your bed. I don't think they will work for warmer weather, but I feel very lucky that I found these! They actually compare to Cuddledown flannel sheets and are actually a little softer and smoother against the skin. I am very glad that I made the choice to purchase these sheets after reading quite a few of the reviews on them. They are great and they fit the mattress well!
