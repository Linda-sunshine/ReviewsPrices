review/summary: Awesome little cleanerreview/text: Lots of power, the only problems are; the cord is way too short and very, very stiff. After using it about six times, the cord has softened a tiny bit, maybe it will be better with age. The cord won't go very far. Its a pain to keep plugging and unplugging in the same room. Otherwise, I would recommend this cleaner.
