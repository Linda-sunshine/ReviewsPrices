review/summary: Its cheap but well worth itreview/text: As always, relying on the general feedback on products here, its hard to go wrong. We have had this machine for over a week now and i guess we have already recovered 50% of what we paid for. At $3.25/cup * 14 = $45.5. Point is even if the machine lasts for six months I would have recovered my initial investment 10, times over. For the price it works great. Me and my wife enjoy a cup of capucinno every night after dinner and its great! The coffee ( KIVU brand, classic)we got from fremeyer cost me $3.6 and we have made 14 cups so far and i guess it will last us another 8-10 atleast.But its a great machine. Instead of spending a lot more on a pricey, even if i have to replace this one every year, its still good. I will update this review in a couple of months.
