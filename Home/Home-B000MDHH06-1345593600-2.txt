review/summary: Really wanted to give it more stars but...review/text: I really wanted to give this machine more than 3 stars, but unfortunately i cannot.Ok, here are the pros - the machine is extremely fast. I mean like REALLY fast. The parts are easy to disassemble and clean. It fits really well on my counter which is pretty small.Cons - because it's so fast, it's very difficult to juice berries and any small pieces of items without it spewing back at you. I also noticed that it leaves pieces of the core of fruit/veg in tact - that's not good; I would want it to juice the whole item. Additionally, it is extremely loud - I don't mind the noise, but if you have persons sleeping in the house or talking on the phone, it can be very annoying.
