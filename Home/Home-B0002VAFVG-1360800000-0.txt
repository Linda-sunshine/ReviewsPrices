review/summary: Durable and dependablereview/text: We've had this juicer for 16 months now, and it is like new. We purchased this Breville to replace another less expensive juicer that did not do as much and lasted about two years. While the Breville was three times the price, it will no doubt outlast more than three of the cheaper juicers and make better juice with more items and less headache. It's easy to keep clean and a great way to start the day or make a snack. I'm a huge fan; also the pulp can either be used in a bread recipe (if you make your own bread with vegetables) or compost it.
