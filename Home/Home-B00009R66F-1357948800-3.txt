review/summary: I think I made a good choicereview/text: I was looking at various brands and models trying to find the right one. I have 2 lil long haired chihuahuas and a houseful of kids ranging from 5 to 12 years old. The kids are constantly spilling stuff on the carpet. Although I had to go over twice I could see that it was really sucking up that dirt and grime that was embedded in the carpet. The carpet felt soft and fluffy again.
