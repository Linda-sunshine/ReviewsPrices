review/summary: Great Stainless Steel Bottlereview/text: If you do not want those cheap (even if they cost more) coffee travel cups that have the plastic liners, get this one. STainless steel inside and out except for the top sippy part which has a nice size sipping spout. Great product. Seals well. Great price considering what it's made out of, stainless steel.
