review/summary: Very durable, does the jobreview/text: Very nice, reliable grinder, nothing fancy. The only thing we don't like about this grinder is that there is no provision for wrapping or storing or holding the power cord, other than wrapping it around the body and doing a half-hitch (which often slips into a puddle). The unit is durable---we have another that we've had for over 10 years that still works, we use the older one as a backup or for grinding spices, nuts, oats. The grinder is quite powerful, grinds the coffee in a few seconds, and is not obnoxiously loud. Also, the price is nice. We bought a Hamilton Beach and it totally crapped out after only a few weeks.
