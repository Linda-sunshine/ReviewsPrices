review/summary: Very nicereview/text: I purchased this as a gift, and am considering purchasing one for myself. The feature I love is the ability to program this radio so the alarm will only sound for an emergency in your county. My current weather radio sounds for half the counties in my state, and it would be wonderful not to be awakened for watches and warnings that don't affect me.
