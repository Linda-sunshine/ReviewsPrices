review/summary: Excellent for Use with FoodSaver Sealerreview/text: The first Wide Mouth Jar Sealer we received was cracked, however Amazon had a new one out to us within 3 days of contacting them. Upon receiving the new item we could not initially get any jars to seal. After researching we discovered that may of the FoodSavers have 2 plastic T-Connectors in the bottom of the unit. We opened our unit and discovered that one of the plastic T-Connectors that tie the hoses together was broken. After a quick look it was determined that a 1/4" T-Connector for a drip irrigation system would do nicely to repair the unit. After a quick run out to Lowes I picked up a pack of 10 T-Connectors for less than $1.50. Popped one in the unit and it worked like a charm. So those of you out there having issues with the Jar Sealers not sealing correctly may want to open your sealer (Usually 8 Screws) to see if your unit suffers from the same symptom! Well worth the investment! We have since sealed 100+ jars with no failures. Hope this helps the rest of you having issues out there.
