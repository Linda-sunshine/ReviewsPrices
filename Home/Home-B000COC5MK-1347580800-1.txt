review/summary: Love this opener!review/text: My parents have used this for a while and bought me one for Christmas. At first I never thought I'd use it, but we love this thing!!It's a bit large, but easily "hidden" behind the coffee maker. We've opened A LOT of bottles with this and works flawlessly. It's a bit noisy but really not a big deal.I did see a few other reviews saying they couldn't get it to work but it's probably because they weren't doing it correctly - you just have to push the button in ONE direction until the cork is fully extracted, and you only push in the 'reverse' direction to extract the cork from the opener.
