review/summary: Handy!review/text: Easy to use, accurate. I like that the magnetized bottom sticks to the stove top so the display stays in place when you open the oven. Other reviewers noted a lack of an on/off button, but this has been addressed; my recently purchased unit has an on/ off switch on the bottom. I am very pleased with it.
