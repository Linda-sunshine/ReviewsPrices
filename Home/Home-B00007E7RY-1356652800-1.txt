review/summary: Love it!review/text: I was skeptical if a air purifier would work or not and I've been pleasantly surprised! I haven't had to dust as often, I can breathe a lot easier (I have asthma) and I've noticed a decrease in pet hair around my house. It's pretty quiet but does take up a bit of space, which doesn't really bother me.
