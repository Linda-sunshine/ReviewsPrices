review/summary: A must have kitchen itemreview/text: A cast iron skillet is a must have in any kitchen. Works great on the stove or in the oven. It's better than more expensive non stick skillets. I've had mine several years now and it is as good of shape as the day it arrived. True workhorse without any gimmicks.
