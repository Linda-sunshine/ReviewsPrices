review/summary: Best Flannel sheetsreview/text: I ordered these flannel sheets in 2010 in 2 colors for our California King bed. The sheets fit perfectly and don't pill like a pair I bought last winter. I'm back on to replace the ones I bought last year with Pinzon 190 gram. The 2 sets I bought in 2010 are still in perfect shape, we just changed colors in our bedroom.
