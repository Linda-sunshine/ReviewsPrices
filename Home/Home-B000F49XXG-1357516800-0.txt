review/summary: Do I need to know when to stop?review/text: I just got the product and made my first espresso. The overall quality was OK. Reading the reviews I realize I need to experiment with a few things in order to make good espresso.But one thing I am not clear about - Will it stop on its own after a "double shot" when I put the bigger basket, or am I supposed to hang around and manually turn it off? If I have to hang around, when do I know a double shot is ready? Will it work if I put just the amount of water needed for a double shot? Or will not having water while it is still "on" cause some problems?Thanks in advance for taking the time to answer my question.
