review/summary: Great through almost daily usereview/text: As far as I'm concerned, there is NO other name in food processors than Cuisinart, and the DLC-2011N 11-cup is one of their best. Got it from Amazon about 18 months ago, during a Fourth of July special, and the price was great. The large bowl is wonderful. The blade is close to the bottom of the bowl, allowing it to perfectly process without &#34;stuff&#34; getting stuck between the bottom of the blade and the bowl - a complaint I've had with every processor I've ever owned or considered owning. I also purchased the supplemental blades and disc holder, and they have come in really handy. We use this food processor almost every day and the blades are still sharp and all components are still 100%. Oh, and it's really quiet! Great product. Highly recommend.
