review/summary: poor design dont waste your moneyreview/text: i gave this a try but wasnt thinking clear..this is not what the pros use theirs isnt as restricted,this product would be better with the wheels fully exposed...dont bind your blade in the plastic or your knife is ruined quickly...i get a way sharper and more even egde useing a cheap carbide hand sharpener...ive been sharpening knives sense i was a kid and can shave with all of them except for the ones i gotta fix because of this machine...total waste of money
