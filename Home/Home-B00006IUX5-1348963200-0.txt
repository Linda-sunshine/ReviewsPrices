review/summary: Great Machinereview/text: I bought this grinder almost 10 years ago and it lasted until just the other day. For the price, I would have thought it would go a year at most, certainly not 10 times that. Another reviewer commented that sometimes, for a fine grind, one needs to shake the grinder a bit which is true, but really a minor minor draw back. Aside from that, it was a fantastic grinder. I use it for a moka stove top and it has always ground the beans just right for it. I just ordered its replacement and look forward to receiving it.
