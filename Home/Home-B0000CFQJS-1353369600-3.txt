review/summary: Can't believe I didn't know about this thingreview/text: I kept a four cup coffeemaker that didn't pour well, or supply me with enough coffee, for a long time becuase it had a permanent filter. I wouldn't upgrade to a 12 cup coffee maker because I hate those paper filters - buying them, changing them.I saw a Black and Decker 12 cup coffee maker with a permanent filter for 25 dollars at a Big Lots. Thought about pulling the trigger, but didn't. Being a heavy coffee drinker, over time, the 4 cup coffeemaker tried my patience with it's small quantities of coffee and sloppy pouring. I went back for the Black and Decker but it was gone. All the other coffeemakers took the dreaded paper filters. I then decided to look up coffeemakers on Amazon and saw that I could buy any 12 cup coffeemaker and then just buy this thing seperately. I was like, "They make these things and I didn't know about it? I'm 41. I have got to get it together.".Great product.
