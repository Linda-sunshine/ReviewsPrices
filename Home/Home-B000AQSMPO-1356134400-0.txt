review/summary: 4 years and still going strongreview/text: I got this as a Christmas gift 4 years ago and it has been absolutely wonderful. I always tell people it's the best Christmas gift I've ever received. It makes great coffee if you use a good brand and has also allowed me to quickly make oatmeal or other foods that require hot water in just a few seconds.Once in a while, the machine seems to get confused on how much water it's holding. I've had it stop immediately after pushing the brew button. I have to lift the handle up and then down again to reset it, and sometimes it sucks more water than it needs, causing hot water to spill out through the overflow valve. The problem seems to have gone away for now, but it has happened on several occasions.Other than that, it's been a perfect machine and the temperature of the coffee is perfect for me (on the high setting). I've never had coffee grounds come through the filter into my glass. Thanks Mom!
