review/summary: Perfect!review/text: I've had the Black & Decker DCM18S Brew 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker with Travel Mug for a week and I love it. I use it at work because they only make coffee when they are cold and I need my coffee at least 3 times during the day. With the coffe maker I can have a cup anytime. I don't have to wait for my break and run down to the coffee shop to get a cup. I love the fact that I don't have to buy filters. Coffee taste great!
