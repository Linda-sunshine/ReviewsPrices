review/summary: Best Purchase in a Long Time!review/text: I love this product! It was easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to store! I have used it to spiral zucchini, yellow squash, sweet potato, and potato so far. I have already recommended this product to others...my sister, my mother, and my daughter bought one and they all love it! This was well worth the money.
