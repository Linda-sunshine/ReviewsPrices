review/summary: energy effecient and convinientreview/text: the device is super small. pratically the size of a small vase.. super light.it comes with built in timer 4,8, and a remote control..it does take a while..maybe an hour to actually fill a whole room with heat.i would only recommend for a single room only though. but you set how hot.up to 85 degrees or even a little more after...
