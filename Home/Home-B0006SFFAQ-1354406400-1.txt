review/summary: not so smart designreview/text: We recently purchase the Cuisinart DCC-1200 programmable coffee maker, because old faithful Mr. Coffee was broken. Our purchase of this machine was on the advice of a family member. The first thing we noticed was the lack of an outside water level indicator. This is a design flaw in our estimation. Trying to discover the water level is a real challenge. You need a light directly above the coffee maker to determine the water level. Also, adding water to the water reservoir is not user friendly; the reservoir opening is not very large. You'd better be wide awake when adding water to this feature:) The carafe lid is not user friendly either There is no easy access to clean it; rather you have to completely pop or pry off the lid to clean the carafe. The outward appearance is sleek looking, until you realize that the brushed stainless steel appearance is plastic. It remains to be seen whether this purchase was worth the price, even though we did get a good price through Amazon. I would give it a 2 star rating for design, because of the mentioned problems that we have noted, and a 4 star for performance in producing a good cup of coffee. That means the rating averages out to a three star. a coffee enthusiast
