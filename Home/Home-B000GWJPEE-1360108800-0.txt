review/summary: Effective, very adorablereview/text: Works well. Almost silent, so you can easily have it on in a bedroom. It can be a bit of a hassle to clean (more like you need to plan time to clean it) and the plastic feet are a little cheap (one of them has cracked, but it doesn't affect the function), but for the price, it's not bad. Very cute.
