review/summary: Too loud for too longreview/text: Makes coffee fine and I want the grinder-in-one coffee maker feature, but can't it make a grinder that does'nt wake the entire neighborhood. It's not only really loud, but keeps going and going .... can't Cuisinart make a vresion that takes care of this?
