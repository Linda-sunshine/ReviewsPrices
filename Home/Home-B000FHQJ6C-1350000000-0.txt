review/summary: Hamilton Beach big mouth juice extractor 67650review/text: A great product. We read the reviews and took some of the advice offered (using a baggie to collect the pulp, etc). Absolutely no issues. We were prepared to buy a higher priced juicer if this one was not satisfactory, but we have found we do not need to. This model meets all our needs and expectations for one third the price we expected. We are very happy with this product and my Wife is juicing - crazy now. :)
