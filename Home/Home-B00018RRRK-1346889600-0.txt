review/summary: Perfect for Drip, Aeropress or French Pressreview/text: I bought this product after being unsatisfied with the highly rated Bodum Bistro electric grinder. It is perfect for what it is: a value oriented upgrade from a whirly blade grinder. I've made wonderful coffee from my freshly roasted beans using a drip maker, aeropress and a french press. The coarseness is perfect for french press!Yes, some of the fines stick to the container, but they are easily discarded without them getting mixed into your grounds. Also, as others have noted, the unit is rather loud. This isn't a big deal for me as I grind my beans in the garage on my workbench where I roast my coffee. If you are looking for a high end grinder for your espresso machine, look elsewhere. If you want a step up from your whirly blade grinder and you make drip coffee or coarser, you won't be disappointed!
