review/summary: Love It!!!review/text: I have been an iTouchless customer for years, and this product was an upgrade to the first generation trash can that I was using. I give it 5 stars for size of opening which enables disposing larger size debris, deodorizing capability, and the ability to remove bags without tearing the sides.
