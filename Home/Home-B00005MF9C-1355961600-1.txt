review/summary: Works Fine, Auto Shut-Off A Big Plusreview/text: This coffeemaker works well. It is inexpensive, easy to fill, easy to clean and fairly fast. The only minor drawback is the lack of an externally visible fill level. The internal fill mark is just about impossible to see, so you really have to measure the water you put in. The automatic shut-off is a big plus. I previously had a similar Toastess model (Toastess TFC-326 Personal-Size 1-Cup Coffeemaker, Black) which was also a good coffeemaker. It had an external fill indicator, but it lacked the automatic shut-off. I kept forgetting to turn it off after making coffee, which probably contributed to its early demise.
