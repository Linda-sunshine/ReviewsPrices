review/summary: Slept better in a couple nights!review/text: If you buy this pillow, have some patience. At first, it seems hard and you'll think you made a mistake. After 2 nights you'll love it. I had neck surgery a couple years ago and woke up with pain almost every day with my old pillow. I have very little or no pain now. It also keeps your head cooler. No more waking up with a wet pillow! I would recommend going with at least the queen size. A queen is about the same size as a standard regular pillow.
