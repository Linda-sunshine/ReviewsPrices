review/summary: Get More Juice From Jack La Lanne Juicer for Half the Costreview/text: I own both this model and the Jack LaLanne Juicer. I get much more juice for the same batch of veggies from the LaLanne juicer. The Breville spins too fast (even at slowest speed) and waste too much....giving too little juice. Dont waste your money...buy a cheaper one first.
