review/summary: Love this thing!!review/text: I was worried reader some of the 3 stars and under reviews about it filling slow, lever being loose and breaking, dripping water etc. I don't know if they just got the occasional bad one, but I haven't had any problems like that so far (3 weeks)The PUR 18 is so convenient, really easy to fill up, holds a bunch of water, fills fast, looks very nice, and even though its relatively big... doesn't take up too much room in the fridge.The water tastes clean, fresh, and cold all the time! Very happy with this product, would buy again for sure!
