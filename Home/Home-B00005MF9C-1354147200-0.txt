review/summary: great single cup unitreview/text: Purchased mine about two years ago, has worked just great. The only difficulty with it has been the little check valve in the bottom of the water resovoir has popped out of its seat a couple times. it is a friction tapepered fit and can be set back in place very easily. Its had some hard usage as both myself and wife are heavy coffee drinkers , but like a fresh cup each time. i see by some of the other reviews that some have had problems with it running over the cup when brewing, wont happen if you use the same cup you are drinking out of to fill the resovoir.
