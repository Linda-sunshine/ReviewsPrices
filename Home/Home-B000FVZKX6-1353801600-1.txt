review/summary: BUY THESE SHEETS!review/text: I LOVE flannel sheets. We sleep on them every day, all winter. In Missouri, it can be VERY cold, and I have purchased many brands of flannel sheets, even Northern Nights, but these are better! I thought the other brand was great when I got them, but these are WONDERFUL!! Much thicker, much softer, they stand up to frequent washing, and I LOVE THEM!!! When I need new sheets, these will be the ones I turn to. I bought "sage", and when hit with a dose of bleach in the wash, they turned a lovely lilac color! That was neither here nor there to me, they're under my quilt, so no one knew the difference, anyway. But be warned, a little bleach may change their color, but who cares? I still LOVE these sheets!
