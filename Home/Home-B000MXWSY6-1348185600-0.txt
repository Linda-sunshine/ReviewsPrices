review/summary: Great alarm clockreview/text: I got this alarm clock about a week ago and it has failed to disappoint. As soon as I plugged it in it displayed the correct time. That's really nice since I've had other "self setting" clocks that took hours to set if they ever set at all. It is supplied with a lithium coin cell as the backup, and the alarm will function from it even in the event of a power failure. I didn't fully read the specs and was expecting to have to buy a 9-volt battery for it. Pleasant surprise. There is a low battery indicator on the screen too, which is something I've never seen on another alarm clock. The dual alarms are easy to set and overall the design is easy to understand and very ergonomic. The beep alarm is a little quiet, but if the radio alarm at full volume doesn't wake you...see your doctor.... Mine's at 3/4 volume and I literally jump out of bed when it goes off. I'm not exactly a light sleeper either. The screen has 3 brightness levels and the dimmest is barely visible, so that shouldn't be a problem if you're sensitive to light. I'm not, and I use the brightest setting all the time with no problems. The radio is adequate, but I didn't expect HI-FI from an alarm clock. It's what you would expect. It picks up all strong local stations but the speaker is a little tinny sounding. In short, it's a good alarm clock that won't break your wallet. Pick one up.
