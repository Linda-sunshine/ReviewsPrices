review/summary: Puffington is very cool and cute as can be!review/text: I bought the product and was going to return, as it was bigger than I expected. It stands about 12 inches tall, and is a fat little guy. My mother wanted it and uses it in the middle of her indoor garden. Your can easily turn the head which changes the direction of the output. This is a nice feature as you do not have to turn the entire unit to change direction output. You simply remove the head, which is not attached or clamped in any way. It just lifts off. The body has an easy to use handle, though it says do not lift by the handle alone when full of water (it could break, I imagine). The plants love Puffington and he is very very cute. After running for a long time (several hours) he feels warm, which I'm not sure is a good sign. But after a couple months, he is doing fine. Probably, one of the best features, is he has no filter to replace. Clean weekly with vinegar. Yeah! He truly is adorable, although kind of a big guy. While we have not measured the actual humidity, the plants are standing taller!
