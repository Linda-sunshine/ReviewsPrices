review/summary: Great garbage can! But caution....review/text: We love this thing! No more lifting the garbage can lid with dirty hands or have a &#34;push then open&#34; lid get stuck. But here's the hitch...you'll start expecting everyone to have a garbage can that will open on it's own (I waved my hands in front of my parents' garbage can on Thanksgiving trying to get it to open!). Plenty of volume for a family of 4, and the batteries last quite a long time (I can't remember the last time we replaced ours).
