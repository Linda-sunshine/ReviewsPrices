review/summary: Sharp when new, not so much laterreview/text: I've had this knife for about nine month and used extensively(almost everyday) for about 6 month. It was very sharp when I first got it and I was quite happy at the time. It was until about a month ago, when my roommate got the 9' version of this knife, that I realized it became a little blunt by comparison. It's not as sharp as the new one. A week ago, I bought a Zwilling Pro S 7' knife (http://www.amazon.com/Zwilling-J-A-Henckels-7-Inch-Santoku/dp/B0000DDVFV/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top), which is incredibly sharp. The Zwilling cut thru any meat with almost just gravity working. I know, that one costs a lot more. So with the price of this knife, I give it a three star. Not so impressive as you keep using it, but still worth the money.
