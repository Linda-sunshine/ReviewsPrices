review/summary: Just what I was looking forreview/text: What drew me to this clock were reviews describing how dim it can get. It did not disappoint. On its dimmest setting, you can't really read the clock in a bright room. At night, it's clearly readable on my nightstand without being so bright that it bothers me.The controls for the alarms are very simple and easy to use. I like that each alarm has independent controls. The beeping is very neutral and wakes me up fine.
