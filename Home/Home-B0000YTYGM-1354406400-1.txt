review/summary: warm coffeereview/text: I replaced a cuisinart programmable coffeemaker with a glass carafe with this thermos model because the glass carafe broke very easily and it cost $25 each time I replaced it. The problem with this coffeemaker is that it does not keep the coffee hot enough. I have to warm the metal carafe with hot water before I start the process, and the coffee does not remain hot for very long. There is no heated pad under the pot. My husband wants to throw it out and start over again.
