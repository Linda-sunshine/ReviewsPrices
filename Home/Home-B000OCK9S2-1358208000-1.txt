review/summary: sound therapy clockreview/text: I originally bought this clock for my husband for trips as he needs back ground noise to sleep. However, I had to use it before he did and and I must say I really enjoyed the Ocean sound. It did help me relax in a strange area and I was able to get some sleep. Yes, I would recomend this clock
