review/summary: Good grinderreview/text: This grinder is great for the price. We were considering getting an attachment for our standing mixer, but couldn't justify the hefty prices ($100+). Instead I found this grinder, which is very versatile and much less expensive than any of the mixer attachments. The product is sturdy and grinds meat well. Haven't had a chance to use the pasta maker or other accessories, but it was mainly purchased to grind meat. Overall a great product, would definitely recommend.
