review/summary: Great Pitcherreview/text: I was getting pretty grossed out at the old smells and flavors held by my Tupperware pitchers, so I chucked them and bought one of these because it holds a half gallon(+) of water, which I need to drink each day. I just look at the pitcher and know whether or not I reached my intake quota! I love its compact size! I bough a second one to keep iced tea in the refrigerator.Others have complained about the loose top: If you look carefully under a light, you will see an arrow directing you to turn the lid's grab-bar handle clockwise to close (CHIUSO) and counter-clockwise to open (APERTO). This product is made in Italy, so the English words are below the Italian words. (The English words are covered when the grab-bar is in the fully closed or fully open position.) When closed, the lid is airtight and will prevent spills. I love it!
