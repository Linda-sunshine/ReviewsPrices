review/summary: Two indoor dogsreview/text: My husband and I purchased two of the air purifiers for our home. We have two large indoor dogs and felt like the house wasn't fresh smelling any more. After a couple of days, the freshness was back. They are a little noisy, but we run a fan at night for noise and no longer need to do it.
