review/summary: The only coffee maker you needreview/text: We bought this on a friend's recommendation. This friend of ours is way into coffee, and to satisfy his lust for the &#34;perfect cup&#34;. he was buying a fancy new coffee machine each year. But, he said, he stopped searching for new equipment after he found the AeroPress.With a recommendation like that, why not spend the twenty-odd bucks to see what the fuss is about?The AeroPress makes a perfect and delicious cup of coffee. I learned to enjoy the ritual of preparing and enjoying my daily cup, which is much healthier for the body and mind than brewing and mindlessly gulping down pot-fulls of the stuff. Our high-quality 12-cup coffee maker is in the closet in case we have company.
