review/summary: Love Them!review/text: My boyfriend and I are both avid cooks in the kitchen. I purchased these over a year ago when I remodeled my kitchen. I had a new pot rack hanging over my island and I wanted beautiful SS pots/pans to hang. I used 1 pan a year ago and never used it again becuase it became discolored from searing.My friends used to make fun of me, stating that I spent so much money on a cookware set that is just for show. Truthfully they were. I used to dust them and that was it. Not anymore!A friend of mine just about a month ago let me in on the secret of Barkeeper's Friend. Well, I decided to try it. OMG I am so happy I get to finally use my set!! There is a total difference with the way food tastes, the food is not altered at all! No matter what I am cooking, when I am finished BF does the trick!! They are as shiney as they were when I pulled them out of the box.The only reason they do not get a 5 star is since I have cast iron grates on my stove, the bottom of the pans tend to scratch.Sounds like I just gave a review for Barkeeper's Friend instead LOL But I guess if you want SS then they go hand in hand. But I do love the pots/pans so much I will be ordereing seperately the 12" skillet and the 5.5 Quart Saute Pan.
