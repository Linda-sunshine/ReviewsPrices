review/summary: Great nonstick panreview/text: I bought this pan because it was recommended by America's Test Kitchen and have been extremely happy with it. I bought another one as a present for my parents and they like it as well. I have had mine for a year and a half and it is just as nonstick as when I bought it. Nothing sticks to this, not even when frying eggs. I am careful to use utensils that don't scratch, but regardless I am very impressed with how the nonstick has held up, especially considering the price which is amazing. My only complaint is that it does not come with a lid, but I just use a lid from another 12&#34; pan and it works fine. Highly recommend!
