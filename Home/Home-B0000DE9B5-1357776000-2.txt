review/summary: Very nice jugs.review/text: I just love this jugs! What keeps it from being a 5 star is the airtight lid. Once you secure it it is airtight, however after it sits for awhile the lid releases. So that is disappointing and at times has made a mes. Other than that these containers are wonderful esp if you don't need it airtight for like water or something. I do recommend this product and I will continue to purchase.Another note people complained about the lids not locking. They do lock use common sense and turn them once they are in place. They are very easy to use.
