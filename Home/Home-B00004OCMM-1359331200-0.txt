review/summary: Whoah!review/text: This can opener is THE smoothest manual can opener I have ever used. It doesn't take up space on my counter top, it's easy to clean, and it's silent. Yes, you still have to turn the handle or whatever, but it is nearly effortless, and I'm a tiny female with tiny hands. Proportionate tiny hands. Why waste electricity? I never thought I'd say this, but I won't be using electric any more.
