review/summary: small and efficientreview/text: small but functionalI have noticed the &#34;plastic&#34; taste of water that other reviewers had noted before. After a few days of daily use, I do not feel it any more, but, then I use this water for tea or instant coffees, so they might mask the taste. Kettle is convenient and efficient, but the electric cord tends to pop out or wiggle out...
