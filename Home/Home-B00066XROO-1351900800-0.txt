review/summary: This griddle is the bestreview/text: I love my new griddle. It is very large for making pancakes or many eggs. I used to have to cook one grandchild's pancakes and then make some for the other one. Now I can make both of theirs all at once. What happy kids now. I love the drain underneath to catch grease when cooking bacon. No more food sitting in grease. It's very easy to clean. It fulfills all my breakfast needs. My son has this griddle and told me to get it. Much better than my old frypan. This cooks evenly over the whole griddle and not just in the middle like the frypan. My son has good taste. So glad he told me about this product.
