review/summary: Worst design ever for lid and spoutreview/text: I could not imagine such a terrible design for the lid and spout. It's way too hard to fill the kettle via the spout since it is so tiny (you would have to use a funnel). Filling it after pushing the button to open the lid results in the lid opening downwards into the kettle so you can't fill it more than half full.
