review/summary: Very Soft, Maybe Too Softreview/text: I have been using this mattress topper for almost a month now and I think I'm starting to get used to it. I think it will work better if you put it on top of a firm surface, but my medium soft bed is now very soft with this topper. It's not so much memory foam as it is just soft foam. If you have ever used a Tempur Pedic, it is nothing like that. It's not bad quality and I can tell it will last for awhile. It stretches instead of rips and it does morph back to normal after being twisted.I don't know why people were complaining about the smell. They call it green tea but it smells like mint. I actually like that smell but it disappears after a week. It probably covers up the smell of the synthetic materials.For $60, it's not a bad for a full size, quality mattress topper. It's just a little too soft for me so I'm rating 3 stars.
