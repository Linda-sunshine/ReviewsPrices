review/summary: The Best!review/text: I bought this a while back to have fresh bread ready when I wake up. Now, I use it at least once a week. I usually just use the mix, kneading setting but I have made meatloaf in this baby! I found a recipe where I can make pasta in the bread maker and can't wait to try that. Easy to clean, can back in maker, but I prefer shaping and baking dough in the over. Not one regret!
