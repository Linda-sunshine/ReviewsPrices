review/summary: World Cuisine Spiral Vegetable Slicerreview/text: I bought this to spiral zuchini for salads and it works better than I hoped. I have gone on to use other foods with it and am still learning which blade works best with which fruit or vegetable. The key to success with the machine is to experiment and take your time. The machine is super easy to clean, watch out for the sharp blades.
