review/summary: Perfect Size, Perfect Rice!review/text: I've owned this brand ( my first 10 cup Zogirushi Rice cooker was bought in the Kuwaiti Souk in Riyadh Saudi Arabia - while squatting in the sand haggling with a Bedouin sales woman!) for over 25 years. SOoooo reliable & makes excellent rice. While staying with my brother for 3 1/2 months while he was dying of cancer, I missed everything about my home - and found an inexpensive (compared to a "Zo") Aroma rice cooker. I bought it and even though I tried everything I could think of - the rice was never as good as in my old "Zo". And most times i used it, I'd have to unplug it and restart it after 10 minutes without it beginning to heat.Now, several years later - I have a much smaller kitchen and needed a tiny rice cooker for my tiny kitchen.... The 3 Micom Zo is the perfect answer! I've used it 3 times in the 2 days it's been here and I'm crazy about it!! Cute, sleek, low profile, retractable cord, heavy cooking bowl, innovative rice spoon that doesn't end up full of clumps of rice, multiple programs, BROWN RICE CYCLE!, and Sushi rice cycle! I'm in rice heaven!One word of warning - I also bought the highly recommended "Ultimate Rice Cooker" cook book. The recipes are inviting but nearly every one calls for a 6 cup rice cooker, which this is not. I'll try reducing the recipes - but many look like reducing will not work.
