review/summary: Great buy and good for the health consciousreview/text: I've owned and used this product for at least two years. It holds up pretty well. Your corn will begin to pop in a matter of minutes. I even caused it to automatically shut off by letting oil get on the grill. But after cleaning up the burnt oil, the unit came back on and have been working well every since. It gets really hot, and the plastic top will become pliable. I wasn't too happy with the melting butter feature, I melted my butter in the micro wave. It pops almost all of the kernels and if your popcorn is of a high quality they will pop up big and fluffy
