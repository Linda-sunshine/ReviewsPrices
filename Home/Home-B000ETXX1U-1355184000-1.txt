review/summary: So far so goodreview/text: I used this bed while the movers had our furniture for a week. I was on it solo for 4 days and then 2 days with my wife as well. Our cats, who still have their claws, even jumped up on it and held up great. It is hard to give it praise any higher than that. The extra height is very nice, as it is closer to a real bed. It is still lower than a regular bed, but does get rid of the &#34;sleeping on the floor&#34; feeling. The pump works well for inflating and deflating.The only downside is that the extra height doesn't really give a place for a fitted sheet to grab well.
