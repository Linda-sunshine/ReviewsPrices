review/summary: no memory foamreview/text: This is a pure foam topper. It may be fine for light weight children but not for adults. It compresses to nothing once an adult lays on it. I bought this for my college bound son but ended up giving it to our 12 year old. Cost of returnning shipping did not seem justified. In hindsight I should have returned it but too late now.
