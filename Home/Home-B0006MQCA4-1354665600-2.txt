review/summary: If you're looking at this, then buy it!review/text: You can't go wrong with this. It holds a lot of water, and it pours out very nicely. The design is perfect - it is slim enough but still very sturdy. It has a lip on the front that can come in handy too when pulling it towards you. Highly recommended!
