review/summary: It's not working well.review/text: We were very pleased with the B-70 for about l1/2 years. But now it is failing. We did all the suggested fixes but it is still giving us problems. Called Keurig and they said we will sell you another one for $117.00. Don't know if I want to buy another one if it is going to go bad like the last one.
