review/summary: Great Waffles for your Bucksreview/text: Simple waffle maker. Not a lot of bells and whistle, nor the higher price of those fancy waffle makers. But makes great waffles. Easy and simple to use. Don't have to be a rocket scientist to make good waffles. Only complaint is that the electrical cord is too short.
