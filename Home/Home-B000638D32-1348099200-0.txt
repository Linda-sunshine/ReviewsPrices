review/summary: overall decent knife for the pricereview/text: Saw this knife on the toppp website. Not too sure why it is the highest overall rated knife. My first impression is that the knife is not well balanced. It's light and cuts well. I guess I would prefer the knife to have a bit more weight to it.
