review/summary: Brevillereview/text: I am very satisfied with the purchase of my Breville. Although it is smaller than the other Breville models, this machine is powerful. The left over pulp is literally dry. I would definitely encourage you to purchase a Breville if you are looking for one of the best juicers.
