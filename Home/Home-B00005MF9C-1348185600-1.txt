review/summary: Right size, not good enoughreview/text: I wanted to buy a coffee maker for my dorm room because the coffee at the dining halls is awful. I bought this one because it was small and cheap (a college student's dream). It was the right size, but I was not impressed with its performance. You get what you paid for.I ran two water cycles through before I tried brewing a cup, but the first cup still smelled like plastic. I also followed the recommended amount of coffee to add to the filter and the coffee was too weak. The next cup I brewed I added a lot more grounds, and the filter overflowed, covering the drip apparatus and the entire inside of the coffeemaker with grounds. They also trickled down the sides. I tried again, and added the average (not too full, not to weak) amount of grounds. Still overflowed. I sent it back; if the coffee maker can't make a decent cup of coffee without making a mess all over itself, I don't want it. It also had a ton of sediment in the cups, and the cups that I used had brown coffee mud caked on the insides after I finished and the coffee itself was a little thick (I didn't mind that so much). The to go cup that is provided is cheap - as expected - but I didn't like how the handle was bendy where it attached to the cup. It didn't seem that secure.Anyway, I returned it and am still searching for a decent dorm room/single drinker coffee maker.
