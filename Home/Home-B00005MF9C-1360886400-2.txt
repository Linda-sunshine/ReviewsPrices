review/summary: Poor qualityreview/text: I was so excited to see this product on Amazon only to be greatly disappointed. The plastic is of poor quality. It was difficult to open the lid at first. When I finally got to open it, the plastic &#34;screw-like thing&#34; at the back broke. When I started to use the machine, it seemed like it was going to explode. It was making this really noisy gurgling sound that scared the hell out of me -maybe it is normal but I have never experienced such a thing from other coffeemakers. The first time I used the product, it produced 1 mug of coffee - at least that pleased me. But after that first time, it was only producing 1/3 of a cup. I have to re-start the machine again and again in order to fill my mug. Since I live in Europe, there is no point in returning the product and wasting more money. Maybe I got unlucky - I don't know. I would NOT advise anyone living outside the US to purchase this product.
