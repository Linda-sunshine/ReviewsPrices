review/summary: A Work Horse Providing A Great Brewreview/text: We have used this coffeemaker for @ 5 years at my workplace. A 24/7 unit. It still makes good coffee and is still in good workingorder despite heavy use. I just bought one for myself at home after my second cuisinart in that 5 year period quit. Now I start mymorning with a quickly (3 Minutes) made 4 cup pot and it is hot and delicious. Should have bought one for home 5 years ago.
