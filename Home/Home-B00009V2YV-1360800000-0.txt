review/summary: 3 Year Reviewreview/text: I purchased my original WWR300 weather radio about 3 years ago and still love it. Since then I have purchased several for friends and family. Remember to replace you batteries once a year, and you should be trouble free. The setup to block certain alerts can be confusing at first but is worth it in the long run. This is simply the best weather radio for the price on the market, of course my opinion.
