review/summary: Lots of bang for your buck...review/text: We've had this espresso maker for about a month and a half now, and I am still learning the art of making exotic coffee drinks. How on earth do the real barristas make those froth ferns, floating on top of my latte? Personal failings aside, the machine works well. The steamer, as others have noted, is a bit close to the cabinet, so I've got to tilt the machine to get our small froth pitcher to work. The espresso maker appears to be well-made, and it makes a great espresso, which is, of course, the foundation for many other drinks. There are no odd leaks or anything like that, and everything works the way it is supposed to. Great value for those who want to make espresso at home, without busting the budget.
