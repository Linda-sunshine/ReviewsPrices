review/summary: Best piece of kitchen equipment i ever purchasedreview/text: My husband & I began using this processor the first day we got it. I can't imagine how we lived so long without it. It came with a very easy to understand DVD. It is so fast & easy to use. One of our favorite uses for it is shredding different raw veggies (such as carrots, celery, jicama, sweet potato spinach, etc.) to mix into the protein meals of our 2 chocolate labs. We shred enough veggies to last us a week in the refrigerator. This keeps them very healthy along with various nutritional powders we add to their food. Before this, we had to grate everything by hand. This is a perfect size for our family & we will probably use it every day. LOVE IT !!!!!!!!
