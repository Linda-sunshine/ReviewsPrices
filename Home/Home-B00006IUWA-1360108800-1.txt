review/summary: Excellent popcorn makerreview/text: Bought this to replace a cheap box-store air popper that would pop maybe 75% of the kernels on a good day. This one is excellent; it pops nearly every kernel, even using my several-year-old popcorn. I wouldn't have thought that there was much difference between air poppers, but I guess I was wrong.
