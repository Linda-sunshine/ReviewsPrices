review/summary: BEAUTIFUL, efficient kettlereview/text: I've had this kettle for a year and absolutely love it. I wanted to move away from my plastic kettle and I'm glad I did because the water tastes better out of this one. It did smell for the first few days, but I expected that. I put some vinegar water in it, then lemon water, and never had a problem after that (although one of those combos foams up a bit...I can't recall which...so watch out!). My only complaint is that the inside heating element at the bottom is changing color a bit, which is probably my fault because I tend to not empty it right away. I am SO glad I got this water kettle!
