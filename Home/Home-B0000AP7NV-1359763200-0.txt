review/summary: Quite smallreview/text: I like the Brita concept. Water does seem to taste better from Brita, whether or not it's healthier or not. But part of the concept includes having enough water to drink. What good is purification if it only applies to a few cups? That's the problem here. The design is quite narrow. This helps it fit into a fridge door but limits the possible uses. I find that I fill up the pitcher all the way and then use it to fill up my metal water bottle. By that point the pitcher is practically empty. It's tedious to go back and forth to the sink and keep refilling it.I'm left to wonder who this is intended for. Does anyone have such a small fridge or so many food items that they would need to cut down on their Brita pitcher size? I would opt for a larger version.
