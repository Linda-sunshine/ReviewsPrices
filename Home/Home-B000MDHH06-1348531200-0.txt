review/summary: Just Okreview/text: I purchased the Juice Fountain as a novice juicer and was not aware that the all excess of the vegetables went to an inner container in the juicer. Needless to say, this causes a HUGE mess to clean up each time and if you are juicing for more than one person then you have to stop and clean it out and then start again. What a PAIN!! If you are a single juicer then it is fine if you don't mind the mess of cleaning out the inner container. I actually went and purchased another juicer, one that has a side container and allows me the ability of juicing for more than one person at a time without stopping. Something to think about when purchasing a juicer.
