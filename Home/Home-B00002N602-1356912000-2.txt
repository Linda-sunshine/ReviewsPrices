review/summary: Presto pressure cookerreview/text: It is ok. i bought one last year and the screws rusted and loosened. i have not been able to find stainless steel screws that fit this. Amazon reimbursed me for the screws- like $2. I bought another and am hoping the screws don't loosen. I wish they would buy American stainless steel screws! The pot is stainless steel- so for the money it is a decent buy. I make beans in it every few days. Instead of taking 90 minutes to cook, takes 10 minutes!
