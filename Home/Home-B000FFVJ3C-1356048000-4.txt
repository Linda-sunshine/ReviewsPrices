review/summary: Great machine so farreview/text: So far I've only dried apples and pineapple but this machine does the job well. I recommend cutting the pieces thin, not paper thin but less than a half inch thick. Extra juicy fruit like pineapple takes longer so you have to account for that if you cut them thicker. I bought this brand because it has more than enough wattage and it was a great price. The Nesco is a great brand. My brother has been using his for over a year and loves it too (he did get a more expensive Nesco, has 1000 watts). The trays are great. The unit gets warm but not bad at all. I love this machine and can't wait to try more items.
