review/summary: surprisingly comfortablereview/text: When I received this pillow, I was very suspicious of its comfort level. It appears to be to too "tall" and too "firm" to be a comfortable pillow. However, after using it for several weeks now, I must say this is a great pillow for me. My neck pain disappeared!
