review/summary: Nice dehydratorreview/text: The other dehydrator (Waring) we bought lost the fan bearings after a month and a half. We put up an entire years of vegetables in the fall and need a reliable one. My neighbor has been using a Nesco like this for 7 years and recommended them, so I decided to give it a try. So far, we've dried spices and 11 lbs of jerky with no problems. The drying time with this one is about a third less. Additional trays are available and this unit will handle up to 12. So far we have 9. I would recommend this dehydrator to anyone that is serious about drying foods.
