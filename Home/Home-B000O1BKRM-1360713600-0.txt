review/summary: Great for baby food!review/text: I ordered 2 sets of these trays to freeze my own baby food in little 1 oz cubes. These work great for that. It is somewhat difficult to remove the cubes, as other reviewers have said, but I have a few tricks I use. First, I twist the trays a little to break the cubes apart. Then I turn it upside-down on the counter, hold the edges with both hands, and push down on one side with both thumbs. The cubes come out pretty easily after that. It is worth the extra little effort. These trays are very nice, durable, and I did not notice a smell transferring from them to my baby's food, but maybe that's only a problem with ice. Overall, I would recommend and order again, though I'd also say you need a very thin little scrapper to help you get the baby food packed in there. Oxo makes a nice one.
