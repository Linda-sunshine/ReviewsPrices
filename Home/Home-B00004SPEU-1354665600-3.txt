review/summary: Great, Compact, Easy to Clean Grinderreview/text: This grinder is a fantastic and affordable package for those looking to make the transition to whole bean coffee. This small unit packs a punch, being able to churn through a lot of coffee beans in a quick manner. The noise isn't too bad (to me) and it gets the job done in less than 30 seconds.This has allowed me to get whole bean coffee which lasts much longer than pre-ground packages. And many specialty blends are often only available in whole bean form. If you or someone you know is looking for a grinder, I couldn't think of another product to recommend over this KRUPS unit. Even though though this is at the cheaper end of the grinder spectrum, it's not at a loss of quality in any regard.Once you're done, cleaning is also a breeze with a dry cloth too. It's definitely not dishwasher safe, but a quick wipe is all it takes to prep for your next use.
