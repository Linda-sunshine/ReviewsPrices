review/summary: poor quality and plastic smellreview/text: I purchased this product a little over a month ago and it's already stopped operating correctly. It will heat for a few seconds, then shut off. It continues this cycle until I just give up and turn it off. The other thing I noticed right away was the plastic smell of the heated water. This did lessen over the month, but was still there. Not a product I'd buy again.My previous electric kettle was Ovente stainless/cordless which I accidentally broke. It will be a strong contender when I purchase a new one.
