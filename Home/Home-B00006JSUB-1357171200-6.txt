review/summary: Versatilereview/text: Pan gets wonderfully and evenly hot, has enough room for a large, aggressive stir fry, and is perfect for making home made pan pizzas in the oven.The size and weight make cleaning a bit more of an effort, and being cast iron it requires a little more attention and care, but it's well worth it.
