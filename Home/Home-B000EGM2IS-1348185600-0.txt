review/summary: Really?review/text: We purchased this as a replacement to an older white version expecting at least similar quality. She didn't want white in the kitchen. This one seems flimsier. The lid rattles as a significant amount of water evaporates and streams out of the unit. It is slow to turn off as a cloud of steam goes under the cupboards. A quarter cup of your tea evaporates! It is also slow to dispense the liquid and larger cups are difficult to fit into the area under the dispenser. After a few weeks of putting up with these problems we've brought the 10 year old white one back into the kitchen and have thrown this one out! At least sunbeam made a great product 10 years ago.
