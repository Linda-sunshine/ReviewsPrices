review/summary: Just rightreview/text: Needed a Thermos to hold my juices and this one has done a good job with no complaints.I prepare about 40 ounces of juice everyday, This thermos holds one half of what I take to work with me, and I get 2 good sized cups out of it. Cleanup is a breeze using the spayer. I'm very satisfied.
