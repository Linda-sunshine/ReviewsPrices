review/summary: So handy!review/text: I really have enjoyed my immersion blender and am happy to not have spent a fortune on it. The Cuisinart immersion blender is a great choice. It quickly blends a pot of soup to varying consistencies, whether you want it chunky or smooth. The blender is very slender and does not take up much storage space and it's easy to clean, as well.
