review/summary: Does What We Bought It Forreview/text: We got this to replace a fan we used for "white noise" since my wife sleeps in the day time, due to working the 3rd shift. We were hoping this would be cheaper than running a fan, so far it seems to be.Pros: It is louder than a fan (on white noise)! Our bedroom door opens to a short hallway then the living. So with the door closed and on about 50% volume this will drown out our 5.1 Sound Sound system. I tested this with Rammstein's "Du Hast" at much louder than normal, the wife never even heard it and was trying to!Cons: We are older (late 40's) and our vision is going south. Hence the time is impossible to see, even with glasses on. The black numbers on a blue background was a bad idea. The other noises are annoying to us, but that may be just a personal preference. If this had only "white noise" it would be just as good.Since we can't see the time on it, we kept our old alarm clock going, so have no reason to test the alarm functions. Also, we'll probably never use it as a radio, so didn't test that either.Final thought: If you are thinking of buying this as a white noise machine only, I highly suggest getting this. But could only give it 3 stars since it failed completely as a readable clock.
