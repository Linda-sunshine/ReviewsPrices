review/summary: I liked it so much I bought tworeview/text: When I unpacked my Cuinart hand blender and saw that it had two speeds available, I thought, yeah, sure. One more useless feature. And then I turned it on. Wow! This thing has a LOT of power. Half the time I use it I only use the low power setting, lest I spray the contents of the bowl or pot I'm using all over the kitchen. I use it for pureeing soups, for making mayonnaise, for making smoothies, and really, just about everything I used to use a standard blander for. Making soup, it's much easier to bring the blender to the pot than dump the contents on the pot into a blander, and the hand blender can handle a lot more volume than my regular blender. It can also handle thicker mixtures that won't flow well in a standard blender. The detachable motor makes it easier and safer to clean, too. I like mine so much I bought a second for my girlfriend.
