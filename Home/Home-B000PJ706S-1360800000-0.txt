review/summary: Boiled Water Smelled/Tasted Badreview/text: Like many people have already written, the water boiled in this kettle has a rubbery smell and taste, even after rinsing and cleaning it multiple times. I'm not particularly picky or sensitive about these kinds of things, but it was intolerable and I returned the kettle, which is a shame because I really like the look and function of this kettle.I have some friends who have this kettle and they are happy with it and didn't notice any odor, and a number of people reviewing on Amazon also haven't had this problem, so I'm not sure if some people just can't taste this particular flavor in the water or if the production of this kettle is hit-and-miss, with some affected by the smell and others not. Either way, I can't recommend this kettle.
