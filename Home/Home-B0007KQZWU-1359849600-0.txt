review/summary: Nice cookwarereview/text: I am not used to stainless cookware. I used to have to scrub it out every night as a busboy in my teenage years. But I don't generally use it. however, with all the things I hear about nonstick being an issue I figured it was time to give it a try. I have to say its not as bad as I thought it would be. Sure there are odd things to deal with sticking and burning, but for the most part its easy enough to deal with. It sure does impress me though how non stick that old non stick cookware was.
