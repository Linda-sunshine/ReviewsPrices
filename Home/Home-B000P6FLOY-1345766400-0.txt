review/summary: Works great...........just don't leave it out in the rain!review/text: This is actually my second one, but only because we used our old one outdoors for the grill and it was pouring and it never quite recovered. Before that I'd had the old one for at least four years or more and never one issue. I really like that this one has an "off" switch though, will definitely save on the battery.
