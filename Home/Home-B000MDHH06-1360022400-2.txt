review/summary: Excellent Juicerreview/text: Purchased this juicer last week to replace my smaller/cheaper model. Received it yesterday and already impressed. Produces more juice, dryer pulp left over, easy to clean, relatively quiet (for a juicer). I really like that I can feed a whole apple or a whole carrot without cutting and chopping (a step up from my previous juicer). The ease of use makes juicing easy. It only took me 2 minutes to juice my carrots/apple juice this am. This means I actually got to work on time :>). Love it so far, we will see what the next few months bring.
