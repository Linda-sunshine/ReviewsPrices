review/summary: Not great, but not terriblereview/text: This pillow is very firm. It is a little smaller than a normal sized pillow, and I don't think the four tube sections were designed well. There should be three sections (eliminate the middle stitch). I tried using it for a month and was not very pleased. I found myself waking up on the other side of the bed with a different pillow.I returned the first one because there was a hole and 1000s of beads in the packaging. I probably should have gotten a refund.
