review/summary: Works well. Love the nonstick surface.review/text: This unit replaces an older round model that did not have a nonstick surface. I like this skillet with one small reservation, it's a bit over large for two people. However, come mid-July when I'm frying a pound of bacon for BLT sandwiches I'm sure I'll wonder how I ever thought this was about 33% more skillet than necessary. I think I'm going to like it just fine.
