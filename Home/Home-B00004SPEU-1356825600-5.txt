review/summary: A great replacementreview/text: This is our second go at this Krups grinder. The first was purchased at Starbucks, at a crazy Starbucks price, and was a gift to us. We enjoyed grinding our way through many years of bean coffee, but finally the original electric motor in the grinder gave up (8-10 yrs).The oval shape allows you to more easily pour the grounds either into your coffee maker, or into another coffee can, for later use.The danger of the high speed blade is guarded by placing the blade trigger flush with the rim of the grinder. Caution is still advised, just as when using the ubiquitous garbage disposal.The new grinder works fine. When you want finer grind, keep grinding a bit longer, or until the results suit you. For the price, you may not find this kind reliability, durability and functionality elsewhere.Enjoy your favorite bean coffee, freshly ground.
