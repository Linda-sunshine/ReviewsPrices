review/summary: Honeywell Compact Air Purifierreview/text: Its the perfect size for an RV, not as good as the comparable Idylis model but it was cheaper.Time will only tell if it cleans the air as well.Not too loud but great if you need &#34;white noise&#34; at night if you are accustomed to it.Aesthetics are fair, it fits into an environment and doesn't look cheap but isn't a work of art either, but hey its an air cleaner.
