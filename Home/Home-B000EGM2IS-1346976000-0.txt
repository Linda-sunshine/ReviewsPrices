review/summary: Really disappointing...rabid fan totally turned off.review/text: I was an addict to my previous ones for about 30 yrs. This one is a dink. My standard 2cup cups will barely fit in it now. Then you can't fully press the dispense bar down. So it takes minutes to disperse the liquid, instead of seconds. Often it leaves 1/2 inch of water behind, which means the thermostat won't reset and you can't start another 2cups of cold water to heat for up to 30 minutes. Yikes, that is scary slow. Seriously, I could do better on an open flame. After 5 weeks of swearing at it, it is a goner, and I pulled out the old electric teapot. I had contacted the company to return it and they blew me off. Yuck.
