review/summary: Alrightreview/text: I am using this for last 3 weeks. Overall a good product. Quite sturdy except for the feet portion that got cracked in the first week. So be careful while handling. Frogy head has 2 openings over the eyebrows for vent. But as you increase the speed the hood gets loose and mist comes from the side of the head as well. No complains for functionality.
