review/summary: A Must Havereview/text: This is something that you look like you'll use a lot only to discover you will use it constantly. It is the best thing since slice bread. I had the original version which had the on switch in front, which was better. The front dispense lever was half the size and next to it was the on switch.It's great for the price. Get it.
