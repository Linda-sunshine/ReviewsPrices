review/summary: Beautiful!review/text: Beautiful Italian pitchers! Love these. The weight is wonderful, the seal on top is easy to use and secure. I purchased two. I like to keep tea in the fridge and don't want food odors to dis-flavor the tea or whatever I put in it. I looked at the swing top bottles, however, I know I would need a funnel to use those, however neat they are, and the metal on the swing top tends to rust. These have no metal, the handle makes them so easy to use, and the top seal is wonderful!
