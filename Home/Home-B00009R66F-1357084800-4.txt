review/summary: Excellent machine...only wish I got it during the lightning deal. :)review/text: We purchased this carpet cleaner to mainly keep our family room clean. We have two kids (a 6 month old and a 3 year old) so as you can guess the floor gets dirty, especially with spit-up from the newborn. I unfortunately missed the lightning deal during Black Friday week, but still consider the price I paid for it to be worth it.The package arrived on time and I was able to get it assembled and usable within 20 minutes. My first impression of the machine was that it looks and feels cheap. Some of the plastic parts seem like they could break easily, but honestly I don't care too much - it's more of a comfort thing. What I really cared about was how it performed. My sister has loaned us her Bissell cleaner and I really didn't care for how the clean water and dirty water were a part of the same plastic tub. It was a pain to clean. The two tank system on the Hoover is awesome and makes cleaning a breeze. It was very easy to load more hot water when it ran out.The bottom line is that this machine does an incredible job of cleaning AND drying carpets. I was very impressed with how dry the carpet felt after sucking back up the water. We were able to walk on it within minutes.If you're in the market for a great, inexpensive carpet cleaner you'll be happy with the Hoover.
