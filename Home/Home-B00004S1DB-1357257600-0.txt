review/summary: Stays Hot in the Pot!review/text: We like french press coffee, but want it to stay hot in the pot; that won't happen with the glass models. We purchased this one to bring along on a cruise vacation, because we are fussy about our morning coffee. We also brought along baggies of pre-measured coffee, and ordered a pot of hot water from room service each morning to make it. The measuring and brewing directions make a perfect pot of coffee. Finally experienced really good coffee out on our balcony every morning! We use it at home now as well.The only reason I cannot give this item five stars is because the press screen does let a bit too many coffee grounds through. We solved that 100% by using a small tea strainer when pouring.
