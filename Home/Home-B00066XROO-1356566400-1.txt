review/summary: How to feed 11 kids and 23 grand kids breakfastreview/text: My wife and I have a combined family of 11 kids and they visit often. We love it. My wife needed some way to feed these kids and their kids her favorite pancakes without taking all morning. I searched the web and found this griddle last year. It really works well and my wife loves it.
