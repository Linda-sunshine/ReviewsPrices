review/summary: Finally a fantastic openerreview/text: I have often cursed under my breath when attempting to open a simple can of anything because of the inability of the can opener to function as one would reasonably and prudently expect!!! I have purchased numerous can openers with the hope they might work easily; finally, however, it is a pleasure to use a truly well-made, solid, and EASY to turn opener. I happened to spy this one by OXO when I was scanning through to find an item to assist one when TRYING to open a jar. OXO also has a Good Grips Jar Opener, which I cannot comment on yet, but if it is anything like this high quality can opener,then it, too, will be fantastic and I'll again be very pleased. This can opener is top quality and I highly recommend it. OXO seems to produce only the best quality products. I will continue to look to this brand for other kitchen items I need.
