review/summary: Perfect!review/text: I gave one of these to everyone on staff for Christmas last year. It was very worthwhile. We compare recipes, techniques and make dinner time go quickly. Roasts can go from frozen to fall apart in 99 minutes. BBQ chicken can go from frozen to on the table in 12 minutes.I highly recommend this product and recommend you have a friend that will cook along with you. Comparing and reviewing makes meal making a much easier task and you will love the fact that this is a quiet product!It is not noisy and terrible on the nerves.
