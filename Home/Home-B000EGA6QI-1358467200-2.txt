review/summary: Every Kitchen Needs Onereview/text: I've had an immersion blender for years. But when I went to a friend's house for Thanksgiving, I learned that she did not have one. So I gave her one for Christmas, and now she agrees with me that it is indispensable. Her model is newer, and the bottom part can be detached and put in the dishwasher. Mine cannot, but cleanup isn't that difficult.
