review/summary: Lives up to the ratingsreview/text: When my previous electric can opener quit working properly--it wouldn't stop when the lid had been completely severed--I wanted to get one that would work better & last longer. The West Bend meets the first of those requirements beautifully, and only the test of time will tell whether it meets the second. I'm very happy with its performance and especially pleased that it's so much quieter than the old one.
