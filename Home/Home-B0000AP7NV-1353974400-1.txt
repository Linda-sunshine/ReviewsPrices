review/summary: Best purchase in a long timereview/text: This size pitcher fits perfectly in my fridge door. Because I have a freezer on the bottom fridge, I don't have much space between shelves and needed something that would fit in the door. It filters the water quickly and I store additional filtered water in another pitcher that fits on the shelves. I would recommend this product to anyone who has limited height space between their fridge shelves and storage space in their fridge doors.
