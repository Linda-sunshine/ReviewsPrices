review/summary: This is my 2nd !review/text: I just bought my 2nd little heater like this and I am anxiously awaiting it's arrival. My other one fits perfectly in the open space of the fireplace we have in the living room that no longer works (is no longer open to the outside) and is wonderful to use while sitting in the lounge chair reading or watching TV. Works great! So soon I'll have one to keep in my other room too so I don't have to move the one from the living room. I'm very happy. : )
