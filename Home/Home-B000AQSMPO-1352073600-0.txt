review/summary: Died at 22 monthsreview/text: Had the maker for a year. Started to brew half a cup. They walked me through cleaning the machine with a tooth prick. I did this and descaled it about 8 times. Worked fine. Last month, it had trouble staying on. Last week, it gasped its last breath. Will not come on for nothing. Customer service rep said it must be my outlet. Tried to tell her my regular coffee maker (Technivorm Moccamaster, GREAT maker) was plugged into the same outlet. Did not compute with her. She then said since it was out of warranty, she could sell me for a new one for $97. This $50 less than Amazon which to me, is no big deal.Great single cup coffee make, just does NOT hold up.
