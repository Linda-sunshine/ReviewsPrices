review/summary: Big Mistake!review/text: This is my first Amazon review. I'm passionate about these trays so here goes - They looked darling and with the promise of space saving I impulsively bought 3 sets. Well, they do save space and they are cuter in real life than in the picture. But there is no easy way to remove the ice cubes!! NONE. I'm typing this with fingers that feel like they have freezer burns. They are useless as ice cube trays. I'm trying to figure out what I can recycle them into . . .
