review/summary: Juice Collector Pitcher Has Measurement in Ounces Markedreview/text: Update 1/4/2013. LOVE this juicer even more than when I first started using it. About every ten times I use it, I putall the assembly parts (including the pitcher and lid but not the base) on top shelf of dishwasher (air dry cycle/no heated dry) which removes stains from metal parts, ash from the plexiglass, and leaves sieve filter squeaky clean.For those who complain about foam in the juice pitcher...drink it! Commonly foam comes from carrots or it comes fromcitrus and pectin (apples) combos.Initial review August 2012:I am a first time juicer and I make single servings. This is a monster machine. This may be more machine than I really needed for just me, but like every other Breville countertop piece I have purchased from Amazon, I am delighted with the quality and the performance. The six parts that need rinsing thoroughly after each use would have kept me from buying this unit if I had known it had so many parts to clean. Having said that, I don't mind the clean up at all (much easier than cooking cleanup involving pots/pans/glasses/silverware/stove top burners, etc). Another upside is that this machine does not leak anywhere. And it will take whole apples so prep time is greatly reduced. The juice collector pitcher has measurements in ounces on the side so you can tell if the recipe will allow for another carrot, stalk of celery, or another apple if you so desire. The base is very weighted so this is a countertop unit you will need to leave out (and it is tall so it likely will not fit under your overhead kitchen cabinets). I positioned mine in a corner, so it doesn't interfere with opening cabinets and it allows me to minimize the amount of countertop space it occupies. Buy this. You will be glad you did.
