review/summary: Buyer Beware of theifsreview/text: I must first start this review with two things. First, I have had nothing but good experience with amazon thus far and also anyone selling items through amazon. Second, I love my Pur water pitcher and filter. The water comes out so nice, smooth, and clean. I even ordered these items on Sept. 18th and received them on Sept. 21st...very fast shipping even though I chose the free slow shipping. The reason it gets a one star is because my order was for a 4-pack of Pur 2-stage filters. I get the shipping box and it is in perfect condition. I open the box and proceed to go through my order which had several items including this one. However, when I opened the Pur box to inspect my filters there were only 3 instead of 4. The person that did this is obviously a professional (meaning they have done it before) because the 3 filters were repacked so that it appeared to have 4 inside. Bottom line, someone stole one...and left me paying for 4 but only getting 3. I'm not sure who's at fault for this...but I am very disappointed and will continue to buy my Pur filters at Walmart from now on. Hopefully Amazon will follow through and check their cameras if they have any and watch their employees.
