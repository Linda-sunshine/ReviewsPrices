review/summary: Hoover is #1 in carpet cleaners....review/text: Great product for the price. Bought this for my son and daughter-in-law for Christmas. He cleaned the carpet in his entire house a couple days after opening it. The Hoover did a super job. I am on my second one (mine has the heating feature) and was a bit more expensive. My first one lasted over 10 years and got LOTS of use by me and others. Highly recommend a Hoover over a Bissell or any other brand of carpet cleaner.
