review/summary: Oil in a spraycan with no extra chemicals!review/text: This is a great little bottle, but do heed the advice of other reviewers and let out the air after each use. Also, it's been my experience that the spray isn't quite as effective for use in non-stick pans, I guess the propellant used in PAM and other commercial sprays also helps stuff not to stick...
