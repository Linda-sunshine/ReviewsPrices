review/summary: Okay, for about a month...review/text: This juicer is pretty much what you get for the price. After about one month, the filter cannot handle anything really fibrous (it starts to vibrate all over like its getting ready to explode) and you have to clean it out after each item is put through the juicer...very annoying. Also, somehow the pulp flies through the cracks in the catching basket and spews pulp all over your kitchen...that is not cool either. All in all, I guess you pay what you get for. I am upgrading to something decent. It is just a "starter juicer" for someone on a budget.
