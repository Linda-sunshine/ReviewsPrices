review/summary: Almost Perfectreview/text: This grinder does exactly what I expected. It is simple to use and cleans up easily. My only complaint is that the grinder's handle is so long (unnecessarily so in my oponion) that the grider can only be used on the edge of a counter. As you can see from the image, the handle is longer than the grinder so if you want to position it anywhere other than the edge of the counter the handle will not turn and the grinder will not work.
