review/summary: Keurigs are great, but unreliablereview/text: This is my third Keurig machine in just over 5 years. I love the convenience, and I keep buying replacement machines. However, if this breaks in under 2 years I may switch to a different "instant" coffee machine manufacturer.It's really confusing figuring out which Keurig model to go with. Save yourself some trouble and just buy this one, since I already did research and bought this model. Peace.
