review/summary: Brita Grandreview/text: Love it ... holds a lot of water - more than we expected. Preparing the filter by running three loads of water through surprised us, but we did so as directed and all is well. Fits into side door of our refrigerator nicely too! Looking forward to using this down the road! Recommend.
