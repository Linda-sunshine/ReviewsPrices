review/summary: Lot o work, little juicereview/text: We got this juicer for my mom's christmas gift. She tried it a couple times and was surprised by how much pulp ended up wasted (she likes juice with pulp in it). Some fruits, like blueberries wouldn't even go through, just came out in the pulp. She also didn't like how difficult it was to clean, and since she wants to use it more than once a day, it got to be a hassle.It was returned and she is much happier with a high functioning blender/food processor for her needs.Amazon was very helpful on the return and made the experience a bit better for it.
