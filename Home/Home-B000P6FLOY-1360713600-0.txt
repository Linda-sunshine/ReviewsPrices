review/summary: Perfect for homebrewingreview/text: I use this for homebrewing after reviewing several thermometers out there. This one is great because the probe can withstand to be in the liquid and is long enough to do the job. It also features and on/off switch which a lot fo the others out there do not so you can save on some batteries, even though the draw is minimal as I use this thing a lot and am still on the same battery (thankfully it only uses 1 AAA and comes with it). If you are a homebrewer, get this one. You won't be sorry.
