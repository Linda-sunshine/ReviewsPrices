review/summary: Very hard to use and cleanreview/text: I was so excited about the dual griddle/ grill feature, but I do not like this pan one bit. It does not cook evenly, and it is a bear to clean. When it comes in contact with the slightest amount of water, it completely rusts and stains everything around it. It is going to collect dust in the back of my cabinet.
