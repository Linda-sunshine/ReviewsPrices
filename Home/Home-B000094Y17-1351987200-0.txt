review/summary: Grand Grand Pitcherreview/text: After reading a lot of negative reviews and using my Grand pitcher for about a year now, I figured I'd post a review.To the lid falling off, I have never experienced that problem.To the filter coming out, I have never experienced that problem.To the water coming out of the top when pouring, I do get that only if I pour right after filling the pitcher. If I just plan a little and fill it AFTER I pour, then I don't have that problem.To the water spilling out after filling the pitcher when moving it, I do have that problem if I overfill. As long as I don't overfill and do a dance on the way to the fridge, I'm OK. Even if it does overflow a bit, it's a simple matter of wiping up a little water from the shelf in the fridge. Helps keep the shelf clean that way. ;-)Anyway. Not much more to say about it. It's a water filtration pitcher, and it does a fine job. No complaints from me, and I've been using it for almost a year now.I do love the digital reminder to change the filter. I am one of "those people" that don't track when I put the filter in, so if it weren't for that it would be wayyy too long between filter changes. Yay for technology.
