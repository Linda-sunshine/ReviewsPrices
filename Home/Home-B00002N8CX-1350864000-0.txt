review/summary: made for bare floors, ok for carpetsreview/text: I bought this because I have bare floors with just a few scatter rugs. It works great on the floors, and is easy to move around, with a very long cord. I would only rate it as adequate on rugs - it works fairy well on low pile, but not well on high piles, and has a very hard time getting cat hair up. The pieces of tube that make up the nozzle have a nasty tendency to separate, and so I have duct-taped them together.Pros: long cord, great on bare floors, light and easy to manouverCons: ability to handle cat hair, deep-piled carpets, tubes don't stay together
