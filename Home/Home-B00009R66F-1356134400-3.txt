review/summary: Dirt from the depths of my carpet was uncovered and sucked up...carpets look great!!!review/text: I have two labs and one of their puppies (I had a litter of 9 puppies so you can see what I was working with)...Anyway, I previously had two pet carpet cleaners (pet model from another manuafacturer: begins with a &#34;B&#34; and ends with an &#34;L&#34;) which I thought were nice carpet cleaners for the price. HOWEVER...I got the Hoover and it puts the other brand to shame. Although the Hoover is a little heavy and somewhat bulkier/awkward, the sucking and cleaning power is much more than the other brand. The turning brushes and the Clean Surge that puts some extra cleaning solution where you really need it (on demand) have done an amazing job on the ancient berber carpeting throughout my house. I rent, my landlord is elderly and lives out of state...so the carpet in my house is about as old as he is (LOL). Needless to say...the Hoover cleaner did an amazing job sucking up the dirt and making my carpets look nice (despite their age). This was an awesome deal from Amazon (lightning deals), and I would recommend the product over many others.
