review/summary: I Enjoyed Thisreview/text: Someone gave me this book after I told them how much I loved 'The Hunger Games.' It was an interesting read. It had hints of 'Brave New World,' and this not so perfect, 'perfect' community. It was definitely better than 'The Uglies,' which is also a YA sort of dark, future society. Out of this genre I would have to say that 'Hunger Games' and 'Logans Run' are my favorite, but 'The Giver' gave an interesting take on it, even if it was a little depressing. I would say this is probably a better message for kids to read than THG, though, not quite as much fun.
