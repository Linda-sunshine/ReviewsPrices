review/summary: Love this!review/text: I actually purchased this for my husband because he was ruining my metal bowl making his popcorn the Alton Brown way over the stove. The Whirley-pop makes perfect popcorn every time and only takes a few minutes. We use grapeseed oil and whatever popcorn is in the bulk bin at our local natural food store. The instructions say to simply wipe the pan out with a paper towel when you are done but I have occasionally washed it and then reseasoned it by wiping it down with some more grapeseed oil.
