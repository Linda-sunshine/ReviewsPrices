review/summary: Replaced our old glass carafe Cuisinartreview/text: Our old faithful glass carafe style Cuisinart finally sprung a leak and had to be decommissioned (think we've had it at least 7 or 8 years now?). We started searching for a newer style model and came across this thermal. The big question we had was how good would the thermal carafe be? Well, let me put it this way. Unbelievable. We program our coffee pot to turn on at 4:40a so it is ready by 5 (this one brews a bit quicker than the one we replaced but old habits die hard so we stuck with 4:40a). At 1pm I can pour the last cup of coffee and it still has steam rising from it. Our old glass model just could not compete with this. It would automatically turn off after 4 hours which meant that by 10am it was cold coffee or brew another pot. So I'm completely pleased with this purchase.I will agree that getting the lid on right requires paying attention to.Then placing the carafe in and making sure everything is lined up requires additional attention. But so did the glass-style one we had. There have been times we've woken up to a flood of coffee all over the place because I wasn't careful enough.And make sure you use brown paper filters (#4) if you're watching your LDL levels. As part of the research on this I came across the LDL component and using the gold metal filters we had in the old unit. No more. Back to paper.
