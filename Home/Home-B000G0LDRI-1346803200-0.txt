review/summary: it works just fine!!review/text: I brought this product for my gf. She had a lot of problem with regards to humidity where she stays.1) I personally think it is not noisy (she also thinks the same), the sound you hear is more like a fan.2) The water lasts for a day and few more hours and I dont think it is too much so an issue or big deal to change it. I mean you need water to humidify dont you?3) We start feeling the change hours after using it - you can feel the change in the atmosphere, I did not buy any gauge or something like that to notice the change in humidity level but we are quite confident that it brought change (there were some body reaction my gf was getting because of less humidity which started healing days after we started using it)It is little expensive but I thI personally think ink it is really worth if you have big apartment (it says it covers 2000 sq feet) ours is much lesser but we are planning to move to big apt soon so I thought i better get this one.
