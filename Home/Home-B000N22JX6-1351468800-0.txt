review/summary: Love at 1st heat!!review/text: We just got this heater as early xmas gift. We wanted this heater because it's cute & because of all the good reviews. Only had it a day but we can say it fills our needs & seems to work as stated. Very low odor, very quiet, & very warm. We live in an old-1920-drafty house & don't have ca/h. We need something to warm room quickly, this heater did. We have pets almost as old as house & the quietness of this heater along with lack of bright glow some heaters emit, doesn't scare them. We have 11 ft ceilings, fan hung & in reverse, & this little cutie is keeping us nice & warm. And we love the fact that it has remote control--not only are we cold, we are spoiled!! We will definitely buy this again!
