review/summary: Amzaing!!review/text: I don't know how I managed without this kitchen appliance. It does everything it says it does and more. I love the color I selected but there are dozens of others....can't imagine not being able to find one to coordinate with any kitchen decor. The one thing I do not like is the weight. It is very difficult for me to lift the mixer out of the cabinet but too large to have it on the counter at all times. I would not suggest storing it in a cabinet above the counter....under counter storage is best. But....it is a work-horse and I do enjoy using it.
