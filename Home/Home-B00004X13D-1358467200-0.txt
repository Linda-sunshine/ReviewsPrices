review/summary: Good deep waffles!review/text: Got for a gift for someone... who has made a waffle almost every night since it was opened! It's a simple, inexpensive machine. Nothing fancy... but it does give you that deep restaurant style that most waffle makers don't. That's why I got it, and I was very pleased with how it turned out. Easy to clean too... can't remove the plates, but really... you don't need to do that anyway. Just wipe down when you are done and it's good to go!
