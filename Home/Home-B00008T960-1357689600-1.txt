review/summary: Nothing sticks!review/text: This thing is great for any items that you don't want to stick. Seriously, you can burn cheese on this thing and it'll peel right off.The only complaint I have is that after a couple of years, the edges on it have started to flake a little but, and I keep having to trim it to prevent any of the fiberglass weave from breaking off into food.I'm pretty careful with it, making sure to only roll it or lay it flat, it's never been creased or folded - but it is starting to show signs of wear. I guess they're not that expensive so I should probably just replace it, but it's got so many good memories!A great addition to any cook at any level. You don't know what you're missing!
