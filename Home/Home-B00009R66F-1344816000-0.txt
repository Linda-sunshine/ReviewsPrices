review/summary: Great little machine!review/text: So I purchased this about two months ago, I have two pets and no matter how clean you keep your house you always have a pet smell. I have used this every weekend on the heavy duty areas and spot cleaning. This machine has paid for itself. I love it, and don't know how I have lived without it. It is a little confusing the first time, but by the second time you are able to quickly add the water, and empty out the dirty tank.Here's my review of the machinePros:1)The machine tells you when its full, by making a different noise which is distinguishable.2)Machine does well in getting spots out of the carpet. After two sweeps, my used apartment carpets look nice again!3)I'm able to hit an area with extra soap with a simple press of a button.4)It's light for me, but after messing around with rug doctors I guess anything would. It travels easily and has been used by a couple of friends for their house. They loved it.5)It dries in a couple of hours. Easily. Great thing when you have pets and people who want to tread across rooms that have been cleaned.6)The upholstery tools work great, and have done wonders on my shabby couch. :)Cons:1)In order to empty the dirty tank, I found that you have to tilt the handle back to get the tank out. It's easy to remove after you open the locks. Anyone else have this issue or am I missing something?2)It doesn't have a heater, so I advise using the hottest water possible, not a breaking point but just something to note.3) After emptying the dirty water, you have to make sure the tank is on properly by pressing down on both sides with some good pressure. Otherwise it just puts water down and doesn't have any suction.All in all its a decent machine. Yes, I could have gotten one that was more expensive, and with more features but this one suits my needs. I love it.
