review/summary: Great Dutch Ovenreview/text: We needed a 5 quart Dutch Oven but were not prepared to pay the price of the most popular model. A search of the Internet plus the reviews in Amazon lead us to the Lodge Pre-Seasoned model. Although the unit is sold as &#34;pre-seasoned&#34;, we still went ahead and followed pre-seasoning procedures. We have used the unit twice and couldn't be happier with our choice.
