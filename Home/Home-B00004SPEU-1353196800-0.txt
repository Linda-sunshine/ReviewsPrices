review/summary: Five star performance and qualityreview/text: I have this Krups for over 10 years and use it every day to grind coffee. Occasionally I use it to gind dried seeds and seasonings. Works like a charm every time and well worth the money. One of the most reliable appliances I ever owned. Highly recommend Krups.
