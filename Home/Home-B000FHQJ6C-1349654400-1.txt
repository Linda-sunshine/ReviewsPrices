review/summary: love itreview/text: I love this juicer! I use it to make tomatoe juice with my garden tomatoes. I did peppers, onions, celery, carrots and of course tomatoes. It did great for what I needed it to do. I don't make juice otherwise. So it was fine for me. I would not be afraid to make apple juice either.
