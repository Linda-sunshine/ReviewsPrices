review/summary: AWESOME PRODUCT!!!review/text: There's nothing I can say except it works like a charm. Very powerful, and practically get anything and everything. My cat sheds like crazy and his fur stays on my couch like a magnetic but thanks to this vacuum I don't have to spend hours cleaning the couch. It sucks up all the fur and when you go to dump it the fur is form in a nicely for circle which means no fur flying in your face and going every where. I also cleans the pieces of rugs I have going up my step.This is a five star product!!!!
