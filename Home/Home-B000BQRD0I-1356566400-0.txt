review/summary: Amazing!review/text: I had previously purchased a more expensive steamer from another company and it didn't hold up very well. This smaller, less expensive steamer is a gem. It is lightweight, heats up very quickly and does a great job at getting out wrinkles. What more could you ask for? Since I abhor ironing, this little guy has been a blessing!
