review/summary: Just about perfectreview/text: First of all, this 3 cup size stands for 3 espresso cups (just in case someone out there does not know this), so, technically, it's enough coffee to fill up one smallish mug. I guess it sort of slipped my mind but I actually like the smaller size. I've been using Ikea Radig 6 cup espresso maker, and I always had leftover coffee that was left unused. What I like about Bialetti is that it's very easy to tell when the coffee is done - as soon as it boils, you just know. With Radig, I got my coffee burned several times as it just kept making the boiling noise. I also like how light and easy to clean this one is. Overall, I'm very happy with this size and the quality of brew!
