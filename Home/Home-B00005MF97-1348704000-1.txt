review/summary: Very good investment!review/text: I was looking through old amazon orders for an address and I saw this and knew I had to review it! I have been using this product since 2009 and its amazing. It has two settings, high and low, and the bottom doubles as a lid if you want to store whatever you chop. This makes chopping onions, carrots, almonds, you name it, so easy! I recommend it to everyone and it saves so much time when you are making soups, etc. Looking back, I am surprised how little I paid for this. Definitely a good buy!
