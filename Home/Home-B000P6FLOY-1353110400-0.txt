review/summary: Piece of junkreview/text: Plain and simple - this thing can't handle home brewing. Before I went to ferment, the temperature was stuck at 117 degrees for a loooong time - even when the wort was clearly much, much cooler than that - and I confirmed it with another thermometer I borrowed from someone. By the way - this was only after 1 session. I am extremely careful with my equipment. Many people seem to have a heavy hand with the thermapen for long periods of time with no problem. Not only did I waste my money, but my time of having to take an extra step to not kill the yeast due to an inaccurate wort reading. Look somewhere else.
