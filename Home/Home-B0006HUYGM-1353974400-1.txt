review/summary: So glad I got itreview/text: I love this vacuum. It's incredibly powerful for its size and easily vacuums my 6x4 foot rug several times over (and it's usually very messy, as I have a dog and a kid). The filter is easy to clean (you can wash it when it gets too grimy). I'm really happy with it.
