review/summary: I sent it backreview/text: It takes longer than ironing, removes fewer wrinkles than ironing, and in some cases even adds wrinkles - by spraying water droplets instead of steam in random places, then the fabric puckers around the water droplet and I have to iron it to remove the pucker.(And yes...I filled it below the max fill line and made sure I was holding it completely upright - it still sprayed water.)So I sent this back and went back to my iron... ironing wasn't that bad, really.
