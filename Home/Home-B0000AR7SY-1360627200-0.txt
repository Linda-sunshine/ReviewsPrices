review/summary: Don't be cheap on a Coffee Grinderreview/text: I bought this coffee grinder as a replacement for a Capresso Coffee Burr Grinder559.04. This grinder is reviewed elsewhere and received 1 * (see my review.)From the moment I took the new grinder out of the box I knew I had a well made product. I loaded it with coffee beans have been using it every morning since with absolutely no problems. When I receive my $200 Brazen 8 Cup coffee maker I will be able to start claiming to be a connoisseur (spelled s n o b) (clearly more money than good sense.)I would make only 1 suggestion as an improvement is to redesign the the hopper to allow removal without having to remove the beans first. then include 2 hoppers with the grinder to allow quick change to another type of coffee bean.
