review/summary: Opener works everytimereview/text: Great wine bottle opener. Does not break any corks or push corks into the bottle. Simply hold the button down until the motor stops running, then hold the up button until the cork drops out. Can't get any easier.Have been using this opener for over nine months and haven't had any issues. The battery life is great. We have only recharged the opener once after the initial charge, and it isn't due to lack of use. We have been using this opener at least once a week, some weeks maybe 3-4 times.Don't buy this item for the chiller, it is only a cheap piece of metal. Requires ice to chill bottles. The chiller is nothing special.The opener is special. If you drink wine, do yourself a favor and buy this opener. If you know someone that drinks wine, this is a great gift. I have already given out three as gifts. Around Christmas time I was able to get this chiller from Amazon for $15 but I would still buy it at $25.
