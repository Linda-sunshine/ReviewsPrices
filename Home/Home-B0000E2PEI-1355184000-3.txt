review/summary: Defective Item..review/text: After reading about 90% BAD reviews and 10% good ones, I STILL decided to buy this scale. Stupid me.The only thing that was fantastic about this purchase is that it arrived here in two days! Super fast. However as for the item itself... first of all the package seal was broken. So that was a good way to start.. Then this scale is crazy! It's all over the place. I literally stepped on it 5 separate times and each time it would give me something COMPLETELY different! I know I weigh around 145-150. So when I stepped on it for the first time and it gave me 120.5 I knew something was wrong. Stepped on it again, 152 (more believable). Stepped on it again, 135. Stepped on it again, 148.I'm returning this item as I'm writing this review. If I was you, I would chose a little bit more expensive scale so it can actually WORK.
