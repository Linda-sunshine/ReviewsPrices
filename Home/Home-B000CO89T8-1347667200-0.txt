review/summary: Works as well as can be expected for the pricereview/text: The Mr. Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmer does a fairly good job of keeping a HOT mug warm. Don't expect it to adequately warm a cold one. I found it works best on mugs 3" or less in height and 3.5" or less in diameter with no irregularities in the base. (won't rock on a flat surface). I don't like my coffee all that hot so the product is adequate for my 4"-5" tall mugs as well. Obviously, the product isn't intended for styrofoam or plastic cups that aren't high temperature rated.As a point of reference, the product's 17 watt heating element will keep my favorite 4" tall 3.2" wide ceramic Yellowstone mug at 123 degrees when half full and 4 degrees lower when topped off.I would have given the product 5 stars if the on / off switch were easier to use and the heating element surface didn't scratch so easily.
