review/summary: Favorite winter gift...review/text: I love this "teapot"! I had a few tins of loose leaf tea and never really liked the tea ball. This was the perfect solution - add tea to the teapot, heat water and put it in the teapot to steep while getting ready. The end result is a perfect cup of tea with no mess. The pot is easy to clean and leave for the next I must admit, I have forgotten a few times and lifted the lid to "pour" the tea, which leads to tea leaves going into the cup. Overall this is one of my favorite purchases in a long time. So much so I bought one for my daughter for Christmas!
