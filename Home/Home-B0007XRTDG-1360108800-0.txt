review/summary: Great for a large family.review/text: I bought this to replace my flat skillet because this one had a lid and could stop the bacon grease from splattering. I used it for my fried chidken and it was great!!!! It holds the whole dinner instead of my using two frying pans on the stove and making two rounds each. This holds them all and cooks evenly unlike the frying pans that I usually stuff to the sides. Great item.
