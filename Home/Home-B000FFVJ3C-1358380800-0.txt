review/summary: Useless Dehydratorreview/text: I purchased this appliance for my son and his wife for Christmas 2011 and unfortunately they never got around to using it for a full year. Now after the very first use it just stopped working in the middle of making their jerky. The warranty is up unfortunately. I checked many of the reviews on this particular item before purchasing and they all seemed pretty good. My advice is to not buy this dehydrator. If you do, use it immediately as much as you can so you can return it during the warranty period if it fails on you. Of course there is always the inconvenience of mailing things back. My recommendation is to purchase appliances locally.
