review/summary: Great for onions and garlic!!!review/text: I just got this food chopper and I love it! It chops garlic and onion and shallots so easily! One thing I didn't expect is that it chops harder stuff better than softer stuff (i.e. it kind of struggled with chopping a red pepper...it just made kind of a puree and that wasn't really what i wanted.) so it might be better for harder vegetables than softer things. Definitely a good purchase.
