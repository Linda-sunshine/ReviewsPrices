review/summary: Have two of them.review/text: I own two tempo widepaths and I use them every week. The older one (2008) has a headlight and is much sturdier. The newer one (2010) does not, is made of cheaper plastic, and the cover falls off periodically and I have to snap it back on. They're ugly. But frankly, who cares? I can't believe how well they clean for the price, and they're easy to maintain.
