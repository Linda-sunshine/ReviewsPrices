review/summary: Not a Bad Chair For The Moneyreview/text: I needed a new office chair because of a back injury and subsequent surgery. I researched a lot of chairs here on Amazon.com, and in the OfficeMax, Staples and Office Depot stores. Because I've broken my back and had a failed back fusion surgery I need a really decent chair to get through 8 hours of working at the computer every day. I tried all the ones at the local office supply places and couldn't find one at a reasonable cost that allowed me to sit comfortable for a few minutes, much less all day. Based on the price and reviews for this Lorell chair, I bought the first chair I ever have without trying it first and so far I'm not disappointed. The chair arrived literally the following day from a location in St. Paul so that was quite a surprise! It was easy to assemble and seems fairly sturdy. The base and wheels are heavy duty plastic but the actual chair base, arm rests and chair back base (the back is mesh) are sturdy metal. You'll only need a Phillips screwdriver to attach the plastic cover to the back of the chair and the included hex wrench to attach the chair back to the base. Very easy and sturdy. I'm, 6'4", 255# with longer legs and it gives me plenty of leg support with the seat depth more than adequate. I would definitely recommend this chair to others and though a metal base and wheels would be more durable it would be more expensive.
