review/summary: Absolute Monsterreview/text: This juicer has no equal. You can spend way more for a juicer & not achieve the quality of this one. I have used mine for several years & it shows no signs of wear at all. It doesn't leak whatsoever, unlike the cheaper juicers on the market.Sure, it costs a little more, but you get what you pay for.I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a quality juicer.
