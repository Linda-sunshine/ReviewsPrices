review/summary: Explosionsreview/text: This worked well for about two weeks, but since then the eggs explode. I mean REALLY explode! I can't figure out how to stop it. It's a pain to clean up, because the entire egg disintegrates. I suggest the egg genie. I have that one at work and it makes perfects eggs with no explosions.
