review/summary: love itreview/text: I was looking for a replacement because the vacuum cleaner I had now did not erase the hairs on the carpet that well. And I saw this little machine with really high reviews. I was a bit hesitated buying this at first because I didn't believe such small machine is powerful enough. But I was wrong. It cleans the hair on the carpet really well, a lot better than the standing vacuum I have. It's light and portable. It can reach any corner you want very easily. The two-directions head is a neat design. I already recommended it to my friend and I'm going to buy one more for my family.
