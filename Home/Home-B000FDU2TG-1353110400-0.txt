review/summary: Awesome for smoothies/shakesreview/text: I bought this from a b&m store for $20 less than advertised here, after my friend recommended it to me. I wanted a strong blender to make fruit and vegetable smoothies. This does a great job. It is very strong. I love how the jar part is one piece. No more screwing and unscrewing the blade and rubber gasket. It is very easy to clean and use. To clean the manual suggests water and a few drops of dish soap, then turning the blender on. I have been using that method and its very quick and gets it very clean. My smoothies have frozen fruit or ice, plus milk or almond milk, and fruits and veggies. I love how when I turn it on, it has a gentle turn on, and then gets going. It is quite loud though. Thats why I took off 1 star. I try to do it when my toddler isnt in the room, again, bc its so loud. Our dog is also scared of the sound LOL. If you can tolerate the loudness, this is a great blender!
