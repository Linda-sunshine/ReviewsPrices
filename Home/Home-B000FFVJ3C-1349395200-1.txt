review/summary: Broke after 15 months, nesco would not replacereview/text: Poor quality combined with inflexible customer service. It worked like a dream for a while then broke. The warranty is 1 year, but given I didn't us it much, essentially it broke after about a dozen uses. When I called nesco they were unwilling to extend the warranty and wanted $35 to repair it. I'd rather replace it with another brand than give them more business.
