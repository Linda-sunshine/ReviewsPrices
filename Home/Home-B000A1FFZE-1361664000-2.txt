review/summary: Don't waste your moneyreview/text: I thought this was a good design idea. But it is terrible on several counts. 1) Small pieces of toast and bagels fall through the sides of the toasting grid and fall down into the "oven" cavity. The side wires of the toast holder mechanism are spaced too far apart to securely hold less than a full-size piece of bread. 2) The OVEN feature requires that you stand there and watch your food. If you don't, the food will burn. This happens regardless of the temperature setting on the oven. In fact, the space between the food rack and the baking elements is so short that almost all food burns before the inside is warm. 3) The outsides of the unit heat up and can cause bodily burns or melt things that might be next to it on the counter. 4) Normal, full-size pieces of bread are too tall to fit in the toast holder; this means you have to toast your bread slice once and then turn it upside-down to toast the rest of it. Depending on the size of the slice, you will have uneven toasting. 5) It is poorly constructed: the oven rack does not remain locked into the clips on the door, meaning that the rack holding your food does not slide out when you open the oven door.And consider the source: in case you are concerned about the source of this product, it is made in China.I received this as a gift, and I am sad that money was wasted on buying this. Now I tell everyone I can not to get this item.
