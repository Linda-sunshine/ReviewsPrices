review/summary: Great water filtrationreview/text: Great water filtration and I do not find the water flow to be slow. I was impressed by the speed and the way it cleans the water. I also like how I can easily switch from filtered to regular tap water. To save money, I signed up for the Amazon Subscribe and Save which automatically sends me a refill every 2 months. This filter has truly saved me money and energy by not having to purchase multi-packs of bottled water and having to lug them home. Highly recommend!
