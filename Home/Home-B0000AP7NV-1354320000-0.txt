review/summary: Great Filter and Perfect Sizereview/text: I have a 10cuft fridge so space is always a challenge when I have too much stuff. This pitcher is the perfect size to fit on the door's shelf so that I can keep the main shelves' space for food and other things. It's nice because it is the perfect size, but at the same time one large glass of water can sometimes mean I have to refill it quite often; however, if it were larger it would defeat the point of trying to save space to fit in my fridge. Based on my space needs I feel it is perfect, but based on the amount of water I drink refilling it often can be a little annoying. It's a catch 22 because a bigger pitcher wouldn't fit well. I would suggest that anyone who doesn't drink a lot of water or who needs to save some fridge space should buy this product.Overall, it's a great product. I would buy this again.
