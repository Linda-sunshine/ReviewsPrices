review/summary: Makes fine coffee, programmablereview/text: I have to admit I cannot read the lcd time window without my glasses because it is too dim, so if I want to use the programmable feature I have to be careful that I have not inadvertently hit a button that has changed the time. That is pretty easy to do. No problem with the coffee-making, and I like being able to program it...just be careful because one tap on a button when you move the coffee maker and you may change the time...and it is kind of hard to read.
