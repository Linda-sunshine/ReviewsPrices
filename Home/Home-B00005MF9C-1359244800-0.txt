review/summary: Exactly What I Needreview/text: For years we have used a small 4 cup drip coffee maker to make individual mugs of coffee. We had been tempted to buy a single serve but didn't want to get trapped into buying special cups or pods. This coffee maker is perfect for our needs.Basically, it's a drip coffee maker that makes one mug at a time, directly into the mug, with regular ground coffee and without a hotplate. It comes with a reusable filter basket, but you can use #1 cone filters if you like, and then toss them away. Almost any mug or cup will also work, not just the one that came with the maker. Finally, the price makes it a great value.
