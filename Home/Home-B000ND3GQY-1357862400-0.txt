review/summary: my everything panreview/text: I purchased this pan on line not knowing what I was really getting, I had second thoughts, Was it going to be too thin and poorly made? Too tell you the truth i was very surprise when i open the box. you see i am in a wheelchair and i do a lot of cooking, i love to cook. The pan is perfect ,it is well made, with stay cool handles which is a great help for me, I love it, most of all i love the price. If you are looking for a family size pan this is the one, I totally recommend it.
