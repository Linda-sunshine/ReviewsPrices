review/summary: Worth the price.review/text: I've been using an old-fashioned ice and salt ice cream maker with an electric motor (not hand cranked!) for 10 years. While the ice cream from the ice and salt machine is by far the best (truly), it is a hassle to buy a bag of ice every time I want to make ice cream, and that machine IS loud.Before buying the Cuisinart Pure Indulgence, I read the reviews, and I was worried that the machine would be loud. It isn't. I know loud, this is not loud. And better yet, the ice cream is excellent.I have had ice cream made with other similar machines and made with the Kitchenaid stand-mixer version. Unlike those machines, the canister really does get cold enough and the ice cream really does freeze up well.This machine is certainly more expensive, but it really is worth the money. The ice cream is delicious, and since the machine makes 2 quarts, you will have plenty to indulge in.
