review/summary: Sparks fly--bad designreview/text: Cons:1. No on/off switch (seriously?)2. When you unplug the unit the socket sparks a TON3. Airstream is blowing up, so the kernals go everywhere.4. Lots of unpopped kernals5. You should only pour in a very small amount of kernals or else you'll have a mess.I used this popper 1 time and plan on taking it back. I've read several other reviews saying the motor catches fire and I'm not taking that risk. My mother has an air-popper from her college graduation that is holding steady and works perfectly and is safe. I guess they don't make them like they used to...
