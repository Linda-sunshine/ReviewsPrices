review/summary: So far a great kettle for the price!review/text: I purchased this kettle as a replacement for our electric kettle that became old and did not function any longer. We have this one now for about a month the Aroma AWK-115S and I must say it has been working great! No leaks thus far and the switch is working fine. It takes about three minutes to boil when full. I do notice that it does let you know that it is working, which I don't find annoying but it is a little noisy. It is almost a carbon copy of the one we had and I like the feature that lets you lift it off of the power base and serve. Be careful with it, don't drop or crash it into somthing and it should last a long time. I think this is value for the low price. Hope you give it a try.
