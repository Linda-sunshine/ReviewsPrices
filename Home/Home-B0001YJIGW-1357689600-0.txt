review/summary: Now I can actually enjoy a bath instead of wishing the water would stop draining outreview/text: Not much to say about this thing except that it's amazing. I had always thought how nice it would be if I could cover up that annoying drain hole and take an actual bath. Lo and behold, such a product exists on Amazon to do just that.There's a drain hole on this as well, but you can angle it wherever you'd like and pretty much fill the tub to the brim. Still, it won't let you overflow the bath. Easy to attach (just get the suction cups wet and stick it on) and easy to remove.
