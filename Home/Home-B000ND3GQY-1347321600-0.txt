review/summary: Not for Induction cooktopsreview/text: I wish I had more carefully read the small print for this pan. I missed the part about the encapsulated aluminum in the base of the pan. It would not heat on our induction cooktop which requires pans to be cast iron or stainless steel only. I think it would be great for other cooktops. Cost me the shipping to return the item.
