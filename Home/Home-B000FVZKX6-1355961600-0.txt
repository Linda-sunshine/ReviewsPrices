review/summary: Sleeping on a CLOUD!review/text: These are the best sheets I've ever owned. I gave it a solid 2 weeks before writing a review. I've washed these only once, but the brown color is still deep as ever! I noticed the water in the washing machine was quite brown, so I would not wash these with anything else that would absorb the color, at least on the first wash. I also have a pretty thick mattress and these sheets fit great.These sheets are a bit thicker than most, which is good for the bitter Midwest winters, but I'm not sure I would use these in the summer months - but that's fine! I'd recommend these to anyone in a heart beat, especially for the price. I also bought the extra set of pillow shams, since this only comes with two.
