review/summary: disappointedreview/text: After reading the good reviews for this waffle maker I added it to my amazon wishlist and received it as a Christmas gift.We are SO disappointed with this waffle maker. The waffles aren't crisp. They come out more like tall pancakes with squares in them.In addition, the waffles tend to stick to the waffle maker and it's hard to get that stuff out of there.We aren't nearly as happy with this waffle maker as we were with our Presto 03510 FlipSide Belgian Waffle Maker. That thing made the crispiest waffles ever. Since it stopped working after 2 years I thought I'd try something else hoping it would last longer. It might last longer but the waffles aren't very waffly.I'm thinking of buying the Presto again because I miss those crispy waffles...
