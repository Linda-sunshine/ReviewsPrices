review/summary: Great!review/text: I really like my Hamilton Beach Toastation. It is just the right size and so easy to use. I love the feature of a toaster that pops up and then the convenience of converting it to a oven. Controlling the temperature of the oven and type of toast you desire are obtainable and reliable Not every toaster oven makes good toast, this one does. It is easy to use and the results are great. As always, I purchased it from Amazon stress free.
