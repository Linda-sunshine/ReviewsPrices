review/summary: Am glad I chose this coffee makerreview/text: I purchased this coffee maker for our beach condo, which we rent out all summer, in an effort to make the kitchen look a little more upscale. We had been using Mr.Coffee style machines before, which worked out fine, but it was time for a change. Also, in addition to style, we were hoping for more durability. (Somehow, we get the idea that our renting guests aren't that picky about their coffee, as long as it gets made).Anyhow, I really like this coffee maker! This rental "investment" has turned out to be a treat for me, off season. Its features may seem overkill, but I enjoy the 1-4 cup setting and use it often. Also I've found the temp-adjustable warming plate to be useful. Higher temp for me, when coffee is to be quickly consumed, or for people who use milk or cream. Lower temp for when I'm drinking it black but want it to last for a while on the burner. And there are medium range temperatures, controlled by the graduated knob.This machine does indeed make good coffee. Since my husband "quit" coffee, we no longer have high-end, daily ground beans. I've been using Starbucks Blonde pre-ground. (I know, but I like it just fine).The few downsides of this coffee maker, but not deal breakers are (1) you pretty much have to add the water by measuring it in the carafe and then pouring it into the machine, unless you are brewing 10-12 cups (the measuring lines have to be read from the top, and you can only see the top ones easily). Also (2), the coffee maker is tall, so I have to pull it out from under the cabinet to pour in the water. Lastly (3) the black chrome finish I purchased needs to be wiped down often with glass cleaner to keep its finish looking nice. Again, these issues are not deal breakers for me, and I am happy with the purchase.Oh, and something about this coffee maker makes me think it looks like Darth Vader on the kitchen cabinet. Now there's an unexpected bonus!
