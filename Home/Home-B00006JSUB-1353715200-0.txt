review/summary: Love it!!review/text: I bought this so that I had a way to make good steaks at home since I don't have a grill at my current place. It has been wonderful. From oven to stove top and then back, without any worries. It fits two decent sized steaks without much of a problem. The only thing I would say is if you buy one and plan on doing high heat, make sure that you have the proper oven mitts to withstand high temps. Absolutely love the pan and I think everyone should have a cast iron in their kitchen arsenal. This is an affordable option.
