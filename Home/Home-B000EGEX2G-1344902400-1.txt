review/summary: Good but not the bestreview/text: So we have this for more than 5 months. It's very comfortable and I can easy remove any stains. We got it in beige/black so I was worry but I can remove anything just with clean water. I gave it 3 stars only because the first time I seat on it one of the springs that you seat on broke!! Since I had a newborn I didn't have time to call and get replacement. As of few days ago it's not only making crazy noises the broken spring is blocking something that doesn't allow me to swing in it. I called to Amazon today and we are getting a replacement. So be aware that it might brake very easily. Other than that very comfy chair
