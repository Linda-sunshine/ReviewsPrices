review/summary: Terriblereview/text: I purchased two of these units for my RV. Unfortunately, they accomplish almost nothing at all! After running them for several hours they removed less than an ounce each of water. Not very impressive as my RV windows are fogged up and dripping with water.When I plugged them in, I initially thought they were broken. After waiting all day for them to do something I came to the conclusion that they are broken. Save your money, these are a complete waste.
