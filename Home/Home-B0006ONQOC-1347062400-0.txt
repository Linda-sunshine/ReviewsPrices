review/summary: Great Machinereview/text: The Cuisinart ICE-30BC performs exactly as described in the instructions. The keys are having the freezer bowl completely frozen (it takes at least 24 hours) and having the ice cream mix at 40 degrees or below before you start. If you follow these instructiions, freezing of your ice cream mix takes 25-30 minutes. The machine is NOT as loud as some of the reviews indicate.
