review/summary: Good value for the money with reservationreview/text: Not a bad machine for the amount of money spent. This is the scaled down version of the commercial type called "Sanitaire SC3680-SC3699 Series". The only notable difference is the wall thickness of the flexible hose and reinforcement collars at both ends. However not as good as the original Mighty Mite that was made in USA by Eureka. The original had a round rubber flap just inside the hose attachment hole that closed when the hose was detached. This prevented dirt from fallout out when you tilt the machine down while wrapping the cord around the body. Another huge drawback, the old original model had a push and turn hose connection that locked into place with a snap and was air-tight. The current models just have a couple of expanding ears that snap into groves and consequently, the hose connection flops around and has a lot of air leakage. Be aware the same holds true for the rear connection blower port. There is a lot of air leakage from the wheel shaft and around the snap-on connection and therefore, the blowing ability is a total failure. Not suitable for blowing out a computer or anything else. If you need this machine to double as a blower, you will be grossly disappointed.
