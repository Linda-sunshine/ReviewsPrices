review/summary: No on/off switch and have to pop the max amount.review/text: First thing I noticed after pulling the poplite out of the box is that there is no On/Off switch.The only way to turn it on and off is by plugging it in and pulling the plug out.The instructions tell you not to overfill. However, there is no mention of under-filling! I found out the hard way. On my first try, I only put half the amount of corn needed to fill up to the fill line as I wanted to make just a little popped corn. Immediately the corn started bouncing around and flying out of the chute unpopped. I stopped the machine (had to pull the plug to do that - gripe number 1) and filled the corn up to the fill line. It seems the weight or quantity then keeps the unpopped corn from flying around and coming out of the chute unpopped.The popped corn was very good. Very few kernels remained unpopped.Since you cannot really pop less that the fill-line amount of kernels, without unpopped kernels flying out, you need quite a large container to hold the popped corn that will come out. Instructions indicate a 4-5 quart container and even says "you may have to add a second bowl during popping". On my first try I was picking up popcorn from the floor.
