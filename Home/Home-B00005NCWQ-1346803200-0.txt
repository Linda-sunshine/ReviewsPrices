review/summary: Look No Furtherreview/text: This is it! As hurricane Isaac approached, I was getting prepared (lived through Katrina without power for a week here in the Land Mass). Water, batteries, fans (battery operated), candles, flashlights,generator, fish cooker, gas, charcoal, you name it - we were going to be ready! My last thought, kinda late to say the least, was coffee....how am I gonna make coffee? Amazon to the rescue. This percolator and some batteries I had also ordered showed up the very day Isaac was coming ashore. And it's very nice looking, too! While we were spared from Isaac, I am content in knowing we have EVERYTHING we might need NEXT TIME. And there will be a next time, no doubt.
