review/summary: Food saver jar sealerreview/text: I've been eyeballing these things for a long while. Finally decided to get some since I've been trying to can some salsa and extra veggies. They get the job done, but can get messy on liquid items if you fill the jar to full. No exact science to it, seems more trial and error. But when it seals, the seal is good and keeps items fresher longer. This does not replace heat canning and most stuff still needs to be refrigerated still.
