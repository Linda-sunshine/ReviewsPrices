review/summary: Great for a mom that coffee goes cold before she can drink it!review/text: I love this Mug Warmer! It has saved my coffee many times and it comes in a beautiful shiny black color. I am a breastfeeding mom and are sometimes stuck sitting on my sofa with a baby. I would much rather sip my coffee than chug. This makes it so I don't wake my baby while standing to microwave my coffee! It doesn't make your drink scorching hot, so you are just gonna have to either drink your coffee faster or get up and heated up. A word of advice though, do not touch the burner because it is hot!
