review/summary: This would work better as an electric tea kettlereview/text: Received this today and am sorely disappointed. Tried it out on several shirts, most of them being of the &#34; easy iron&#34; variety with dismal results. Followed the directions and all the shirts look rumpled and anything but wrinkle free. I'm presuming all the positive reviews for this p.o.s are &#34; bought&#34; reviews. This is trash, do not waste your money! Returning ASAP.
