review/summary: This is a great value. 2 inch mattress topperreview/text: Love this mattress topper. It is not as high as some of the toppers. It is very comfortable and conforms nicely to your body. My hips do not drill into the mattress anymore. There is no smell after an initial short period when we left the mattress out on a porch to air out for less than a day. Seems to be a quality product and the price was very good. Shipping was free.
