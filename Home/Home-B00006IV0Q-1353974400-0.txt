review/summary: presto 12 cup stainlessm steel coffee makerreview/text: I really like this coffee pot as the last one we bought from Black & Decker were plastic and I could still smell the plastic after using vinegar and water to clean. I am very happy with this, What a good cup of coffee it makes and I don't have the plastic smell. This pot even has metal coffee filter.
