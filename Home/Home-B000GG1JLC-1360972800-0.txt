review/summary: Love the idea, but it keeps falling apart.review/text: This is great when it stays together. Our problem has been that every time it gets bumped, the bottom part that holds all the ties disconnects from the hook-- so everything ends up on the floor. I've been meaning to try slipping something in the bottom of the hook to see if spreading the two little prongs will help it stay together better.
