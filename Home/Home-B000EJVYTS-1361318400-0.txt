review/summary: Awesomereview/text: favorite item in my house right now - works like it says and I didn't have any problems yet....only a couple months in, but sensor is fineCloses after 4 seconds - regular bags fit - we'll see how long original batteries lastonly bad part is it sometimes opens when I walk by it because the garbage can faces a traffic area between kitchen and living spaceOverall, can't complain and we love the new garbage can
