review/summary: It's worksreview/text: It's noisy, not terribly, but noisy. Especially when compared to the Crane drop-shaped blue/white one. The plastic quality is definitely cheap. It's messy - every time you lift the top to refill, it's dripping with water. When set to very low level, it only makes noise and no humidity. You have to set the knob to at least fifth of the way to actually to get humidity. So why three stars? Because the animal shape looks good in a kids room. My daughter loves the elephant shape and it does the job of a humidifier, with all its flaws. If you dont care about the shape, I would simply get the Crane drop-shaped one, which is the best cool-mist humidifier.
