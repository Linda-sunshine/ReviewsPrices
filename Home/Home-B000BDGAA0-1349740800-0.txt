review/summary: Very hard and not comfortablereview/text: I do understand that the pillow will need to be firm for treatment of specific neck and spinal conditions. However this pillow is very hard and does not provide much opportunity to conform to ones preference. The description is correct that it holds it shape. It will most likely hold it shape since there is very little room to fluff the pillow. The product may be good for some but not for me.
