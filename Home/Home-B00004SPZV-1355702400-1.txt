review/summary: Been using this for months and it works great!review/text: I have put olive oil and canola oil in it and it works great.After a few months it starts to get clogged and sprays less misty and more in little drops. Just put the sprayer part into boiling water for a minute or so and it cleans right up and sprays more misty again.
