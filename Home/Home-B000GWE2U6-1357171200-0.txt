review/summary: Loud fan/motorreview/text: I purchased this unit 18 months ago when my baby was born, and it worked great up until a couple months ago. My (frog) humidifier has been making a loud humming noise (most likely from the fan), which prevents me from using it in my toddler's bedroom while she sleeps. I have tried cleaning it per the manual instructions, but it did not help (granted, I did not clean it with white vinegar the entire time I've been using it, and it's been used almost every day since she was born). Instructions recommend cleaning the unit weekly - oops! But I honestly think it has to do with the fan, because it sounds like the motor (or the fan belt?) is skipping, and it will occasionally "catch" itself and become quiet again. This loud noise would occur occasionally at first, maybe about every other day, so I would just keep the humidifier off that night and try it again the next day. But now it is permanent. I wrote an e-mail to the customer service dept. a week ago, but I have not heard back. I guess I'll have to buy a different unit.
