review/summary: Great Comalreview/text: The round griddle is great for homemade tortillas. The cast iron is smooth, pre-seasoned, and you do not have to oil it. When you hand wash the Comal you must dry it right away because you do not want it to rust, but if it does rust all you have to do it oil it down with a paper towel and you are back in business. Only put a small amount of oil for conditioning so it is not sloppy oily when you place it back on your shelf. I keep mine in a grocery store plastic bag so no dust or anything else sticks to it.
