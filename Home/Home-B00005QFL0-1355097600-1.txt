review/summary: Not worth the moneyreview/text: I purchased this product - actually TWO of this product - one for me and one for my daughter. We have had many breadmakers in the past - this one just isn't a good choice in our opinion. The display is hard to read, the instructions difficult to follow and it's just not user friendly at all. We returned them both and got the Zojirushi breadmaker instead - more money but definitely worth it! If you want an easy to use breadmaker with great options, this is probably not the one for you.
