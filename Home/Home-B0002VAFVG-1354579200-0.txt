review/summary: What a workhorsereview/text: This is an AMAZING machine. A many have stated, I too watched Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead. If you are an Amazon Prime member, you can wach it for free on Amazon instant video.* I started on a juice fast the next day...literally...I had my juicer overnighted to me. If you are an amazon prime membr, is is only $3.99!* I immediately went on a 30 day juice fast, and at first I was making 5-7 quarts a day. Each time I made the juice fresh (as in not in a big batch). 5 days later, I had 2 daughters join me in the fast, so then there were 3 people juicing, a lot, every day. The juicer has not failed me ONCE. I have only had it about...7 weeks? But in that time I have done 2 years worth of juicing, lol.My sister has went through 2 refurbished machines with really bad luck. She just got this one and I know she is going to love it.You can buy a less expensive juicer and save some money, but it will not last long and you will be shopping around to replace it. Save yourself time, and eventually money, and go for this juicer.I have not talked a lot about the product features because there is so much of this already posted. I just wanted to tell you about how hard it has worked for us, how easy it is to clean, and how wonderfully healthy and energized I feel, and this was the best investment in ME that I have made in a very, very long time. You deserve it!*I dont work for amazon nor am I involved in selling prime memberships, lol. It is a great offer and I get way more than my money's worth.
