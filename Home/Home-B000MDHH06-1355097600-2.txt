review/summary: Juicerreview/text: Not bad for the prize, I love juicing and cleaning it is not too much of a work for me. This product came brand new and the prize was very satisfying. I juice a lot of vegetable and fruits that the juicer container always overfilled and I'm learning how to use the right amount but I wish the container was bigger like the other Breville juicer. Overall good product.
