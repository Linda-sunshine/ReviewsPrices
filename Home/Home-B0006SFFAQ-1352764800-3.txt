review/summary: Another Failurereview/text: DCC-1200 - 1 pot of coffee a day (minus some vacation and out of time time) for about 18 months and then it died. Brought out my mothers old Wearever percolator and made coffee the 'old school' way.While I agree on some of the positive points, I found filling to be a bit of a challenge and the hot plate on low was quite hot.We thought we had found our coffee maker after 2 other brands were bought and failed only to find the same problem with the "highly rated" Cuisinart.I sent Cuisinart customer service an email yesterday (11/12/12) and I am awaiting a response. I suspect there are many more customers in queue ahead of me.I may purchase an old Braun from Ebay. That was a great coffee maker. Thanks... Bob
