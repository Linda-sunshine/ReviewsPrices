review/summary: The absolute BEST juicer you can buyreview/text: I am a hard person to impress. This juicer has to been one of the finest constructed pieces of machinery I have ever owned. It is a machine, not an appliance. The construction of every component in this thing wreaks of precision. There are no loose parts. No cheap materials. The stainless steel is a very heavy gauge so I am positive that I will have this baby for years to come. And it devours fruit and vegetables leaving only the juice in the pitcher. The leftover is literally colored sawdust. I have used this for 5 days roughly 3-5 times per day and I am thoroughly impressed with its results, ease of use, and ability to clean effectively. I estimate that I have juiced 100 pieces of fruit and vegetables this first week and its churning out the same results. To sum it up, if Mercedes Benz made a juicer, it would be just like this one.I recommend this juicer to everyone. Buy it.
