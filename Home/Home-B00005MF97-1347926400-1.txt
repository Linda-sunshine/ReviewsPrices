review/summary: easy to usereview/text: I have had this B&D for over one year. It is easy to use, easy to clean and does the job quickly. I would recommends unplugging it but I usually just blast the underside of the motor with hot water from the tap. This seems to be sufficient because the plastic material is very slick. Oh, it processes small amounts of food very well.
