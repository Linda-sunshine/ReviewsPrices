review/summary: Exactly what I wanted.review/text: After years of buying coffee at our food co-op and grinding it in the store, we moved to a place without 1) a co-op and 2) good coffee in grocery stores. Time to buy a grinder and bags of our favorite beans. We use a Bialetti mokka pot (fine grind) and a French press (coarse grind) in this house, so I wanted something that would provide the proper grind for each. After MUCH research on coffee grinders, I settled on the Infinity. It was slightly more than I wanted to pay, but I'm very glad I made this choice. It grinds quickly and not as loudly as I had anticipated. I give the receptacle a little tap after grinding and that takes care of static issues. I was expecting a big mess and have not encountered any mess apart from my own clumsiness when I empty the ground coffee into the Bialetti.The only negative experience I've had with this machine was in assembling it. I had some trouble getting the hopper to attach to the base correctly even though each part was lined up correctly. After a few tries, it went right on.All in all, this grinder was worth every penny. We love it and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a basic, reliable grinder.Pros: Perfect grind for our two different coffee making preferencesAttractive and doesn't take up a lot of spaceQuick, fairly quiet, minimal to no messEasy to use and keep cleanCons: Main hopper was a difficult to put on for some reason
