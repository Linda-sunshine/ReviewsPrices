review/summary: Great coffee makerreview/text: This coffeemaker is an excellent buy.It performs its ritual every day with no problems.If I had a con it might be that it could keep the coffee a bit hotter but then I use a thermal carafe .The beep when it finishes is very low and I do not see how it could bother anyone.This is an excellent buy, if you need a coffeemaker buy it, you should be pleased with your purchase.
