review/summary: Very Impressedreview/text: I have an elderly cat (105 in 'cat' years ) who regurgitates often on the carpet. I use a spray spot remover and Oxy Clean, but there are still noticeable spots on the carpet.We usually rent the Rug Doctor once a year and do the whole house. It's quite a pain loading it in the truck and dragging it around. It cleans well, but is heavy, cumbersome and loud. I got tired of the carpet looking the way it did and decided to get something I could use more often and wasn't such an ordeal to use.I read the reviews and watched a video on the Consumer Reports web site. I opted for the less expensive Steam Vac over the one designated for pets. They seemed to have all the same features but one comes with shampoo and pet stain wipes and costs more.I was intimidated in assembling it just because of the problems I'd read others had had. It really wasn't any big deal. I made sure I watched all the things that gave others problems with the machine.It comes with a small bottle of shampoo, too.It's not as loud as the Rug Doctor, but since I have Tinnitus, I wore ear plugs. It's much lighter and I had no trouble maneuvering it, and unlike the Rug Doctor, it functions while both pulling backward and pushing forward.I was impressed with the amount of dirt it collected and think it definitely did as well as the Rug Doctor and it leaves the carpet MUCH drier and that's a big plus.This is the first time I have used it and I shampooed the equivalent of 2 good sized rooms and I am very satisfied with the purchase.
