review/summary: easy cookreview/text: i love this i wanted one ever since i saw commercialsthis does a great job cooks fast and easycons :it does not cook wedges right they dont come out tasting so goodand its not that easy to get tray on and offand hard to clean out the bubble indents so i say cover with foil before placing food on the tray for easy clean up
