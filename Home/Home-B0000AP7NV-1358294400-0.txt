review/summary: Great for one person who drinks a lot of water!review/text: For the cost of this pitcher and the filters, I'd say this was a good deal. I didn't think I'd have to fill it so much but I do drink a lot of water. So far it works pretty good for just me. The only draw back is the height of the pitcher makes it a tight fit in the sink when refilling. Guess I could use a cup to transfer the water into it.
