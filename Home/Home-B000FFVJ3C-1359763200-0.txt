review/summary: Works great, but made where?review/text: My wife has been bitten by the dehydrating bug, and the 75-PR has been going pretty much non stop. Meanwhile, I'm biding my time to make jerky. I just ordered 2 additional trays, 2 screens, and a jerky shooter. Transaction with seller was non-problematic. I ordered, they delivered, and the product works well.So why not 5 stars? It's not made in the U.S.A. Sigh
