review/summary: Excellent service by Santech USA on KA Pro 600review/text: I have owned the KA Pro 600 for about a year and have been most satisfied with the mixer. I make bread about once a week and this mixer has held up well. It did overheat once but that was my fault as the dough was simply too dry. Thermal protection on the mixer tripped and after 30 minute cool down period, mixer was fine and ready to go again.I ordered another KA Pro 600 for my daughter for 2012 Christmas. I tracked the shipment with UPS tracking and noticed that the mixer apparently got lost at one of the transient points. I sent an email to Santech asking them to look into the shipping problem. Without my asking, they immediately sent me another mixer by Three Day Air. Customer service doesn't get any better than this. The replacement mixer was received seven days prior to Christmas in good shape. I look forward to doing business with Santech again in the future.
