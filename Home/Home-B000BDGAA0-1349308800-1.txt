review/summary: Ive tried everything before this pillowreview/text: I have literally tried every pillow on the market to help me sleep better. I get a stiff neck and end up waking all night trying to fix my pillow to better support my neck. I end up feeling drained all day and sore as well.I hesitated to buy this pillow because, frankly, I'm sick of spending money on pillows that either don't work to begin with or eventually stop working. I did finally decide to buy this pillow and I have to say that I am very happy with it.I plan on reviewing again in a few months to update, but so far I sleep solid through the night and wake up with energy and no stiffness in my neck. I can't remember sleeping this well.I think that every person is different so the fact that this pillow worked for me is no guarantee it will for you, but if you are torn on making a decision to purchase this pillow, it is definitely worth the try.
