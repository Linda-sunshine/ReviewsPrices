review/summary: Does it's job wellreview/text: I'm definately satisfied with this purchase, especially for the price. I use it for mixing up some foods for my babies and it does a good job of breaking down fruits and veggies. It comes apart easily for cleaning as well which is a plus. If your looking for a basic device to do simple jobs its worth the price.
