review/summary: Save money and spacereview/text: Don't bother buying other FoodSaver containers... This device, plus a plentiful supply of mason jars, will keep you storing anything and everything you can think of securely.Simple to use, it needs no usage instructions if you're familiar with using a FoodSaver machine already. Connect everything up, put it on a jar onto which you've placed a (canning) lid, activate said machine, wait for machine to finish buzzing and for the sigh of air after it stops, remove sealer.My only complaint is that now I have to decide whether to store something in a mason jar, or whether I want to use said jar for canning/pickling/fermentation. Yet if I buy more mason jars I will be subject to further looks that say "No more"...
