review/summary: Laid down dead...review/text: This is the second Cuisinart coffee maker I have owned. The first one (with a 'brewed coffee reservoir') just stopped working one day. But I had liked it, and my sister gave me one of these for Christmas, 2010. Yesterday it just stopped working. The clock on the front still works. The "I'm brewing" light still lights up when I flip the switch. Nothing happens.I was very happy with it as a working coffee maker. I'm not so happy with the aesthetics that I want it on my counter if it won't yield coffee. We'll see if Cuisinart makes good on the 3 year warranty.
