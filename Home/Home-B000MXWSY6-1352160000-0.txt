review/summary: Nice clock but missing key featurereview/text: The clock is priced extremely well with almost every key feature you could want in an alarm clock. The ability to handle DST automatically, dual alarms, dimmer for the clock, etc. But the lack of a weekend feature is critical to any alarm clock. There is nothing worse than sleeping like the dead on Saturday morning and then BEEP BEEP BEEP at 6am because the alarm clock didn't realize it was Saturday and there was no way to tell the clock other than turning off the clock. Now you are wide awake and can't get back to sleep. Or you do happen to remember to turn off the alarm Friday morning but forget to turn it back on Sunday evening, and you are an hour late for work or for getting the kids up and out the door for school.I spent so much time looking at the automated clock setting features, dual alarm, and dimmer that I missed what I thought was a standard feature these days, especially on a dual alarm clock.Product Returned!
