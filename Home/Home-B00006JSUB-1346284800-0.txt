review/summary: This is a really good pan for not much $$$review/text: I have used it twice now. The first time was on an incredible steak using the Alton Brown method. It was incredible!! As good as any fine steak house. I have also used it to cook burgers and fry potatoes. It has work great at the high heats needed for frying and searing steaks. I can't believe I haven't owned one before. Only issue is how smoky your house gets from using this hunk of metal. But that is not the pans fault.
