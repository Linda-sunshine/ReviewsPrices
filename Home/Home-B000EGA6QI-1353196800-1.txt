review/summary: Immersion Hand Blenderreview/text: I bought this initially for making home-made mayo. O MG, it does a fabulous job on that. Really looking forward to discovering other amazing feats it will perform. If you have a smaller job, and you don't want to drag out the huge mixer, this is what you're looking for.
