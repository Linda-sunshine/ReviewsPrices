review/summary: deployment must-have!review/text: Using this on a beat up old mattress in Afghanistan. I've had this topper on my mattress for about a month and a half now and I can't explain the difference it has made in my sleeping habits. The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is for the first 3 weeks it smelled really weird. Almost like bengay or some sort of muscle rub. Slowly it's going away or I'm getting used to it. But SO comfortable. To get a 3&#34; and pay all that extra money is pointless, because the 2&#34; works wonders.
