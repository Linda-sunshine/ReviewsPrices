review/summary: Coils Corrodereview/text: I have owned this kettle for approximately 2 years and have only used it about 20-30 times. I purchased this for work purposes. Recently I pulled it out to bring to work and noticed the coils were corroded. I have always made sure it was completely dry before storing so I'm not sure why this happened and am waiting for a response from the vendor. But I would not purchase this kettle or recommend it to anyone.
