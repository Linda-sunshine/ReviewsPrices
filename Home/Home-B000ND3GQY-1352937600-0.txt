review/summary: Horriblereview/text: Got this pan because we wanted to stay away from the toxic non-stick coating. The pan is actually 15 inches, quite large and too heavy for me to handle. It also heats unevenly so a lot of time my food is burnt on one side and undercooked on the other side. I'm off searching for another pan......
