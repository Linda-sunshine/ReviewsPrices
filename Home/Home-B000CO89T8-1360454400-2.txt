review/summary: Keeps coffee warm...not hot...review/text: I plug this in before going to the kitchen so it's ready when my coffee is brewed. I put it on the warmer straight from the pot. Then I get on my computer and tend to forget about it...which is why I purchased this product. But it doesn't keep it hot...just warm...very warm, but still just warm. Loses it's appeal after a while as mildly hot coffee is not very appetizing. I like that &#34;Sip...Ahhhh&#34; feeling you get from hot but not scalding coffee. So, I either need to find a better warmer or just drink my coffee faster...Having said that, it is definite improvement on NOT having a warmer...
