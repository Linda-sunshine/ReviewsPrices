review/summary: NOT espresso, but great coffeereview/text: Love, love, LOVE my aeropress.Pros:-Makes great coffee-TOTAL control over coffee/water ratio, water temperature, and contact time-Easy to clean-Filters are inexpensive and reusableCons:-It doesn't do espresso. I don't care what the marketing claims are, the output of this device is (really good) coffee. It might be very concentrated and taste great, but that doesn't make it espresso.-I wish it was bigger. It doesn't even fill my standard mug in a single press, and a 12 oz. travel mug takes two cycles to fill. Maybe there's a market for an Aeropress XL.Tips:-Search on internet for "Aeropress inverted method". Works much better.-If you're not satisfied with results then don't be afraid to experiment. Change one thing at a time and keep a log.-For a head start on recipes and methods, look for "Aeropress World Championships",[...]or [...] YouTube is another great resource...lots of Aeropress lovers out there.-Don't bring your water to a full rolling boil. Use water at about 190F, or even slightly less.So why only four stars? Because Aeropress continues to market this as a "Coffee and Espresso" maker despite it being completely incapable of making five star espresso.
