review/summary: Canning at its best at Amazonreview/text: Using a pressure cooker can be intimidating for most people but with this pressure cooker all the safety precautions are in place with the pressure gauge, the pressure regulator and pressure plug. Read and following the instructions and the pressure cooker makes life simplier and safer for food to be processed. I have processed tomatoes, beans, carrots, beets and made salsa as well. Beats that freezer method and freezer burn!
