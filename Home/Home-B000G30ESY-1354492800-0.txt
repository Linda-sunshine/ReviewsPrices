review/summary: The right and smart rice cookerreview/text: I have been wanting to replace my old model of Sanyo rice cooker with the newest frizzy logic rice cooker. Though they are toward the expensive side but I do think they are worth the price. It is very easy to operate and easy to clean. When I researched and found some reviews mentioned that the rice tasted better, I did not believe it. After I started using it, it is very true that rice does taste better, the rice captures the moisture and the natural favor and tastes great. One particular feature that I like is its &#34;count-down&#34; indicator, when the rice is 12 minutes away from ready, it will automatically starts counting which helps me to time the cooking of other dishes. It is a great product.
