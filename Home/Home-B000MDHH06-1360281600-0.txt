review/summary: The best well spent $100 in my lifereview/text: Depending on the great reviews Breville has, I expected to be good, it is twice better than I had expected. The motor is so strong, feels like it is taken from an airplane, you "drop" the fruits and veggies inside and they just disappear without any + it squeezes every single drop of juice from them.Mother Nature and human kind are not always in opposition!:) Mother Nature had given us an amazing assortment of ingredients and nutrients, while the man had invented the juicer- that's what I call a great collaboration:))Something else I love about Breville juicer is that It literally takes me 5 min to clean it. I had had juicer before and, honestly, at some point I was spending half of the day over the sink. But this one is amazingly well done. There are no hard-to-reach corners or parts and 90% is done just by rinsing it!I highly recommend it to all of you this product!I called mine Juicer Jack and he is officially my best friend now!
