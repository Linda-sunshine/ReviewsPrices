review/summary: If you like your drink HOT, look elsewherereview/text: Considering I'll brew coffee, pour it into a mug, then immediately pop it into the microwave for twenty seconds, I thought a mug warmer would be the perfect thing for me to keep my beverage hot enough for my tastes. Sadly, it only keeps my coffee/tea warm, and warm ain't hot.So if you like your hot drinks HOT, the most this will do for you is keep it palatable. Not optimal. For now, though, it's better than nothing!
