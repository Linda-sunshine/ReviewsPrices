review/summary: Throw away the Keurigreview/text: First, a little background: If you want a good cup of coffee, it doesn't take a lot of fancy equipment. All you really need is:1) Coffee beans that are freshly roasted (in the past few days), and freshly ground (in the past few minutes)2) Good water, around 200 degrees Fahrenheit3) Some simple filter put over a cupThat's it. Then you just pour the hot water over the freshly ground beans, wait a few minutes, and you have a good cup of coffee.Sadly, we've become a culture that values convenience over quality. Keurig and similar coffee makers are exceptionally convenient, and produce a very mediocre cup of coffee. The beans are not freshly roasted. The beans are not freshly ground. The water does not stay in contact with the coffee for more than a minute or so.Fortunately, there are many great simple devices for making quality coffee. This Aeropress is easily my favorite way to make individual cups of coffee. In about five minutes (six if you include cleanup), I can make a great cup of coffee. Put water in the microwave. While it heats, grind 12-15 grams of coffee beans and put them in the Aeropress. By this time, the water is hot enough. Pour it over the ground coffee, give it a stir, and wait 2-3 minutes. Press the coffee into a cup slowly (about 20 seconds), and you're done.How much do I like my Aeropress? Enough that I'm getting a second one so that I can make two cups of coffee at once.One other bit of advice: The paper filters are fine, but like any paper coffee filters, they hold back oils that would add extra depth to your cup of coffee. I prefer the oils. Seek out a permanent filter for the Aeropress. It cuts down on the paper, and produces an even better cup of coffee. The permanent filter requires an "inverted" Aeropress technique which is just as simple as the regular technique. Search YouTube for "inverted aeropress" and you'll see what I mean.
