review/summary: Works decent enough but gets really hot!review/text: I used this to make the kids ice cream malts..I was making three of them, and by the end of the third I had to stop to turn it off and give my hand a break as the base of the machine had gotten very hot. I don't know if others have experienced this or not. Between each malt I made, I had the blender turned off for approx 1-2 minutes, so it wasn't in consistent use for 3 malts. Anyway, it worked well, didn't take long at all to make them and they were a wonderful consistency.
