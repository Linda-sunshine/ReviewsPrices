review/summary: Measurements wear off - can't read them anymorereview/text: The last two Pyrex measuring cups I have purchased lost the painted measuring marks in less than a year. After this problem and reading that Pyrex is no longer the same glass, I'm switching to Anchor Hocking which has the letters embossed in the glass. And every time I see a vintage Pyrex measuring cup at the flea market I'm buying it!
