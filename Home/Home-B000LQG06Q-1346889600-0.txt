review/summary: excellent! it fixed my lower back pain.review/text: I recently got married and purchased an extra firm mattress which feels good, but not when you sleep facing down. Mattress is new and conforatable but I couldn't take the pain in the mornings so I tried this and it fixed my problem. It is good quality, fits perfectly and solves the pain problems. I highly recommend it.
