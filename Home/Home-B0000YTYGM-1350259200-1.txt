review/summary: Cuisinart Coffeemakerreview/text: This coffee maker keeps the coffee hot for hours and the coffee itself is very good. If there is any problem in how you put the coffee in or if grounds get in the lid, the coffee pot will overflow. As long as you are careful and do not accidentally get grounds in the lid, it works fine and the coffee is worth the extra care in making it.
