review/summary: I love itreview/text: So I came to Amazon expecting to get a small drip coffeemaker when this little thing caught my eye. After reading all the positive stuff about the AeroPress, I decided to take a chance, and boy am I glad I did! It makes awesome coffee/espresso. It's also fast, and super easy to clean up. it also has that quirky geek factor that I love... it's just cool. The downside is that it does use more coffee than a drip machine... probably twice as much. But it's a great, high quality product for a low price. This is one of those rare times where I've been truly delighted with a purchase.
