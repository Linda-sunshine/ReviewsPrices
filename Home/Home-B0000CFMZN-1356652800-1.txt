review/summary: Love it!review/text: I use this all the time in our kitchen and it's a perfect size for making our dinner preparations. Potatoes and veggies, measuring for larger amounts of water and milk, all work well in this product. The red paint has not faded at all and the glass is clear as the day I bought it.
