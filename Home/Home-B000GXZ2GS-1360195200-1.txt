review/summary: Great Coffee, but one cup at a time brewingreview/text: I consider myself a bit of a coffee snob. I have to say, after using this for a week, it makes my french press coffee taste like it was brewed at 7-11. I was very surprised at how naturally sweet and flavorful the coffee is when using this device. I even have been taking it with me on my business travel since it is very small and portable. French press coffee, which previously was my favorite, tastes very acidic with no distinct flavors. The aeropress allows you to really taste the individual aromas/flavors in your coffee. It is also, substantially easier to brew via this method than from the French press. You don't have to let it sit for 4 minutes and remember to come back. You get coffee as soon as you want it. It's also very fast - about the same amount of time as a Keurig (assuming you already have hot water).I only have a few cons. The reason why it is 4 stars instead of 5, is the size. You can only brew 1 cup at a time. One of the things I really like about a french press, is that one "pot" is just the right amount for both my wife and I. Now, if we want coffee, we would each have to brew our own. It's not a deal breaker by any means, but it does make it a little less convenient than it could be.One other plus/minus - I've actually resorted to just microwaving water when using this (which is a big plus/much easier than heating on the stove). However, the way that the aeropress is designed is that it has to be on the coffee mug when you pour water into it. Otherwise it will slowly drip and create a little bit of a mess. This makes it a pain to heat water in the microwave unless you want to dirty two cups (one for heating/pouring, one for drinking).I would definitely buy it again and would recommend the purchase for people who like good coffee.
