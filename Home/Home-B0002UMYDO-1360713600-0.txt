review/summary: Best so farreview/text: Had an expensive opener before this one and broke it trying to open flip top cans. This one works well and when emptying cans after opening the content slide right out. I open many dog food cans and I don't have to cut the food up to get it out of the can because there is no rim left on the can. Nice opener, just takes a medium strong push to get started. Has auto shut off and you may need to touch magnetic cover lifter to touch top of can. good design and works great.
