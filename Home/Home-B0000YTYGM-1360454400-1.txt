review/summary: Hard to usereview/text: First: about the references to the coffee maker overflowing; it is hard to get the lid on straight which might be part of the problem. I put &#8220;L&#8221; part of the lid facing the pour lip and this seems to help to put it on straight. I always check its straightness. After a while the threads get worn which help. I am always careful to put both the pot and the filter basket in very carefully. I have never had an overflow as to date.Secondly: it is a left handed coffee maker. The fill gauge is on the left hand side, which makes filling the water hard for a right handed person.Third: the shut off valve for the basket to allow pouring when brewing leaks from the get go. Not much but it does leak. I now wait for the alarm for end of brewing to sound. No problems then.Fourth: cleaning the pot is hard, because there is a very small opening.Bottom line: brews excellent coffee, using my Kitchen Aide Conical Burr Coffee Grinder, but hard to use, thus the rating.
