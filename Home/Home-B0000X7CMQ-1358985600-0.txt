review/summary: Zojirushi Thermal Carafa Coffee Maker (FLOP) DEAD in 4review/text: I was so taken in by the design and sleek style of this coffee brewer.What a mistake that was. The store where I purchased this raved and raved on what a quality product this company produced, in terms of bread makers. Well it appears to be a different story with the coffee maker. I paid $90.00 for this item on Jan 20, 2013, today is Jan 24, 2013. Coffee pot program buttons work but that is it. I have cold water sitting in the pot, coffee in the filter and noting. (DEAD), so I called the store where I bought it and they are not as excited on taking it back as the raves I received when buying. I also called the service department at Zojirushi and they were surprised at the issue and said the store should take it back. I can see this is going to be a pain in the ass. Anyway it is up to you, if you want to spend $90.00 and hope for the best, and then do so. Me I am going back to Bunn.
