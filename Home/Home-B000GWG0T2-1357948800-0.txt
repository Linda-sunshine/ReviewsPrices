review/summary: Inexpensive and durablereview/text: I bought mine at Publix for $20 when i was living in Florida a year ago. This is a pan that receives a lot of use in our household. I think one attribute is its light weight, which makes it easy to handle.It's curiously called a saute pan but lacks a true saute pan shape. More like a large non-stick fry pan. Whatever, it held up for about a year before the non-stick surface gave out.Non-stick pans won't stay that way indefinitely. If I could find another one for $20, I'd be inclined to replace it with the same brand.
