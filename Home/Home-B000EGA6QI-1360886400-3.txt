review/summary: Coolreview/text: This is a pretty cool gadget. It did a great job on several things and I was glad to have it. In our little kitchen it was nice to not have to pull out the big mixer for simple things. I was surprised and disappointed when I tried to turn eggs into meringue but I am guessing it was because there weren't enough in the bottom of the bowl. The stick got very very hot. It was too hot to hold at one point and that is after I had given it a minute of no use to cool off before starting again. The eggs never did firm up as I had to stop mixing with this mixer due to the extreme heat. Other than that I have had no problems with it. It is a nice little mixer.
