review/summary: Worked only oncereview/text: I purchased this grinder to mainly be used with my Cuisinart automatic drip coffee maker, with which I have been happy. This grinder worked great .... ONCE! When I went to use for the second time after purchasing it, it simply would not turn on despite my husband taking it apart cleaning it and assuring that everything is in right operating condition. I'm returning this to amazon and purchasing the Capresso which I should have done in the first place.
