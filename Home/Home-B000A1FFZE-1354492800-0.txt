review/summary: Who designed this piece of junk?review/text: And when I say "designed," I suppose I should hold the people who test the product accountable as well. This is a piece of junk. As a toaster, it's weak. You have to toast items twice. The slot isn't wide enough for two pieces of bread. As an oven, it's useless. The top element is too close to the food. Something as simple as a toasted cheese sandwich gets burnt on top and uncooked at the bottom. Jack Donaghy would never have let a shoddy piece of workmanship like this slip past control when he was Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming at GE. Fire the knob who allowed this travesty of a toaster oven to make it to market. Replace him with a real executive who understands the need for uniformly cooked Hot Pockets.Hamilton Beach, I shall never buy one of your products again.
