review/summary: Excellent little heaterreview/text: Our gas fireplace is broken and our living room gets very cold. Particularly by the non-functioning fireplace (which happens to be where I sit). I got this to help keep out the chill and it really does the trick. Our house is very open, so I would call our living room large if only because it gets a lot of airflow. I rarely need to turn this heater to high, low is usually sufficient to warm me up. The heat can be comfortably felt on the other side of the room. It was an excellent buy especially considering the low price.
