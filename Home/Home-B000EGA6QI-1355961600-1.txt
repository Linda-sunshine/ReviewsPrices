review/summary: Pay attention to the other 1 star reviews!!!review/text: I usually do a better job looking at the negative reviews before buying an item. My wife wanted this particular item so I just went ahead and ordered. Although she really likes that it can come apart for cleaning, like so many others have already said, the plastic connection has stripped making this stick blender useless. We have had it for barely over 2 months (it does...or should I say 'did' get used almost daily). Since it is past Amazon's 30 days, I am now stuck waiting on Cuisinart's customer service to deal with this. Estimated wait time on a Thursday night? 10 minutes. Yippie. My wife has searched the other similar products and NONE get real high marks all around. I guess she goes back to the one piece she has had for years and years. Stands up, but hard to clean.
