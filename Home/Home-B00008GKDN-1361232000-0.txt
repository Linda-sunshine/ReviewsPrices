review/summary: if you like fried eggs and pancakes country stile this is it.review/text: personally i like cooking with cast iron. i love this griddle. it took about 2 mornings of fried eggs before the eggs didn't stick but after that, a little oil or butter and you've got the best fried eggs you could ask for. watch out for the hot handle, keep a hot pad or mit handy.
