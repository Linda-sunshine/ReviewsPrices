review/summary: terrible designreview/text: Terrible!!! My wife and I spent an entire morning trying to get the handle trigger mechanism to work. This is a major design flaw. When we finally though we had it right and put water in the machine, it poured out all over the floor which we then had to mop up. The only good thing we can say is that Amazon was very efficient in their return process. We would not recommend this to anyone.
