review/summary: Arrived Quick!review/text: I have been using this since I opened the box. It was exactly what I wanted. Lightweight and not a Belgium. I didn't want to be bothered with a rotating one. Works well and the non stick, really is nonstick, just spray with non sticking cooking oil. Easy clean up.
