review/summary: Big bargain for the bucks!review/text: This is my favorite grinder now that I've found it...very easy to use...very easy to clean...and the grinding choice is definitely determined by my operating method not by the grinder itself...I totally control it from coarse to fine...I generally grind for one to four days of coffee depending upon my schedule. Daily is my first choice. Actually the size of this grinder helps me to do two things...I'm just one minute away from preparing a pot of freshly ground coffee and I have found that the waste of coffee from the grinding process itself is curtailed to minimum over time which is important from a cost-saving framework. I would not hesitate to give this grinder as a gift to my friends if they needed one.
