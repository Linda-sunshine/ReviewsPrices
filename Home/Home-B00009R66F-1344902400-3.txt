review/summary: Works good, but broke after 1 monthreview/text: Like it says in the title, it works like it is supposed to. We got it for a new dog that needed to be trained and this cleans up after it well.The cons:Kind of loud, but you aren't really going to find a super quiet oneA piece of plastic that holds the unit up broke, so now it just lays flat instead of standing up right. It was not used hard, in fact it was just sitting there and all of a sudden fell over. So, not real sure about the quality but for the price we couldn't complain. I will call and get it fixed under warranty.
