review/summary: One of the top Rated Air Cleaners out therereview/text: The Honeywell 50250-s is one of the top rated consumer air cleaners available. I have owned it's predecessor for 20 years and have only been happy. It truly cleans the air as specified. The workmanship is very solid and my previous unit still runs as it did when new. I needed a new one in order to move the old unit to another part of the house. The hepa filter lasts much longer than 3-5 years as long as you keep the pre-filter clean and vacuumed. I do not replace the pre-filter as often as specified either...I do however vacuum and soak it in order to fully clean it once every couple of months. If you do not replace the pre-filter as specified, it's odor cleansing qualities diminish to some extent but it's physical molecule pre-filtering capabilities will continue. I would recommend this unit to anyone that wants a top rated efficient long lasting air cleaner. I have read many many articles on air cleaners over the years and one can spend upwards of $900.00 on a portable unit...many in that category utilize the same physics as this one...they may be a wee bit quieter though...the noise doesn't bother me. One last thing, it is important to also vacuum the hepa filter after cleaning or replacing the pre-filter.
