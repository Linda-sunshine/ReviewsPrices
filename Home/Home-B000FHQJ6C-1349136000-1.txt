review/summary: Metal-on-plastic flawreview/text: This Juicer worked great for two months. My 20 year old Juiceman JR still worked, but I was excited about the "big Mouth" that could fit entire apples. I really enjoyed this juicer for two months as it saved me from having to slice up apples, beets, and cucumbers, but this morning while juicing I got that "burning plastic" smell followed by juicer failure. Upon closer inspection, I noticed the back part of the blade that snaps onto the motor assembly was melted and crumbled. Perhaps metal-on-plastic is not a good way to connect the motor to the blade.I guess it's back to the 20 year old juiceman jr for me.
