review/summary: Great purchase!review/text: This turned our so-so mattress into an awesome, comfy mattress. If you can't afford a memory foam mattress, this is a great substitute. It has also worked out perfectly for my girlfriend who is pregnant and is forced to sleep on her sides at night. Highly recommend.
