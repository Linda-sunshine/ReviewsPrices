review/summary: the rice cooker of my dreamsreview/text: i use this thing almost everyday. from jasmine to brown, calrose, and even sushi, this little marvel can cook any type of rice i can throw at it! but it doesn't just stop at rice. i cook lentils, quinoa, and amaranth in here too! it disassembles for easy cleaning and the stainless steel has looked great in three different apartments. it looks so good in fact, i sometimes carry it with me to special events like weddings and for some extra bling up in tha club. i received this as a gift and it made me instantly fall deeply in love with the woman who gave it to me. she and i aren't together anymore...but this rice cooker is still with me and i know that as long as i live, i'd never part with it!
