review/summary: Makes great coffee (compared to drip)review/text: I've used this coffee maker everyday for almost one year and it still is working just fine.I use Bunn filters in the coffee makers basket. I turn the basket upside down, place the filter over it and punch the filter with the perk tube....then place the filter inside the basket.
