review/summary: Worst Item I've Ever Purchased!review/text: This item is very poorly designed! After vacuuming a single flight of stairs, the entire area at the foot of stairs was covered with dust, I was sneezing, and the unit was covered with dust! It should be mentioned that I'd cleaned the steps only 2wks prior, so it's not like they contained a year's worth of dust. I've used bagless vacuums before, and they've never performed this poorly. Eureka certainly has tarnished their reputation by having their name on this device. It's absolutely TERRIBLE
