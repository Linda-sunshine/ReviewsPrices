review/summary: Box fell apartreview/text: I bought this as a gift so I do not know if it works. I opened the package up and the box holding the coffee maker fell apart. Its almost as if I was shipped an item that was returned. I really hope the coffee maker works.Following up: I further looked at the box. It had writing all over it, as if the seller sent me item that was returned. I have never had this issue with an Amazon purchase.
