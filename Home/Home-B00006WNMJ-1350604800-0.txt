review/summary: excellent productreview/text: I have tried many other faucet filter systems and this is by far the best. I first purchased the system in 2010 and am still using the original housing and replace the filter every month due to the water in El Paso. With the other systems I've tried the housing would crack on top and leak after 3 or 4 months and I would have to purchase another one. Culligan is top notch and I plan on purchasing a whole house system when we get into our new home.
