review/summary: Well designed and solidly made to get the job donereview/text: I had been wanting to try several recipes for soup, smoothies, and other dishes that required pureeing with an immersion blender. After reading Amazon reviews, the Cuisinart CSB-76 looked like a winning combination of price and quality, so I ordered it. It was a good buy, and so far I'm completely satisfied with it. The first recipe that I tried was for lentil soup that made about a quart of soup. It only took about five seconds for the Cuisinart to puree the soup to the right texture.The blender is well made, the ergonomics are fine, and it has a good solid feel to it. With a 200-watt motor, it blends/purees most things in a matter of seconds. One really nice feature is the removable shaft that can be rinsed off or cleaned separately in a dishwasher.Call me a very happy customer.
