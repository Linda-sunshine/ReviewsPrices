review/summary: Marvelous and lovedreview/text: When the last elephant died, due to mold inside, we were informed by the 6 year old that she only wanted another 'Ele'. These are great humidifiers. This, the newest model, comes with clearer instructions on how to clean it and so should last longer. The mist comes out of the elephant trunk and gets fairly high into the air. We set it up on a stool near her bed and it helps tremendously all winter long. Because this model has a single point of electronics (the dial on the front) it is easy for her to turn off in the morning when she wakes up.
