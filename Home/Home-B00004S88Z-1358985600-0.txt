review/summary: Either was a defective item or damaged previous returned itemreview/text: Loved the idea of this canner, was excited to get it however upon opening it two of the bolts and wing nuts were stripped and rendered the unit unusable as the lid could not be secured. I wanted to exchange it however that isn't an option as to exchange for an exact item you have to first return then reorder. I logged on to see about ordering a new one even before the old one was picked up by UPS only to see that the item is no longer available from Amazon and this notice was posted"Item Under ReviewWhile this item is available from other marketplace sellers on this page, it is not currently offered by Amazon.com because customers have told us there may be something wrong with our inventory of the item, the way we are shipping it, or the way it's described here. (Thanks for the tip!)We're working to fix the problem as quickly as possible."I guess now all I can do is hope Amazon's return policy and customer service is top notch and it is back to looking for a new canner.I cannot tell if it was a failure of Quality Control with the manufacture or if I got an item that was returned damaged and reshipped to me but I hope the problem gets resolved.
