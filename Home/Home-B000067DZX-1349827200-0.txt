review/summary: Relatively Goodreview/text: I would recommend a Pur filter to anyone who has bad tasting tap water. Mine isn't, but I still use my filter occasionally. I can taste a small difference, but it does taste a little better. Some people in my family don't like it as much (they say it has more of a taste), but I disagree. The filters need to be replaced every three months or so, so if you use it daily, good tasting water water costs little more than $20 a year. Not a bad deal, if you drink water.By the way, I would definitely recommend drinking water daily. It is a great substance, and is very healthy for your body. If you need a Pur filter to spark that habit, it is worth the money 100%.
