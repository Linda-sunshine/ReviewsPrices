review/summary: Fun little gadgetreview/text: So far this has worked great. For making cookies and the like it is fast and easy to restart the timer and keep going. Accurate and easy to use. I've not used the temp part yet, even though that it in large part why I bought it. This seems so well built I am sure it will work fine.
