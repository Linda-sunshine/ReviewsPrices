review/summary: Works great for drip!!review/text: I just bought a second one of these to replace a Starbuck's Barista at our weekend house. The first one works very well-- quiet, powerful, and handles dark oily beans very well (I roast my own). Can't comment as to how it would work for espresso, but for my "daily grind" it's perfect!
