review/summary: I absolutely cannot cookreview/text: this has worked for me every time, as long as I follow the directions to the letter. The only time it failed was once when I didn't add enough water and once when I didn't add enough flour. Your will find, as I did, that the best way to measure ingrediants, is to get a scale and measure by weight, it will then be perfect. I am now using my scale to measure ingrediants for other things, like chocolate chip cookies and it has really made a difference. Set your scale to &#34;grams&#34; as this is better than ounces, at least that's what has worked best for me.My last batch of cookies was the best yet for me. Oh and the sandwich setting is perfect for every day bread, I love it !
