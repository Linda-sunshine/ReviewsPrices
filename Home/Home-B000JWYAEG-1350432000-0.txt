review/summary: Great price... Nice sheets... a little too big?review/text: I've never owned any sheets that had a thread count before, so I'm hardly qualified to tell anyone how good (or bad) sheets like this are supposed to be. But bottom line: I love these sheets! I bought white and coffee, and both are high quality and great to sleep on. The only problem I see with this order is that the fitted sheets are much larger than my extended queen bed requires. All the labels say queen but I'm sure these sheets are for a king-sized bed. (Both sets of sheets are the same size, and say queen on the packaging). But it wasn't worth quibbling about, so I kept them.
