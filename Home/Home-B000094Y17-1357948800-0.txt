review/summary: The lid is really a non-issue - Use common sensereview/text: This pitcher works well. Yes, there has been a lot of "chatter" about the lid design but in reality it works fine if you understand how the design works. I agree with what LONEWAR ( Dec 24, 2012 ) said. Here it is again....."Have had this product for about a week or so now and am enjoying cleaner & better tasting water than can be bought in a store. I have moderately odorous well water & this product has cleaned it up nicely.I almost didn't buy this because of the reviews about the lid not staying on. Here is the "Lid problem" in a nutshell. This unit has an upper level reservoir which holds the water until it can filter down through the included filter. However, if you try to pour out a glass of water before it has had a chance to fully filter the water in the reservoir down into the bottom chamber, the lid tends to come off because there is still water in the upper chamber, thereby forcing the lid off because it has nowhere else to go.The "Lid problem" is not an actual problem at all. What it amounts to is a "lack of common sense" problem on the users part." LONEWARSo folks, read the above carefully. Don't overfill. Wait for top chamber to fully empty into main reservoir. Keep your thumb on the lid when pouring. Be happy.The only reason I'm only giving four stars is because the lid design has caused so much confusion and the indicator battery is non replaceable.
