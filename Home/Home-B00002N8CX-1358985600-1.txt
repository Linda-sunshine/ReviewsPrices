review/summary: Good powerful vacuumreview/text: This is a relatively small vacuum cleaner. Works great, used mainly for small cleanup, tile floors. Does NOT come with a HEPA filter but I bought a Eureka HEPA filter that fits on the back exactly. Powerful, but is noisy for a canister vac. Otherwise, a very convenient vacuum that doesn't take up too much space and easy to move around.
