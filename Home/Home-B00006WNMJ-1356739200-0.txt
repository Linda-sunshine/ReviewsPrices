review/summary: so much better than purreview/text: I've had this faucet filter for over a year and I love it. I've had two pur faucet filters and they lasted about 3 months before they started leaking. The Culligan is the best. I change the filters on a 3 month average. I use the spring, summer, fall, and winter dates as reminders. You can't go wrong with this filter.
