review/summary: VERY PLEASEDreview/text: i've used this cleaner for all my carpets now and am very happy with the results. I did have a little trouble getting used to the exact fit of the cover to the dirty water tank but once I had that down the cleaner performed wonderfully. It really isn't that difficult to do. My carpet areas aren't huge so I didn't find that emptying the tank to continue on was annoying either. My only complaint would be that I found the machine hard to push around. I was sore from using muscles I hadn't in a while but the results were certainly worth it.
