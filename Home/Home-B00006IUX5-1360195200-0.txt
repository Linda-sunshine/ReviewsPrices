review/summary: Smaller than expectedreview/text: This grinder works fine for grinding coffee with the exception of being much smaller in size than other grinders I've purchased in the past. I also don't like that you have to keep pressure on the button the entire time you're grinding the coffee. I like the products that you press the button once & it continues grinding til the coffee is the texture you desire.
