review/summary: Happy coffee drinkerreview/text: Haven't had the machine for long, but we love it so far. It's perfect for when you're running out the door in a hurry, and my husband can have his stronger blend coffee and I get my flavored coffee with no waste. I love the variety of different coffees available and the ease of use. I definitely recommend this machine!
