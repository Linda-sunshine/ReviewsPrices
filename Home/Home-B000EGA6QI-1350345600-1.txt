review/summary: It's NOT industrial strengthreview/text: I just had to buy a replacement, but only because I wasn't careful enough with my first one. This thing is FREAKING AWESOME in my venture of making homemade baby food. The first one broke from me trying to puree some plums and not sifting for the seeds all the way. One got caught in the blades and "CLICK!" was the last thing I heard. When I removed the 2 parts I saw the white plastic connector-thing that makes the blades spin had broke. I was so upset at myself, NOT the blender. (Obviously, I knew I wasn't ordering a bone saw.) I ordered another one later that day. The handle fits perfectly in my hand and the motor is powerful. It does get hot with prolonged continued use (3mins+), but if you use it like me you should be happy with this item. For example: peel and chop some pears, then puree. Empty those into ice cube trays, cover and set to the side. Puree some carrots or chicken soup, empty into ice cube trays, cover and set to the side. The motor gets to rest between purees. Love this thing!
