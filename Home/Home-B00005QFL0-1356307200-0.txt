review/summary: OKAY Bread Machinereview/text: Machine does a good job of making bread but several recipes need tweaking. Its display is difficult to see and the buttons tacky. Did not like the feature that if you need to redo the parameters the machine needs to reset itself by pulling the plug and resting it for 15 to 20 minutes.
