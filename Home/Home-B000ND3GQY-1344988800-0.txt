review/summary: Used it the first time and burned my foodreview/text: I received this pan last week and used it for the first time yesterday. I made Kung Pao Chicken. Since stir-fry dishes are supposed to be cooked on the highest heat, I used that setting on my flat-top electric range and put in the peanut oil when the pan appeared to be hot enough. But as soon as I put my first ingredients in (dried red peppers & sichuan peppercorns), they were burned immediately, before I could even begin to stir them. I went ahead and added the chicken to see what would happen, but the chicken was burnt slightly on the outside after cooking for a minute (The recipe called for cooking the chicken for 2 minutes).So my conclusion is that this pan conducts heat much better than a regular stir fry pan designed for a gas range. I guess it's because of the aluminum core inside. This might be a very good pan, but I believe that I am going to have to lower the heat and try to find what the ideal setting is for stir-frying food. If anybody reads this review and has some suggestions for me, I would appreciate them.Thank you.
