review/summary: One of my most favorite appliancesreview/text: I have dehydrated everything from herbs to vegetables to refried beans to pasta to sauces to beef jerky to chicken and this unit works flawlessly! I use it so much I had to order extra trays, mesh screens, and fruit roll-up sheets (I now have 11 trays, and six each of the mesh screens and roll-up sheets). I've even learned to dehydrate prepared Hamburger Helper (complete with meat, sauce, and pasta) so I can rehydrate it right in the bag while camping or hiking without any cooking or cleanup. If you are into long-term food storage, prepping, camping/backpacking, or are just tired of paying through the nose for jerky, this is the unit for you! Highly recommend!
