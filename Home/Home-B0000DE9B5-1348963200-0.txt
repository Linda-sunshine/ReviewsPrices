review/summary: Classy Glass.review/text: I was apprehensive about purchasing a glass pitcher, as I am very clumsy and break glasses constantly. This pitcher hasn't met that fate yet, and it is better than other pitchers I've used in the past for two major reasons. First, lemonade and ice tea and other beverages don't leave lingering smells (a problem I always had with plastic pitchers, even after washing in the dishwasher). Secondly, the vacuum seal lid keeps the liquids fresher longer, and the fridge doesn't smell like whatever is in the pitcher. It also looks pretty classy. Great product.
