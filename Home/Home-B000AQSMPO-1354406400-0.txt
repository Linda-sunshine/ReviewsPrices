review/summary: a surprise gift that has been a worthy addition to my small kitchenreview/text: Last Christmas my husband used some of our banking rewards debit card points to surprise me with this machine. I've used it regularly for almost a full year now, and I have zero complaints. It's been reliable, makes great coffee, works well with the ekobrew refillable cups and my favorite local beans, which I grind as needed in a small spice grinder. I clean it with a plastic scrub brush, and find it goes back together with ease. Occasionally I get the "prime" flag and have to clean the water tank and re-position the little wheel that feeds the water into the heating area. Other than that standard maintenance, I have had no trouble with it. I couldn't be happier with the B60. Best use of reward points ever.
