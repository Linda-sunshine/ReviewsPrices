review/summary: My doctor is not happyreview/text: My doctor just told me I need to watch my carbs, but the bread we are making is so good. Machine works very nicely and has many options. I especially like the raisin option so we can add ingredients mid process. We made olive and onion bread with this feature and it is awesome.I fully recommend this product!
