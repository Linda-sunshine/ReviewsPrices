review/summary: LOVE ITreview/text: I can't say enough about this thing. I love my lodge skillets, so when I went looking for a pizza stone, this just happen to come up. It was a lot cheaper than the stones I was looking for. Figured what the heck, I will give it a try. No regrets so far. Had this for almost a year now. Never leaves the oven. Has definitely evened out the temp spike we used to get from oven cycling. Works great for pizza. The only drawbacks are the weight and size. It is a little heavy. Not a problem for me, but the wife says it is a little heavy for her. You cannot make a giant pizza, but for a family of three it works really well. Especially with everyone want a different kind.
