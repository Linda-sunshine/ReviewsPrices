review/summary: Perfect Pizzareview/text: I began looking for a better way to cook pizza after I purchased a new oven. I was tired of always having burnt crust and barely melted cheese on top. I looked at pizza stones, but realized that I would need to preheat them for nearly an hour before cooking the pizza! Way too long and too much electricity use in my mind. Then I came across this pan from Lodge. I own a medium sized dutch oven by them for cooking in campfires, and it has always been a wonderful thing to have to cook out in the wilderness. Decided I would give it a try, and ordered one. 3 words: best pizza ever! I prefer regular non-crispy crust, and it this pan cooks it wonderfully. The cast iron takes longer to heat, so it is just right for a softer crust, with a properly cooked top.Recommend to anyone that likes softer crust.Also I recommend getting the Lodge polycarbonite scrapers, they make cleanup a breeze!
