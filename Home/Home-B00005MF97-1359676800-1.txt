review/summary: Small machine does very solid job!review/text: I was not expecting much because of its size and price, boy&#9734; was I presently surprised! Very solid motor and precise job, okay not as evenly chopped as you would wish, but knowing I myself would not do such a perfectly even job anyways, it did very fine job for my standard. Finely chopped 600g of fresh-ginger in a matter of minutes definitely impressed me!One CON: cannot wash your head since the motor is there with wire, but I knew ahead of time so put plastic wrap around before you use the chopper so any splashes is caught by the plastic wrap and the head stays clean.
