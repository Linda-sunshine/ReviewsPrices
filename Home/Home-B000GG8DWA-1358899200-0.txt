review/summary: A nice heater to keep your feet warmreview/text: I bought this space heater to replace an older one that blew the air rather than act as this one does. That one tended to blow out cold air in the back, and I believe it really hogged a lot of energy to do it. It needed to go!So far this heater is pretty nice, especially for the cost. the 400 watt setting works well, however with the current below zero temperatures i keep it on the 800 watt setting. It does a slightly better job than my old heater. Overall i like it. I can put my feet up to it for a quick job in getting my toes warm in these freezing times.I have had not experienced any mechanical issues that prevent its functioning yet, but i'll certainly post about it if I do.I recommend this space heater if you have the need.
