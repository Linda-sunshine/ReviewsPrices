review/summary: A bit pricey but works as designedreview/text: I like the very long cord on this one. I had one (a different brand) that stopped working after five years. I not only use warmers for my beverages but also to warm wax. This one gets really hot.The only things that I do not like about this model is that it does not have the following safety features.1) Automatically shut off after being on for several hours. This protects you when you forget that the warmer is on and leave it unattended for hours. (normally two)2) A sensor on the bottom which realizes when a weighted object is on the warmer. If the object is not heavy enough to trigger the sensor, (with the unit powered on), the warmer will not heat up or if heated will shut off. This protects you when you finish drinking your beverage and forget to turn the unit off and leave the empty cup atop.I try not to be careless, but I have gotten busy at times and forgotten to turn things off. I need a warmer and will keep and continue to use this one until I can find one that has more safety features. Finally, 10 dollars was a bit pricey for a cup warmer. I'm sure it's the brand name that cause the price to be at this point.
