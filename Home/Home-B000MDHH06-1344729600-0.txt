review/summary: LOW CAPACITY AND MESSY CLEAN UP.review/text: CONS:I could only get about 10oz of juice at a time before having to clean the whole darn thing. No pulp reservoir to hold enough residue.Juice came out with about 40% foamy stuff on top of the juice whichdidn't settle after refrigeration.Cleaning is no fun, you have parts everywhere.PROS: UNIT WAS MADE WELL JUST NEEDS A REDESIGN.
