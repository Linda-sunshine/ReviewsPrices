review/summary: The Perfect Dehydrator!review/text: I started dehydrating last summer right before the prices started going up on food. This unit has been put to the test and it is wonderful. You don't need to spend several hundreds of dollars to get a quality dehydrator. I even bought additional trays so I can dehydrate larger batches. I used this item literally every other day last summer and dehydrated enough vegetables for a year. I dehydrated apple chips sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and sent them to my brother in Afghanistan. He loved them and he loved them. With this item I can send him dried fruits which they don't get a lot of over there. I also made some yummy strawberry chips as well. I just bought 5 lbs. bag of potatoes on sale for $1 and I am going to make dehydrated hashbrowns (for my hashbrown quiche, etc.), scalloped potatoes, etc. No more boxed foods with high sodium. I am eating healthier because of my dehydrator.
