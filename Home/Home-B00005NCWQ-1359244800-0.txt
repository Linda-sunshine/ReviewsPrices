review/summary: Hurricane season 2013, you're on notice. We're ready.review/text: After spending 4 hours driving around New Jersey during Hurricane Sandy to locate the last box o joe in the free world, I decided we needed a Percolator. This was the one we chose. It works well and didn't cost much. We have a gas range so no big deal for us to use it during a power outage.
