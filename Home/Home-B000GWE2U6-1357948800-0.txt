review/summary: Did not work as advertisedreview/text: Purchased two units. One did not produce any water vapor at all. The second unit produced a little bit but it was poor in output. This was disappointing as we compared the performance to other units we have had in the past years likes vicks. So we did research online and followed all the directions and the output was still poor. It was not the water quality as we used reverse osmosis water. We returned the units for a full refund to amazon.com and purchased the vicks units instead that we know at least work.
