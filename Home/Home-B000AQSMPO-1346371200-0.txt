review/summary: Never owned a better coffee machine!review/text: I bought my Keurig B70 machine in 2007 for home, and started using it at work in 2010. It quickly became the preferred coffee mess. We are now in 2012, my Keurig has never let me down, and everyone in my area loves the vast assortment of K-cups I keep on hand. I've always used filtered water and have never experienced a de-scaling issue. I just bought a B60 for the house because I couldn't bring myself to take my beloved B70 away from my coworkers.
