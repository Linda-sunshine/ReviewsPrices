review/summary: Hamilton Beach - The perfect kettle!review/text: Having long been in search of a good hot pot, or electric kettle, I searched Amazon and decided to try this one as the features seemed good and the reviews were okay.I have had this for about a year and a half, and use it to heat water at least 20 or more times a day. It is perfect.It heats the water quickly, turns itself off after it comes to a boil (if you keep the lid closed), and the double wall construction keeps the metal from burning you, even at a full boil. The seamless metal construction prevents it from leaking, which was a problem with every other electric kettle I owned. The only way you can get a leak is by overfilling it and getting water into the steam vent system.I have let it boil dry on 3 or 4 occasions - that will prevent it from working. Just take the kettle off the base to cool down, unplug the base from the recepticle for a moment, then plug it in again to reset it. Then continue as usual.After having this for about six months, I purchased an identical one from Amazon for the office. On that I ordered a &#34;warehouse deal&#34;. It looks good and works perfectly - it just cost less.I am very happy with my purchases, and if it came in a smaller size, I would order another one for the little travel trailer. I highly recommend this electric kettle!
