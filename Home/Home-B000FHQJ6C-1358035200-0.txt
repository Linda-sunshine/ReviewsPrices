review/summary: Pulp comes out wet.review/text: This is my first juicer so I wasn't sure what to expect. I borrowed a Jack Lalane juicer before so that is all I had to compare too. The Hamilton Beach definitly cleans up easier but that might be the only advantage. When you turn it on, you have to hold on tight because it will jump off the counter top if you don't. It works well on hard stuff like apples and carrots. The pulp is moist and there are some large chunks in it though. Don't get this juicer if you want to use leafy greens. I fed 2 cups of kale into it and 2 drops of fluid came out. It reminded me of the juice losener from the Simpsons show. It is low priced so I didn't expect top of the line. That is why I give it 3 stars. If I wanted more, I needed to pay more.
