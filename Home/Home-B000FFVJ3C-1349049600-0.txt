review/summary: Great product!review/text: This is a really great performing product. I was really impressed by the holding capacity of the trays, but i do wish there were one or two more trays. But, I do see how extra layers of trays could affect drying performance. I mostly use this to make dog treats (sweet potato, banana, apple, and carrot chips) and it works perfectly fine. The only gripe that I have with this product is the noise level. It's not incredibly loud, but you can definetely hear it in the background. Would not hesitate to buy this again!
