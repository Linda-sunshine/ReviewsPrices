review/summary: Die, dustbunnies! Die!review/text: Excellent small vacuum for tile or hardwood floors.Doesn't clean carpet very well at all, but Eureka doesn't claim it will. It's adequate for getting lint or cat hair off an area rug, but if you have wall-to-wall carpet, please buy something else.The small bag capacity might be a nuisance if you have exceptionally hairy and shedding pets.
