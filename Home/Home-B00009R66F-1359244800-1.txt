review/summary: Hoover Steam Vac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surgereview/text: I ordered this last Tuesday and received it the next day. It was packaged well, and it took me less than 20 minutes to put it together. It isn't too heavy. I cleaned two of my carpets today and it did extremely well. The carpets had not been cleaned for a long time, and this did a fantastic job! It was very easy to use, not too hard to push around, and the carpets did not take very long to dry. I had considered buying the model with the lift off canister to use on the stairs, but reviewers stated it was hard to put together and very heavy. I got this one instead, and am very glad. It has attachments to clean upholstery and stairs. It was very easy to dump the dirty water tank.It was easy to clean after I was finished. For what I paid for this cleaner, I got more than my money's worth. I definitely recommend this.
