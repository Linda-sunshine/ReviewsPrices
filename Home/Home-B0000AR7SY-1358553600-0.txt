review/summary: Nice burr grinder for the pricereview/text: This is a huge step up from Cuisinart blade grinder I had. That unit was loud and only ground evenly when it was full of beans. Comparatively, the Capresso is much quieter and produces an even grind no matter how few beans are in it. The grind selection feature is a great improvement from the blade grinder. This is a great little machine that performs as it should. No more picking the grinder up and shaking it to get all the beans to grind.
