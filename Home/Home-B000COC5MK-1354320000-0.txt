review/summary: Don't waste your moneyreview/text: This is a review of my SECOND Oster Electric Wine Bottle Opener. I ordered it when the first one died after about 6 months. After leaving this one charging overnight, I attampted to use it. It never seemed as if had enough charge. The motor sounds very labored and slow. It never occurred to me that the item would be lousy, and I threw out the box and packaging as soon as I connected it. That was a mistake. Otherwise I would have returned it. So, I have ordered a more durable (albeit more expensive) model from another company and it works fine. If you absolutely MUST buy this one, at least save the box because you will definitely end up returning it.
