review/summary: Perfect cup every time.review/text: I have been hesitant to buy one of these coffee machines since my last purchase of a Senseo a few years ago. I loved the idea of making one cup of coffee at a time but, the Senseo style coffee pods were WAY TOO STRONG for me and the coffees made me sick! So, I had all but given up on these single cup machines. Then, the other day I was at a friend's house and she offered me a cup of the Donut House Coffee (which is a light roast). YUMMY!! I liked it so much that I ordered the Keurig machine the very next day. Wow!! I love this machine. It makes the perfect cup of coffee every time. So happy with my purchase. I just hope it lasts (and doesn't break down like so many here have described) since I will be using it allot.
