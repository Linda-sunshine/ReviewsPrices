review/summary: Awesome compact dehumidifier!review/text: I'm currently renting a home in NW Washington and during the winters it gets cold and wet. Unfortunately the windows are single paned and there is a huge condensation/mold issue. When I used to take showers the walls were visibly wet and had beads of water collection on the base boards. Now with the dehumidifier I take a shower and the whole room is bone dry within an hour. When the bathroom isn't wet anymore I'll move it into the kitchen for when I'm boiling water or running the dish washer. It will collect about a cup a day...huge improvement and the mold issue is WAY better than it previously was when paired with an anti mold spray.Some have issues with it not working after a while. From what I've read the fan will eventually stop working which in turn makes the dehumidifier useless. You can buy a new fan for less than $5 and replace it if you are somewhat of a handy man.
