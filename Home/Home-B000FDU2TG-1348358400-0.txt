review/summary: Fantasticreview/text: We received this blender as a gift nearly a year ago and love it. It has been used to make everything from mundane frozen fruit smoothies to hummus, and has generally done the job without a hitch. I'm a big fan of KitchenAid products as I also have their stand mixer -- this blender doesn't disappoint. It's powerful, quiet, and has a sleek look to it that lends itself to being left on the counter when not in use.We have had one problem with the blender where the motor stopped working on us. Contrary to other reviews, we found KitchenAid's customer service to be simply outstanding. My husband called the number on the bottom of the blender's base. Within 10 minutes, the service rep had found our warranty information, determined the problem was their fault (even though the motor died while making a double batch of hummus), and had a replacement blender on the way in "5-7 days". Not only was the rep very kind and efficient, the blender actually arrived in under 48 hours. :)I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a blender that can handle most ordinary kitchen tasks. It's a great little blender and KitchenAid has superb customer service in the event that anything goes wrong.
