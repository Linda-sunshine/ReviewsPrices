review/summary: Very cheapreview/text: I didn't really expect much from this product... and it really wasn't much. It's VERY cheap. The lid for mine doesn't open very easily and I feel like it's going to break every time I pull it up all the way. Also, the line between the white plastic and the clear blue part isn't very clean and very messy looking. It basically seems like a cheap product from China. But I knew what I was buying, and for the price it does what it's supposed to do: boil water. I know I won't use it very often, I just keep it in my dorm room just in case I want to make coffee or tea on the spot. If you are planning on using this to drink your everyday morning coffee, I wouldn't recommend it. It seems like it would break very easily. But for those once in a while times for the poor college student, definitely worth it!
