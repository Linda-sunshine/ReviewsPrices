review/summary: Shrinks After First Laundry Cyclereview/text: First off - love, love the fabric finish. Very soft! After unpacking the sheets, I washed them (like I always do for purchased fabric items). I used the warm permanent press wash cycle, and low 40 minute dry cycle for my king sized sheet set. They did not pill. However, the set was noticeably smaller after removing them from the dryer. I have a pillow top mattress and the sheet set barely fit after the first washing. The pillow cases were a major struggle to put on my standard king pillows. I do like the feel of the sheets, but they should be either pre-shrunk, or made slightly larger than a king sized mattress to earn a &#34;luxury&#34; label.
