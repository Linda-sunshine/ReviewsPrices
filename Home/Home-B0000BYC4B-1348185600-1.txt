review/summary: Fabulous for pantry storagereview/text: I use canning jars to store dry goods in my pantry. Unlike thinner plastic bags and containers, the thick glass keeps all pests out. It's super easy to pour rice, oats, popcorn kernels, etc out of the jars. The plastic lids make this even better because I don't have to fiddle with bands and lids each time. I keep a bunch of each size in a drawer, ready to use. As others have noted, they can leak when used for liquids. When I use them with liquids I take extra care not to tip or shake them. On the rare occasion that I did have leakage, it was minimal and required a lot of shaking to even get it to leak in the first place. I consider these a must-have in my kitchen.
