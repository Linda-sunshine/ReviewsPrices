review/summary: Easy Excellent Exactreview/text: I couldn't be happier with ours. Set it in the early AM to go off sometime in the late PM and you'll come home to the base of a fantastic dinner. Looking for a treat? After it is all cooked, sprinkle some white or brown sugar on brown rice and add berries, nuts, or raisons (or all of the above). It even takes well to cream.Of course, for healthy eating, it can't be beat. Add anything to it and whatever you invented will taste great.The 2 cups max for this cooker makes more than enough for my husband and me - 1.5 cups is just about right. I think it could easily serve 3 to 4 adults, especially if the rice is mixed with other things.Best - it's EZ to clean.
