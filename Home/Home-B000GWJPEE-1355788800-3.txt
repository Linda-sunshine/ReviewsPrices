review/summary: hard to clean so it gets moldy fast and is unusable after a few monthsreview/text: First, buy a hygrometer to measure humidity. Without that, you don't know if your humidifier is doing it's job or not. A $8 Chaney wall thermometer (also sold by acu-rite) works just fine. I calibrated mine, for info just google "hygrometer calibrate potassium carbonate".This *could* be a great humidifier, but there are major problems with it.1. Barely puts out any water. I have a whole house humidifier (which I HIGHLY recommend) and keep it at 40%. I put the Crane in my 10'x12' baby's room and kept door shut for two days, and humidity only rose to 43% -- barely worth using.2. tiny opening in the tank (about 1.75"), so it's really hard to clean it well. And tank is a medium blue plastic and most of it is textured so you can't see in clearly.Unless you clean it every few days with a 10% bleach solution (as recommended by the Mayo Clinic), it will get funked up. Since you can't see in easily, it's easy to miss dirty areas until they become nasty. I sometimes forgot to clean mine for a week -- and once it gets funked up you can't get in there with your hand or a brush to thoroughly clean out the funk, so it has to be thrown away. Much better to spend $70 and have one that is easy to clean and puts out a lot of humidity.
