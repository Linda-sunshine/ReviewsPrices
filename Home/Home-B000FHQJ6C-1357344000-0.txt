review/summary: Can be annoyingreview/text: Juices well but the clean up is gross. In the instruction manual it says to put a plastic bag in the pulp 'collector' (wtf?).If you don't, then you're pretty much stuck cleaning orange, kale, apple or whatever the hell you put in the juicer out of the big brown base. Other than that it does it's job it's just messy and I wish they at least sold bags that are fitted to prevent the mess.
