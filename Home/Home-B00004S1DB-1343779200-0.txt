review/summary: Coffee grind leaksreview/text: Very nice insulated coffee press as it keep the coffee still hot/warm after 4 hours. But taking one star away because as other reviewer reported, some of the coffee grind do get pass the filter. This is due to the screen is slightly too large that it folds/crimples leaving few gaps between it and the canister. I also tried, as another reviewer suggested, with my old Bodum press with this, and it fit perfectly (not gap). I also notice that the coil on the Bodum is stiffer, that may also help. Overall, still happy with this purchase based on the price/value.
