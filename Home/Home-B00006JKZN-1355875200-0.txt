review/summary: Great Waffles, Mediocre Hingereview/text: Im not sure if my model is defective but the hinge is failing after 1 use, but i am giving it the benefit of the doubt because it makes superb waffles.These thin waffles are what I find at Spires Restraunt down the street but mine are now better.
