review/summary: Gas cooking Is not a problem.review/text: I have 2 sizes of this pan 12&#34; and 8&#34;. I cook on gas so have no problems. It is so slick the oil does run away from the center because my stove is not perfectly level. Gas is infinitely adjustable and I never seem to burn things even on the highest heat so long as I keep an eye on what's cooking. Cleaning is so easy. I will buy the 10&#34; soon.My other pans are 30-70 year old cast iron&#8211;still the best for high heat and oven cooking.
