review/summary: Excellent machinereview/text: Note: I did not buy this at Amazon. I bought it at a local store.I am reviewing the Cuisinart Prep 11 Plus 11-cup food processor. It should be noted that the only thing I use this machine for is shredding cabbage and carrots to make my own cole slaw. Therefore I cannot comment on its use for liquids or breads or other uses. But for this use, it is flawless and a joy to use.The Cuisinart replaced a Hamilton Beach BigMouth food processor that had developed a leaky bearing or motor seal, allowing black gunk to get into the food. The Hamilton Beach unit was extremely noisy, awkward to clean, and difficult to get all the shredded salad out of it. The Cuisinart, by contrast, is quiet, much easier to feed the food into, easier to get the salad out of since there are no pesky protrusions inside the food bowl, and easier to clean.I originally bought the Hamilton Beach unit because it was a lot cheaper. But as Click & Clack say, "The stingy man pays the most." By trying to save money, all I did was waste money since I had to throw it out after a year. Spend the money to buy a good unit to begin with!Attaching the shaft to the shredding disk is a little tricky, and the instructions were not entirely clear: You have to use the little sliding switch to hold the pin in while you set the shaft into the disk and turn it into place. Once you realize this, it is very easy. But until you realize it, it's not immediately obvious how it fits in. Look at the picture in the owners manual, and then slide the white plastic switch back to withdraw the pin, and it will go into place easily.I highly recommend this machine for shredding veggies. I have no experience using it for anything else.
