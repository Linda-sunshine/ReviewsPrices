review/summary: Very fine machine. Nicely donereview/text: I just got it so I don't know how long it will last but I love how its made and runs.Very smooth. The leftovers are very dry so no money wasted there.And I love how wide opening is. You can put an entire bunch of whatever you juice.Juicing just got more pleasant for me.
