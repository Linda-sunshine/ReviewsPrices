review/summary: i think it stinksreview/text: i never considered buying a k cup brewer but received the b60 model as a gift. i was happy with my coffee maker at home, so against my better judgement, brought it to work for my employees. the k-cup's taste horrible. its not warm enough. the cup size is tiny even on the largest setting. and the k-cups are expensive. if you look at the cost to brew a tiny k-cup, its probably a dollar. if you were to brew a decent sized cup, a medium from a coffee shop for example, it would require two k-cups; equaling two dollars which is the same you would pay for a really good cup at a coffee shop but the k-cup tastes inferior!! being an optimist, i bought the earth friendly "brew your own grounds k cup filter". put the grounds in that i use every day and it tasted very different from the k cup brewer and not for the better. BUT ABOVE ALL, THOSE LITTLE K-CUPS ARE BAD FOR THE PLANET. K CUP MAKES A LOUSY CUP OF COFFEE AND IS BAD FOR THE PLANET. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND BUYING IT AND WISHED I HAD RETURNED IT. (not to mention that if you like a few cups in the am, you havae to brew each one separately which is more work when you dont have time). HATE IT........
