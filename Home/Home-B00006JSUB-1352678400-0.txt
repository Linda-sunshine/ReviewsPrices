review/summary: Do not buy online, read why!review/text: The quality control of the surface is not great. I got this one at Bennys and got the last one that had a smooth surface, the rest were gritty/pebbly as some reviewers complain about. I do love this skillet, great non stick, even heat, just buy in store so you are sure to get a smooth one. It's hit or miss with buying online so if you do at least know you're taking that risk.
