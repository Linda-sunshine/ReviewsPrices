review/summary: I love my canner.review/text: I was very hesitant about buying this canner because of it's size. But I'm so happy I did. It works great and the size is not that bad after all. It fits on my 30&#34; gas stove just fine. I agree with the other reviews on buying the 3 piece Presto regulator to go with this canner. Even though you can set the pressure using the gauge & your stove top burners by adjusting the flame or heat setting. It is much easier using the 3 piece regulator instead. My stove is not that precise on the heat settings so getting it just right is hard to do. With the 3 piece regulator you don't need to worry about it. Just use 1 piece for 5 psi, 2 pieces for 10 psi & 3 pieces for 15 psi. No need to worry about precise stove settings. I'm not sure why Presto wouldn't give you this one instead of the 1 piece regulator that comes with the canner. I can't imagine the 3 piece would cost that much more to manufacture than the 1 piece especially since it's so inexpensive to purchase by itself. The gauge is certainly useful in watching what the pressure is for your own info. I definitely recommend this canner to anyone wanting do some canning and/or pressure cooking. My canned Chili is gonna be real good on some cold wintry day.
