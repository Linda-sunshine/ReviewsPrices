review/summary: Excellent Valuereview/text: I was determined NOT to shred cheese by hand this year for the Macaroni & Cheese I always serve for Christmas dinner, so I purchased this Food Processor with that task in mind. It performs that task flawlessly ... think of it as a wood chipper for cheese. An hour-long task normally done by hand, (with a few scrapped knuckles and some under-my-breath profanity) was reduced to 5 minutes to shred two 1-lb blocks of sharp cheddar cheese. It took me longer to put the processor together for the task than to actually DO the task. The machine showed absolutely no signs of strain, neither visibly nor audibly ... the whine of the motor only slightly reduced as the cheese was fed down the chute.The only other use I've put this processor to was making the dough for pizza. I followed the recipe in the enclosed "Use and Care & Recipe Booklet" that ships with the processor, and was entirely successful. Again there was no strain as the motor mixed the rather heavy dough in seconds, using the pulse mode as recommended. The only issue I had was the small amount of dough that migrated down the shaft from the inside of the bowl to the underside, making a little mess at the point where the shaft exits the motor. Other than that I was quite please with the operation, and intend to branch out to some other bread recipes I have.Some people might have an issue with there being only 2 speed settings on this processor, fully ON or Pulse, but since I have a blender with over 16 speeds and only use 2 ... I knew this wouldn't be a problem for me.This food processor is an excellent value ... at $99.95 you can't go wrong.
