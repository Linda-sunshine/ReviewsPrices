review/summary: Great value!review/text: Nonstick is good quality, handle is very nice. The shape works well for saut&eacute;ing. The red dot that indicates its heated seems to work, but I don't really pay attention to it. This pan is medium weight for an aluminum pan, so it won't hold a ton of heat. If you put too much food in, the temp will drop and you'll be steaming. I use a heavier pan when I really want to sear a piece of meat. But, as nonstick skillets go, this one is very good and cheap enough that you won't be sad when it finally wears out as all nonstick pans eventually do.
