review/summary: Really great for the pricereview/text: I really like this pot! It cooks evenly and is easy to clean. I store it on my stove top and it looks great as a display piece. The color is vibrant and beautiful! I've only used Caphalon in my kitchen and was worried that cooking on enameled cast iron would be difficult , it's not. It works wonderfully and I greatly prefer it to my other Dutch oven. My only concern is that after cleaning the inside rim of the pot where the lid touches it looks like it is developing a little rust. I'm afraid to use anything abrasive to remove it so I've just been extra cautious when washing and make sure to dry it completely before putting the lid back on.
