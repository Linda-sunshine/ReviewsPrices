review/summary: Awful productreview/text: Do not waste your money! I bought this just over a month ago to replace an immersion blender that I used for over 10 years. This blender is completely unusable after THREE uses, and unfortunately, literally three days after the return window. The attachment is connected via a cheap plastic part which is 100% stripped after using the blender for two well-cooked broccoli soups and a butternut squash soup. Extremely disappointing. Don't believe the good reviews here.
