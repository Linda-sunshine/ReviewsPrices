review/summary: Better than tassimoreview/text: We had a tassimo machine for years. We liked it because it made lattes. That machine just broke down, so we started looking at other options. We were spening a lot of money on coffee and wanted a machine that let us use a fillable filter. Since you can adjust cup size with this machine, you can make an espresso shot. We bought a frother and we make great lattes with this machine. We are saving money since we use the generic coffee filter 80% of the time. I would recommend making the switch from tassimo.
