review/summary: No grounds in coffee if you use the filters!!review/text: I have to say after the first try the coffee came out wonderful. Love that it doubles as a thermos too so coffee stays nice and hot.I was concerned when I read about coffee grounds escaping into the coffee-- on first try I used the paper filters that came with it and I didn't experience this problem.My only recommendation would be to use 2 tablespoons coffee grounds per 6oz of filtered water.Thanks Presto!!
