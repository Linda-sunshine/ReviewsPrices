review/summary: Great juicer if you want quick and easy to cleanreview/text: It took me a while to decide on a jucier. I'm new to juicing and the information out there was overwhelming. I decided on this one because I wanted the benefits of juice but it needed to be quick to fit into my busy lifestlye. Not only does this juicer juice incredibly fast but it is also easy to clean. I juice mostly vegetables and while I know I could get more out of a masticating juicer this one serves my purposes for now.
