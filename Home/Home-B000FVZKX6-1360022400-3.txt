review/summary: Thick, warm, snuggly, awesomereview/text: These sheets are extremely thick and well made. I love the color and the texture. I would recommend these to anyone. They are super heavy weight flannel However the one caveat is that they are very very warm. I keep my bedroom very cold, I would not like these in a warmer setting and will only use them in the winter.The quality is excellent regardless.
