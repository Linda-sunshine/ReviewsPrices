review/summary: Performs as advertised, easy clean up, no buyer's remorsereview/text: I had done a small amount of research prior to purchasing a juicer and am satisfied with my choice. This is probably about as good as you are going to get at this price point; to get better performance than this, you would probably have to spend three figures or more. The few extra drops of juice may be worth it for some, but I think most people will be pleased with the production of this juicer.The mouth on this juicer is large enough to accommodate a medium -size apple without quartering it. The pulp that is left is damp but not completely dry. The catch bin is just the right size to fit with a plastic grocery bag, and the cup is a little larger than twelve ounces; stop juicing when you reach the taper to be able to pour your juice directly into a cup from your cabinet. The included brush makes scrubbing the screen easier and more convenient than using a sponge with less mess and no shredding. Disassembly for cleaning is a matter of undoing two catches, and the places where the pulp might stick are not so fine as to make wiping them out impossible. This might change if you wait to clean it; wash immediately after juicing and before anything has a chance to dry for best results. The plastic parts are dishwasher safe, but I'm not willing to risk the mesh given how fine it is and how precisely it fits.Sturdy enough for daily use, this is a great introductory juicer that has performed well in the time that I have had it.
