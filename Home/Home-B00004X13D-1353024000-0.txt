review/summary: Great Waffles, Stores Easy!review/text: You can't beat this waffle iron for the price. It makes really great waffles, and stores in the space of a cereal box. Sometimes we eat waffles several times a week and sometimes only once a month. Didn't want to spend a fortune or have something that took up limited cabinet space. This fit the bill. In a perfect world it would make a sound when the waffle was done, and give you options for for lighter and darker. But like I said for the price it's perfect for our needs. We like Bob's Red Mill waffle mix the best!
