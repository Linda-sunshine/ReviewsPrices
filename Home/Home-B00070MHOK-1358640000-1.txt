review/summary: Alright... for a short timereview/text: I bought one of these a couple years ago and it worked fine for a little while. the water containers not th ebest design and it started sputtering right off the bat. It's definitely not something that you would be able to use at many angles.. again because the water container only holds the water in a certain position, you would only be abl eto hold it very upright in order to steam anything.Mine also started leaking out the base. I don't know when it happened, but at first I attributed it to all the sputtering that was coming out of the spout.After a year or so it just stopped working. the light would turn on, but nothing would heat up. It wasn't until then that I actually realized that water was leaking through the base (because there's no way it could be the sputter if theres no steam coming out right?)It's a cheap quick fix, but definitely not something I would buy again.
