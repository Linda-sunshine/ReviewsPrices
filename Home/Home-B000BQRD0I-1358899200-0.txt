review/summary: Nice and Compact--Poor Performancereview/text: Cute size, however, the hose directly above the coil (approx. 3 inches) gets super hot, even intolerable to the touch, hence the steam causes it to bend and overheat. Because this part of the hose collapses when hot, additional steam does not come out of the nozzle. Am I disappointed? Not really. I got what I paid for. It 's worth it to go with an industrial or near-industrial one.
