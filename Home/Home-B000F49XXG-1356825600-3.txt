review/summary: Great machine BUT...review/text: works fast, great crema, decent price BUT..very loud, and it vibrates alot, the first one had to be returned because the cup wouldnt stay underneath due to the vibration from the machine adn the countertop shook. The machine doesnt feel cheap, but the vibrations make it feel so. Comparing the Nspresso and other machines that are now out, this one is bigger and possibly not worth the price. May be worth giving it a try since Amazon has a great return policy. But I would choose otherwise.
