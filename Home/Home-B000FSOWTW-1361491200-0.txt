review/summary: It'sl okayreview/text: The bottle opener works perfectly and effortlessly. However the &#34;chiller&#34; if that's what you'd even call it is nothing more than a hollow walled bucket. There isn't enough room to put ice in there with a wine bottle and if you freeze the bucket it quickly thaws due to the open and hollow walls. I wouldn't recommend this product mainly because I don't feel it's worth the money. You would literally only be able to use the opener, and I wouldn't pay that much for an Oster opener..
