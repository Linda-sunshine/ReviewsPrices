review/summary: Perect size for tworeview/text: A great size espresso maker for two. Extremely simple to use and very economical. I use between 1/3 and 1/2 of a rice cooker measuring cup of whole beans. Use good quality espresso beans. Check out George Howell's Terroir Coffee web site or Paradise Coffee Roasters. Grind them at "fine" in your burr grinder. For the full Italian enjoyment, I like using the ACF 10oz late' cups with 1/3 milk/foam to 2/3 espresso.
