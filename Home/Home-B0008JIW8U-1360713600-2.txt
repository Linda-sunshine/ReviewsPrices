review/summary: Cute but WEAKreview/text: The coffee pot is small and makes 2 cups of coffee. Bigger problem is that the coffee flows through so quickly that it doesn't have time to brew in the basket. The amount of coffee I have to use exceeds what I needed for a large pot!Frustrating and little savings. Boo.
