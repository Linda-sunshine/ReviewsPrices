review/summary: Best humidifierreview/text: This humidifier is quiet and works great. I operate mine on low in a smaller room and only have to refill once every couple days or so. Only buy your filters though on the Honeywell site as they do not sell Honeywell filters on amazon. They only sell "replacement filters" for this product here- But they are not true Honeywell quality.I LOVE this humidifier though. Very easy to use, simple, quiet. I've had mine for 2 years now and works great.
