review/summary: Given as a giftreview/text: I bought this for my grandson who's an enthusiastic would-be chef. He needed a heavy-bottomed large pot in which to braise meats and simmer stews over several hours.As I have the same pot in red, I purchased this one for him in the hope that he'll have the same luck with his Lodge cast iron that I've enjoyed with mine.
