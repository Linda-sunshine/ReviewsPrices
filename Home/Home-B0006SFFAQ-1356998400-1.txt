review/summary: brews very gooood coffee.....review/text: very classy design. Read the reviews before I decided. So far, no condensation problem, the stair indicator for water seems okay once you get used to it. I would understand a left handed dominant would have problem filling the water reservoir, coz it only allows you to pour it at a certain angle. Over-all once you get the right mix of brew you like, it makes really tasty coffee, hopefully it will last longer than a year then I would really consider this 5 stars. So 1 star less for just having it for 2 days. so far a good buy.
