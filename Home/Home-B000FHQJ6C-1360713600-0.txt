review/summary: Absolutely no complaints. Great juicerreview/text: The Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Juicer was significantly cheaper than some of the offerings but I have had nothing but good experiences with this unit. I primarly juice beets which the Hamilton performs quite well at. This is a quality juicer and I would recommend this to anyone who is starting to juice and doesn't want to break the bank to do so.
