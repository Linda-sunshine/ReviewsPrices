review/summary: great juicer to get you started in juicingreview/text: I'd been thinking about getting a juicer for awhile and then I saw Fat Sick & Nearly Dead and that finally convinced me to make a purchase. I decided to go with this one because I saw it in the movie and because the price is right. I didn't want to spend a lot of money not knowing if I'd take to juicing. As it turns out I love juicing and this is a great juicer to get someone started in it. This juicer quickly juices everything I've ever put in it and I feel that it's producing a decent amount of juice. However, I don't have another juicer to compare it to.. A big mixing bowl full of vegetables and fruit produces a little over two mason jars of juice. It's a smaller juicer so you need to stop and clean out the fiber once it fills up which doesn't take long. Usually I can get those two mason jars full before I need to clean it out. Cleanup is a little lengthy (about 10-15 minutes) but it's not difficult. The hardest part is scrubbing the strainer but mostly you just have to thoroughly rinse everything. You need to rinse it quickly after use otherwise the plastic will stain. I also periodically put all the parts in the dishwasher. It comes apart and goes back together easily. The compact size is handy for carrying around, storage, and it takes up less counter space. I would definitely buy this juicer again although I might consider a larger one in the future. I'e only been using this juicer for a month so I can't comment on the durability or reliability.
