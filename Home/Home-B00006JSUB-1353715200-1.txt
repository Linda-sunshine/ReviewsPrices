review/summary: Lodge is the best!!review/text: I own several pieces of cast iron and Lodge is the best!! I swear by it. I also own a 5 qt. Double Dutch Oven where the lid is also a 10 1/4 in skillet when you turn it over. I love that skillet for smaller jobs but needed a bigger one. I could have gone with the 12 inch but decided &#34;Size really does matter&#34;!! LOL. When you're fixing dinner for several people or preparaing a larger recipe, this is the big gun you haul out. Like all cast iron, this one's heavy and a beast, which is why it's good to have that secondary handlle. But I can handle it (pun intended) and it's a good work out. Like other reviews it's good that it comes pre-seasoned but I season it anyway before I use it the first time and occasionally after that. It helps build up that black shiny patina you want faster and increases the no stick properties. Like other recommendations, rub a light coating of vegatable oil over the skillet, turn it upside down, place it on the middle rack and bake it for an hour at 350 degerees. Cook with bacon grease or any other animal fat you want. but when seasoning and storing use only vegetable oil so that it does not turn rancid.
