review/summary: Great But For One Design Flawreview/text: We've had this coffeemaker for 5 months, during which time the pot has overflowed during brewing on numerous occasions (as reported here by others). The odd thing is that it doesn't always overflow--just sometimes, usually when making a larger pot. After the first overflow, I came here to read more reviews. I found the one written by an engineer who did some troubleshooting and discovered that the problem stems from a vent hole in the lid that is too small. As coffee brews into the pot the air inside is displaced and compressed; it needs an escape route, thus the vent hole. But the engineers at Cuisinart miscalculated and made the vent too small. It consists of two small (3/32") holes in the lid, one on the bottom (inside when the lid is in place) and one on the side in between the threads that screw the lid into place. Apparently, the idea is that the air escapes into the thread channel and follows it around to escape near the pour spout.To fix the overflow problem I simply used a 1/8" drill bit to enlarge the two holes and carved out a small section the size of the new hole in the threads where the hole is located on the side of the lid. I cleaned up my carving with an Exacto knife and ran a thin wire through the vent to ensure that there were no plastic bits left from the drilling. Now the brewing coffee drains into the pot fast enough to avoid overflowing and the coffeemaker brews great coffee (provided that you put great coffee into the brew basket!).If it hadn't been for the need to modify Cuisinart's design, I would have given this coffeemaker 5 stars. Maybe they will correct this deficiency in the future.
