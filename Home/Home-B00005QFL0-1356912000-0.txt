review/summary: Broke just after the warrantly endedreview/text: This bread machine came highly recommended. I used it approximately once every 2 weeks (or less). It was great for a while, then one day I dumped in the ingredients as usual but got... floury water. It had just stopped working. I looked online and through the manual for some clue as to what to do, but found nothing. It was not worth shipping it back to NJ for repair, so now it's in the landfill. This bread machine was a disappointment and a waste of money.
