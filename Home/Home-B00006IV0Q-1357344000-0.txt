review/summary: Great Percolaterreview/text: Bought this for my mom for Christmas - She loves it. Makes coffee slower than an auto-drip coffee maker but the taste of perked coffee is much better than coffee made with the usual auto-drip coffeemaker. Mom uses it with the same grind coffee she used with her auto-drip coffeemaker and it works fine. She is using the filters that came with the percolater but plans to use regular coffee filters after she uses these up; coffee filters made for percolaters are too expensive when you can just poke a hole through the regular coffee filters.
