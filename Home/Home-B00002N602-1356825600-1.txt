review/summary: Almost perfectreview/text: It's the right size to cook a roast and it's easy and safe to use. What I usually use it for is to cook up a 3-5 pound boneless chuck roast (when it's in sale). Here's what I do:put in a couple of tablespoons of oliver oil and brown the meat top and bottom. Take the meat out, toss in the trivet and put on top of the roast 2 cut up carrots, 2 stalks of celery cut up and half one large or two medium peeled onions. Throw a few peppercorns, 1 or 2 bay leaves and some dill weed on top and pour in a can of beef stock and add a little water.close the lid firmly and put on the regulator, and after it starts up, it's 45 minutes to a perfect pot roast.Everyone's got tricks for lowering the pressure, I just use a wooden spoon and after turning off the gas burner, I simply push down on the round black rubber and release the pressue until the silver button drops. There! No fuss or hassle and this method does not hurt the unit at all.Yes, the handle is a bit short, but it still works very well, especially since I never have to carry it full to the sink to run cold water to release pressure. I've never had a problem with this pressure cooker (buy the stainless and not the aluminum!)I've had mine for over 3 years and use it mostly in the winter months...I've probably made 20 roasts in the unit.
