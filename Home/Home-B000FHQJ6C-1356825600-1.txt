review/summary: You get what you pay for!review/text: This is a cheap centrifugal juicer. Although the price makes it easier for people to start juicing, it would be a better investment to get a more durable model. The pulp is very moist = wasted juice. The blade rests on a plastic rim and after several uses, my blade heated up and melted the plastic rim. This sent plastic bits into my juice and burnt the motor out. In my opinion, if you are serious about juicing you should do a bit more researching and not get this model.
