review/summary: Interesting Bookreview/text: This book really makes you think and I really enjoyed itJoan (the maim character) has to start thinking for himself and is a good story of a child becoming a man/boyThe only reason why I didn't put 5 stars is because I already read the book once before, so it was a little boring because I already knew what was going to happen. But otherwise it would've been an obvious 5 stars
