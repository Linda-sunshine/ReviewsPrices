review/summary: Great BDAy gift for my bridereview/text: My wife wanted to get an ice cream maker that could make fruit sorbets as well as ice cream. I did the research and found this machine had excellent reviews. I was a little confused as to how much it would produce and had considered the smaller machine. I am glad I went with this machine and this size. It easily makes enough ice cream for six of us. We have fun making different flavors. We cannot wait until the family shows up at Thanksgiving. We will have a blast. We use it about once a week only because we have to show some restraint or we will weight 300 lbs in no time. It is a wonderful treat to select the ice cream to make and then make it.
