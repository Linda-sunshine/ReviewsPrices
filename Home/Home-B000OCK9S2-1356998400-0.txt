review/summary: Does the job but could be betterreview/text: The sound quality on this isn't great; it's tinny. There are plenty of sound options, but most of them I find too distracting; i.e. not calming enough. The sounds I prefer are the ocean and running stream. I wish there was the option to combine sounds as there is in some other machines.The volume on this is plenty loud in my opinion. If you could handle the volume at its peak, you could easily drown out every sound in the house. I have it a little more than 1/4 of the way turned up and this does great at muffling most sounds but won't drown out a loud crash.I like that you can keep the sound on all night or have it on a timer. I only wish that the sound would be gently faded out with the timer mode. Instead, it shuts off abruptly, which can be a little jolting when you are not quite in sleep land yet.I think the blue light on it's lower setting works as a great night light. It's just bright enough to make out the furniture in the room, but not too bright that it wakes you up if you have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The blue light only works if the AC adaptor is used, so if you're planning on taking this on a trip and like the nightlight function, remember to pack the adaptor.All in all, it's not bad for what I paid, but if you're looking for excellent sound quality, I'd look for another product.
