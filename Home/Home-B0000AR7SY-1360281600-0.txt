review/summary: Happy With This Grinderreview/text: I did a lot of checking and reading reviews for this and comparing it to other grinders. I wanted more consistent grinds mainly for french press. I'm very happy with it. It makes very consistent grinds and it is easy to use. For the people that complain about the mess I would say it's a coffee grinder, of course there is a bit of a mess! My experience is that any coffee grounds that get around from static are very minor, though. Not a problem for me. Clean up is easy, too. My advice for those buying it would be to take a few seconds to read the directions, especially in regards to turning off the timer, so you don't damage it. I suppose I could have paid twice as much or more for a better grinder, but from what I've seen out there the advantages would be very minor.
