review/summary: A definite upgrade from the basicreview/text: We replaced our original model, the basic white one, with this after ten years of reliable service. While the old one did the job, this upgrade is much better in function, design and construction. The dial is easier to read, the device can be programmed without reading the instructions, and it looks rather sharp. The AM/FM radio sound is not stellar but more than does the job in the case of an emergency. Would definitely recommend it.
