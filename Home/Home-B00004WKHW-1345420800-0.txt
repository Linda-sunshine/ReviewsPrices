review/summary: Fits the Billreview/text: I cook for two people, and I don't do huge amounts of prepping vegetables, but I've always wanted a food processor. My daughter got one of these and recommended it, so I gave it a go, and I am very happy. Today I ground up raw cauliflower into a rice-like consistency, and it was super fast and easy. Also, finely chopped onions in a flash. Super easy to clean and simple to operate.Before you order, take out some bowls and measure to see what 3 cups looks like--it is small--the bowl is maybe the size of a grapefruit. But that has its plusses--it fits neatly on the counter next to the coffee maker. If it has to go under the counter, it will collect dust.The motor is strong and the blade is sharp. I am not certain how durable the plastic parts will be, but I will be careful with it. It does seem that a small plastic part could snap off, rendering it useless. Still, the price is right!
