review/summary: Love This Panreview/text: I just used this pan for the first time. It is a wonderful addition to my cooking utensils. It is a large fry pan and for that fact alone I love it. I do agree with most of the reviews on the cast iron products that the seasoning on these pre seasoned pieces could be better. HOWEVER, let it be known seasoning is so simple. Also just using the pan frequently makes it improve with age. I have been familiar with cast iron pans since I was a child. They are heavy pieces but so worth the lift. :) Cleaning the residual food off, as you never use soap, is so simple. Use a plastic card, for instance an old credit card, to scrape the pan. However I do not necessarily say to use a credit card as I do not believe in letting them lay around. I just wanted to get the idea of what type of card across to you. Nothing beats cast iron cooking. I am trying to replace all my pans and pots with cast iron. Obviously very satisfied. Hope you find this helpful.
