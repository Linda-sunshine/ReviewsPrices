review/summary: defectivereview/text: The kettle worked great for us for about a month. then i started noticing when I would come back to the kettle later in the day, there would always be a pool of water around the heating element on the counter. I finally realized that the seam between the silver metal and the black base of the kettle has a leak so water is coming out. EVERY time i use it.i'm pretty sure this is a safety issue considering the way this product works.looked at the return policy and looks like I'd only get a partial refund and have to pay for shipping myself to send it back. pretty disappointing, i'd rather have a replacement since it sounds like everyone else's kettles are working without a hitch.EDIT: Amazon refunded my pot and is letting me ship it back at to extra cost to me. Will be purchasing a good ol' stovetop kettle from amazon instead. can't go wrong with that. Thanks!
