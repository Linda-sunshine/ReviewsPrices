review/summary: Awful product.review/text: Awful design. Since the toaster part of the Hamilton Beach 22708 Toastation toaster and Mini-oven takes up 3/4 of the space of the oven there isn't even room to bake a potato. I would stop stocking this item if I were you. Resented having to pay such a high shipping price to return it.
