review/summary: Reliable and durablereview/text: Four years later, this thing is still working, which is great.It isn't an advanced grinder. It's not going to let you set it for a french press vs. an espresso machine. If that's what you want, you'll want something more expensive.But this was dirt cheap and it grinds coffee for a percolator very nicely, and it has lasted a very long time for me. I can't make precisely artisanal coffee using it, but it works and I'm satisfied.
