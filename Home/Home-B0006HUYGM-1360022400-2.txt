review/summary: This little baby is a winner!review/text: I just used this little powerhouse for the first time on my staircase. I was appalled at the amount of dirt it picked up. It didn't look that dirty! That first time has justified this purchase. Putting the cleaning attachments on my Kirby vacuum is a hassle, so the Eureka handheld is a dream come true, that is, if I dreamed about vacuuming things! I like the ability to brush-clean the risers, that's where the dog hair settles. Thank you, Eureka!
