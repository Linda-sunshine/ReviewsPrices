review/summary: Great but a little heavy for Lahey's no knead breadreview/text: I didn't know how much I would be using this dutch oven for baking bread when I bought it or I would have paid a little more for the Lodge Logic 4 quart one with the big loop handles (model P10D3). This one is pretty large and heavy to take in and out of a blistering hot oven, expecially when it's blisering hot itself, and the bigger handles and slightly smaller size of the 4 quart one might make the job of baking a little easier and safer. But if you're strong and agile, this dutch oven certainly works for the purpose of making terrific rustic Italian bread.The only other fault is that it didn't come particularly seasoned (as it was advertised), but that's pretty simple to take care of.
