review/summary: I wish it wasn't plastic, but otherwise goodreview/text: I have owned one of these for about 4-5 years, and decided to buy one for my mother for christmas. She loves it. She's never had a food processor before. I love mine and use it often, esp, when tasked with a big meal for a big family. My only complaint is I wish it was glass, not plastic, esp. at the hefty price! No matter how many times I was it, the plastic doesn't look clean and has become &#34;dingey&#34; over the years. If you don't have a dishwasher, it really gets disgusting, not matter how hard you try to clean it.
