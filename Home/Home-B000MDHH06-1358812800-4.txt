review/summary: Well Worth the Pricereview/text: This is my third juicer since I started my family. I had tried Champion and Jack Lalane. They were all good brands but this one from Breville really works its wonders. First off, the great style of the juicer speaks for itself, it looks great sitting on the counter. You could totally see that it is of high quality and it would fit well in any kitchen. The motor blades in the juicer are of high caliber because I have used this for over 6 months now, and it still works well. And take note, I use it every day. The pulp tray is also different from the other juicers that I had. And if you ask me, I like this way better. And for me, the best part is that I could easily clean it. Best deal for a homemaker, right?
