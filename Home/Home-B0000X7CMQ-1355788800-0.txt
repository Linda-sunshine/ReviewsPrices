review/summary: Defective AND defective replacementreview/text: I got my significant other this machine for Christmas, along with a conical burr grinder and an excellent (if I do say so myself) selection of beans from a great micro roastery.When I received the package, I was immediately disappointed by how light it is. The construction does not feel solid at all. but I shook off my concerns and continued. We plugged in this baby to take her for a spin, and as we poured coffee into the reservoir, water began to leak out of the bottom of the machine. It didn't stop until the reservoir was empty. Having already applied for our warranty, we called the company only to be told that our best bet was to go through Amazon if we were hoping for a new device rather than repairing the one we had. We went through Amazon and the new machine showed up in a day.We plugged in THIS baby to take her for a spin, and as we poured coffee into the reservoir, water began to leak out of the bottom of the machine! It didn't stop until the reservoir was empty!!So this time instead of ordering a replacement, I will be ordering a refund. I think the Cuisinart line is looking good...
