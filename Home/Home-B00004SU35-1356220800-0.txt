review/summary: Clean up nightmarereview/text: I bought one of these about 8 years back and found it to be a poor product. The main problem is that the lid is amazing for capturing butter and/or oil which is fantastic if you enjoy spending three times as long cleaning your pot as it took to make the popcorn. Seriously, look at the think, it is articulated with a very nice hinge for each half of the lid (lots of butter/oil trap locations), there is also the bar in the middle, which is ridged (more nooks and cranies), also the gear system which allows the oil and butter to waft up to the top of the lid. And the two per lid side air vents? More detailed areas yet to be cleaned. Seriously a PITA. Not just that but the lid is flopping around as you are cleaning it and the edges aren't exactly well finished. The little scrubbing twigs inside? Yet more stuff to be cleaned.Going off my main them here but, the sound of it when being turned is just not as pleasant as you might imagine a steel nail loosely scraping an thin aluminum pan might be.What I do to make popcorn is use a 6 quart pot with a lid and physically lift and shake it, holding the lid down with the thumbs of course. The main goal in making popcorn is to allow the uncooked kernels to fall back to the bottom, as long as the shaking is vigorous enough and the pot not too full, it will work. My popcorn comes out nice and fluffy and I even make kettle corn this way. Watch how the pros do it at the farmers market, heck, they don't even use a lid. They use a wooden spoon, I tried that but had too many kernels escape, probably works better with a huge 3-4 ft diameter wok like they have.One star because it makes popcorn, a second one because it does move the kernels around.
