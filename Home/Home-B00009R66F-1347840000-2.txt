review/summary: Hoover Steam Vacreview/text: I recently purchased a Hoover Steam Vac from you. The Vac works well, however on the second use, the clip that holds the upright part of the Vac broke off which makes it very difficult to do stairs or move to the second floor. The reason I replaced our old Hoover Steam Vac was the very same thing. I would suggest you contact the Hoover Company and tell them of the poor construction. I tried to tell Hoover about my problem but they recommend I go to one of their dealers. Hope you can help
