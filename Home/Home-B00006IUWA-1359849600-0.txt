review/summary: Best Popcorn Popper EVERreview/text: My first hot-air popcorn machine and I am thoroughly satisfied. The Presto popper works as advertised! The only thing I noticed was the popcorn seemed to become stale faster than microwave popcorn, I guess this is probably caused by the lack of oil and may be the same for all hot air poppers.
