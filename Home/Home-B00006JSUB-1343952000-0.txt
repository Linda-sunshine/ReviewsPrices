review/summary: Awesome!review/text: I have never purchased anything from the Lodge line of cookware. I bought the 12" Cast Iron skillet on Amazon and was honestly a little concerned with what kind of quality I would be getting because the price was so low.I love this skillet! It's really a perfect cast iron skillet. I am constantly destroying my skillets and thought cast iron might be smart for me. I purchased this a couple months ago and have used it multiple times. I burnt the crap out of a blackberry cobbler last week and was worried I had damaged my pan. The sugar was completely scorched. A stiff brush and some hot water and this thing was good as new (the poor cobbler wasn't so save-able). If this thing can stand up to me, it can stand up to anything!I now realize I do need to improve my upper body strength :) The Lodge 12" Skillet is very, very heavy. Not a complaint, it should be heavy - but I do have a little trouble getting it in and out of my oven. If it didn't have the extra handle, I would not be able to lift this pan at all.Awesome quality, great price, smart design - of all the items in my kitchen, this pan is my favorite.
