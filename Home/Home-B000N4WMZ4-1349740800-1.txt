review/summary: Great Potreview/text: I got this pot for 2 reasons, to make fried chicken and for great big batches of chili. This pot is great, it holds the temperature of the frying oil at a steady temperature and its so big you can fry a 4.5 pound chicken all at once. I noticed some reviewers complained about the weight, curious, you expect cast iron to be light? I've only had the pot for about 3 weeks so I can't comment on the durability of the enamel coating. One other reviewer complained about the lid not fitting, perhaps he got a lemon, my lid fits perfectly.
