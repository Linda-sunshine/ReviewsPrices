review/summary: Oh so nice, easy to use!review/text: Ok, I am officially spoiled now just by using this rechargable wine bottle opener. Lol I love it, works excellent and has a nice docking station with small footprint to store on the counter. Stainless steel makes it look so upperclass and the chiller container is well made and big enough to actually use with company too! The button is very nice feeling and the whole thing is really well made....no more fighting to turn, crank that stupid manual opener again. Ya sold me with this little number...it is a keeper...had it just two days and have used it three times. Ha!
