review/summary: Needs modification to pour well.review/text: Got this because my cheap Walgreens brand one was discontinued. Have the same issue as others....the lid does not stay on. I had to tape it down in order to prevent it from spilling water all over. Seriously...this shouldn't be. It should not need to be modified in order to work properly. I also notice when I do pour it water gets between the clear pitcher and the reservoir and if I didn't tape it down I suppose this would inhibit even more leaking. The filter change indicator is a joke as it doesn't actually monitor the cleanliness or action of the filter but actually simply counts the pours you do. After a certain amount of pours it simply light red indicating you need to change the filter whether the filter is actually still filtering or not. It doesn't give me any better tasting water that my old cheap Walgreens one but since Walgreens discontinued it I had no choice but to replace it. I had absolutely no issues with my Walgreens one. I'll just have to grin and bear it and keep mine taped up. One thing I will mention it prior to taping the cover down I did notice that it didn't even sit flush to the top. The pour end stuck up a bit no matter what I did. Not worth returning if a bit of tape was all it needed to work properly but that shouldn't be the case. For being such a HUGE leader in the home water filtering industry I am very surprised they have such a poor designed product.
