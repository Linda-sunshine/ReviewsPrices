review/summary: Love it!review/text: I love this slicer. I use it mostly on zucchini. I use the ribbon setting for a nice presentation of steamed squash. We eat low-carb, so I use the "spaghetti" setting for when we want pasta. I steam the zucchini "spaghetti" and then top with our favorite sauce. The slicer is very easy to operate and also easy to clean.When I first heard about this type of slicer, I did some research on the web and this seemed like it would work the best. I was not disappointed.
