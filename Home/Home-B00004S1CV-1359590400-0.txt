review/summary: If you are actually on-the-go this is NOT the mug for you.review/text: At least in my experience a travel mug with a tea strainer is intended to make it easier than waiting for loose leaf tea to steep at home. This product does not allow for that, the loose leaf tea basket must be removed in order to drink. Once removed you have to carry it around with you some where. What is the point? you might as well steep the tea at home and put it in a mug you already own. Don't buy this product if your intentions were to speed up your daily routine or have less to lug around with you.
