review/summary: Great Stovetop Espresso Makerreview/text: This is my first time using a stove top device and I was very pleased from the first try. I've always used several machines in the past and I think I will like this one.Pros:1) can make small shots with little effort2) easy to assemble3) fast4) easy clean upCons:1) Small on my ceramic cook top so excess heat escapes2) small (but this is also a pro)3) you have to keep an eye on it during the brew process4) no real creamy head on the shotI'm very happy with my purchase and I think you will enjoy it too!
