review/summary: Accurate and cheapreview/text: I only use Taylor thermometers, both at work(I'm a pro chef)and at home, they are the best devices for the money. They are tough, this particular one is water proof, and it lasts a good long time on its battery. Buy it if you want a long lasting temperature probe for your home kitchen that you wont have to replace for many, many years.
