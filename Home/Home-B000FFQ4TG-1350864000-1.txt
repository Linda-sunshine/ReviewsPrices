review/summary: Sooooo Slow!review/text: I work for a small company where I am the one making these little purchases like a new coffee maker. This Bunn is extremely slow! The coffee is made at about 7:30am but it is at least 3:00pm before it is finished brewing! This cannot be normal, otherwise I'm not quite sure how Bunn is such a well-known, and frankly, expensive brand. Very disappointed!
