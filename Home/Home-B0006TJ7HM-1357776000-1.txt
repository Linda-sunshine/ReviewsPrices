review/summary: Doesn't Live Up To The Hypereview/text: I expected sharper knives out of the box. As other people said, some of the knives &#34;tear&#34; your food, instead of slicing or cutting. These are just OK, but even if I never have to sharpen them I would've preferred to buy a &#34;cheaper&#34; set of knives that was sharper out of the box and had to replace them sooner.
