review/summary: Perfect for flaxseedreview/text: I used to have a manual flaxseed grinder but I accidentally knocked it over last month and broke it. It worked well enough but it was always an effort to grind the flax and a lot of work only produced a little bit of product. Because I couldn't find a duplicate of the one I had, and because I am such a big fan of putting flax in my food for a variety of health benefits I decided to give this one a try.Perfect. It grinds the flax up in no time. In fact, I ended up with more ground flax than I needed so I keep the leftover bits in a container in the refrigerator. (For those not familiar with flaxseed your body really only benefits from the seed being freshly ground up and not eaten whole.)So I've found my perfect flaxseed grinder.Needless to say, this works great on coffee as well, but the test for any grinder is flaxseed because it's so small and hard yet this Krups grinder worked like a charm.Highly highly recommended. And easy to clean to boot.
