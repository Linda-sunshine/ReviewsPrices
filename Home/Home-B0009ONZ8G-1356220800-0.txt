review/summary: Quality is lackingreview/text: I have had the vacuum a year now. The power cord has always been in the way, I have placed it in the channel and it doesn't stay. The tubing kinks easy and is very then. As for the suction it is been comparable to my Kirby. I probably would not buy again.
