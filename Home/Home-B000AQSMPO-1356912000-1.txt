review/summary: MAKES TEENY WEENY CUPS!!review/text: This machine is great, makes a nice little cup of coffee. This was given to us as a gift, when I asked for it I should have done more research. I wanted this machine to save money and stop throwing away cash at the coffee shops, also to quit drinking calorie loaded coffee drinks. I like my coffee in the morning, in a travel mug on my way to work. Usually I have 2-3 cups that I can work on thru out the morning. This machines LARGE cup of coffee is smaller than the smallest cup offered at Starbucks. Large as its called, measures out at just over a whopping 9 ounces, the small is a whole 5 and something ounces. I like a cup-a-joe, not a shot! So I go thru 2 or 3 K-cups each morning. Not only that but even after removing the drip tray NONE of our travel mugs even fit, so I use another mug and dirty an extra dish every day. This thing was built for elves. Also trying to find the k-cups that produce bigger cups is impossible.Bottom line: If you like a human sized cup of coffee, get a regular coffee maker!
