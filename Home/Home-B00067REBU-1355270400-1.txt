review/summary: disapointedreview/text: I have had the exact make and model for 20 years. Finally the belt broke and this is the reason I bought a new one. I am disapointed in it. It moves on the counter, It almost stalls when it mixes the dough. It doesn't raise the bread right. It makes a woddling or whipping noise when it mixes. It's made much cheaper than my old one. Its loud. Any suggestions?
