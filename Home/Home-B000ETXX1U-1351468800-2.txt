review/summary: Did what it was suppose to doreview/text: The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the only way to inflate it was with the A/C plug in. not really an option if you are out tent camping like I was when I discovered this little flaw. Fortunately it was not that long of a hike to my ac-dc converter in my truck.....the hike back to the campste was a bit of an adventure with the inflated queen sized bed but we made it. So if you are planning to inflate with any other pump this is not the bed for you....otherwise good quality, held air, and was comfortable.
