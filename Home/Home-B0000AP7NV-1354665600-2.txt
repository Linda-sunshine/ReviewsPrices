review/summary: Cheapreview/text: Since this is the cheaper end of the pitcher, you get what you pay for... Its very small and it fills a few cups up. The filter must be low grade because the water coming streaming through it very fast. Therefore I would get a higher end filter since its probably not doing it's job.
