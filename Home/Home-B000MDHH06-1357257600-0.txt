review/summary: step up.review/text: Last year I bought a Bella juicer from Macys and I liked it except for the clean up and mess. This one is just a tad easier to clean because of where the pulp goes, therefore debris doesn't fly up out of the pulp container. I feel like the clean up is less complicated but otherwise it is still lengthy. This one came with a brush for cleaning the mesh/bladed area. Nice. It also feels like a more smooth suction on pulling the veggies in to be juiced. It's sleek looking and large. I still have to cut my apples to put in the juicer, I am assuming the apples they are talking about that fit are those tiny Fiji apples. Not my green ones. Overall I do like this juicer but I still have to juice for two or three days if I can so I don't have to wake up 30 minutes earlier everday to juice and clean the device.
