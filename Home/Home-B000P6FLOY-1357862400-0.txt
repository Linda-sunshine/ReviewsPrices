review/summary: All about temperature accuracyreview/text: I've already made about three roasts with this thermometer, including a standing rib roast and a couple of pork loin roasts. The results have been spot on every time. I tested the accuracy of the digital temperature with a good analog probe thermometer, just to see if the two temperatures were close. Well, not just close, exact. I was kind of impressed by that. I leave the probe in while the meat is resting, to keep track of the carryover cooking temp. The alarm is loud and relentless, so there is no question when the meat reaches the temp you've set. Easy to use, easy to clean. Handy convertible magnet mount, or you can just set it on the counter and flip up the screen for optimal viewing. If you're using this for meat, as I am, you can't go wrong.
