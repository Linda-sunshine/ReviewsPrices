review/summary: Mr. Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmerreview/text: I gave one of the mug warmers to a friend and was told by her that the hot drink in the cup was not kept hot while on the warmer when it was turned on. So I tried the other warmer that I kept and it too does not keep the drink hot even if I had mircowaved the drink in that warmed up cup. I tested the temperature of my old warmer and the surfaces of the two Mr. Coffee warmers and had a difference of 50-75 Degrees higher on my old warmer. I used a &#34;Deluxe Infrared Therometer w/ Laser&#34; &#34;ATD- Advanced Tool Design &#34; Model ATD-701. I used is tool for mechanic and truck driving to check temperatures on the equipment and any frozen food or other products to watch for temperature varies.
