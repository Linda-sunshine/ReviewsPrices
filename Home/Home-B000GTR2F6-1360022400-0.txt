review/summary: Wanna pay more for bad coffee with extra environmental waste?review/text: Well you're in luck.If it wasn't for so many other commonplace consumer blunders, I would be shocked that these Keurig units have become a mainstay in coffee drinking culture. The fundamental problems as I see it with all these singe serve models are:1. You pay more for coffee.2. The coffee is generally poor quality to start, but the brewing process ensures a bad cup of coffee.3. There are now millions of non-recyclable little plastic cups headed for the landfill.Want a good single cup of coffee, get a quick boiler and a french press, or a single drip cup for over your mug.Virtually any other method of producing a single cup of coffee (while taking perhaps 30 sec. more time) will give you a better cup at a cheaper price.
