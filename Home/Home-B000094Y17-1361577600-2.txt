review/summary: Poor Designreview/text: I have had several Brita pitchers and this one is just poorly designed. I didn't get it from Amazon as I needed it that day.*Yes the filter likes to fall out and I do push it in.*There are many groves, edges and lips around where the lid sits and the lid. This gets DISGUSTING! and I clean mine regularly.--including mold in he hing area*I don't like that you can not pour while it is filter, oh you can but not easily.I am actually here shopping for a new one.
