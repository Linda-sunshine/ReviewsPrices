review/summary: Greatreview/text: This gets lots of wear and tear from my 14 yr. old and her friends. It has held up perfectly. Once you get the right amt. of mix figured out, it's mess free, too. Clean up is so quick and easy that a 14 yr. old can do it. Storage space is minimal. It also can make crispy or soft waffles.
