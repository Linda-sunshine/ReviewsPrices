review/summary: Not original Brita filtersreview/text: This review is for the 10-pack from the seller "Velvet Cake". The filters I received came loosely packaged, and they had purple printing on them. I checked for the "Brita" name, and couldn't find it. They don't exactly look like Brita filters either--side-by-side with original filters (which I'd also bought from Amazon, just not from this seller) you can see differences in the original vs the ones I just received.I think that selling these as actual Brita filters is false advertising, and I haven't decided whether I want to return them or use them anyway. I paid the price I did because I thought they were original filters, and I would not have paid this much had I known they wouldn't be original.
