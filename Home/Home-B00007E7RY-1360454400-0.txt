review/summary: Works well but LOUDreview/text: I run this filter pretty much 24/7 in my bedroom because of persistent mold inside the wall problems (it's a rental, I'm moving soon!)Prior to getting the filter, I had a cough that wouldn't go away and in general felt congested. After getting it and having it on for about 3 days, I could tell an improvement in my sinuses and the cough has gone away.It has 3 settings, turbo, daytime, and sleep.Turbo is REALLY REALLY loud, I pretty much turn it on only when I'm leaving my room, and I use the sleep setting almost exclusively when I'm inside the room.It's a solid filter, works well, and I get a lot of R2D2 jokes.
