review/summary: Probabaly a great product but disappointed in two major factorsreview/text: I hastily bought this product because it does appear to be well built and PUR is one of the better filters on the market, but I am disappointed in two major points and hopefully this helps out anyone considering this product.1. It is a Proctor and Gamble product. I never liked this company or its practices and this just makes me suspicious how &#34;quality&#34; PUR products really are.2. It does not filter out fluoride. And to be fair, any household filter company like Brita and Zero Water do not filter fluoride as well, but for optimal health and safety it should be removed. I won't go into a rant why I hate fluoride but it may be something you want to check out for yourself. There are filters out there, albeit more expensive, that will not only filter out the standard icky stuff like lead and arsenic, but also fluoride as well.So do your research and really get to KNOW what is in your water first. Perhaps even get a TDS tester before buying a filter; know what you are really up against.Hope this helps!
