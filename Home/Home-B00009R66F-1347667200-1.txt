review/summary: Ordinary Userreview/text: I've only used it once. It's easy to assemble and relatively lite in comparison to other carpet cleaners. Since I have only used it once I do not have much to say but it did meet my expectations. It actually cleaned a carpet that hasn't been cleaned in about a year. So it certainly have cleaning power.
