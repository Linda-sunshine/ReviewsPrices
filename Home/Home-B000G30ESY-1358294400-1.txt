review/summary: Its not good , but it is okay to use itreview/text: I wanted some good rice cooker so i bought this one even tho i saw lots of products that cost around $30-40.I dont recommend this one. i mean it works fine but its small and sometimes it is just too hot to touch it.I eat brown rice, it took forever to cook.
