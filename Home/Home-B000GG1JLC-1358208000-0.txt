review/summary: Good Tie Rackreview/text: It does what it says it's going to do - holds my ties. It spins easily allowing you to access ties from any side or partition. It get's 4 stars out of 5, because it is a little flimsy. But, i can't complain for the price that I paid for it. If you have a lot of ties, and don't want to spend a ton of money - this really is a good product.
