review/summary: Absolutely Impressed as Always!review/text: My Mother turned me towards this product. Thank You Mom! I am completely satisfied! I have 2 children under 4 years of age and 2 older dogs. I recently moved into a new home and the last thing I wanted was stains in my rug! SOOO I would borrow my Mom's Hoover carpet cleaner (older version) when needed and it cleaned like new over and over again.In turn I bought myself a present and listened to my Mother's advice and... I couldn't be a happier Mommy : ) Well worth every penny!!!! I promise! If it's a tough stain, dont give up just give it an extra few drive bys and it will be gone before you know it. Better than being on your hands and needs scrubbing or tearing up carpet! If one of my dogs has an accident I dont stress about it anymore I just grab my Hoover. No worries! Easy peasy : ) Enjoy! I do!
