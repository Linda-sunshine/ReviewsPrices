review/summary: I love this Egg boiler!review/text: This is the easiest and very accurate boiler for making hard-boiled eggs. It's easy and quick without having to drag out a pan and lid to use on the stove. Everyone once in a while I get a craving for hard-boiled eggs but I never prepared them because it was a pain to have to place them in cold water, wait for the water to boil then turn it off and let the eggs cook. Now, I can just fill the bottom of this boiler with water, add eggs and put in the microwave for the specified time. Make sure you run cold water over the eggs after preparing them.
