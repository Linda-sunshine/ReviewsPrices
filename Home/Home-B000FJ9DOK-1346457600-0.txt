review/summary: May Be the Best Thing I Ever Boughtreview/text: I've now bought ten of these. I've used them for water, smoothies, and other cold beverages, and they are absolutely some of the best purchases I've ever made. I generally take 2 or 3 of them to work with me every day. They keep beverages cold, they seal securely, they are extremely easy and convenient to use, and I know I'm not ingesting carcinogens in my beverage.The only caution I would give is that YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE BLUE GASKET (RING) IS PROPERLY PLACED IN THE LID BEFORE SCREWING THE LID ON THE BOTTLE. If you don't, the bottle will leak. If the gasket is securely in place, the bottle will not leak. I carry these bottles in my purse with green smoothies in them, which I would not do if there was any chance of leakage. I've been using the bottles daily for a couple of years now, and I've never had one of them leak if the gasket was in place.I wash mine in the dishwasher regularly, and have not had any problems from doing that. I put each lid over one of the spikes on the dishwasher shelf (the ones that are made to hold glasses and cups), with the spike sticking up through the drinking spout. That way if the blue gasket comes out, it stays in place around the spike, under the lid, so I don't need to hunt for it when unloading the dishwasher.If you only use the bottles for water, there's no reason to use a dishwasher, but if you put flavored beverages in there, the dishwasher is the only way I've found to completely eliminate the flavors/odors.
