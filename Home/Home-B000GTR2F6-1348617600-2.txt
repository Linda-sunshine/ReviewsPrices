review/summary: Crappy Coffee Makerreview/text: This coffee pot stopped working with a minimum of use. We had only had it a few months, but were gone for over a month of that time and it was getting no use at all. Plus, my husband is the only drinker of coffee, so it was barely broken in. Of course it stopped working a week after it was possible to make a return. Disgusting waste of money! Do not buy!!
