review/summary: Still working after 25 yearsreview/text: I have had this version of the Krups coffee grinder for 25 years. It is still working like it did when it came out of the box. I am buying one for my daughter. She will be thrilled to get the "same" one because the sound of the coffee grinding will be so familiar.KRUPS 203-42 Electric Spice and Coffee Grinder with Stainless Steel blades, Black
