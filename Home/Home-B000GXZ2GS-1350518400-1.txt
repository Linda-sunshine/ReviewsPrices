review/summary: Not what I expected.review/text: Well I read all the reviews for this product and decided to purchase it. After I opened the box and looked at it the quality was really bad. Well I might be a little harsh but it just wasn't for me. It was way too small and the coffee didn't taste good. It just don't think it's worth it when you can buy one that holds the coffee in it for a while when boiling it. This releases all the flavor out and doesn't taste like watered down coffee. I returned and bought a $25-30 one and I love it.
