review/summary: Great when the price hits below $11review/text: These are odd as the price fluctuates daily it seems like. Sometimes Amazon has them on Prime for under $11 and that is a steal. I have no idea why some people say they have a problem with the top. You have to hold it and secure the inner seal by twisting the handle, I have bought 5 and never had a problem and not one has leaked. We have a couple to infuse vodka. Get fresh pineapple or other fruit and fill these with it and top off with Vodka and seal the lid. Keep for a couple of weeks (fruit never spoils because of the vodka) and lightly shake once a day. they look decorative and you drink the vodka with crushed ice and it's great! We put a bow on them and give them at gifts when we go to a party and people love them. Better than a bottle of wine. Hope this helps.
