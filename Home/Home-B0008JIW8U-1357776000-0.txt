review/summary: Disappointed!review/text: I bought this to replace a Mr. Coffee 4-cup Coffeemaker for which I was having trouble finding a replacement carafe. This coffeemaker is nothing like the older model. I don't like anything about it! New design makes adding water awkward, the on/off switches are located too close to each other which can be confusing. Worst problem, after you have the first cup, even only 10 minutes after brewing, all subsequent cups taste burnt, stale. Awful! This will go in the garbage as soon as I locate another 4-cup brewer.
