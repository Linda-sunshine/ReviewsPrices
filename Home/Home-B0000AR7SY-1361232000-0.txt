review/summary: works for me to make espressoreview/text: I bought this to grind my coffee beans for espresso. I don't understand why people keep saying it doesn't work for espresso because it works for me. I'm using the Breville Infuser and I can get my grinds fine enough to choke the machine. Even though it has only 16 step settings, you can use the settings between the markers so that it gives you 32. For me I use the setting between the finest &#34;fine&#34; and coarsest &#34;extra fine&#34; and tamp firmly. I'm not going to pay several hundred dollars for a burr grinder....at least not yet. For now it's good enough for me. The only complaint I have is this grinder is difficult to clean. I have to keep banging it in order to empty all the grinds, and also it should have an on/off switch instead of a stupid timer.
