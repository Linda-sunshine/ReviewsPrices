review/summary: Oster Wine Bottle Openerreview/text: Received this product on October 16. It is now November 29. This thing does not work. I have charged it all day, I am not using plastic corks, it worked for maybe 8 wine bottles. As you push the down button, it stops half way and still does not lift the cork. This is the worst product I have ever purchased!!!! I did not even want to give this a star!!!
