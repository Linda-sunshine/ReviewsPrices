review/summary: Finally a good iron !review/text: I moved to the US 5 years and have been looking for a good iron for about as long. I had a rowenta - awful - then a sharp - and at some point I just got tired of using such a bad product and looked for good reviews online. I am not disappointed in my purchase today. This iron actually reaches the temperature I need (ironing linen so far, had been a waste of energy) and steams very well - unlike my other purchases, for which I always needed to press the steam button. Ironing is a chore, but this iron makes it much more bearable.
