review/summary: Phenomenal value for the pricereview/text: I have been using this espresso maker for almost two years, and it still brings a smile to my face every time I make espresso. The machine heats up quickly, it creates a beautiful natural foam like a professional grade machine would make, and the flavor of the espresso is excellent. I bought my first stove-top espresso pot in Italy in the 1970s, so I'm a long-time espresso connoisseur. Unless you're prepared to spend a great deal more money, I don't think that you'll find a better buy.
