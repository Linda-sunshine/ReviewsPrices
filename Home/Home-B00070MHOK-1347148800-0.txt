review/summary: Not Happy.review/text: I bought two of these for use (a) prepping my daughter's wedding veil before the ceremony and (b) steaming out wrinkles for fabric used in the reception. It did nothing. Nothing. Given a choice between this product and a steamy bathroom... believe me when I say, you are truly far better off with the steamy bathroom. I've purchased many things on Amazon over the years that I absolutely love. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. I even read the reviews prior to selecting these; some people love this item. I found it useless and I have used steamers with no problem before.
