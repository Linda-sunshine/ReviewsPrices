review/summary: Excellent coffee maker, top of my line.review/text: I plug it in, it works. I beeps to tell me when its brewed, it beeps to tell me when its shutting off two hours later.Less than 10 minutes for a pot of nicely hot coffee. (more like 5 to 7 minutes) Ive never adjusted the temp but I like it how it is (I THINK I remember seeing that option, but I wouldn't want to mess with what works. Ya know?). Simpler? Having a maid...but that's just someone else to trip over and who could afford one.
