review/summary: Love this so muchreview/text: I have consistently bad luck with crock pots, and prefer a good dutch oven for my stews, soups and beans. This one works very well. Because cast iron retains heat so well, on the stove top it does best with lower heats for me. I have a gas range. In the oven, as long as it's under 400 degrees you can bake or roast in this pan.All the heat retention of cast iron, with an enamel finish that's easy to keep clean. The enamel finish is beautifully done so it's very smooth and all edges are finished. The lid fits tightly. The handles are big enough for me to lift it even using thick potholders.I love the colors and actually just keep this on my stove top unless I need to move it for cooking in other pans. It's weighty and attractive so it's just easier to keep it there after hand washing.For the most part, you care for enamel the same way you care for non-stick pans so you don't scratch the finish. Use wood or plastic utensils and non-abrasive cleaners. If you do accidentally burn food in it, pour some water in the pan with some baking soda and bring it to a boil. Let it cool and the burned spots should come right out.
