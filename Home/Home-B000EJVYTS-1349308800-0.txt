review/summary: Try a different productreview/text: This trash can broke down after just 2 months..the lid did not open. When I contacted the manufacture I was given the run around and then told that if I wanted a replacement that I would have to pay for the shipping (to and from) the manufacturer for the part ($25.00+). Save you time and money and look at a different brand.BT
