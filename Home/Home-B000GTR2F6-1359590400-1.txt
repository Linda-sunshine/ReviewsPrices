review/summary: Great Coffee Makerreview/text: Our expectations were exceeded with this machine. The pump is very quiet; some machines sound like a jackhammer. It's easy to clean, well designed, and we get lots of use out of it. It's great for guests to serve themselves coffee without thinking they are putting you out to make a pot. We tried coffee with & without the new filter that is included with the current models. The coffee is much smoother with filtered water, & I thought our water was just fine to begin with.Of course, I don't like the price of the pre-packaged K-cups but it is a great convenience. We offset this somewhat by using the refillable basket that can be purchased separately. We then put our favorite coffee or tea in & viola!, adjusted for the strength & cup size you desire. I even used orzo (roasted barley) recently & it turned out great.The five cup sizes insure that we can use any cup we have. Although the K-cups are meant for 8oz, we get use out of the 4 & 6oz settings, also. It doubles as a hot water pot for tea bags so, you have the choice of 5 different sizes of tea cups.I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this machine again, or give it as a gift. We use it daily.
