review/summary: Coffee in Secondsreview/text: Using the Time On/Time Off feature I have this system set to turn on 30 minutes before I wake up. I simply drop the K-Cup in and press the brew button, in less time than it takes me to get bread in the toaster: I have hot coffee!The brewing is quiet, I don't worry about waking up the kids when I start it going. Quieter than my old Senseo, but louder than a regular drip coffee machine.Even with the top open to put a cup in, it fits under the cabinets. I had to pull my Senseo out when I popped open it's top.The removable water reservoir is easy to pull out and fill. The Senseo was awkward to refill, I spilled frequently. I haven't spilled once!This coffee maker didn't come with the My K-Cup reusable filter, but I ordered the Ekobrew cup and it's working great.Overall this was a good replacement for my old Senseo which I replaced because it was getting very difficult to buy 'pods' for. and now I can even drink my own coffee!
