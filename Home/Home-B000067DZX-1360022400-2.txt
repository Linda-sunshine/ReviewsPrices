review/summary: Good filters. 3 pack better valuereview/text: Good filters that work well. You don't need a silly "indicator" - which was only a mechanical device anyway, not an indicator of how congested the filter is.When the flow of water through the filter slows to a drip you change the filter. Number of pitchers and time in service will depend on the quality of water in your area, that's why an indicator is pointless.NOTE: Get the 3 pack rather than this 4 pack - the price per filter is, amazingly, less with the 3 pack.
