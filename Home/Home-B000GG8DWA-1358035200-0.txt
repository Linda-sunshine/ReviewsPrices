review/summary: Great!!review/text: This solved the problem of tripping the circuit breaker. My roommate and I each got one and it's definitely good enough to heat our little rooms. And they are really only good for usage in smaller areas - when I bring it into the living room, it just really keeps my feet warm. But for the purposes in which I got this, which was for my room, it is great and energy-efficient.
