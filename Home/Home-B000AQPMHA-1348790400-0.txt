review/summary: great coffee!review/text: I love the convenience and the ease of use with the Keurig. I also enjoy a variety of flavored coffees and there is a plethora of k-cup choices available. I appreciate how quickly it heats up and delivers a hot cup in the morning as I am up early and am not a morning person. The clean up is so much easier than with a pot too!
