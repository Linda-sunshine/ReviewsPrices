review/summary: Good size; no timerreview/text: Very compact, but a bit odd. The toaster opening is very wide (in the bread thickness dimension), so bread tends to curl up and become stuck inside. The oven toasts very quickly, but highly uneven between top and bottom. The biggest reason for my returning this was that there is no timer. Burned food is almost guaranteed...Keep trying, HB.
