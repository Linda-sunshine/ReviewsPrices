review/summary: Well pleasedreview/text: This product has met, or exceeded, all my expectations. I have used it to slice and dice, and the slices of cucumbers and beets from the garden are always perfect. I have used it to make cole slaw, and the shreaded cabbage came out perfect too. I have also used the machine to kneed dough for bread and rolls, and it saves a lot of work. I am baking a lot more whole-grain bread now. The machine does not bog down when kneeding dough (use the metal blade). This size is perfect for family use, I see no reason to buy anything larger. Great for making herb sauces, and salad dressings. Clean up, in the sink, is easy. Let it air dry. I have been using this machine for a month, every day, and have had no problems. I will never go back to hand chopping, and hand kneeding. It is the most used piece of equipment in my kitchen, and I would never part with it.
