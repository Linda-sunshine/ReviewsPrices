review/summary: Very Happyreview/text: An excellent product. The fact that this is a quality product will be obvious as soon as you take it out the packaging. By just picking it up you get the impression of heavy duty quality. I'm sure I'll get years of use from this opener. It opens fully making cleaning very easy. Because of it's size you get a good mechanical advantage on first penetrating lids; and the oversize knob makes operating the cutter very easy. You don't have to have arthritis to appreciate the ease of use provided. Cuts through lids like a hot knife through butter.Highly recommended!
