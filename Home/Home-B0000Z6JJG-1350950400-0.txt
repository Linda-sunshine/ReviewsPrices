review/summary: Presto Professional Salad Shooterreview/text: I've only used it a couple times. It has a funny smell, I'm hoping that is just because it is new. It also seems to be struggling a bit, not as powerful or smooth as my older one that I used for years and ruined by trying to grate soap in it. Time will tell.
