review/summary: Small but greatreview/text: I have used this little thing for a while now and I am very happy with it other than it's size. I usually only cook for myself, but I still find myself wanting a larger capacity processor.It works great and I use it to chop up my tomatoes, onions and green peppers and other foods for cooking. Never a problem with the product, only the issue with how small it is.So, if you don't mind the small capacity, then I would highly recommend this little food processor. I'm planning on upgrading to a larger one eventually, but until then, I'm very happy with this Cuisinart food processor.
