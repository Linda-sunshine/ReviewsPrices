review/summary: Perfect if the spout didn't dripreview/text: This is the second Hamilton Beach Cool-Touch kettle I've owned. The base to my last one quit working after about 5 years, and after shopping around and realizing that even most of the high-end stainless kettles were not insulated, I purchased another one of these. It heats water quickly, shuts off at boiling and holds the water at temp. The only flaw with it is that the spout is not pronounced enough, so it is really difficult to pour water without having it dribble down the side of the kettle onto the counter. However, it seems to be about the best choice available, if you don't want plastic coming in contact with your boiling water.
