review/summary: Christmas gift for my oldest and much loved friend..:)review/text: Purchased this for my friend,who has been my friend since we were both 13~~! Now we are both in our 60's,and even tho we are miles apart,different states,we still see each other as often as possible...try for once a year...I am so happy that she LOVED this wine chiller...:) I knew she would like it,of course,but she told me she had been thinking about buying one for herself..so a double score on the gift...Thanks to Amazon I was able to get it to her before the big day....happy stuff...and I do love to shop with Amazon,almost always fast ship,great prices,and of course all the Kindle stuff...Happy New Year to all....
