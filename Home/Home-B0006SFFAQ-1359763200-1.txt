review/summary: No issues best coffee maker bar nonereview/text: Cuisinart DCC1200 Brushed Stainless purchased 4/2005 used daily, don't use water filters, NEVER had any problems , clean twice a year using white vinegar. Yes, you must make sure the filter basket is properly seated or you will get water/coffee grinds all over(that's why you ALWAYS should read the manual) Also brew pause DOES work but one may get some water drops on warming plate from steam/condensation when you remove carafe before brewing is complete. If filling reservoir is difficult using carafe, try using a large pitcher, such as the plastic type made by Rubbermaid --works every time. Also own a Cuisinart CPT 120 toaster in red, purchased 10/2003 used daily still works flawlessly. Finally have owned other coffee makers Krups, Mr Coffee. The Krups water tank cracked after 2 years ($90 machine) the Mr Coffee machines all quit after 2 years....
