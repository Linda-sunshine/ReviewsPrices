review/summary: Sandpaper texture. YUCK.review/text: I was so excited when I finally decided to buy these sheets after they had say on my wish list for months and months. I couldn't wait for them to arrive. I tore open the box and immediately tossed them in the wash so I could use them that night. To my dismay, I crawled into bed that night and ended up tossing and turning all night long (odd for me on my Tempurpedic) all because of these stupid sheets. They're hot, scratchy, and feel like crappy flannel mixed with sandpaper. It was actually kind of gross. These will be getting sent back ASAP. Ick.
