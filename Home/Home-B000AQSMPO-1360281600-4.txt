review/summary: Excellent machine; If it holds upreview/text: I'm on my forth Keurig machine; the others were the B40 model which after about 2 years developed valving issues. Before one comes to any conclusion, please note that I tend to be hard on my appliances. Not that they get abused I just use them a lot.I decided to purchase the B60 as I drink green tea (in a bag) and the 7.25oz setting dispensed to much water for my Stackable Porcelain Cappuccino Cup & Saucer 9 Pc Set I purchased here on Amazon. the 5.25 setting is just perfect for my cup and saucer set.Other uses for my machine as it makes just the right hot water for my cup of noodles that I use from time to time too; or for any other use for that matter that requires hot water.Some pointers I have learned over the years with Keurig1. When registering your machine, NEVER state you purchased your unit on an online auction site, even if new. Keurig will not warranty your machine. Here on amazon it is ok.2. Use your machine for at least 6 months before you register your unit. If your machine is going to fail, it will around or just after the warranty has expired; which is 1 year.Also C o s t c o online offers two variety's of their Kirkland brand of Kcups at a great price.
