review/summary: Nothings perfect, BUT!review/text: Bought one about 2 1/2 years ago, made a pot a day or close to 1000 pots, stopped working & would not get hot, picked up the phone called for a replacement and for 10 bucks shipping and turning in the busted one I had a new one in two days. WOW! If you can beat that let me know. Update: Cost over $19 to ship the bad one back out west, so total cost $29, still not bad! It's not there falt UPS bangs you for over $19.
