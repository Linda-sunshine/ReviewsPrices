review/summary: Finally one I can keep around.review/text: This can opener is quality built. I was a little concerned about it being mostly plastic but it functions magnificently. Quality engineering and materials. Haven't cold weather tested it for deer camp but at home in the kitchen it has the style and functionality needed to keep it out of the garbage can. I actually think I am using canned goods more because of it and the wife has seen me help out more in the kitchen because of it. May seem like a lot to say but those that have been frustrated with opening cans will understand.
