review/summary: Gift for a Friendreview/text: My friend loves tea, so I bought this for her. I have one myself, bought it years ago. Let's just say that we both admitted that we got rid of all of our old tumblers because this one is superior.I never fill it to the line with hot water. After brewing, I fill it to the line with cold water, otherwise I'm burning my tongue hours after I've brewed my tea.
