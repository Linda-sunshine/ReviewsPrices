review/summary: Does exactly what it says it will do and does it well. Easy and convenient!review/text: Great product that does exactly what it claims to do. Makes soft boiled and hard boiled eggs well. Just fill up the bottom half of the "egg" to the fill line, add one to four eggs in the tray, place the top on, and pop it in the microwave oven. Extremely simple and convenient. No need to waste time boiling water and prodding eggs in a water pot.A few things. The egg boiler doesn't do soft boiled that well. I like my egg whites to be firm but the yolks to be runny. At shorter cook times, the white will be somewhat runny alongside the yolk (making it harder to peel as well). Also, I find that you should lower the microwave times that are recommended if you have a newer, high-wattage microwave.Otherwise, a great product. I bought one later as a gift. Makes a great one for someone on a diet or is a vegetarian. Eggs are nutritious and have been demonized for no reason. Eat the damned yolk!
