review/summary: Happy with vacuumreview/text: Vacuum arrived very quickly and in good condition. It has very strong suction power to clean upholstery from my white cat hair and black dog hair. Nice long cord but no place to store it on the vacuum. Only problem I have is the air hole on suction pipe will not stay closed for strongest power and when I close it, it sucks my skin in and pinches me, ouch. Not good for thick carpet. I bought it for pet hair on furniture, so good for that, light weight and good value.
