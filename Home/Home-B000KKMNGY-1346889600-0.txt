review/summary: Unable to use due to qualityreview/text: I think this product is a great idea, but the one sold here is made of a bendable metal product that does not operate as shown in the picture. The minute I placed four wrap products in as shown, the side closest to the back of the wall bends down and makes the shelf below it unusuable. I can say that I received great customer service though, because as soon as I wrote the seller about the defect I received a refund.On a side note - I recently found these at the container store in multiple different sizes for less than they are selling here and they do not have this issue.
