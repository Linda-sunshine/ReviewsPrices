review/summary: Where have these been all my life?review/text: I use ball jars to store a lot of things that dont need to be 'canned' - homemade carpet fresh, fridge pickles, salads for lunch, so these are PERFECT. Only one piece to keep track of, easy to label, and I just chuck 'em in the dishwasher (no idea if you're 'supposed' to or not). Just awesome...
