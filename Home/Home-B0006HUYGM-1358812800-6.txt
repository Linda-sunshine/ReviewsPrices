review/summary: Want the best, buy this one!review/text: Over the years, I've had many hand held vacuums but honestly, this is the best one I've ever had. I purchased the product mainly to vacuum my carpeted steps. The two position head is perfect for doing the risers and with a flick down, to do the treads. The cord is long enough to reach all the way with some left over. The suction is very strong and with the heavy duty brush, it really cleans out those corners. I would highly recommend this vacuum.
