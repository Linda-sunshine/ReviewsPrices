review/summary: I bought one for myself and loved it - - my son liked it as well so his wife and I purchased one for him.review/text: Only problem I have with the coffeemaker is with the nut behind the wheel. The time is a little difficult to set with the proper time of day you are looking for. The AM and PM are so tiney and sometimes are delayed in showing up. If any of this is mentioned in the &#34;start up&#34; I did not see it nor an I find it now that I know to look. Eventually you get it correct - coffee just getrs done a little early from time to time. I love it anyway!
