review/summary: Mostly OKreview/text: We have two of these. One for olive oil and one for regular vegetable oil. They work pretty well but can get a bit messy with use.The issue is that you have to release the pressure from the container if you're not going to use it for a while. (I make sure to release it at the end of every day.) If you do not release the pressure from the container then it will cause the oil to thicken into some pasty mess and it will ruin the device. (This happened to the first one I had before I learned about this requirement.)So because you have to release the lid to release the pressure, and because it is under pressure, some of the oil will come out and get a bit messy. I deal with this because I cannot find a better alternative for spraying oil, but if they could figure some way around this (such as a release valve that didn't let oil come out) then this would be a 5 star item.
