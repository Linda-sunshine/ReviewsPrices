review/summary: Versatile traysreview/text: These ice cube trays are flexible rubber, which makes it possible to extract a single cube at a time. This makes it great for storing non-water items that you want to use a few at a time. We freeze homemade pesto and can drop a cube or two into a pasta dish when we need it.The trays also make perfectly cubed ice, which is great for cocktails -- the drinks look professional due to the symmetric proportions.
