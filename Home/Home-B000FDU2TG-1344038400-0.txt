review/summary: Leaks....review/text: I got this so I could make smoothies, the first step in an upgrade to a more healthy diet. Unfortunately, it wasn't long before it started leaking from the bottom, leaving a mess on the blender and the counter for me to clean after making my smoothies!! I got tired of my morning smoothies being such a pain in my a$$ and stopped making my morning drink. :(I tried to find a replacement for the pitcher but I can't. The loose bolt is proprietary. The only thing I can do is buy a completely NEW pitcher. Not pleased. What a waste of money.
