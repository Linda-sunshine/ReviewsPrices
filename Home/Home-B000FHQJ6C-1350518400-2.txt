review/summary: Love this juicer!!review/text: I am so happy with my purchase of this juicer!! It works great and is actually pretty easy to clean. All of the parts can go in the dishwasher (except for the motor & the screen filter - which requires some scrubbing but cleans easily). For the price, it is absolutely great. I am so glad I didn't waste more money on another juicer because this works so well. Fits large pieces of fruit and veggies into the feed chute, and the waste is very dry so you know you are getting most of the juice out of whatever you are putting in.Bottom line, great juicer & 100% recommend it.
