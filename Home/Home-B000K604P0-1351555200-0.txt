review/summary: Excellent thermos/travel mugreview/text: I borrowed this thermos from a friend on a camping trip and was amazed at it's ability to keep coffee warm all day. When I got home I ordered two. My wife and I both love them. The spring loaded flip top is very handy and completely seals the contents inside so you don't have to worry about carrying it upright or tipping it over and yet it is easily opened with one hand. The drinking spout is predictable in use. I have yet to spill a drop on my tie while driving to work. One long term concern may be the durability of the hinge. I've had no problems and my friend has used his for a year or so with no issues. The construction is sound and of quality materials but I can see where mishandling or dropping the mug with the top open could lead to breaking the hinge. That said, in my mind the convenience of the design outweighs any possible structural issues. This thermos will be high on my list for Christmas giving.
