review/summary: works ok but I got one that leaks (manufacturing defect)review/text: Pros: boils water quickly. Auto shut off works good but only if the cover is securely closed. Cover must snap to be closed.Cons: the min fill level is about 32 ounces and I use it to heat water for one large tea cup per day so I end up heating about twice as much water as I need.After a few months of once per day use, I noticed puddles on the kitchen counter if I left water in the unit over night, also rust forming on the seam at the base of the kettle. I found a post on line where leak was a manufacturing defect. I am attempting to get a replacement at no cost from the mfg (Aroma Co.). Their warranty is almost useless as I would be required to pay return postage almost equal to the cost of the item. I gave this item 3 stars due to the defect, otherwise it would have gotten more.
