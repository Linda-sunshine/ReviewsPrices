review/summary: How Do I Love Thee Lodge?review/text: Sure everyone may dream of owning a le cruset, but not everyone can afford one. I bought this Lodge Dutch Oven in September and have used it many times since, both in the oven and on stove top. Since it is cast iron you will find it heavy, but it holds heat like a champion and allows me to burn a smaller propane flame when using it. I love that I can brown or sautee in the same pot that will hold the rest of the recipe and slow cook to perfection. One should read the owners manual for proper care and use to preserve the integrity of this cookware. It is easy to clean with soapy water and gentle scrubber. I honestly cant' think of any complaints and would recommend this Lodge brand to others.
