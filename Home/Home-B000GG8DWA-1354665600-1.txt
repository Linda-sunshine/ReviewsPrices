review/summary: Easily takes the chill from a roomreview/text: We've had this heater for years now. Still working. Using it in our moderately-sized living area, and it nicely takes any chill from the room. Doesn't overheat it, and there's been no substantial change in our electric bill. Using this we can keep most of the house at a lower cool setting, and just let this deal with the room we're in.
