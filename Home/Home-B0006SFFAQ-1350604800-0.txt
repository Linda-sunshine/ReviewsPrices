review/summary: Mine caught on fire, tooreview/text: My coffee maker, a DCC-1200, was just short of two years old when it caught on fire. My fire was not near the element, but behind the main control panel. I had walked into the kitchen, and thought "why is the coffee maker off (red light was off); has it been two hours since I made coffee?". No, the light was off and the clock was out. I also thought I heard the end of a brew perk sounds, but no, it was the sound of electrical arcing. Staying calm, I decided to watch what was happening. Electrical smoke (not steam) started rolling out from the underside of the control panel. The smell was electrical - but then the smell turned into a melting plastic smell. Calmness lasted only a few short moments; I unplugged and removed the unit. I'm sending this unit back (even though they charge $10 for the warranty replacement), so I did not dismantle it to further investigate the failure.Otherwise, this is a great coffeemaker!Seriously, I'm not sure what I'll do with the replacement... I'll either turn it off manually when I leave the house, or sell it.
