review/summary: I wanna cook everything on it!!!!review/text: I am so happy with this cooker. I was need it so much because I learnt how to cook using most of the time a pressure cooker, and without it I am like without a hand in the kitchen. I search a lot for it and this was by far the best option I found. You have to assemble it but is very easy to do it. It looks very nice and works perfectly. I am overcooking my food because I kind of forget the times are so short cooking with it!!!
