review/summary: My Snack Baby.....review/text: The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because it doesn't have a timer, or an on/off switch. Also, the whole in the center prevents me from making the traditional circular dehydrated pizza crust....Besides that, it works great, I've made energy bars, kale chips (weekly), sweet potato chips, heck I have it going right now lol!! Got some yummy goodies on there along with burgers for dinner......If you don't want to spend all that money for the excaliber and you want a good dehydrator this is it. Especially if your not super serious about raw foodism.
