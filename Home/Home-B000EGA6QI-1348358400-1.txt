review/summary: Up in Smoke within 6 Monthsreview/text: This is a piece of junk. I used it infrequently for smoothies and soup for about 6 months. After not using it for several weeks, I took it out to blend soup and the blade wouldn't turn. After a couple tries to get it going, it began to smoke and stink. You get what you pay for - don't waste your money on this product which, with a very short detour, will be going from the store shelf to the landfill.
