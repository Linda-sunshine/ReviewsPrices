review/summary: Cranberry Dark Red color, not cinnamonreview/text: I took a gamble with this color because when something is called Cinnamon Gloss you think your screen could be off and it could arrive as some retro funky rust color. ITS NOT. Its really a sophisticated deep red/cranberry color instead of the bright candy apple.The mixer is fabulous.
