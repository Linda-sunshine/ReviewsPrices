review/summary: Excellent!review/text: It's amazing that sorted by Amazon's customer reviews, this is #1 and the next best one is a Breville costing 10 times as much.I originally got this grinder for grinding some other stuff but I appropriated it for use in grinding coffee in an emergency (coffee emergency, ha-ha) and have been using it ever since for that.Pros:1) The price. Look around, it's a great deal.2) Quality. This is a finely made appliance, simple and elegant, and nothing to break!Cons:1) Not made for grinding coffee. But in a way, that's what I like about it. Grinding it to different coarseness requires skill. I feel like an old world craftsman when I do this. You don't have a button to choose, you have to use your experience, your eyes, your ears. It makes the grind much more personal. Hard to explain, but I feel a much greater satisfaction when I do this, almost like I'm doing it by hand. Anyway, it seems much less of a con when I think of it this way. It's true that the grind is somewhat uneven, but I like it that way, it's seems more aesthetically pleasing!So, overall a great general grinder. Simple and elegant.
