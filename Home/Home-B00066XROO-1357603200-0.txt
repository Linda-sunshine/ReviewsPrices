review/summary: Everything we hoped for in a large electric griddlereview/text: Our family of five includes three boys ages 12-16, so a big morning breakfast demands maximum pancake production capacity. This griddle replaced a West Bend model that gave its all and then some. I'm pleased to say this one is better in every way. The surface is somewhat larger but also more square. Most important is the very even heating which was non-existent with our old griddle. We can crank out nine large hotcakes at once, all evenly cooked. Awesome.We have yet to try it for anything other than pancakes. The surface tilt seems like a cleverly simple arrangement that would be great for doing meats.Build quality is good. The control knob has temperature marks, our old one did not, so that's also a plus. I can easily recommend this griddle.
