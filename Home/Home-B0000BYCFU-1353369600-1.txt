review/summary: Great product for the moneyreview/text: I had an abundance of tomatoes this year and canned several using the "water bath" canning method. I wanted to make my own Ro-tel type tomatoes and tomato basil soup, but needed a pressure canner due to the ingredients in them. The instructions were easy to follow and I made several batches of both. I wish I had purchased this at the start of the harvest season and I would have canned a lot more.
