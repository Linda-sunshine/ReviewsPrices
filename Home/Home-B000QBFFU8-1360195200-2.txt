review/summary: Breville Juicer - Made in China, but ok.review/text: It's made in china, and not worth the price, but it seems to be built ok. it doesn't quite pulp all the product and will spit out skins. Pulp is dry, so it's doing it's job. 2 apples will make a 8 oz glass of juice, and 20 baby carrots will make 1/4 cup. It's a chore to clean, and disassemble, 5 pieces to wash. It's only got a year warranty, so use it hard that first year.
