review/summary: Great design and conceptreview/text: I received one of these for Christmas last year from my husband because he knows I love making tea. I originally was using one of the small tea pots that has an insert for your loose leaf tea but this seemed to always be a mess and produced weak tea. The Ingenuitea teapot creates tea that is fully integrated by just placing the loose tea into the top then toping with hot water and letting it sit for the 3-5 minutes to get your preferred strength. The best part is then to get the tea into your cup just place it on the top of a cup or mug and the tea will fill in the cup or mug without leaking or leaving a mess. I was shocked but how it didn't leak for me AT ALL. I've now started using the hot water from my kuerig which works great as well and then means I get the exactly oz I want for my cup also.
