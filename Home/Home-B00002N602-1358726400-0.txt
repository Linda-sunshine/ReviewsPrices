review/summary: i love this item. It was shipped fast and it lived up to my expectations. It is stainless steel so sometimes food can stick if treview/text: I love this pressure cooker. it is stainless steel so it takes a scrub when food sticks. You do have to be vigilant about insuring there is adequate amounts of water. But it is great for beans and soups and stews!
