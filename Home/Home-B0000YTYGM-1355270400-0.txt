review/summary: Great for the pricereview/text: Have been using this coffee maker every day for about one month. I have a 3 year old Capresso that I sent off to our retreat. I liked the Capresso very much, but purchased the Cuisinart because it makes 12 cups and the Capresso only makes 10 (really 9) and needed to be taken off everyday duty. I read about all the problems folks had with the Cuisinart and thought that if I had mastered the Capresso, the Cuisinart would be no big deal. I was right. Just read the instructions and you will have none of the problems with the machine that folks have mentioned. It is much easier to use than the Capresso, and makes the same quality coffee plus 2 extra cups. No brainer. I also got the Cuisinart for a fab price - thank you Amazon!
