review/summary: Perfect Sizereview/text: I love this item. It holds a lot of water, so you're not always refilling it, but it is also narrow and long, so it doesn't take up a lot of width in the refrigerator. I get so many comments on the great design from family and friends that I have purchased two as gifts. The pitcher also fits the generic/universal filters from most grocery stores, so that's good also if you're looking to save money.
