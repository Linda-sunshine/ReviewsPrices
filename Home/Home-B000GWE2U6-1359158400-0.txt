review/summary: Cute, but not as functional as the standard teardrop Cranereview/text: We are a Crane ultrasonic humidifier family - have them in everyone's bedrooms, and they run for most of the year. I bought this one to replace the old Crane that was in our nursery when it finally gave out. I thought the elephant design was really cute and would look great in our jungle-themed room. The problem is that, unless you leave it on the lowest setting, the condensation collects under the elephant lid and leaks all over the surface it sits on. So, we use it without the elephant lid, and now it just looks weird.Anyway, definitely buy a Crane...just go with one of the colorful teardrop shapes. They're awesome!
