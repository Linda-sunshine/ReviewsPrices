review/summary: Ok while it lastsreview/text: Bought this in August of 2012. Enjoyed it for 15 months. One morning it just would not do anything. Called Cuisinart and they said that it should have a vinegar and water cleaning. Followed their advise and still nothing. Then I was told that nothing could be done and realized it was headed for the junk pile. Really sad because I liked using it.
