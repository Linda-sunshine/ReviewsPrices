review/summary: I like em'.review/text: This knife set is really my first &#34;set&#34; I've purchased. I'd like to give it 5 stars but I have nothing to compare them to. My only complaint is that the Santoku Knife is flimsy. I replaced it immediately with a heavier duty knife. Also the Kitchen Scissors are terrible and your best off purchasing a good pair to replace them.
