review/summary: Changed my mind and bought Hooverreview/text: I was planning on buying a competing brand because they appeared to be the market leader. After reading the customer reviews for carpet cleaners, this product appeared to be the better choice. Customers seemed generally pleased with the Hoover and the price was lower. I also found a significant number of reviewers complained of problems with other products. I purchased this model, assembled it yesterday, and it worked fine. The only negative I found was the sprayer on the stair attachment was difficult to use on the stairs. I would recommend filling a spray bottle, applying the cleaning solution, and using the Hoover attachment to dry the carpet.
