review/summary: Safety Danger - be carefulreview/text: My wife bought me one about one year ago. Yesterday, Christmas, we made a pot of coffee. It started to sputter, sizzle and stink of electrical burning. I quickly unplugged the coffee maker. Thank God we were around and had not trusted the machine to auto-turn-off. This thing made good coffee for one year, and then became a fire hazard. Check the internet ... we were not the first.Back to Mr Coffee for me.
