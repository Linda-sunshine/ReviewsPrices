review/summary: Guard Your Lid!review/text: I love this pressure canner and cooker. I have made the best chili ever in it. I made a huge chuck roast that was tender and succulent...but my mistake was dropping the lid. I didn't realize that this broke the gauge at the time as everything seemed to be in order. However, I noticed when attempting to can my beef broth and some pork that the gauge wasn't rising past 5. After a few minutes with the weight giggling like crazy and still no change in the gauge...something was wrong. So be careful if you are clumsy like I am. Luckily Amazon carries this gauge on prime and I ordered a replacement today. I may get a back up one just in case...as now I have a fridge with partially canned broth and pork also-and my freezer is FULL of stuff waiting to thaw and can. ::SIGH::
