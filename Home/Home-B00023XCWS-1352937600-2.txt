review/summary: Does the job, but built cheaplyreview/text: I guess with this low price, I shouldn't complaint too much. But with the plastic material and poor built quality, you need to lower your expectation of its service time. Seeing so many positive review, I suspect the manufacture has lowered the quality standard for this product recently.Pros:Cheap price,Light weight,Boil a liter of water in reasonable timeCons:The whole thing is made of a thin layer of plastic&#65292;poorly finished. The lid has irregular surface, looks like been melted...It's inconvenient to plug and unplug every time you use it.The lid cannot be closed smoothly, and without the lid fully closed, the auto switch DOESN'T shut off after water boiling. This is DANGEROUS!The hinge of the lid is very thin plastic. With the effort to open the lid, it can be easily broken any day...The coil at the bottom of the jar is not easy to clean.
