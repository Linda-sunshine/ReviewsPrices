review/summary: Great dehydratorreview/text: This is a great dehydrator at a good price. It has a temperature control which is pretty accurate--I checked the internal temperature with a digital cooking thermometer. There is a small recipe book to get you started if you're novice at dehydrating food. The trays are durable and fairly easy to wash if you have a stiff brush. The design is good. the trays fit well together and airflow seems even throughout the unit. My previous cheap dehydrator had no fan so this one dries items FAST even on lower heat settings. The only negatives I can think of are: there is no timer, hence no auto shut-off, and there is no power switch so you do have to unplug the unit when you need to set the top unit aside for any reason. I've seen and owned other brands of dehydrators but I'm most impressed with this one.
