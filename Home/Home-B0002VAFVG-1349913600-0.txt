review/summary: Quality Juicerreview/text: This juicer is worth the price. Had a bargain juicer and there is no comparison, the Breville is made of stainless steel and the bargain juicer is made of plastic. The 2 speeds on the Breville make it better to use for softer fruit and vegetables. Taking apart the Breville and cleaning, then re-assembling is a quick and easy process. The juicing pitcher is convenient. A good tip is to put ice into the bottom of the juicing pitcher before juicing room temperature produce, so that the juice melts some of the ice while you are juicing. Good product, but not perfect!
