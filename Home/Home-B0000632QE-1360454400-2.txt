review/summary: Best one out therereview/text: There are Mandoline slicers, some of which more expensive than this one. Well, don't get them, get this one instead. I've been using this slicer for 2.5 years so far, and the blades haven't lost their sharpness. Saves lots of time, especially when cutting onions.
