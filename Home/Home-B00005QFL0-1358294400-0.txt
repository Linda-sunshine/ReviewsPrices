review/summary: Very pleased with this productreview/text: I got this bread maker for Christmas from my wish list. I have made several different loaves so far from the recipes that are in the manual. My bread has come out very good every time. I will say that the loaves aren't very loaf looking sometimes. Maybe I'm not measuring my ingredients just right. I love how I can put all the ingredients in, input whatever bread that I am making, set it, and walk away! It's also quiet and doesn't take up too much space on my counter. The pros to this machine are its ease of use and uniform baking and coloring of the bread. It's con I guess is that the french bread cycle takes six hours. So you can't exactly whip up a loaf of bread. Overall, I love it and am happy with my product.
