review/summary: So soft and comfortable!review/text: I've had this for about 2 weeks now. I would give this 6 stars if it were possible! It fits my queen size bet almost perfectly, only about and inch short length ways and and inch short on the width. I would never buy a mattress topper that isn't 3 inches. It's so nice I love it! It's true memory foam that hold the shape of your body and then goes back to normal within a second. This makes you never want to get out of bed. You won't be disappointed with this product! You get way more than what yo pay for! Highly recommended!
