review/summary: Hot tea and Plastic? Are you Kidding?review/text: Cardinal rule of tea making: Tea or hot water must not touch plastic of any kind, or metal of any kind.Glass, porcelain, stoneware, china, Yeah!This product preys on lack of knowledge and laziness pervasive in our society!For those wide-eyed 4 and 5 stars: Enjoy the plastic in your brain from the hot tea :)
