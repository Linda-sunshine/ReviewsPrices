review/summary: So Disappointing! Less efficient than my old cheap juicer.review/text: I decided to give my last (still working after 13 years) little Juiceman Junior to the Salvation Army. I hope someone has given that little workhorse a good home.I thought I needed a bigger, better, fancier juicer for my carrot juicing. Boy was I wrong.The Breville Ikon 5 Speed Juicer looks good and feels heavy and solid with nice controls... but that's where my praise ends.I won't get into a real lengthy review, but bottom-line is that it did not do nearly as good a job of juicing carrots as my cheap little Juiceman.The pulp container was full -really full- of large carrots chunks and chips. I had to put the pulp through 2 more times to get a decent amount of juice AND there were still carrot chunks in the too moist pulp.FYI: 7 very large carrots yielded 6 oz of juice-that included the bit of juice I got from juicing the pulp 2 more times.That, in my opinion, is a very poor yield for the time and effort expended.Another note: The design is flawed in that there are just too many parts to clean - 6 - not counting wiping off the base.Never have I had to clean so many parts on a juicer.I think there could have been more thought put into that aspect of the design.You don't always get what you pay for!
