review/summary: Norpro Grinder easy to use and cleanreview/text: We've used the Norpro Meat Grinder, Mincer and Pasta Maker for about a month. We've used it mostly for grinding raw or cooked meat and it does a fine job. The only minor complaint I have is that we could use a coarser blade sometimes. It's lightweight and comes apart for easy cleaning. Initially, I was concerned that the suction cups at the bottom might break loose during use, but they held fast without a problem. I would recommend it if you need to grind a couple of pounds of meat at a time. The hand crank might get tiresome if used for jobs larger than that.Norpro Meat Grinder, Mincer, and Pasta MakerHave not used it as a pasta maker.
