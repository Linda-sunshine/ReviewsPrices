review/summary: Great and as expectedreview/text: Obviously i knew what i was buying so it's hard to review something that is sort of a spare part, so to speak. I needed these filter refills for my water container but these particular ones are kind of hard to find in store so i just order them off amazon. They make the water super clean and according to my husband, this brand is superior to Brita.
