review/summary: GRILLIN' FUNreview/text: I purchased a hi-end range with built in grill, however it was very messy to clean-up with: a grill and several baffles and the gas burner. So looked and found this LODGE LOGIC cast iron: grill/griddle combo. only one thing to clean now and it cooks meat&fish;, pancakes&french; toast.It is heavy. But is an excellent accessory for cooking even over a campfire!
