review/summary: Five years and going strong!review/text: I have had mine for five years, so I just bought one for my mom. Mine holds two shampoo bottles, shaving cream, shower gel, and bar of soap. It has never come off the wall! We moved and I took it with me; just got new command strip fasteners.
