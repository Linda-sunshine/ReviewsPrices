review/summary: Awesomereview/text: I can't believe that I went so long without having one!!!I love to cook from scratch and it's the prep work that takes so long!! But since I bought this, my prep work time is miniscule!! I was a little worried buying it online because I was a little weary on if it worked as well as people described... And it does!! The biggest thing though is that you have to do it in one smooth motion. For instance when I made hashbrowns, it literally took 10 sec per potato. But, if I didn't do it fast enough or in a smooth motion than sometimes the potato would get stuck in the blade. But it's easy to get it out, just don't try to use your hands to put it through the blade!! The blade is super sharp!! :)
