review/summary: Terrible rubbery tastereview/text: I do not recommend these ice cube trays. No matter what means I have tried, i.e., dishwasher cleaning, vinegar, baking soda, vodka -- nothing works. A powdery white film develops as the cube melts in the glass as well as a disgusting bad taste -- sort of rubbery.I bought 7 of these and they are a disappointing product.
