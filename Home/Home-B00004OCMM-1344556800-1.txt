review/summary: Works well, very comfortable but expensivereview/text: Not much can be said about a can opener. Its a can opener, but whats important is that the grip be comfortable, the opener blades remain sharp and rust over time.This can opener has it all, but the price is too much. I got it and love it, but constantly question why I paid over $15 to open a 50 cent can.
