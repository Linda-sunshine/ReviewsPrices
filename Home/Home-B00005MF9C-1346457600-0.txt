review/summary: Handy little coffee makerreview/text: I was contemplating buying a kuerig, but wasn't sure if the price was worth it. When I saw this single cup coffee maker I thought I would give it a try first. It really works great. I fill the filter up with my coffee, fill the thermos with water, dump into the resovior, put thermos under the maker and turn it on. Within a few minutes the coffee is hot and ready to go!I would like to use other thermos's as well, but have not found others that are the same height. So I end up having to wash it daily, and hope I remember to bring it with me to work. The filter I just rinse out with water everyday and take it home on the weekend to run it through the dishwasher.I have it stored in a drawer at my desk at work and just pull it out every morning to use. (we do not have a communal coffee pot, it got taken away by the fire chief)Overall, I'm extremely happy I went with this instead of a kuerig, it's much much less expensive and it's funcitonality is really the same.
