review/summary: Couldn't be happierreview/text: This thing is much better than the non-stick wok we picked up in the local store. The pan base is larger, the heating more even, the overall size and shape are spot on for stir frying. The handle remains cool to the touch during use. Overall, the design of the pan was well considered and implemented.Regarding comments by other users suggesting issues with the lid - if you had read the instructions, you would have noted that the fit is tight by design. As the pan cools, the metal shrinks, and the lid may seal. Mildly reheating the pan will release the lid.
