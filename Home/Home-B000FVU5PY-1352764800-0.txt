review/summary: Super soft and high qualityreview/text: I'm a student so I don't normally worry about the quality of my bedding. I have used 2 sets of standard sheets from Walmart in 5 years. Those Walmart sheets cost $25 per set but don't last. These have a totally different feel. They are thick but not stiff at all. I can already tell they will last twice as long and feel more luxurious the whole time I own them.
