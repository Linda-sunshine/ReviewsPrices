review/summary: I had no idea what I was missingreview/text: The idea of a bread machine sounded interesting... but I had no idea what I was missing. This has been one of my best purchases hands down. It took me a couple of times to find recipies I liked, but I can't stop making bread! I've made wonderful pretzels, dinner rolls, and tortillas. I am very impressed with this machine. It is super easy to clean, and user friendly. Nothing has come out over/undercooked. I listened to other user reviews and never even tried recipies in the manual... I bought the bread machine book and have found many yummy options in it. My fiance warned me that he didn't like homemade bread when I first got the machine, but he quickly changed his mind. I caught him contantly eating it and he said &#34;you make really good bread&#34; This definitly saves money, and it's nice to be able to try different kinds of fresh bread all the time. Again I can honestly say that this is one of the best purchases I've ever made! It was super affordable and works wonderfully.
