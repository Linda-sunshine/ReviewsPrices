review/summary: Aroma Water Kettlereview/text: Excellent product however, the same situation as the rice cooker and Cuisinart Water Kettle that I ordered. All were supposed to be 220 volt - 240 volt and all arrived 110 volt - 115 volt so I was not able to use any of the three products. However, they are all excellent and had they been the correct voltage, I would have been a very happy, satisfied customer.
