review/summary: Wonderful....review/text: I do have to say that this carpet cleaner is the best we've used. Just had the chance to use it today, in both my SUV and my home. The carpets in my home look brand new (but I do have to say we've only been in our home for a year - which was brand new) and the carpets in my SUV look much improved (will have to go over some juice and coffee stains). It works really really well though. One thing to add: make sure the dirty tank is both snapped close in the back and hinged close in the front, otherwise, there is no suction...just a lil FYI :)
