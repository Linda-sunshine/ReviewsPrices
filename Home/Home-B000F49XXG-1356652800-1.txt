review/summary: Makes a great lattereview/text: Pros:-Dual temperature (no burnt shots. Can pull as many shots as necessary without burning the espresso)-Great foam-The removable parts come apart to clean easily-Overall: Makes a great latteCons:-It takes a long time to heat the water to make espresso-low clearances for both the espresso (I have to remove the metal tray to fit a 2.5 in cup under the filter holder) and the steam wand (I have to line up the machine sideways along the edge of my counter in order to have enough clearance for my 2 cup measuring cup to fit under it.)-It vigorously vibrates to the point that I have to readjust the expresso cup to keep it in place and make sure the whole machine doesn't walk itself of the counter.Overall: I like it, it does the job decently; but if I had the money for a nicer one like a Breville, I'd buy the nicer one. It's a vast improvement over my old one that has just one thermostat that would burn the coffee as it warmed up past the ideal temp for expresso on it's way to &#34;steam&#34; temperature.
