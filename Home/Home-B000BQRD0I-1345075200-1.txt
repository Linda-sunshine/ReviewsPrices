review/summary: Great product!review/text: I was looking for an inexpensive steamer for all the curtains in my house. This was a great choice as I easily steamed every curtain of every length and fabric throughout my home. My only complaint is that the hose gets very hot on the outside so you have to be careful when using it. Overall it is a great product!
