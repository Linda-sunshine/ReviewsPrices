review/summary: The Best Manual Can Opener We've Ever Hadreview/text: Okay, my wife has rheumatoid arthritis and we've tried many manual can openers. The Oxo surpasses them all. She was using it just the other day and I asked her why she didn't use the electric can opener. She said for the smaller cans she likes to use the Oxo. She held it up and smiled at me and said, &#34;I love it.&#34; I cannot give a better recommendation than that.
