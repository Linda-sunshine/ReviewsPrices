review/summary: I thought I was "upgrading"!review/text: We've used a Brita pitcher for years, so when I saw this larger capacity one I bought it without thinking twice. Like one reviewer said, you shouldn't have to look up reviews for a water pitcher, but I wish I would have. One, the lid does not stay on like my old pitcher did. If this one has water in the top when you pour a glass it's more than likely going to leak unless you use one hand to hold the lid tightly on. Two, it takes two fills of the top reservoir to fill the pitcher, which is annoying especially when you want to pour a quick glass of water but instead you are stuck waiting for the top to empty into the bottom. Three, the lid spout flapper tends to stick at times causing water to spray everywhere but your glass. Brita, why mess with a good thing? Your older pitchers worked great, just wanted more water per pitcher. Instead I got more hassle than there needs to be.
