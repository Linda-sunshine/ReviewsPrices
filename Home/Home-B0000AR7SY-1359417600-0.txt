review/summary: Greatly Improved Coffee Flavor! (Conical Burr Grinder vs. Blade)review/text: I purchased a DeLonghi blade grinder from Amazon almost ten years ago, which was a big improvement over pre-ground coffee. Though I'm happy that the DeLonghi lasted so long, the conical burr grinder made such an ENORMOUS difference in the flavor of my morning Joe, I almost wish the DeLonghi had died sooner!! This grinder is very sturdy, but it also looks very stylish as a permanent addition to my counter. My only hope now is that it wears as well as the DeLonghi!
