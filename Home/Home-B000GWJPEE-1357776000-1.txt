review/summary: Great (when it works)review/text: I made the decision to buy 4 of these humidifiers after it got great reviews from Consumer Reports, which is how I choose most things these days. Two of these units malfunctioned within a few weeks. They start up, but then make a loud buzzing noise and stop producing the water vapor. I've tried cleaning them out with new water, making sure there wasn't any contaminates on the part that makes the vapor but couldn't get them to stop malfunctioning. The other two work great and have helped reduce the dryness in my children's bedrooms. I don't plan on replacing them with the same units since a 50% defective rate isn't worth the aggravation in my opinion.
