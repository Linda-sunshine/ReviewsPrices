review/summary: Didn't last long!review/text: Item was billed as waterproof, so I was not careful when around liquids. I guess I should have been as after about six months of use it quit working. Display went blank so I thought it might be battery. Took it apart & the inside was rusted out. I never left it submerged for any length of time, just tested liquids & washed it. Can't be too surprised, it is a $10 thermometer
