review/summary: Spaghetti and zoodlesreview/text: I've used this a couple times. I just changed to a paleo diet, so I originally got it to make zucchini &#34;noodles&#34;. As son as it came I took it out of the box, didn't have to assemble anything, just take the little pieces of tape off of the blades, wash them, and I was ready to go. It was super simple to use and the zucchini turned out great. Clean up was even easier. All the pieces come apart, wash easily, and then pop right back together. The other thing I made was sweet potato curly fries, which were great. Next on the list is going to be apple chips.
