review/summary: One Great cup at a time!!review/text: First if your looking for the cheapest way to have a cup of coffeee this product is probably not the best fit. However, for great taste and a single cup at a time it works great. The variety is abundant and with Green Mountain's patent expiring the cost of K cups should slowly begin coming down. The ease of use will cause anyone to drink more single cups of coffee so keep that in mind. Also clean the reservoir good and cycle 2-3 full runs to flush out that factory packaged taste many complain about at first. It will quickly become your favorite kitchen device and will please many guests for years to come!
