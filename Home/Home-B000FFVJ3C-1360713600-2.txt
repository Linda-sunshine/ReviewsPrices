review/summary: Total disasterreview/text: Waiting time and delivery were great, After getting my first batch of things to dehydrate ready I turned on the machine and it lasted maybe 20 seconds tops before there was a strong smell of burning plastic and a pop. I now have to go through the sending back and trying to get my money back etc.I was also disappointed that there was no on/off switch and I wasn't very happy with the settings, In general if it hadn't blown straight away it was the right size for what I wanted.
