review/summary: Good but a little fragile!review/text: My wife likes to bake, and she read in a magazine about cookie dough scoops. So we looked around and picked up the Oxo based on price and good reviews.The scoop is great, but a little fragile. You see, this is actually our second scoop, the first one we had worked fine until it broke while trying to scoop some cold chocolate cookie dough.We are now a little more careful.
