review/summary: Works great but light doesn't turn on any longerreview/text: This electric kettle works great, boils water quick and shuts off automatically after boiling. It use to have a light that turns blue when you turn it on to boil, but stopped working after a month, although it still boils so not a big problem. I did notice a bit of a taste like a plastic or some kind of after taste but after we switched to soft water i did not have that taste any longer, even with my stove top kettle i had a taste to it so the soft water helps. I still love it and would recommend.
