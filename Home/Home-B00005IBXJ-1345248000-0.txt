review/summary: Could be great, but only ok due to poor designreview/text: If it were not for a few design flaws this could be a great little device. On the plus side, it does do a very good job of cooking frozen pizza. If you like crisper crusts, you may need to have it cook just from the bottom for about five minutes before setting it cook from dual sides- but otherwise very happy with how it cooks. Unfortunately the engineers who designed this thing stopped there when figuring out how to make it convenient for use. First off, they omitted an on/off switch. The tray will spin the entire time it placed on the oven unless you unplug it. For someone like me who would like to just leave it on my counter without having to store the tray separately this is annoyance. Secondly, balancing the tray on the pin can somtimes be a bit challenging. I do not find it quite as precarious as some other reviewers have described, but still not fun. Some people have said that the nonstick finish on their tray was problem, but I have not experienced this. It probably depends on how you use and clean it however. I only use for pizza but if used for greasy foods likes wings or cleaned with something abrasive I can see how you might damage it. The last problem would be the dial timer being imprecise. If your food is done prior to the time you set it for, you either have to let it just remove the food and let it finish, or force it back to zero wich feels like you are breaking it. All in all, if you get one of these for a good deal you will probably be happy enough with it, but be prepared to be whistfull for how much better it could have been.
