review/summary: Emergency kitreview/text: A stove top coffee pot is MUST for every emergency kit. When my power goes out, even with a generator, my drip coffee maker draws so much power that I'd need to turn everything else off. This Farberware pot works great and looks beautiful too. It's definitely slower than an electric coffee maker and the coffee is piping hot! Great for camping too.
