review/summary: Very Solid Built Juicerreview/text: I don't normally write reviews, however, feel it necessary on this particular juicer. I have been a juicer off and on for 20 yrs. I really like this juicer. I've had it for about a month now. In fact, I would say I love this juicer. Yes, it is not without its very small flaws but nothing in life is perfect. This is my 4th juicer of the centrifugal type. They all work in the same manner. Shred your produce and then whirl the juice out the front and the pulp out the back. Clean up is a breeze as long as you clean your machine immediately after juicing. This juicer does a great job juicing just about everything (including leafy greens if they are bunched up tight and loaded in the chute and pressed very slowly thru the machine)with the exception of citrus. However, Citrus really isn't a problem because I just run the pulp thru 2 or 3 times and end up with pretty dry pulp. If you are looking for speed and convenience, then this juicer will meet your needs. Yield is good. While it's true centrifugal juicers do oxidize the juices more than a masticating juicer, it is really a trade off. Do you want speed, convenience and pulp free juices or are you willing to take the time to cut your produce into very small pieces, spend more time waiting for your produce to be juiced and then drink a pulpy juice that may or may not have more nutrition? This is the bottom line. Because in the end, if you have a juicer that you don't use, what good is it to your health? I prefer speed and convenience. This is the juicer for me and it keeps me juicing several times a day.
