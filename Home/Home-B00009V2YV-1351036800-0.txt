review/summary: Great weather radio; lousy alarm clockreview/text: I bought this weather radio/alarm clock with the belief that I could replace two electronics on my nightstand with just one. This was a mistake. Reviewers who rave about the Midland WR300 Weather Radio are right; it's a great weather radio.As a clock, though, it is LOUSY. The clock is indeed the little tiny thing in the top right of the photo. I had hoped that when an alert displayed, it replaced the clock display, but no. When there's no alert, the 3/4 of the display is taken up with...wait for it...the date. Useful, but not the main purpose of a *clock.* The display is also difficult to read. It's either unlit and unreadable in the dark, or constantly backlit and too bright for a bedroom.Setting the alarm clock means that users have to access the clock's menu where each keystroke has an accompanying *beep,* so be sure to remember to turn down the radio's volume or set it when your sleeping partner is awake.I debated about returning this unit and going back to my previous weather radio/clock setup, but I decided to keep it for two reasons: 1) it's a way better weather radio than my previous model because I can choose to suppress alarms I don't care about (like fog warnings) and 2) I can and did buy a thinner alarm clock than my previous model. So, I still have two electronics on my nightstand, but I like them much better.Bottom line: buy this because it's a good weather radio, not because of the alarm clock feature.
