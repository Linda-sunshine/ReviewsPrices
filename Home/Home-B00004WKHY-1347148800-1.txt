review/summary: My new kitchen #&tch !review/text: I ordered this a few weeks ago when my 11 Cup (Costco purchased) Cuisinart Pusher Unit cracked and failed, for the second time in 7 years. Parts (replacement bowls and pushers) had become scarce, and I was guilty of putting the plastic pieces into the dishwasher, many times each week over 7 years. I'm not complaining at all..... Loved that processor.There are a lot of great things about this new processor that I enjoy though. It's lightening fast. It's powerful enough for my heavy home-made pasta dough. It's totally beautiful (bigger than it looks in pics). But maybe the best thing about this new machine, is that in addition to the great reviews and performance, it fits my old faithful DLC-8 DLC-10 blades. My 2mm, and 6mm slicers, and a french fry blade from the old work-horse are being re-deployed with this model.Note - The old metal chopping blade and the old attachment stem are NOT compatible, so check your spec'sSo far, this processor is performing really well. I did a lot of research and seriously considered the KA Architect with the adjustable blade (tempting feature!!!). But, I'm still really happy with my choice of Cuisinart again.
