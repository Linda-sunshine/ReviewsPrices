review/summary: Quality issues and potential safety issue.review/text: IF YOU HAVE A YOUNG CHILD/BABY THAT CAN NOT SPEAK YET, DON'T GET THIS PRODUCT.This product line has quality issues and a potential safety issue. I bought 2 of these humidifiers. The first one the frog from Target. At first it was very quiet. After about 2 months, the frog started humming and rattling loudly. So we threw that out and bought a second one. This time it was the elephant model. It seemed to work well for a couple months. But then one night I came into the baby's room and there was a horrible plastic smell that burned my nostrils, and my baby was crying. I hope that smell isn't toxic. Do a search for the word "smell" on all the low ranked comments and you'll notice many people having this same issue.
