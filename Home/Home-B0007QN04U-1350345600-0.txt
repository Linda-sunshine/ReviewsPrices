review/summary: Worked Great for Three Yearsreview/text: The KitchenAid Professional 600 series mixer has been an awesome mixer to have. My wife used it for bread, cookies, pizza dough, cinnamon rolls, and much more. The tools that come with it have made the task easy and are easy to hand wash. The power was always sufficient and the space plenty. The thing has performed flawlessly until today, completing each task we gave it.However, today, about three years after purchasing this mixer, it broke. The engine works, but the attachments (dough hook, etc) will not spin. I called KitchenAid and was told that the warranty is for only one year. I was then told that I could send it in for repair which would cost quite a bit after purchasing a packing kit, paying a diagnostic fee, etc. The other option was to call a local repair center (2 hours away) and work it out with them. The lady on the phone was very friendly, but I am frustrated that such an expensive item would break in just three years.I ended up searching the internet and found a YouTube video (search "kitchenaid 600 repair") showing me how to diagnose/fix problems with the gears. Apparently this is not an abnormal problem to have... After watching two videos I was able to take my mixer apart and ordered repair parts/grease through KitchenAid's website (linked to another). Amazon.com also sells many of these parts, but I feared ordering the wrong ones. One of the gears had chipped away while another was showing significant wear (professional series... seriously?). I ended up spending money on a couple of tools as well and will hopefully get this thing working on my own.I just wanted to warn people that while you may have the best mixer at first... it may need some repair in just a few years. Something to consider, especially if you don't think you'll be able to figure out how to fix it on your own.
