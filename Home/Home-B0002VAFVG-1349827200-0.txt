review/summary: Breville Juicerreview/text: My former juicer was a Jack LaLanne. Well made but lots of plastic. Breville uses steel and high impact plastic. Beautifully made. Works very well. The pulp is almost dry---that tells you how much juice this machine can take out of just about any veggie or fruit. Highly recommend.
