review/summary: Love this slicer!review/text: I bought this spiral slicer to make zucchini "spaghetti" since we have so much zucchini in our garden. I love the way the "spaghetti" turns out. It is wonderful with my homemade spaghetti sauce. This unit is made of plastic but seems to be very sturdy. I highly recommend it!
