review/summary: The bestreview/text: I love my KitchenAid. It is the best appliance ever. The bowl is big enough and the motor is plenty for a most anything you may need one to whip up.I have made bread, pasta, cakes, mashed potatoes and many other things.I have had it for about four years now and have never had any problems with the motor or any other aspect of the machine. I would highly recommend getting this KitchenAid.
