review/summary: Makes great coffee, BUT...review/text: Bought this coffee maker about a year and a half ago. Was very happy with it until the black plastic handle and top broke completely free of the stainless carafe about 6 months ago. It broke in the middle of pouring a cup of coffee, spilling coffee everywhere. We attempted to fix it by gluing the black plastic top onto the stainless steel with super glue. Yeah, that didn't work and again ended up with a full pot of coffee on the floor and all over us, this time the entire handle snapped off. By the way, we are NOT super humans with extraordinary strength! And we didn't beat up or treat the carafe badly, just used it normally as one would when making coffee. Just plain poor design on Cuisinart's part. Boo. I would've rated this 1 star, but it did make pretty good tasting coffee.
