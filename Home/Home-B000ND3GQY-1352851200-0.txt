review/summary: Excellent Quality, Especially for the Pricereview/text: I use this wok almost daily. It is large enough to make a stir fry dinner for an entire family in the one pot. I like the fact that it is healthy stainless steel and not some chemical coated pan. It cleans up pretty easy with steel scouring pads. On the few occasions that hasn't worked I use Bon Ami, and on the even fewer times when the really tough, burned on stuff was too much for Bon Ami, Barkeeper's Friend scouring powder did the trick. I like to use this wok for scrambled eggs as I can make a big batch at one time and then leave it in the fridge for family members to have breakfast on their individual schedules. If I had to trim my life down to 100 items suggested by Internet minimalist challenges, this wok would be near the top of my keepers list.
