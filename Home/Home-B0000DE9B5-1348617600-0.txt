review/summary: Heavy, but durable, lid is a painreview/text: I bought this to make sun tea. It is very compact, but does fit 2 quarts of liquid in it. The pitcher is heavy itself, and once it's full of liquid, it is verrry heavy for my wife. The lid has some type of turn and suction technology to it. It is kind of a pain to work with...sometimes it is hard to get the lid to stay on. Also, when you pour, liquid will run down the pitcher.
