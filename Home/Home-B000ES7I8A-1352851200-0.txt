review/summary: Excellent, practical, electric kettlereview/text: This kettle is wonderful. I have had it for a week and I get so much use out of it. It holds enough water for many cups of tea, and is perfect for boiling water for my french press in the mornings when I am in a hurry.The only thing I would be careful about is when your pour the water, do so slowly. Though the kettle does have a spout the water is very hot and can spill over a bit if you pour too fast.This product is worth the money! It would make a great gift for those in college who might not have access to a stove, or anyone who is an avid hot beverage drinker.
