review/summary: Very convenient in every wayreview/text: This hand blender is perfect for quick blending jobs without having to engage the full sized blender and the ensuing clean up that's required with those. This one blends quick and takes only a minute to clean. Obviously, this is only for light items. Anything hard or chunky still requires the full size blender. Had this for a long time now and it's still going strong.
