review/summary: Tea at workreview/text: I bought this device because I'm the only person that likes tea at work; there are no provisions for getting plain boiling water.First: this is a really affordable device. It is also simple to use. From the picture, you can see a tab on the top of the handle: flip it up to turn on the heating element, and down to turn off (there is also an automatic turn-off if there is no water in it).Minimum water level is about 10 fl oz. and max is 32 fl oz (1 liter). I filled it half way (about 20 fl oz)The notations on the window provide a guide level at minimum, .5Liter, 4 teacup (~20oz), 6 teacup (~30oz, and 1 liter (maximum). You could probably put a little more water that 1 liter, but you run the risk of it spilling out when the water comes to a heavy boil.Also, after a while you may need to descale the interior, depending on your water quality. I've been using bottled water for a little while, and there is not any visible signs of hard water. There is more information on cleaning in the instruction manual.Since I haven't used the expensive and top-tier kettles, I can not compare this to them; however, this is a great value for a simple task.
