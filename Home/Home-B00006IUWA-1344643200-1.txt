review/summary: Amazing Popperreview/text: I checked out the reviews on this popper before I bought it, and it has surpassed my expectations. It pops almost every kernal quickly and deposits the popped corn efficiently in the bowl below the spout. I'd buy another, and have recommended it to my kids. It was extremely well priced through Amazon.
