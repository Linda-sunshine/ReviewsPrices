review/summary: love itreview/text: i bake bread nearly every day. sometimes 2 or 3 loaves a day. love this!!! buy an extra pan if you are as serious as i am about baking. then you can have 1 ready to pop in as soon as one is done.take the machine outside to cool quickly to make it ok to bake again. [ it has a sensor or something that insists the machine is cool b/4 you can bake again]
