review/summary: Failed on the tenth cupreview/text: I am regretting my decision to replace my Tassimo machine with a Keurig. I had my Bosch Tassimo brewer for 3 years before it started experiencing a small problem, but since Keurig had such a larger selection of cups, I decided I would make the switch. After reading all of the reviews, I stupidly thought I could be immune to the problem with these machines, but I was wrong. My brewer's box said the brewer was manufactured 2 months ago, so it was the latest version and it had a larger capacity water well. I went to start my tenth cup of coffee and the water was no longer being pumped through enough to make a 1/4 cup of coffee or hot water. After following the cleaning instructions, including using a paper clip to clean out the holes in the piercer (why don't they just include a cleaning tool?), there was no improvement. I contacted tech support who didn't sound the least bit surprised that this was happening and they are sending me a new unit. I don't have much hope for this brewer lasting much longer than the warranty period... and definitely can't imagine me using it for 3 years like my Tassimo. If (err, WHEN) my next brewer fails, I will have to carefully think about whether to stay with Keurig or not. How could this problem be ignored for so long?
