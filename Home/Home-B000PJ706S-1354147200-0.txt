review/summary: don't buy this!!!review/text: Looks can be deceiving as they say. This is a beautiful looking water kettle and for that reason I bought it. However, like others have said, there is a horrible chemical smell and taste when you boil the water. Even after I add sugar and milk in my tea, you can still taste a chemical. Not a good thing to say the least. This company should correct the problem.
