review/summary: Excellent juicer for a beginner and FASTreview/text: We are beginning juicers. Though I had done extensive research and understand that a masticating juicer preserves more nutrients in the juice from the slow extraction, I know myself and wouldn't use it all that much (patience is a virtue, but not one of my virtues). This juicer is FAST and extremely easy to clean. Cold veggies = cold juice, so the juice is not heated up much in the process. As another reviewer said, the best juicer is the one that you'll use daily: this is THAT juicer.
