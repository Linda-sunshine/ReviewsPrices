review/summary: You need this if you're a loose tea loverreview/text: If you regularly use loose leaf tea, you absolutely NEED this. I bought one for my dad and ended up loving it so much that I bought one for myself. It's incredibly easy to use, not ridiculously hard to clean and makes the perfect cup of tea every time. I've not had problems with the filter coming loose at all. Pair this with an electric kettle and making great loose leaf tea is so easy you'll never think of using bags again.I think I might buy one of the 32 oz one day too, but for now the 16 oz suits me fine.
