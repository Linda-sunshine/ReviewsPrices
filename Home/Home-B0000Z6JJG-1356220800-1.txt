review/summary: Easy to get bored of...review/text: I used a lot in the first week, but now it's only occasional. I did make shredded carrots today that cost $2 less that the bag my roommate bought. I'm in a big salad mood this week so my usage for cucumbers, carrots, lettuce and eggs today will be worth it and save some $$, but then it will sit for a month
