review/summary: Utility blenderreview/text: This little guy gets used every day to prep breakfast smothies. Its ice-crush feature is a marvel of success -- each dose gets 18-20 large ice-maker ice-cubes to smash, and they are really cold. This blender has never jammed on the ice or soups or meat loads: great power and blade design. It cleans easily. It looks sharp. It works. My only problem is that after a month or so, the carafe tends to leak around the bearing and then it slings some droplets against the skirted extension to the carafe -- which keeps the work-area clean and tidy (great design job there also). A little more leak-proof bearings would be a useful enhancement, but the design does capture any leakage.
