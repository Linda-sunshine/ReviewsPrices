review/summary: Like sitting in front of a firereview/text: The heater is pretty much what I hoped it would be. It is radient heat and feels like sitting before an open fire. Do not expect it to warm up a room. If the room is cold, your back (or whatever is not facing the heater) will feel cool. So dress accordingly. I am quite satisfied with the heater after a month of using it in our unheated, enclosed patio here on Lake Erie.
