review/summary: Helps so much with my allergiesreview/text: The Air Purifier works in our basement apartment great. It is L-shaped and we use it for all areas but the bedroom, we have a smaller Honeywell Pure HEPA Air Purifier there. It has reduce my headaches, and we are not changing out the Filtrete filter three month filter every month. It used to be covered with dust, which I am allergic to. I have several health issues and this has kept me healthier this winter, than I have been since we moved here.
