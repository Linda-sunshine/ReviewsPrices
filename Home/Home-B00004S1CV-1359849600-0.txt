review/summary: Great mug for coffee and teareview/text: I have had this mug for about 3 years now. The size holds a very reasonable amount of liquid and keeps it piping hot or very cold. The no fuss tops simply screw on and do not leak. The top is very thick so it helps maintain the temperature when the mug is closed.When making a cup of tea, I put the leaves into the filter, screw on the filter, pour the hot water through the filter until I can barely see the water through the leaves, screw the top on, and turn it upside down. When the steeping is complete, I unscrew both tops, screw on the sip top, and have hot tea for quite a long time.Probably the only con is that when making tea I either have to carry either the sip top or filter loose in my bag or drink without the sip top. I wish there was some way the filter and sip top could work together.All in all a great product.
