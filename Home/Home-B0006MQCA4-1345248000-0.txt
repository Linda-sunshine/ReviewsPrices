review/summary: Great Water Filterreview/text: I have used this product for about 7 weeks and am very satisfied with it. Some reviews I read indicated a problem with the spout leaking. I found that when the water level was low there was a tendency to drip a little. So I don't let it get very low and have not had a problem.
