review/summary: Sweet dreamsreview/text: Partial to Egyptian high thread count cotton as flannel makes me too hot in middle of night. So far: man, Portuguese got it right! Wondering how long elastic corners hold out but after first wash & 2 weeks of nightly sleep are fine. Pleased so far; definitely recommend.
