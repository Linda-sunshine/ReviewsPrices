review/summary: Wonder! Except...review/text: The reason I chose this Keurig over the normal Keurig (non-platinum) was because of it's ability to &#34;adjust the brew temperature&#34; to make iced coffee. I was under the impression you'd be able to drop the brew temperature to whatever you like (it doesn't specify this anywhere in the product description). After opening it, I realized you can lower the temperature to about 5 degrees below the normal brew temp...so still have to wait for it to cool down for iced coffee. The product works fine, but definitely not worth the extra money just for this feature.
