review/summary: Why did I not buy this pan sooner?!?!review/text: It is now apparent that I've been making myself suffer by using non-stick pans and spending 10-15 minutes afterwards trying to scrape and clean off the remnants of whatever it was I was cooking. I purchased this pan specifically for making scrambled eggs (easily a 15 minute clean-up job using my old pans) and if there were ever a law created to adopt a pan as an official member of the family, I would do so with this pan in a second.I normally don't wait for the "hot spot" logo to disappear before using it, so I can't attest to whether that aspect of this pan works as described. However, the pan seems very even heat-wise and cleanup afterwards, even for scrambled eggs, takes less time than it takes to get the pan out and put it back. Amazing.I wholeheartedly recommend this pan that America's Test Kitchen recommended and I wouldn't be surprised if I order one or two more so I can cook more than I item at a time.
