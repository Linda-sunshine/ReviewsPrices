review/summary: Good Dehydratorreview/text: I've never had a different one to compare this to, but so far I love it. It works very well on the fruit I've tried it on. I've done persimmons, bananas, apples, oranges, mangoes and cantaloupe. Haven't tried any meat yet but I'm fairly confident it will be good for jerky too. Very simple to use and I like the heat setting which has the recommended temps for each type of food printed next to the dial.I do recommend getting a good cleaning brush for getting into all the crevices on the trays.
