review/summary: Defective toggle switchreview/text: This is a great coffee pot, except for one problem. It doesn't stay on. The on-off toggle switch is cool-looking but it tends to switch itself off after a while. At first this happened sporadically, but now after over a year, it's almost impossible to switch it on at all since it goes off as soon as you release the toggle switch. I called Cuisinart and they told me that there is another model of the DCC-1200 with a button and that the toggle-switch model is only available through club stores, but the toggle-switch version is the model Amazon has on its web site. I would strongly advise anyone wanting to keep this pot for more than a month to look for the other model with a button but I can't find it anywhere on the web.Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew Central 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Black/Brushed Metal
