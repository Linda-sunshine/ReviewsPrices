review/summary: Great Canner!review/text: My husband and I have decided to start canning. We purchased this for those vegetables and meats that need to be pressure canned. This pressure canner holds 7 quarts and 18 pints. We like the weighted pressure gauge with a choice of 3 weights combined with the pressure gauge dial to see the pressure increase/decrease when cooking. We like not having a rubber gasket. The canner is easy to use and is American made.
