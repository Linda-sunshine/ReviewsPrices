review/summary: More than Pizzareview/text: I'm prejudiced. I like cast iron for cooking. This pizza pan is an utilitarian tool for the kitchen. Yes, it makes great pizza but it can also be used to make Bisquick's drop biscuits for example. I've even used it to make delicious pork rinds. Not sure you can do that with a pizza stone. Use your imagination. Like all cast iron, it holds heat beautifully with no hot spots and you don't have to worry about it breaking. I've had mine for a couple of years now.
