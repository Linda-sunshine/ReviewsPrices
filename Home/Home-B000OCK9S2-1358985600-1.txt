review/summary: Unusablereview/text: This machine impedes sleep in two ways. First, the clock produces a a bright blue light that I can see through my eyelids. The second and most annoying problem is the loop on the sounds. Instead of drifting to sleep, my consciousness constantly attends to the strange noises it makes when it loops. I cannot use this machine and will have to buy another.
