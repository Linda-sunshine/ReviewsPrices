review/summary: Love Willow Tree Figurines, Especially This Onereview/text: I love this figurine. My wife and I are expecting our first child. Our anniversary is in a week and I thought this would be a great gift to give her. I feel like it really symbolizes our love for each other and for the child that we will have. I love the craftsmanship that goes into all the willow tree figurines. They really are well made and make a great collection. It seems like there is a figurine to commemorate almost any life event, which is awesome. We are excited to embark on this adventure together and I love the fact that we can have this figurine to always remind us of this time.
