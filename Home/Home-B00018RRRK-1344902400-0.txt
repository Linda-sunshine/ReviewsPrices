review/summary: Worked mediocre for exactly one year now deadreview/text: I bought this unit July 2011 and it is very messy and noisy. Also exactly after warranty ran out all of a sudden there is no power. I bought it for $39.97 a year ago and now it is being sold here for $59.99. Why would exact same crappy model go up $20? I suggest getting a better one.
