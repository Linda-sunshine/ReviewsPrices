review/summary: Perfectreview/text: I never knew I needed one these. Bought this on a wimb to make some green tea and it essentially changed our lives. Now we eat more oatmeal, drink more tea, and switched to starbucks coffee. This thing is amazing, easy to use and heats water super fast. Every now and again we have to clean it though cause we have hard water and a sediment starts to form, but I cant fault the pot for out water situation. If I lost this, I would pay double to get it back.
