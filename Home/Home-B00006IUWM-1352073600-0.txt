review/summary: Good, but not greatreview/text: It sharpens knives, but it appears to not have a strong enough motor. Most of my knives slow it down so much it doesn't sharpen them quickly.However, with patience, it does sharpen them. I have to finish them with steel from my knife block or a stone, but it works well with patience
