review/summary: It is what it is.review/text: Look. This isn't a big dehumidifier that will suck out all the water from the air. But if you live in an moist area this thing could work for a small room. I'm a freshman in college in South Carolina and this thing sucks out 200-300 mL from the area per 24 hour period.It doesn't make the air feel like it does with a full sized dehumidifier, but it improves it a lot, and a little goes a long way. If I come into the room after not being in it for a long time, it's very noticeable and very nice. However, when I am in a lot, the room can still feel a little humid.The noise is not really noticeable, it's a little hum. The AC unit in my dorm is a good bit louder than it, but admittedly that unit is pretty old. I have no trouble sleeping with it on, and it's right below my bed. You could probably sleep better, in fact, since I at least find it hard to sleep when it's humid.
