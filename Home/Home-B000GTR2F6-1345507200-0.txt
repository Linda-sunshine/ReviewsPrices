review/summary: Think twice before purchasing this product!review/text: Over the past 11 years I have made purchases through Amazon.com and this is my first review. I want to clarify this is not a negative review against Amazon.com but rather a "VERY NEGATIVE" review of Keurig, Inc. We bought our Keurig Platinum B70 several years ago through Amazon.com and this week it stopped working. Over the time of ownership our Keurig was well maintained, the needles (Top & Bottom) were kept clean and de-scaling was performed to eliminate calcium/mineral blockages. I have called Keurig, Inc. twice and each time the customer service representative will only entertain a $62 discount towards a new Keurig leaving me to pay $117.95 plus 5% sales tax. On my second call I requested an explanation of why some people got better discounts toward their replacement Keurig such as a replacement cost of only $79.99...I was told it was based on the serial number. I then asked if there was a known manufacture defect and there was a "LONG" pause before the customer service representative said no. I will never buy another Keurig Product and will ensure to tell my family, friends, and co-workers that Keurig products are not made to last and think twice before making a purchase from this company. Its really to bad because this ultimately hurts the companies who manufacture the k-cups. I just finished canceling our seven k-cup quarterly subscriptions with Amazon.com, it was nice while it lasted! :(
