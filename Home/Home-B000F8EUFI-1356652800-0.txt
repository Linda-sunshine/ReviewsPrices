review/summary: Dirt Devil Vacuum & Dirt Devil Steam Mop; Merry Christmas to me !review/text: This vacuum cleaner and matching steam mop are beyond belief. I purchased this vacuum & the matching Dirt Devil Steam Mop Wednesday, the day after Christmas and they both arrived today, Friday, December 28th. What wonderful tools! Our family Bissell vacuum cleaner and Shark steam mop were no longer performing. Both Dirt Devils do an amazing job. Do not be deceived by their respective price. I really was not impressed with our Bissell vacuum cleaner from the start, but that was the cleaning instrument of choice my wife chose. I, on the other hand, purchased two Shark steam mops. I thought they were OK until I tried out our new Dirt Devil steam mop. There is no comparison. After steam cleaning our tile floor, I realized how truly great the Dirt Devil mop is. I would recommend these tools to anyone and everyone. Shopping online can be somewhat traumatic; these are a great buy. I vacuumed our tile floor first with our old unit, and was surprised how much leftover the Dirt Devil picked up. This is the best present I could have given myself !!!
