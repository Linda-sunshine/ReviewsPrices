review/summary: Great tasting waterreview/text: I use these in my Brita pitcher Slim to purify the college dorm water. The water just out of the tap tastes a bit metallic but after being filtered the bad taste goes away. Since its only my roommate and I, we only have to change it about once a semester. Good deal overall :)
