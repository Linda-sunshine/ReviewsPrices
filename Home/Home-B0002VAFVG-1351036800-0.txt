review/summary: Best thing ever!review/text: I absolutely love that I bought this juicer. I was a little concerned about spending $300 on something I've only seen online--but I am really glad I did.I've only been juicing for about 2 months total and I started out with an inexpensive one to make sure it was something I would stick with. After about 2 weeks with the smaller juicer I decided to get this Breville to cut down on the time I needed to chop up produce to fit in the smaller juicer. I love that I can drop small whole apples down the shoot--larger ones I have to slice in half--sometimes quarters to fit.It is SO efficient I can't stand it!! Clean up is pretty simple...sometimes the basket take a little bit of time to clean--especially with carrots. The only only issue I've had is with certain produce you get sprayed on from the area where the compost shoot goes into the retaining bucket. I suggest you use throw away bags in the compost bucket as well. I just use plastic grocery store ones.The basket scrub brush that comes with it is a life saver!Cleans the basket perfectly.The compost is pretty dry and compared to the other juicer I had this thing is awesome! It juices anything and there is a lot of juice coming out. I like that the little pitcher that collects the juice also helps pull back some of the foam when you pour it into your drinking glass.The parts break down quickly--from start to finish (meaning cleaning the machine and putting it in the dishrack) less than 5 minutes!! Highly recommend this juicer!Will update if anything changes.
