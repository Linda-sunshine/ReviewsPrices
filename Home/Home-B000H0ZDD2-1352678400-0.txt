review/summary: no more musty/mildew smellreview/text: We have always had moisture problems, and my closet never seemed to have a 'fresh' smell. I am amazed how much water this collects in such a short period of time. We have several room dehumidifiers for use during the summer. I was on the verge of cutting ventilation holes in each of the 6 doors on our closet. I knew that would help, but wouldn't really solve the problem. I was browsing through Amazon (daily activity) when I accidently saw these small dehumidifiers. I wanted several, but ordered just one to see if it worked. The amount of water it collects along with the freshening of my closet convinces me this was a great purchase. I think how close I was to undertaking a major headache (cutting 8 closet doors) and I can't believe how lucky I am to have found this. I will be ordered more for other areas. I haven't had it long, so I can't attest to its longevity, but if it quits, I will keep ordering another one.
