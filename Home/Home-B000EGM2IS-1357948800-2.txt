review/summary: Love it!!!!!!!review/text: I love the Hot Shot and they are impossible to find in stores. This is the 2nd I've bought for myself (the previous was very well used) and I've given two as gifts. Has water ready for your tea or whatever in less than a minute and it's attractive enough I don't mind it on my countertop.
