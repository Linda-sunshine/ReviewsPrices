review/summary: I am never going back to a non memory foam matted mattress ever again.review/text: I have been experience lots of joint pains and tossing and turning on my spring mattress for awhile now and my mattress is only 6 months old. I bought this foam mattress in the hopes it would fix my bed problem and wow it feels awsome. I can finally sleep better now and no more tossing and turning. Yay!I'm 5' 10" and I weigh 215lbs and this 2" mattress does a perfect job of cushioning and supporting me while I sleep on my bed.Be warned though, this mattress has a strong minty scent on it when first opened. It does go away after while, but some people might now like the smell at first.***Update 01/28/2013****I had to drop it down one star because it does have a odd odor to it when you first open the packed mattress. There's a un natural chemical smell it gives off, it smells like mint, vinegar, menthal mixed together. The smell is pretty strong when you first use it and it take like around a 1 month before the smell went away. I heard this is a commonon problem and that letting it air outside will remove the smell quicker.
