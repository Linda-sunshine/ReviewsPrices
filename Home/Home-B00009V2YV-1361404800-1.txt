review/summary: So far so good...review/text: I'll update this review after getting through the spring 'storm' season and see if it give me all the alerts I need. As far as the weekly tests, it has alerted each time so far...I will say, though, that the instructions for this radio are terrible. For example, there is a pretty major typo that says you *cannot* turn *on* alerts for Tornados (the main reason I bought it). The website says it's a typo and that it should say cannot turn *off*. Apparently this has been a typo for a while, so I don't know why they haven't reprinted the book.Additionally, the radio is not intutive. With most things, I can pick it up and play with it for a few minutes and figure it out. For some reason, however they designed and setup this radio, it just doesn't 'flow' - however, even though the instructions are pretty crappy, if you follow along with the manual, you can get it set up fairly painlessly.One last minor complaint - the weather 'channels' are labeled 1-7 (which is fine), but NOAA doesn't name anything by 'channel', they organize their stations by frequency. I can pick up two or three 'channels' at my house, but there is no easy way for me to know if I should have the radio set to channel 3 or channel 7 other than just sitting there and listening to the radio to see what channel is broadcasting for my city. It would be handy if they either just programmed the radio in frequencies (so I can easily go to the NOAA website and know what frequency I need to be on) or at least print in the manual what channel is equal to what frequency.Overall, I would say once you get it set up, it seems like it will work pretty well... but time will tell...
