review/summary: Super helperreview/text: This is a wonderful aide in any kitchen. How many times do you go to your trash can with your full of dinner prep, kids clean up, anything and struggle with the peddle without dropping anything. This trash can senses you near and opens for you to drop in your trash can. This is my second touchless trash can. The first trash can lasted 8 years, and I immediately went looking for another trash can. When I saw that Amazon carried the touchless trash an I didn't think twice about ordering it. It runs on simple batteries. Best kitchen appliance I own.
