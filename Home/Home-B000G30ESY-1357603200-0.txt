review/summary: This appliance is worth the money!review/text: Received this rice cooker as a "requested" Christmas present. It's amazing. Yes you do need to honor the liquid ratios but the rice is amazing! So good you can eat it plain. Because I have to eat gluten free I've been experimenting with other foods to make using the rice cooker - risotto is spectacular and so easy to make! I also added small bits of ham to the risotto (who can finish up a spiral ham?) the results were delicious. You are probably wondering about ratios for risotto so here's what I did. Two cups risotto and one 32oz box of all natural chicken stock, 1/2 diced onion and 1/2 stick of butter. I used the quick option - my 17 year old was starving. After the risotto cooked I added small diced pieces of ham- about 1.5 cups to the creamy risotto and turn the rice cooker to steam for 10 minutes. It was superb. And the best part - the clean up is really easy. This sounds like a commercial I know - but seldom does a product live up to its reviews. This one is definitely worth the money.
