review/summary: Good knife for the pricereview/text: The handle has an almost sticky rubber that feels great in your hand. The blade is made of a good steel and looks to be at least 3/4 tang through the handle.I got this knife as a gift for a friend that needed a solid starter chef's knife, and he says it works better than any knife he's ever used. I'm sure there are nicer knives out there, but probably not at this price point.
