review/summary: Awesome, with one flaw.review/text: Retains heat amazingly. Cooks evenly. Solid American made product. I can turn off the burners and still cook on it for another 10-15 minutes.It needs one improvement. The angle that is meant to allow fat and oils to drain off into the gutter is not significant enough. I even got out a small level and checked my stove and the griddle for level just to make sure. Oils and fats tend to pool in the upper corners and don't drain and the angle of slope itself needs to be a little more significant. If Lodge could fix this they would have a 5 star, perfect product.
