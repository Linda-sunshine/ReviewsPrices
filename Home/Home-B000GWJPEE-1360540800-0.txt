review/summary: I LOVE THIS LIL GUYreview/text: This is my first humidifier so I have very little to compare it to, but he was super simple to set up and he's SO CUTE. The moisture that comes out is cool-- is that normal? It looks like steam but isn't, so fun. He doesn't really fit my decor (I'm an adult woman living in an NYC studio) but he's worth it. I was worried that I'd pick the wrong animal, but now I'm confident that penguin was the best choice. When I put his little head on (after filling him w/ water), I like to put it facing a little askew because that makes him look like he has attitude and I like that.
