review/summary: Broken hardware (brass bolt) includedreview/text: I tried to assemble this glider chair, however one of the 6 small bolts included for assembly was broken. The end of the bolt (where the allen wrench fits) was not punched correctly at the factory, and therefore the allen wrench will not seat into the bolt head. Totally frustrating. I contacted Amazon to try to get just a replacement bolt but they said I have to return the whole chair, which I have already mostly assembled and would have to spend 30 minutes taking apart and packing up again. Just for a bolt. Totally frustrating, and too much inconvenience to return this bulky item. I will just buy a replacement bolt next time I go to the hardware store.
