review/summary: Can't get a keurig machine to last over a yearreview/text: Bought this machine at Costco after the untimely death of the previous addition. Love the bigger tank and I swore the coffee tasted better on this machine. This morning my kcup refused to brew. After unplugging multiple times a strange noise came out of the machine. Turns out the water was refilling back into the tank. Did I mention the machine was two months old? I was able to get a replacement but these machines are on thin ice with my household.
