review/summary: Great heater!review/text: There have been so many favorable reviews of this heater that I was tempted not to write one. But, after using the heater for an hour this morning, I feel compelled to say how satisfied I am with it. There is a safety switch on the bottom that turns the heater off if it tips over. Because there is no fan, it is a silent heater, and I appreciate that! It is lightweight and compact, and it has a handy cord-wrapping pair of protrusions on the back, along with a handle that makes it easy to carry. The dial that selects high or low heat is convenient and easy to use. The heater feels and appears to be well made. So far, I have only used the heater in the high heat mode, but I was very satisfied with it, and it kept me warm from a distance of six feet with no problem. Assuming I get a few years of use out of this heater, I will be extremely happy with it. I may buy another one for use in my office at work.I bought this heater to replace a Presto parabolic heater that quit working. I was happy with the Presto heater, but I think I will like this one even better.And this heater is very reasonably priced - much less expensive than the Presto heater. And it qualifies for free Amazon shipping. So for a reasonable price, you have it delivered to your house free of charge. Such a deal!
