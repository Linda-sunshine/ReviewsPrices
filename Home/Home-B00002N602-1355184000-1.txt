review/summary: Great productreview/text: My wife has 2 other pressure cookers but larger. She ask me if I could find a smaller (6 quart) size and without the dial type pressure setting. This one has the weighted pressure regulator and it is perfect. She has used it many times now and loves it. This is the stainless steel version. Not sure how the aluminum model would compare but I think the stainless steel will hold up much longer and stay looking nicer.
