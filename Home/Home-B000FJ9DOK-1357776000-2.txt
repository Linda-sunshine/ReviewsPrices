review/summary: Great but not perfect.review/text: I've used this bottle for roughly two years and its succeeds in all the marketing claims. The single downside of this bottle is the durability of the lid. I dropped it about three feet onto a tiled floor and it landed lid first, shearing off a good chunk of it. It's unfortunate that the lid isn't partially metal to protect it from this fate.However, I purchased the identical product to replace it. Overall it's a great bottle, just be wary of lid damage.
