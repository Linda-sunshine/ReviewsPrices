review/summary: Great Coffee Maker, Impossible to pourreview/text: The Cuisinart thermal coffee maker makes a great cup of coffee and the thermos keeps it warm most of the day. It works great except for one serious fault. It is just about impossible to pour coffee out of the thermos without spilling it all over the place. This cannot be compensated for by any amount of care or diligence in pouring. It just spills out no matter how careful I or my wife try to pour it into a cup. We have to pour it over the sink. How a company such as Cuisinart could have been so lax in human ergonomics is beyond me. If there is a fix to this problem, I'd like to know. If the coffee beans are not completely ground to a powder, pieces of the bean get stuck when the coffee drips into the carafe, causing all the coffee to pour over onto the counter. Having had it for a year, we are completely dissatisfied with it and would not recommend it. It's design flaws are really not apparent until you've used it awhile. We waited too long to return it and now use the old coffee maker instead, a Black & Decker at one third the price.
