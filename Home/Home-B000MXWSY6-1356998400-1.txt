review/summary: Best alarm clock I've ever ownedreview/text: I bought this to replace my old Scientific American clock that was 10 years old. This clock is great. The alarm starts off slow so as not to startle you but progressively gets louder and faster the longer you let it go.The snooze button gives you the option to delay the alarm in 10 minute increments. So if you press it twice it will delay for 20 minutes, etc.The alarms are easy to set with the knobs on the sides. Instead of having to use 2 fingers to set the alarm, you just turn the dial in the direction you want to go.I understand this clock has other features but I only use the ones listed above. For the price I would pay it again for a good, reliable alarm clock.
