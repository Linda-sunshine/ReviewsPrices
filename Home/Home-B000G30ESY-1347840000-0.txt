review/summary: Amen...review/text: This rice cooker is AMAZING! I have been cooking rice with it for a few weeks now. It cooks perfectly every time(Clean up is very fast) and has a time setting to have it complete cooking the rice whenever you want... The only down side is that it takes about an hour and 25 minutes to cook brown rice (Which is all i eat in terms of rice) But, with a little planning, that problem goes away quickly. The design of this product is compact and convenient for small kitchens. Being a single, health conscious male, i completely approve of this product. Worth every penny.
