review/summary: very disappointedreview/text: I did alot of research before purchasing this item and I chose this one because the reviews said it chops evenly. Absolutely not true. I have tried on the chop and grind options and even putting in just 3-4 nuts some of the nuts are still practically whole while the rest of it is practically ground into flour. Very disappointed. I wouldn't recommend it at all.
