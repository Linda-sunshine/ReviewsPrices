review/summary: poor qualityreview/text: I'm not a fan. It's a cute toy, but I'll take regular brewed. The quality is poor and unsatisfactory compared to other single-serve brands I have tried. If you calculate cost per cup, this is a much more expensive alternative for a low quality tasting coffee.
