review/summary: Gift from the wifereview/text: This grinder is a huge improvement over the cheap one we used to have.PROS: Consistently sized coffee groundsMuch quieter than the rotating flat blade designsCONS: There is a decent amount of "dust". When used in conjunction with a gold filter, the dust flows through the filter and makes the last few sips at the bottom of the pot really potent.Static electric build up between the burr wheels causes some of the grinds to get stuck in the chute and make a small mess as you remove and insert the "grounds container"
