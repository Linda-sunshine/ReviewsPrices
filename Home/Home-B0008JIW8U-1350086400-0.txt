review/summary: Nice little coffeemakerreview/text: I have been using this coffeemaker for a few weeks now and I love it. It's the perfect size and I love that I can set it to make coffee for me in the morning. My only complaint is that I wish the warmer would stay on longer but I am glad it has an automatic shut off. It doesn't take up very much room on the counter and even has a space for cord storage in the back so you don't have wires all over your countertop. It's super easy to program and I enjoy the delay brew feature every morning I have early classes. Waking up to the smell of coffee brewing helps get me out of bed. I know some reviewers don't like that you can't program it for more than 1 day in advance but I don't mind. You have to put the water and grounds in anyway so just hit the button when you do.
