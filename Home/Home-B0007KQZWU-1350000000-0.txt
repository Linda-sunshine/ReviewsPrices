review/summary: Very pleasedreview/text: Was a bit skeptical about the product due to the mixed reviews, but I couldn't be happier, all the lids are interchangeable, they clean up great with little effort, most I have had to use is a little baking soda to put the brand new shine on them. Any one who knows a little about cooking can use these without burning the pans. Similar sets run as high as $1200. I have been a serious foodie for over 17 years and I have no complaints with this set. Two thumbs up!
