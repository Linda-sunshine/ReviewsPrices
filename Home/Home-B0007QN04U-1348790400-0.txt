review/summary: Awkward & Noisyreview/text: Got a Professional 600 mixer as a gift replacing my 21 year old, tilt top KitchenAid model that was still working just fine. I wanted to give it a try so after making sure the bowl and mixing attachments were adjusted properly, I made my regular double batch of chocolate chip cookies. I always use the wire whip attachment for this recipe so I did the same with the new model. I spent a lot more time scraping the sides of the bowl. The whip is close to the bottom of the bowl but on the sides it is very far away and leaves a lot of batter that dosen't get incorporated and needs scraping. The scraping was awkward to do. I could scrape about 2/3's of the bowl and then had to move the whip to get the rest (Never a problem in the tilt top). It took me a lot longer to get the dough ready. Then, when it came time to take the bowl off, I had to mash the whip down into the batter to get the bowl off. This then required extra time to clean it off. I also found the mixer to be excessively noisy. I'm hoping it will quiet down with use but considered going to the garage to get hearing protection as the loud whine was very unpleasant (much louder than my tilt top model). Oh, and you can't wash the whip, paddle or dough hook in the dishwasher...Really?. In conclusion, I wish I still had my tilt top KitchenAid model.
