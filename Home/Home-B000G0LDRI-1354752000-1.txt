review/summary: Honeywell HCM-6009 QuietCare Humidifierreview/text: This thing really pumps humidity into the air! If I don't turn it way down it would send 10 gallons water into my house easily. My home is 2300 sq. ft. It will get a little noisy when it is just about empty due to vibration of the reservoirs being light. I throw a phone book on it after refilling and that does the trick. I am happy with my decision to purchase this item. It's compact, well made, nice looking and it WORKS! My only wish is that it held more water, but I'm lazy and it is easy to refill. I haven't had to clean (de-lime) it yet, but I figure it can be easily done in a bucket with vinegar or &#34;whatever&#34; solution.
