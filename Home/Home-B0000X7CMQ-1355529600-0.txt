review/summary: Buy a different coffee makerreview/text: This coffee maker was highly rated when I bought it. God knows why. I has a red ball that indicates the amount of water you have added. It is almost invisible because there is minimal contrast to the black background. The coffee basket isn't sized properly. I need to make several folds into a #4 coffee filter to get it to fit. The Mr. Coffee style filters don't fit either. The thermal carafe really doesn't keep the coffee warm for very long. The screw top on the carafe is very difficult to remove and gets stuck easily. There is always water or coffee on the stand underneath the carafe so when you set it down on any surface, be prepared to wipe up after you've set it down. I believe these are made and apparently designed in China. They don't know anything about coffee makers. I've heard that Cuisinart makes a good coffee maker. I'm going to buy one of those. I've owned a few Krups brand and they're very good, too.
