review/summary: Love this product!review/text: We use this in our motor home located on Mustang Island on the TX gulf coast just a few hundred yards from the ocean. Have one in the front and in the bedroom. Just amazed at how much moisture it retrieves from the air. Our computer printer paper used to be so soggy it wouldn't print---no more! Quiet and takes up such a small space. Would recommend for any one in any RV where there is a high humidity problem
