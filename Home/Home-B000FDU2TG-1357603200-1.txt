review/summary: work great - die in about a yearreview/text: just bought my third kitchen aid 5-speed blender. they work great for about a year then the bottom of the polycarbonate jar falls apart and everything you pour in the top pours out the bottom. both times this happened there was no warning - just one day it fell apart. hmmm. don't really like the plastic jar - glass cleans up better...
