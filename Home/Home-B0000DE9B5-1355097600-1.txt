review/summary: Great product, just what I was looking for.review/text: This is a great jug and just what I needed. It is nice and sturdy, if a little on the heavy side, but that's fine because I don't have to worry about it breaking easily (and I can set it out for lunch and it will stay pretty cold.) The lid was a weird hard to get used to at first, but the directions explain how it works. (Keep the directions handy for at least a few weeks, the first time I washed it after I used it I had to consult them to make sure I was putting all the pieces back in properly.) Once you get the hang of the lid though, it becomes intuitive and works great. No leaks and a nice steady stream when you pour. I think the handle is great, not too close at all. It doesn't fit on my fridge door, but my fridge is super-old and not a name brand, so it might fit in a more standard fridge. I have plenty of room anyway. The wide mouth makes it really easy to clean as well.I love it! No more worrying about weird chemicals leaching from plastic into my Crystal Light! (Plenty of chemicals in that stuff already!)
