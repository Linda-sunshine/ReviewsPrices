review/summary: SpecialKreview/text: This Coffee maker makes great coffee in about 5 minutes. It also keeps the coffee nice and hot. It makes a clean cup of coffee (no grounds in it) with or without a filter. It will also make great coffee even with the standard ground coffee purchased in a store if you run out of coffee ground for a percolator. When it starts making the coffee it can make a few noises but then the noise stops in a minute. The only thing I did not think about before purchasing the coffee maker is that it does not shut itself off so you have to remember turn it off when finished. Otherwise, it is a great coffee maker and extrememly easy to operate and clean.
