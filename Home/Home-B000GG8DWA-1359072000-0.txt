review/summary: Savings, Savings, Savingsreview/text: This thing has saved me a ton of money this winter. I got two of them at the beginning of the season because I couldn't face another $250 electricity bill (that was just for one month!) this winter. By using these instead of the baseboards my monthly bill was $95. I'm very impressed and grateful for the saving. These little heaters can put out some heat so it's not as if I'm saving money but suffering from the cold... I'm warm and toasty. Another good thing about this heater is the lack of a noisy fan which I specifically did not want. I'm definitely going to get another one.
