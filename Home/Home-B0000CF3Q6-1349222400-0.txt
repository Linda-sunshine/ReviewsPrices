review/summary: Excellent cup of coffeereview/text: It seems like I've come full circle with coffeemakers: first the stovetop percolator, then the Mr Coffee-type brewers, an espresso machine with steam milk attachment (I miss that), a K-cup brewer and now my little Bialetti stovetop espresso maker. I love this Bialetti. Yes, it's good enough for one cup (not very big cup) of coffee made Italian-style. I bought the Lavazzo coffee and it is excellent. When you place the maker on the burner, ensure that the handle is not over the element or flame. Ensure that you screw the top on securely, not overly tight; you don't want the product to squirt all over when it begins to brew (which happened to me). If this is your first time using one of these espresso makers, stay close while brewing so you don't over heat your maker. Once the coffee begins its ascent into the top it doesn't take but less than five minutes to fill the top. To clean, let it cool completely before you attempt to unscrew the top from the bottom. Coffee grounds can be used for your compost or garden. Rinse with warm water, let air dry. Don't assemble while still moist. Enjoy!
