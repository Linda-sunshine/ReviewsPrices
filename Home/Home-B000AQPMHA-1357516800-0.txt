review/summary: Keurig B40 Elite Brewing Systemreview/text: This was a gift for my aunt and uncle who are aged 80 plus. The instructions are clear and precise. They love it, in fact my aunt was speachliss to say the least. She had mentioned this in passing this past summer not expecting to receive this for Christmas and was floored. My uncle is known for his conservatism and has a time of trying anything new, this is his greatest toy. I strongly advise getting this item for loved ones. Its a great gift.
