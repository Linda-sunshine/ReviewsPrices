review/summary: Perfect!review/text: The outside of the pot stays cool and the water heats so quickly! I use it to heat water for oatmeal, pasta, etc because it heats so much faster than the stovetop. It also has a self storing cord although I use the kettle so often I rarely use that feature:) I highly recommend this kettle. I've given it as a gift and everyone gives rave reviews!
