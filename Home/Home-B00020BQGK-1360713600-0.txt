review/summary: Excellent Choice for our Needsreview/text: We needed a small, lightweight vacuum to clean the tile floors in between regular cleanings. This vacuum is lightweight, not excessively loud, and easy to manuever. It works so well that we use it for our regular cleanings as well. In addition, it does a pretty good job on carpet, so we use in for our carpeted stairs, although we do use a heavier machine for most of our (flat) carpeted cleaning.
