review/summary: Not worth itreview/text: Purchased this as a Christmas present for mom in 2010. She never used it, and I've only used it 4 times, and now it's dead. Did all the online troubleshooting. Called customer service, and they were willing to replace it for $77.95. Definitely not worth the replacement. Now I have boxes of k-cups I will never use.The coffee was tolerable, but not amazing. It lack the aroma of 'fresh' coffee.
