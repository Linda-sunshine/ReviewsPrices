review/summary: Inconsistentreview/text: Needing something to combat the dry heat of my apartment this winter, I ordered this humidifier. I was tired of waking up with red eyes and a desert-dry mouth. I set the unit up on a slightly elevated surface above my bedside and pointed its output towards me. Whether I fill the tank up entirely or not I still usually wake up feeling crappy and dried out despite having the damn penguin powered on full and pointed directly at me. It seems to do its job for the first few hours but then looses steam half way through the night. When I wake, its output seems weak and insufficient despite it still having water in its reservoir. I have no other experience with humidifiers so I do not know if it is standard for them to function crappily after a few hours of use, but I suspect it is not. Yes, it's aesthetically pleasing, but that factor may just be masking some of the deficits in its performance.
