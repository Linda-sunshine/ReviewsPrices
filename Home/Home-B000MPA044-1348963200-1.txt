review/summary: I love it!!!!review/text: I purchased this December 2010 as a housewarming gift for myself. I remember how for years my Mom whipped up meals in this monster of a Presto cooker. Since then this appliance has become the mainstay of the kitchen. I love it. I can take a piece of tough meat and using this pressure cooker can render it so tender that you can shred it with a fork. I so love it. Hearty soups are ready in 20 minutes. Soups with crusty bread and salads have become common meals in this house. I'm eating healthier and have started to convert other recipes to be used in the cooker. I absolutely love it.
