review/summary: Would like to give this a zero; last one I had was great.review/text: The digital readout is barely visible half of the time, and the other half, is not visible at all.It was like this the moment in came out of the package.I bought this identical item at my grocery store a few years ago, and it worked fine for severalyears until I dropped it head first into the sink .... more than once. This item is no longercarried by my grocery store, so I looked on Amazon and bought the identical item since the lastonce worked great.I don't have time to be running to the post office to return this, but I would like the companyto know of my experience. Maybe my grocery store stopped carrying this because of customercomplaints?
