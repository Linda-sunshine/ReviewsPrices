review/summary: Don't buy this machinereview/text: This machine doesn't work as described in the directions which means my particular unit is defective or the product is badly designed. The size/darkness buttons don't function in any order after using menu, or select buttons. The inability to reset the machine without unplugging it for a long time is also a big problem, and would have been easy to add to the controls. Compared to my Regal bread machine from the mid 90s this machine is extremely buggy and hard to use. Don't purchase this unless you like to be annoyed.
