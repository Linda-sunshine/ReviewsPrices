review/summary: QUICK AND EASYreview/text: THIS ITEM DOES WHAT I NEED FOR IT TO AND THAT IS SHARPEN MY KNIVES.I AM LEGALLY BLIND AND HAVE ARTHRITIS IN MY HANDS SOWITH THAT DUO I NEED TO KEEP MY KNIEVES SHARP FOR LESS CHANCE OF IT SLEPPING BECAUE IT IS DULL AND CUT ME , AND EASY TO USE IN CASE MY HANDS HAVE TROUBLE GRIPPING THE SHARPNER.JUST RUN THE BLADE OF THE KNIFE IN THE AREA PROVIDED AND IT IS DONE AND DOES NOT TAKE A LONG TIME AND I AM READY TO USE THEM AGAIN. SO NOW IF I CUT MYSELF IT IS PURE CARELESSNESS AND NOT FROM A DULL KNIFE..
