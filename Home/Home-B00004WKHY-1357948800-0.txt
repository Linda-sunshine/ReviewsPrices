review/summary: Mom of 3review/text: It's performance is everything we could dream of and more. The only drawback is that we wish we would have purchased the white color. The stainless steel looks more like a plastic version of chrome. Only time will tell if it holds up. It isn't messy to use, so I am hopeful that it will do just fine.
