review/summary: Worked Fine, Then Stopped Workingreview/text: Pros: It does what it's supposed to - keeps drinks warm.Cons: The warming surface is a little small, doesn't fit wider mugs. Mine stopped working after a month, and I'm not sure why. It may not be spill proof, because I got some coffee on top... perhaps it shorted somehow?Bottom line: OK, but might be a better one out there...
