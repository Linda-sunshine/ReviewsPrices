review/summary: Awesome little heaterreview/text: We use this little heater, together with a forced-air heater, to heat a 'shelter' that we made for 2 outside kitties. The heat is steady, and we have used it continuously for one winter so far. We have an identical heater in storage as back-up, should we need it. It's very light-weight, and I was concerned it might fall-over easily, but it stands well on its feet. Great little heater!
