review/summary: small but powerful enoughreview/text: This is my second one. I had the first one for about 3 years and wore it out - actually, I broke the power nozzle off. This is not a replacement for a large full feature vacume if you have a real house. You end up needing something for your car, furnature, something with a hose and wand. I use it to do quick and easy clean up. It is very easy, light and will get under most furnature, does a fairly good job on stairs. If you try to do a large job it will heat up and stop. Let it cool off and your fine for the next job. I use an old tooth brush to clean out the reusable dirt repository.
