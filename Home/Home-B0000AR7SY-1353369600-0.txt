review/summary: Nice, cheap, but some staticreview/text: I really like this grinder. I had been using a blade grinder, but it would powder half the coffee. This grinder leaves no powder and each particle is close to evenly sized. There was a notable increase in coffee quality when switching to the burr grinder, taking out much of the bitterness caused by those ultrafine particles. This was the cheapest burr grinder I found with a set of good reviews and it lived up to them. The only drawback is some static in the bin. It isn't noticeable with oily or very fresh coffee, but throws some grounds around with dry and older coffees when opening the bin.
