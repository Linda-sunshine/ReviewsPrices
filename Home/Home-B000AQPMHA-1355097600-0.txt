review/summary: Good coffee, bad everything else.review/text: It makes a good cup of coffee, which should be the bottom line, but everything else about it sucks! It is extremely overpriced, at half the price. It is huge and takes up an enormous amount of counter space (to make a single cup of coffee?). It is also incredibly noisy - it bangs and pops unbelievably as it heats the water. If you want a good cup of coffee, get a small french press and be done with.
