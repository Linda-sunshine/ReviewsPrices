review/summary: Painful. Buy a different pillow. This one is a mistake!review/text: This is not even worthy of being called a pillow. If you want to know what sleeping on this is like go outside to your garden and get some bricks to lay your head on. This product is SO awful I am returning it. I have never returned anything to amazon before but these are SO SO awful they have to go back. These pillows are PAINFUL to lay on....pick a different pillow.
