review/summary: What am I doing wrong?review/text: On paper, it's the perfect inexpensive coffeemaker for someone who doesn't drink coffee like an addict. But there's something not right about this unit so far, in practice. I put the coffee in a paper filter in the drip basket, position the drip basket so that it sits as low as possible in the well, close the door -- and the basket's bottom door/spring mechanism doesn't touch the top of the carafe's lid, which means all the brewed coffee stays in the drip basket, sometimes coming close to overflowing it.I've tried to poisition the drip cup several ways so that it is forced to sit lower in the well, but nothing seems to work. The only way to get the coffee in the pot is if I stand there and lift the pot up against the underside of the dripper, forcing the spout of the drip basket open.Beside this issue (which I'm hoping can be solved by helpful comments, since the manual is no help), I'd like to know who at Mr. Coffee decidees what constitutes a "cup." I have to brew 2.5 cups just to fill one small coffee mug. This is coffee, not espresso.
