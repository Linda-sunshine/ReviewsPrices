review/summary: Great for lots of thingsreview/text: I love this pan!!!I use this for broiling & roasting food in the oven, for roasting seeds and flour on the stove, and for normal stove top uses. I love the size! I can fit so much in it and keep things from getting crowded. It is HEAVY, but I just keep it in the bottom drawer of my oven.SEASONING AND CLEANING:Before using it the first time I did a quick 'seasoning' technique I learned from my wok: take green onion ends, chopped up and saute them rubbing them around the pan 'till they're burned.For cleaning, I just use hot water and a scrub brush... NO soap!, NO soaking, quick dry.
