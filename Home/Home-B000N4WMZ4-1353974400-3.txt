review/summary: 3 quart Dutch ovenreview/text: Just the right size for making soup, chili, or stew. I have used it on the cooktop and in the oven. It cleans up easily and is ready for that all day Beef roast with onions, carrots, celery and assorted peppers. yummm.I would recommend it of the single person that cooks for a maximum of 4 people.
