review/summary: Requires a FS model V3440 at a minimum ($129) to use!review/text: Great product, but it does NOT work as a stand alone jar sealer.This wide mouth jar sealer, and the regular jar sealer, requires at least...--- the Food Saver model V3440 to use it.It does work also with the low priced model V3431 Starter Kit at $129...--- and with the more expensive series 3000 models (retractable hose although not described)$179 - $259.They will not work with models V2244 or V2450 to my knowledge.In plain English, any Food Saver appliance that does not come with an accessory hose for jars and marinating will not work...--- with the jar sealers!Therefore, these jar sealers do NOT function with any of Food Savers hand held units...period.--- these handheld units work only with plastic bags, and they require recharging to work effectively.
