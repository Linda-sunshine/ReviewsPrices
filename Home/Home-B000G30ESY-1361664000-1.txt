review/summary: I love my Zoreview/text: This rice cooker is the best small appliance I have ever bought. That seriously means allot because I have ALLOT!. All you do is rinse the rice , measure accurate and the results is amazing , Delicious rice. I think I'm on about my 30-35 batch in 2 1/2 months and all have been almost perfect. A little more water ,than asked for, is improving certain grains. I am thinking of buying a second for the work place. But for that i am going to go to the larger size so my co-workers can enjoy as well. The 3 cup is perfect for just myself.
