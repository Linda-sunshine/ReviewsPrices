review/summary: Best vacuum everreview/text: We bought this vacuum last year when we moved into our new apartment that had brand new carpeted floors. I have major dust allergies so a powerful vacuum is a must. It picks up dog hair, dust, and a whole bunch of stuff that lives rent-free in your carpet. We vacuum weekly, sometimes more, and the amount of stuff that it sucks up is amazing! Keep in mind that this is BRAND NEW carpet - we are the first to walk/live on it and sometimes we have to empty the container to continue with the rest of the house. It's gross and awesome at the same time. Highly recommend. Don't let its compact size fool you. It's a beast.
