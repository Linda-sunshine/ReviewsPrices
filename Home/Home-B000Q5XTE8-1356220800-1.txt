review/summary: No, it's not a Miller Aeron . . .review/text: But it's probably the next best thing, for the price or otherwise. It's now about 6 months in, and - Hey, it's a chair - it's not running a major multi-national corporation, or the air-traffic over the NY/NJ metropolitan airspace. As a chair, it works great - it's comfortable, for sitting at length working in front of the computer, or for shorter periods, too. It maneuvers across hardwood flooring easily, the adjustments work as expected, and the armrests have not needed adjustments, but I like that I can remove them should the need arise. What else should I be asking of this chair? Would I replace it with an Aeron, if it needed replacing and I was more flush? Nah, probably not.
