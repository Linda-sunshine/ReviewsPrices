review/summary: Delicious!review/text: I've never owned an iron skillet before. I love this thing. We cook chicken breasts and steaks in it once or twice a week. A few tips. Never use soap to wash it. I use Alton Brown's salt cleaning method (just google it, there's a video where he explains it).To cook steak, I use the 3/3/3 method. Season the steak with some salt and pepper or a rub. Let it sit for 10-20 minutes. Put a couple of drops of oil in the skillet. Preheat the skillet in the oven (450-500 degrees). Take the skillet out, and put it on the stovetop on high heat. Put the steak in there for 3 minutes, then flip. Wait another 3 minutes, then put the iron skillet in the oven for an additional 2-3 minutes.Chicken breasts are done the same way, except they'll take about 10 minutes in the oven. Use an oven thermometer to monitor the temperature of the chicken breasts. It should get to 160-165 degrees in the thickest portion of the chicken breast. I usually season the chicken with a rub.
