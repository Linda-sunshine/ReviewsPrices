review/summary: OK but poor quality and died soonreview/text: I purchased two of these, one for me and the other as a gift. The gift one died in about 2 months with light use, just stopped working. The place where I purchased it said that I would need to ship it back to Cuisinart, not worth the shipping cost. Mine worked fine for about 18 months and died as well. I took it apart to see if I could repair it and discovered that the circuit board had failed which was not available for purchase so mine is also trash.During operation one thing I did not like was the static in the grounds hopper, the grounds would fly everywhere when poured, wish they would have used static free plastic.I purchased Cuisinart because I have used their appliances for years with good results and they were dependable, not true about this grinder.
