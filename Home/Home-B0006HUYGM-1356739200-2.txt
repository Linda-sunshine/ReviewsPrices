review/summary: handy vacreview/text: i opted for corded for the strength, which its pretty good, although on carpet, it might need a couple passes to get it all. and beware of the fan in the back, if you go past a pile of dirt, it will effectively blow it in your face. So a little learning curve for people like me, but overall a handy little vac. A little noisy but no more than i would expect these things to be.
