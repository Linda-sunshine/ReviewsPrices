review/summary: my first espresso machinereview/text: Can't tell you if it is better than another machine or not. I can tell you it makes a nicer cup of coffee than a typical brewer. It does take a few moments of time to prepare a cup but I think it is worth it.That said, I am looking forward to it breaking in the future. I have quirks with it that I would like to not have when making coffee. Mostly that my favorite mug does not fit under it. In fact it misses only my a few millimeters. Oh well. I also think the steamer is a bit weak. Though I have not had much experience steaming milk prior I think this one is probably not as good as others.This machine was a great intro into making espresso. I am glad I bought it and I do use it everyday. I will be able to buy my next machine with better knowledge of what I am looking for. I suggest this as a good first machine. It will teach you what you need to know and it will prepare you to know what you need in a future machine. This is an excellent starter system and the coffee is REALLY good.
