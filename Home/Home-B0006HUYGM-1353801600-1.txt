review/summary: Bought this 6 months ago - It continues to be amazing!!!review/text: I can't believe how fantastic this small vacuum is, especially considering the price. I have a beautiful, albeit crazy, cat who sheds at amazing rates. I can't believe she has such a glorious thick coat considering that she seems to shed 1 full cat each day. This vacuum is my salvation. I use it on the rugs, furniture, and even my comforter - and it works! I have to admit that I use this little guy as my regular vacuum, instead of my $500 large vacuum, because it simply works better. I swear I don't work for Eureka - but I just can't recommend this hand-held vacuum enough.
