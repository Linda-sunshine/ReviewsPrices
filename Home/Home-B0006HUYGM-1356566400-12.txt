review/summary: Great vacuum!review/text: I use this vacuum mainly to clean my chinchilla's cage. I have iRobot roombas for the floors, but this is what I use for his cage. It works really well! I wish the hose was a teenie bit longer. Even with the extension, I wish it just a little bit longer. Everything else is perfect though. It's bagless, which is great. I can just open the bin and tap it into the garbage. The filer also works well, almost a little too well, as sometimes I have to take out the fur myself instead of just letting it dump into the garbage bin.Love it, it works very well and I've no issues with it losing its suction at all. When using the hose, it can pick up particles from further away than expected. The suction is pretty strong! I am a big fan and love the product!
