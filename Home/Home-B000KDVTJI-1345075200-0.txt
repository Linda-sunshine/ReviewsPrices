review/summary: leaks at handlereview/text: I bought this to replace the same water kettle that I had before and liked. However, this one appears to be slowly leaking from the bottom of the handle. It's only a small leak and appears to happen after the water has heated. It is too late to return for a full refund, and it's not worth it to return for partial refund. If you buy this, pay attention to possible leaks and return immediately. Wish I had!
