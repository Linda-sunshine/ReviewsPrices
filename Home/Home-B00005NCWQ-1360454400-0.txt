review/summary: Possibly the best coffee I've ever had.review/text: I've used drip coffee makers and electric percolators before, and this stove top percolator is definately the best. Here are my reasons why:1. Not only is the taste better, but the aroma filling the kitchen is better.2. My electric percolator cuts off after only 2 or 3 minutes once it starts percolating fast. The stove top you can leave on longer - 5 to 7 minutes is recommended in the instructions.3. I almost gave up on percolators ten years ago. I tried two electric percolators and they didn't last very long. I recently bought another electric one. The electric ones have a heating well which is not stainless steal, and it corrodes or something builds up in the well, which eventually will make the pump stop working, and I've tried cleaning them but the well won't come clean. The stove top is all stainless steel on the inside - there is no heating well. And the pump is completely different - there is no washer and it looks like it will never stop working. This percolator will probably last forever. The plastic knob and handle are replaceable if those break. This percolator has a lifetime warranty, but my electric one has only a three year warranty.4. You can't beat the $20 price versus $50-60 for an electric one.This is an example of how old fashioned products can be better than modern ones which are probably made with built-in obsolescence so you keep buying them over and over. Why haven't I ever seen a stove-top percolator in a local store?
