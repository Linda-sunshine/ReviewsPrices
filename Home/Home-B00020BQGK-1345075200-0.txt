review/summary: Have had 2 and will not buy a thirdreview/text: Just want to warn everyone. I love this vacuum, but it burns up after about 3-5 months of use. The first one I bought I thought I had just gotten a lemon. I contacted Hoover and they were no help at all, even though it was under warranty. They basically told me to take to a repair shop and the closest one was 90 miles away. I then ordered another one and it lasted 3 months before over heating and turning off. I only have hard floors and throw rugs in my house. These two vacuums were never used on carpets. I expected a lot more from hoover. Love the design and features of the vacuum, but it does not last.
