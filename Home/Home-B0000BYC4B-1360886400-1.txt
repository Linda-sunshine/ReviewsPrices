review/summary: Very nice capsreview/text: It might sound silly to be impressed by the quality of a jar-cap, but I was impressed. These caps are much stronger and, well, just &#34;more&#34; than I had been expecting. I've had lots of experience over the years with cheap, flimsy jar-caps, and NO experience - until I got these - with high quality caps. I'm REALLY glad I got them!
