review/summary: Works fine for small areasreview/text: This is a much better shampooer than the last one I had, different brand all together. Works well in small spaces, or small areas of carpeting. Once I figured out how to change the settings it worked even better!!! I would recommend this to someone that may from time to time need to clean the carpets in a small room.
