review/summary: Easy Breezyreview/text: Just fill up the Steamer with water, plug in, wait a minute or so and you are ready to remove wrinkles from delicate fabrics. Perfect for blouses and skirts that tend to wrinkle up. Also works well on dance costumes and accessories such as veils and other delicate items. Easy to use device and small enough to store away.
