review/summary: Sheets are softer after treatingreview/text: After buying these sheets, I had to treat it with soaking in fabric softener and then washing a few times to get it to become soft. It's still a little bit rough in the beginning, but after use, it gets better. The sheets are quite sturdy and I have not seen any pilling or other defects after many months of use.The fitted sheet also goes very deep, so there are no problems covering a really thick mattress, such as my double-sided pillow top mattress.The only downside is the sheets are quite rough to begin with, and it is quite a hassle to make them softer.
