review/summary: Extremely Happyreview/text: I've wanted this red mixer for many, many years. I didn't figure I'd get a ton of use of out it, but I was wrong! I use it a lot more often than I ever imagined. Cookies, cakes, shredding chicken (put chicken in while still very hot, and turn on...instantly shredded!) mixing doughs, icings, and so much more! I'm very pleased with the quality. I've had it for about a year, and no problems at all. The only thing I would change about it is I'd like to upgrade to the glass bowl, and also purchase a scraper paddle. I highly recommend this mixer!
