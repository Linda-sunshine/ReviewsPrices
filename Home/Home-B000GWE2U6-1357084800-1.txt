review/summary: Love this little guy!review/text: This has been perfect for my bedroom. Not leaving water anywhere, no white dust yet. Cleaning doesn't seem to be a problem, as long as you do it weekly as suggested. So glad I decided to take a chance. I do leave it at about half power - that sends out a strong enough amount of vapor without condensing on the floor.
