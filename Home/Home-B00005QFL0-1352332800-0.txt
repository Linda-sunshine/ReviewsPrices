review/summary: Don't buy this model!review/text: We make bread several times a week, and when our Breadman Pro finally died, we decided to upgrade to a more expensive bread machine. Picking this one was a BIG MISTAKE!!!!! It worked once, and has never worked again. The one time it did work, it took FOREVER! We just use a bread machine to make dough, which took about 1 hr 20 min in our Breadman. It seriously took about 3 hours in the Panasonic. Way too long. Foolishly, before buying the Panasonic, we'd ignored all the reviews stating how difficult the service department is to deal with. We figured, buying such a pricey model, surely it would work well. Wrong. We sent numerous emails to the service department - absolutely no response. We called the service department - were on hold for over 40 minutes, then disconnected. Called again. Same thing. Called the next day. Were told we'd obviously broken it in some way. It is now sitting in our storeroom, having made one loaf of bread. A heck of an expensive loaf! BEWARE!!!! We will never buy another Panasonic product!
