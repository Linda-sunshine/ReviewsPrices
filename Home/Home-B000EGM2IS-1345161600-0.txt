review/summary: All Goodreview/text: This is my 2nd hot shot in about 8 years (not bad huh?). the 1st one still works but it's a little loud these days and it of course is a little kitchen stained so I figured probably time to get a new one. the quality of my new black one is not quit as good as the 1st in that it's a little more flimsy but, it works! I have no problems and if by chance something unexpected would happen to it I would buy another.
