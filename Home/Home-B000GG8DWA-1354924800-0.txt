review/summary: Great little heaterreview/text: I bought this little heater so I could turn my thermostat down and keep the area I was sitting warmer. It works great for that purpose. I like the two settings -- and it keeps me toasty-warm in the general area I'm sitting. I would not recommend it for long-term heating of a larger area -- but for my purposes -- works great!
