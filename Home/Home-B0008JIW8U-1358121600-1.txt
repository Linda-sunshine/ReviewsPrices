review/summary: Works great and perfect size for one personreview/text: I love coming into the kitchen in the morning and finding a fresh and hot pot of coffee waiting for me. Works great, easy to use and clean, doesn't take too much counter space, and a perfect size for one person. If you are making coffee for 2+ people, I'd recommend a larger size coffee maker.
