review/summary: good set of steel pansreview/text: I've got a lovely set of All-Clad that I've collected over the years, but it eventually dawned on me that my mom had been using the same flimsy pots for 30 years, and frankly, it was time for the pots to move on. Friends of mine raved about this Cuisinart set, and it was a very reasonable price, so I sprung for it last year.My mom has been using them for a year now, and loves them. The rolled lip is actually a huge advantage over the All-Clad; I am able to pour out of the sauce pans without any of the splattering or dripping that I get from my own pans.These have nice heavy bottoms, and distribute heat evenly. If you've never cooked on a steel set before, you'll probably find you need to turn the heat down; once these get warmed up the thermal mass does a lot of the hard work for you. If you do happen to burn something on, a soak and rub with Bar Keepers Friend will make these as shiny as new. There is a lot of value for the money if you can get this set for less than 250 like I did; highly recommended.
