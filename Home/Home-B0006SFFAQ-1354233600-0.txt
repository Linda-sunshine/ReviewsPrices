review/summary: Bought as a gift and works perfectlyreview/text: My parents have this exact model and my sister loved it, so I decided to buy it for her birthday about a year ago. After one year of daily use (one-two half pots brewed per day) the grinder still grinds beans well and the coffee tastes great. I know that my sister does clean it regularly, so I would suggest that to anyone buying a coffee machine. I like the glass pot, but I do know that my parents' unit was fairly easily cracked when it accidentally banged against the counter top, but that was obviously their fault and not the manufacturers. However, they easily found a replacement that was cheap (not sure if it was through Amazon or not). I would suggest this coffee maker to anyone who is looking for ease-of-use and a decent grinder/maker combo.
