review/summary: ONLY ONE IN THREE PERFORMED PROPERLYreview/text: &#34;Wow! What a great product to organize my 40+ neckties,&#34; I thought as I placed my order for two of them. They were sent flat in two pieces per unit (hanging hook & rotating spindle) and the first one snapped together in a flash. When I tried assembling the second one the hook broke as I tried to duplicate my first success.&#34;Oh Well,&#34; I opined. The cost was cheap enough and I could always just buy a replacement, which I did. When it arrived I carefully snapped the two pieces together and breathed a sigh of relief at my success. I rushed to gather up my remaining ties and when I returned the Tie Rack Organizer had fallen off the arm of my couch onto the carpeted floor where it laid broken into two pieces, utterly useless!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!
