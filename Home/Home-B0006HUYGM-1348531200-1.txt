review/summary: Eureka Hand Held Vacreview/text: ~ I just received the Eureka Hand Held lighweight vac from Amazon. Wow!! This vac has so much power and suction that amazed me! I love using it for my carpeted stairs whereas I don't have to carry around my upright vacuum with all the tools for a small job like this. Also I have used it in my vehicle plus the crevice tool which does an awesome job! I would highly recommend this vac for anyone who is looking for something small and not heavy and bulky!!
