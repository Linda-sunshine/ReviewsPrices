review/summary: very handy and just throw it in the dishwasherreview/text: This is a good tool for blending stuff quickly, and it works fine with liquids up to batter thickness. I've found it works fastest if I have it tilted just slightly (thin liquids will quickly start splashing if you tilt too much). It's fairly easy to scrape stuff off and the stainless steel (I think it's stainless) has a good polish so it sheds liquids easily and cleans easily. I have no complaints whatsoever, which is pretty rare for an appliance.
