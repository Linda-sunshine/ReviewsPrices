review/summary: yupreview/text: It seals wide mouth jars. The only thing that messed me up is it doesn't come with the required hose. So once I got this lid, I then found out that I had to order the hose. I think one of the pictures on Amazon shows the hose, so I just assumed it came with it... But no... Make sure you order the hose if you don't already have one.I use the heck out of it. I like to buy Beans, Rice, Potato flakes, Bisquick, sugar and other stuff in bulk when its cheap. I then just vacuum seal the goods into quart size jars and pack them away. Not only do I buy this stuff at the least expensive price but I also have a comforting back log of food in storage &#34;just in case&#34;. I live in an active earthquake zone and I feel good knowing that I have enough food to last me and my family 6 months or so. I also have a pressure cooker and am able to use the jars for that.Works well. Thumbs up.
