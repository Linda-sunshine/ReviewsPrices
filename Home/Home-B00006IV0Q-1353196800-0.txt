review/summary: beats Farberware and Cuisinart hands down!review/text: after trying Farberware and Cuisinart perk pots (both of which I used and returned and which I do not recommend!), this one seems to be a superior pot... it makes a strong, hot cup of coffee, and has a heavier base (maybe a more rugged heating element?).. it is made in China like all the other pots I've looked at and tried and the overall quality is not at the level of the price, but it works well and hopefully it will last a couple of years... CONS: the cord is short and is made with a two prong plug.. the wire gauge is smaller than other pots... the spout is sharp and it is possible to cut your finger if you run your finger around the opening.....
