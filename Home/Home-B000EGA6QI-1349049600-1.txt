review/summary: great for the pricereview/text: I don't have the need to use this product regularly. I use it mainly for soups and sauces...probably 1 or 2 times a month...but when I need it, it's a lifesaver. No more trying to dump hot soup in the blender to get it smooth. Cleaning it is a breeze; the bottom comes off and I throw it in the dishwasher.
