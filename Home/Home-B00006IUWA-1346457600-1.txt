review/summary: BURNS YOUR FINGERS!!!!review/text: This popper pops corn just as well as any other hot air popper, BUT the plastic lid gets as hot as a cast iron skillet. DO NOT attempt to remove the lid until it has cooled for at least 10 minutes, and do not let children make popcorn with this appliance. I used it once and blistered my fingertips.
