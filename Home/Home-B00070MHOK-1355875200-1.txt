review/summary: Love love lovereview/text: This steamer is small, but it packs quite a punch. Be sure not to overfill or it spits hot water. I can steam a lot of my clothes in one go and it's saved me soooo much time ironing. Of course, nothing beats a real iron for crisp shirts, but this is more than enough to release the wrinkles from my t-shirts and dresses. It's a good size for travel and I use it so much more than my iron.
