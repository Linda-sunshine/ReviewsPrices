review/summary: Leave my kitchen super tidy!review/text: Why I bought: 1. I've heard many people recommend it (mostly online). 2. I just moved to a nice house and want to get rid of my &#62;8 years old rice cooker. 3. I need a rice cooker with timer so that I can wake up and eat nice porridge.Advantages:1. It may cook very small portion for one person. We are a family of 2 and this is absolutely big enough for making rice and porridge. No leftover rice in the fridge! 2. No spill at all! Keep your kitchen tidy!! 3. delicious rice! I haven't got a chance to test with brown rice but I believe it will be good. 4. Make my kitchen look upgraded ;p.Disadvantages (tiny things): 1.Price. the price is even higher than other brands which can add pressure, making soup, bread, stew etc. 2. It can only make rice and porridge (please let me know if you have other recipes). 3. With the timer, you can precisely set when you want the cooking is done. However, if you don't the timer, you have to refer to the manual to tell how many minutes are left.Generally, I recommend to people who like a tidy kitchen, delicious rice and don't mind spending a little bit more.
