review/summary: Great for the price.review/text: This is a no frills vac with a HEPA filter and bag less. it really just comes with one 'on board tools' but for what we use it for (college house with lots of people coming through) it works great. It sucks up everything I've asked it to with easy and doesn't spit anything back out the vent, like some vacs that I've borrowed.
