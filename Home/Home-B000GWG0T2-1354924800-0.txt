review/summary: GREAT NONSTICK FRYING PANreview/text: In my opinion, T-Fal makes excellent products for the kitchen. In each product line there are different grades. In this line, the professional series is the best. This 10 inch pan is a great everyday Pan. Of course it is nonstick and I think T-Fal does nonstick better than most companies.What sets this particular pan apart from other T-Fal pans is the steel disk on the bottom of the pan. It keeps the bottom of the pan flat against the stove. I have a ceramic cooktop on my stove and some pans I had in the past would would buckle in the middle and would not lay flat on the stove once it got warm.This 10 inch T-Fal pan is a great all-around size for every day use. The sides of the pan on not too high making it easy to use a spatula to turn the food. The handle is rock solid and it is riveted onto the pan so it will never come loose.This T-Fal pan is more expensive than some of the cheapo pans but worth the money.
