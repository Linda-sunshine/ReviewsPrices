review/summary: Lindareview/text: This is a superb quality digital steam iron at a great price. It does a great job on both heavy and light fabrics. The digital display is easy to use for the type of material you are ironing. If you make a mistake, the steam feature is great for correcting. I felt that I didn't have to work as hard in getting the job done. I had it a couple months before use and wish I would have opened it sooner. Thanks for a great product.
