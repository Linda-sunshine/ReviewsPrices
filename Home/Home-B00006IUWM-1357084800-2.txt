review/summary: Better than expectedreview/text: After reading the reviews I was finding it hard to believe that a $25.00 sharpener could do the trick to restore my dullkitchen knives. When I received the sharpener, I immediately sharpened about 6 knives and was really quite surprised at howsharp it got them. The edge seemed a little choppy at times when finished but they were sharper than they had been in a loooong time. I think some of the "choppiness" was because you need to have the knife at just the right pressure and angle to keep themfrom jumping a bit. I found if you hold the knife all the way to either the right or left edge of the slot (depending on which slot you are in at the time) they seem to go thru smoother.Overall, for an inexpensive sharpener, so far it seems to be doing a nice job. No complaints for the amount of money spent.
