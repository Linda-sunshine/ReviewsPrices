review/summary: FINALLY a grill to suit my big family!review/text: Very versatile grill. Easily converts from a flat top to slant for excellent draining. The only bad thing I could say about it is that the row where it plugs in to the griddle tends to get a little hotter that the rest of the surface. Its just something I'm getting used to.
