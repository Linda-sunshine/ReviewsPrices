review/summary: Not Worth the moneyreview/text: I used to love my Kitchenaid. My Mom never owned one, so when my husband surprised me and bought me mine, I was thrilled. I have owned it less then five years and it's already giving out. Since day one it has been so loud that you have to yell to have a conversion. It now turns off when I am trying to make a simple loaf of bread (it never used to turn off) and if you make bread you know it's a pain to have to wait for it to cool back down before you can continue. I know its' supposed to turn off when it overheats, but kneading white bread for 6 minutes doesn't sound like it should overheat to me.Also, there is only a one year warranty on the appliance. In my opinion, that's not very long to test drive a 500.00 mixer. My first car didn't cost a whole lot more than that and I drove it for ten and sold it when it was 18 years old. I wish I had know the insane loudness was not normal, but I didn't till about year three. Also, I would've been happy if the customer service had cared a little, they didn't. They understood my circumstance 'must be frustrating' but they didn't care enough to even give me a little bit of credit towards a new one. My Mother-in-law has owned hers for over thirty years and has never had a problem; guess we can conclude that things are not made like they used to be. Kitchenaid makes their mixers at a lower grade quality so we all have to buy new ones after a few years.If I could go back, I would've bought a cheaper brand, which probably would've lasted five years too. Then, when I had to replace it I wouldn't have felt so bad. After all, 100.00 each year on a mixer sounds like a lot to me.
