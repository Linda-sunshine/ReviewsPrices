review/summary: Like itreview/text: Bought this steamer on sale after a friend recommended steamers instead of ironing. I have always ironed and really don't mind doing it. I often need to as I wear dress shirts everyday for work, but was looking for a new way to do it. This steamer is nice and does a solid job for most of my shirts. There are a few shirts I own which get crinkly in the button area and this is really the only time the steamer doesn't do as good of a job as ironing. For those without room for an iron/board I would recommend this steamer. I also like to use it on pants and my suits, areas where I would be a bit worried using an iron. Overall it's something that's worth trying at this price.
