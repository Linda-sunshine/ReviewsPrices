review/summary: Best thing in the kitchenreview/text: I don't understand how anyone could rate this product lower than 5 stars? I use this for french fries (frozen or reheat), hashbrowns, cookies, chicken patties/nuggets, fish, french toast and of course pizza. If you can put it in the oven on a cookie sheet this product will cook it and I've always been more than satisfied with the results. Don't know about everyone else but my oven takes 15 minutes to pre-heat. I can turn on the pizza pizzazz and before the oven is ready the pizza/anything is done. You know it costs a fortune to heat an oven box and it's empty while it pre-heats then you have to cook the pizza. Last time I looked my oven ran on 220 not 110. This product has to pay for itself in a dozen uses just by the electricity it save (unless you have gas, right?). I purchased one extra after I had such great succcess with the first one and it sits in my basement just waiting for the old one to die (didn't want to take the chance they discontinued it). I've had it for 3 years and have cooked 100's of pizzas and everything you can think of. I use it 4-5 times a week and it's great to re-heat left-overs. Best thing in my kitchen!! I wouldn't pass it up on a few reviewers that sound like they couldn't operate their microwave. It cooks the center of the pizza - be creative - if the pizza is thick use the bottom coil for a little extra time. It's a common sense product - rotate food like chicken nuggets just like you would in the stove. Easy clean-up. I have nothing negitive to say other that you have to unplug it for the table to stop rotating - but on the other hand it helps cool it for quick storage. I hope you enjoy yours as much as I do mine....
