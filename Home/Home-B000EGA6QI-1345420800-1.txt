review/summary: Works well until it doesn'treview/text: We've gone through two of these and have now learned our lesson. It was fantastic at first but over time, the shaft started getting loose in the housing and the blade assembly began moving up and down. I think this has to do with using it on crushed ice. Unfortunately, that's the bulk of what it is used for; smoothies/protein shakes. What ends up happening is that drinks become REALLY frothy to the point that I had to use larger and larger containers to mix things in as the volume of liquid kept increasing in a crazy manner. Even doing that, after a while it started throwing stuff all over the kitchen. There was a review of another mixer that had an all-metal shaft unit so I'm off to track that down.
