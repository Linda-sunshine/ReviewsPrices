review/summary: Don't let the price fool you!review/text: Don't let the price fool you. Lodge makes extremely high quality cookware. I own this along with one of their grill pans and one of their griddles. I was lusting after Le Creuset skillets and someone at the local kitchen supply chain recommended Lodge instead. I can have great quality cast iron cookware without spending hundreds of dollars. AND they're made in the US. I will have these pans for years to come.
