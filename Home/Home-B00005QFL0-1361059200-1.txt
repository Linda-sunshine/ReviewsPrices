review/summary: use this guy at least once a week.review/text: Bottom line when making bread, it is a trial and error experience but we are eating some awesome breads these days. Just keep trying for good recipes, don't bother with the dried milk that's in all the recipes that come with the machine. We made pizza dough for Valentines and heart shaped pizzas were fun for the kids to make and super yummy! And only 5 ingredients. So easy!!!
