review/summary: DO NOT BUY CUISINART!!!!!!review/text: This is the first review I have ever written on Amazon and I have purchased many, many things. I bought this to replace my old pressure cooker which finally bit the dust after quite a few years. The first time I used it after having it about 18 days the unit locked up and the lid would not open. Pressure was released, but no way, no how was that lid coming off. Called Cuisinart and their customer service is disgraceful. They told me they would send me a new lid. If I have a unit with a lid stuck on it and food inside, what in the devil am I gong to do with another lid. Supervisor was worthless after I finally got to talk to one. He told me he couldn't replace it even tho there was a warranty because there was food in it and I couldn't ship it back with food inside. Seriously!! This was my 3rd call to them!!! The customer service rep I had talked to on the second call called me back 3 times that night and called me a Bitch. If I read this, I wouldn't believe it, but it is absolutely true!! So, I tried Amazon. First, the customer service rep told me the same thing, but after a very lengthy explanation of the events and of my complete disgust with the customer service at Cuisinart, she offered to replace the item or give me a refund. Of course, I took the refund. I will never, ever even look at another Cuisinart product. Yay to Amazon service for going above and beyond!!
