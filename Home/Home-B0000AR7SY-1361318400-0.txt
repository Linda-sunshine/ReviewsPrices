review/summary: Great Grindreview/text: This grinder does a great job grinding coffee. It's consistent, flexible, and not too loud. Having the stainless steel body is definitely worth the extra money.BUT, the grinder timer mechanism is a bit cheap. It's just a basic mechanical timer. Other grinder I've owned in the past have had a start/stop button with maybe some sort of knob to control their auto run time.Overall, the solid grinding job overshadows the timer flaw, but I've owned nicer grinders at this price point.
