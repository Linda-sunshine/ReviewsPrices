review/summary: This really sucksreview/text: I bought this vacuum cleaner solely based on others' reviews, and I am glad I did. It is small, but surprisingly powerful. Half of our house is hardwood and the other half is carpet, so we needed something that works well on both areas. The hose feature is especially important to me because we have a lot of nooks and crannies that the vacuum can't reach on its own. This is why I knocked off one star-the hose is nowhere near long enough to get the job done without a hassle. It has no stretch to it at all, and practically every time I use it I end up pulling the vacuum cleaner over to the ground. Don't get me wrong-the hose still works just fine, but I wish it were more elastic. Other than that, this cleaner is great. Tip-if you notice that debris is being blown all over the place when you are vacuuming, pull the hose out and check where it is connected to the vacuum-more likely than not, this is probably clogged (I found this out after 10 minutes of blowing dust and dog hair all over my kitchen floor).
