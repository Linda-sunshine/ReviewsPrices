review/summary: Good for little stuffreview/text: This product works great for little stuff like chopping/mincing garlic. I am not an experienced chef so this review should have that mentioned for consideration. I did not have much success getting an onion 'chopped' using this little guy. To put a medium sized onion in this guy I have to quarter it at the very least. This produced pureed onion at the bottom and chopped (ish) onion at the top. If I have to cut the onion in more than quarters I can chop it by hand in close to the same amount of dirty dishes, time and energy. So I use it for my small things like fresh herbs, garlic, chives and those types of things. Basically, when I give it the right task it does great! Also, I am very happy that I got to have a pink food processor in my kitchen :)
