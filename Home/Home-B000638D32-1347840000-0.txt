review/summary: Feels goodreview/text: This knife is lightweight, sharp, and feels good in the hand. I don't know if I would say it's the sharpest thing ever like some reviews are saying, but it definitely is a step up from your standard kitchen knife and the price is right for sure. You can buy a bunch of these for how much it costs for one of those fancy premium knives and I doubt the difference in price would be worth it. I trust Victorinox and if you are familiar with their products you know that you can't go wrong.
