review/summary: Worth the extra $$review/text: I have been dehydrating food for years. I have used my oven and I have used a fixed temperature, bottom fan model and now I have arrived! I love all the features that the Nesco FD-75PR offers. The top mounted fan is great because in the bottom fan type if you have something that drips, like beef jerky, the juices get on the heater and the fan so that each time you use it after that, the air it blows smells like the jerky. I also love the adjustable temperature. It just makes more sense to be able to control how much heat is going to the products you are drying. Even though it costs a bit more than the bottom mounted fan models- it is definitely worth it!
