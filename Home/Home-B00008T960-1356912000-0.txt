review/summary: Really goodreview/text: My wife uses it for baking macarons. Works well. The flour mix spreads out evenly and bakes evenly as well. The cookies do not stick on the Silpat. It's like using parchment paper but my wife says it better in its performance. I like it cause it all about reuse recycle and repeat baby. Kinda pricey cause I guess it's the name brand when it comes to this kinda product. But oh well, happy wife, happy life and cookies in my belly.
