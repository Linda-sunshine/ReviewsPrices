review/summary: Lasted less than 90 daysreview/text: While it worked, the coffee was okay but lots of grounds, even using the recommended filter. One morning, after less than 3 months, it just quit working. Now it is just an expensive un-insulated metal pitcher. Might make a decent planter but a waste of money as a coffee maker.
