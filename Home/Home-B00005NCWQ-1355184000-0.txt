review/summary: Nice Quality Potreview/text: I wanted a percolator after living through Hurricane Sandy with no power for 3 weeks! It's not fun to try to make coffee by pouring hot water through the electric drip pot at a slow enough pace to keep it from overflowing.A nice quality pot, this will be in my storm kit, and will also be handy for camping and as an extra pot for decaf or flavored coffees at parties.
