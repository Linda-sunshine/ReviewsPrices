review/summary: Best sheets everreview/text: I have never had sheets I noticed so much, and liked so much, and other people noticed so much when they stayed with us. My folks want a set now.They are THICK, first of all, noticeably thick, and crazy soft. Perfect for winter and then switch them out in the summer. The cream color is gorgeous and goes perfectly with the Gaiam duvet cover set I've got with cream and green leaves.100% Cotton Queen Sized Sheet Set (Organic Leaf Pattern)Amazon randomly runs out of these and doesn't stock them for a long time so if they're in stock jump on it. I got a second set out of fear they were getting discontinued.
