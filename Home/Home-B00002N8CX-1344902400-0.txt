review/summary: Eureka Mighty Mite Vacuum--Amazon purchasereview/text: I already had this vacuum for my personal use and love it!!! A friend asked me to get it for them. This vacuum is light-weight and very easy to use and has excellent suction. I am using it almost exclusively all over the house. Even though it does not have a beater-bar it cleans area rugs really well. I recommend it to anyone that wants to use a light-weight vacuum that cleans, easy to use and is powerful. I read somewhere to be sure it is the 12 amp and I know that the 3670G is, but you might just check to be sure before purchasing. I love it when cleaning my windows because I can vacuum and get all the outside dirt off the window before cleaning and getting into corners is easier too.
