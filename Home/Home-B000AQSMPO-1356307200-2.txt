review/summary: We love our Keurig !!review/text: We use this every day. Also comes in handy when you just want a cup of hot water for Tea, Instant coffee or a bowl of Oatmeal.I only paid $137 (Prime) for it back on April, 2012. Probably you should wait until after the holidays to buy. Looks like the vendor raised the price by $30 (gouging for the holidays).
