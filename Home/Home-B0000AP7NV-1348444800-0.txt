review/summary: filter for tastereview/text: Works great, but takes a minute to filter down. A bit tall - doesn't fit into the fridge water dispenser - but I can still trip the dispenser with the spout. The oval shape allows shelf room in fridge w/milk etc. The cover prevents unfiltered water from pouring before filtering is done.
