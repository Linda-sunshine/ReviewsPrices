review/summary: Awesome little Vac!review/text: This little vac was everything I had hoped for and more. I was originally looking for a rechargable portable vacuum, and the wife showed me this unit. The reviews on this Eureka hand-held swayed me into trying an electric unit. Am I glad i did! This works great...I use it for the car carpets, the house stairs, and around the cat's litter box. It is super powerful, the detachable hose with crevice tool is nice for those hard to get to areas. It is easy to empty, and the cord is easy to unwrap/rewrap and handy. Highly recommended!
