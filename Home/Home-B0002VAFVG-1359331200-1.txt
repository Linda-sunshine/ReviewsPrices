review/summary: Way Too Expensive: Spend your Money More wiselyreview/text: Does not juice efficiently: leaves pieces, the pulp is always wet. Does not juice greens efficiently - whole pieces are seen in the basket - though juices them much better than many other centrifical juicers. But you have to waste a lot of greens to get ample juice.Also the warranty is only one year compared to 5 to 10 on other companies juicers. That's because in my experience, the quality of this juicer is not as good and I can see it breaking down much quicker under continuous use.Also, something strange keeps growing on the diecast metal underneath the cutting blade and no matter how many times I clean and disinfect it, it doesn't solve the problem. I did not have this problem with the $199 Breveille icon juicer.The plus: Fast juicing and fast cleaning it and goes through hard vegetables like beets and carrots like a commercial juicer.If you want this Brand, I would not waste money on the $299 juice fountain elite. I've owned the $199 Icon and it's just as good if not better. The slightly extra power of this 299 - you don't need. All this diecast and stainless steel fancy talk, this and that, are insignificant to the juicing, but might be relevant for appearance. The icon also has more multiple speeds for slower juicing. But if i were you and you wanted a Breville, I would buy the 149 model - it's just as good. And then if you need to buy a new one in a few years, you won't be out so much money.
