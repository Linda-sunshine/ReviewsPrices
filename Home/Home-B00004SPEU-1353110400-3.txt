review/summary: Great blade grinderreview/text: I've had this grinder for over a year, and it's been extremely reliable and useful. I make coffee almost every weekday, and this machine can handle up to about 8 tbsp of whole bean coffee. It can grind to a rather fine consistency, but the coarser grinds might by inconsistent in their grind (you'll see whole shells in there). Cleaning is rather easy - just use a paper towel or napkin to get the coffee residue out. I've used other blade grinders that have an adjustable consistency dial; this one does not, and you can only adjust the coarseness of the grind by timing it.That said, I have just "upgraded" to a burr grinder. If you're looking just to make a simple cup of coffee every morning, this electric grinder will do fine. But I wanted a bit more control over the consistency of my grind, so I purchased theHario MSS-1B Mini Mill Slim Coffee Grinder. It's about $10-15 more than this grinder, and can only handle ~4 tbsp, and it's hand crank (not electric). BUT I've been much more pleased with the quality of my coffee since upgrading. Still, you can't beat the Krups electric grinder for its ease and dependability.
