review/summary: Buzzkillreview/text: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Sure, you'll be completely in love with it for the first six months. Maybe even 9 months or a year. Then suddenly, without warning, the infatuation will come to a grinding halt and you'll be left in a severely undercaffeinated froth. You thought it would last forever, but the Keurig brewer knew the buzz would end one day.I purchased this coffee maker in 2009. It worked great for about 1 year and 10 days, and I was under its spell. I could easily have written one of the rave reviews about this machine here on Amazon, but I didn't. After 1 year of use, it just stopped working and gave me an error message. I called Keurig and they tried troubleshooting it with me, but when we exhausted all options, they just said it was a known problem they couldn't fix, and I was out of warranty because I had had it for over one year. They offered me a new one at 2/3 the price. I declined.Amazon to the rescue! Thanks to its amazing customer service, Amazon offered to refund my purchase. This is one of the many reasons I think Amazon has the best customer service on the planet. They weren't able to exchange it, but that was OK. I thought I'd give up on Keurig, but in a moment of weakness, I bought another one (B60 again) at Best Buy. After about 1.5 years, this one has now broken down with the exact same problem (constantly cycling on the water heating stage with the message "NOT READY", then shutting down without brewing a cup). I went through the same troubleshooting rigamarole with Keurig, and Best Buy isn't Amazon when it comes to customer service... so I am looking for a new coffee maker.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT'S TERRIBLE. No coffeemaker that costs $150 should last less than 5 years. I think even Keurig has to acknowledge this.
