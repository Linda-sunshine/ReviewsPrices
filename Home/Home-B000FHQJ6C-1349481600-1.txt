review/summary: Juicerreview/text: I check consumers report and picked this juicer. I line the waste basket with plastic bags and then do not have to clean that one part when finished juicing. It works good, then cover, screen, and screen mount must be cleaned right after use. No problems if kept clean. Love to juice.
