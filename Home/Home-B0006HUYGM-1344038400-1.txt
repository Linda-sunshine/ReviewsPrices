review/summary: Definitely recommended for pet ownersreview/text: I have two cats and one dog--all prolific shedders--and I've been in search of the perfect vacuum. I still haven't found it but I've had the Eureka hand-held vacuum for a couple of weeks now and am beginning to think that the perfect vacuum will actually be two--a combination of a good upright plus this Eureka. It really does have the power of an upright in a hand-held. I need to vacuum my couches, dining chairs and stairs at least a couple of times a week and am loving this vacuum for this. It sucks up the pet hair at least as well as my Dyson, if not better; and it is much easier to use than the attachments on my upright. Yes, it is a little heavy and loud, but I don't find either of these to be significant drawbacks.
