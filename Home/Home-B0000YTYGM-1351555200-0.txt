review/summary: Oh yeah... the Cuisinart DTC-975BKN Thermal 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemakerreview/text: My Krups Aroma Control finally died, after ~15yrs and nursing it through the last 3. In my grief, I tried to find a replacement just like it (there are none)and decided on the Cuisinart DTC-975BKN Thermal 12-Cup. This is the BEST coffeemaker I could have chosen - why did I wait so long? Excellent and easy use, quiet, AND the coffee stays hot all day! I just love that there are little balls that cover the holes to keep the liquid hot, and they float up when pouring. Yes, pouring is slow, but it gives you time to give thanks for an outstanding and best tasting cup of coffee - it is really that good! Uses all the grounds too (which used to drive me crazy with my Krups)I like mine painfully strong. The problems others have mentioned with leaking can be fixed with FOLLOWING THE DIRECTIONS! I may buy another one for if and when this one breaks, cuz this one I will grieve over much worse ...
