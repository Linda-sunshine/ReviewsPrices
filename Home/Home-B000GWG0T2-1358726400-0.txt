review/summary: Great Pan!review/text: I am very happy with this pan. I am tired of buying and throwing out pans that just don't hold up well. I went by the Cook's Illustrated recommendation and tried this one out. It is so sturdy, heats quickly and evenly, and I don't need non-stick spray. I only wish I had bought a bigger one, I started small to make sure I loved it, but 8 inches is very small! Clean up is a breeze. Will be buying more as I start to replace my older beat up pans.
