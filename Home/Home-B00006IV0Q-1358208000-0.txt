review/summary: So far, so goodreview/text: Gave up on Farberware after my last one died in two months. So far, at two months, this one works well. Also needs about 20% less coffee than the farber pot. Would give this 5 stars if I had it for two years, but just like Farber, this one is made in China so we shall see if it lasts more than a few months.
