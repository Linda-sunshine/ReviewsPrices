review/summary: Luxurious Comfortreview/text: These are the best sheets I've ever slept on! I was afraid the flannel would be too hot, but they're very breathable. The quality is fantastic and unbeatable for the price. What a difference getting into bed with sheets that are so soft and warm. We are so spoiled now that I will be ordering a 2nd set so I can keep them on at all times!
