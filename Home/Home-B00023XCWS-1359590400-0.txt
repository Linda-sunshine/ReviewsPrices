review/summary: good for the pricereview/text: I purchased this electric kettle to use in my office. It's a good, cheap kettle. The plastic taste was pretty strong even after boiling several full kettles of water, so I used a solution of half white vinegar, half water and boiled that through a few times, which helped. Also, I find that if you rinse and refill with fresh water before each use, it cuts down on the plastic taste (I don't always have to do this with the metal version I have at home - it's ok to use water that has been in the kettle for a little while). Overall, good for the price.
