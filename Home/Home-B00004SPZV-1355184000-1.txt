review/summary: Great healthy alternative to spraysreview/text: This is a handy little tool to have in the kitchen however it's not perfect.Pros1) fill it with any oil you please2) no chemicalsCons1) fills the air (and your counter tops, and your lungs!) with oil as you spray it2) just oil is not as good as spray alternatives such as pam etc3) oil is not fat free like spray alternativesI would recommend this product for spraying baked goods instead of brushing, making eggs instead of chemical non-stick alternatives. However, it's not perfect.
