review/summary: The perfect glass jugreview/text: I love this jug. It is the perfect size to keep my fresh goat milk. This jug has a pleasing vintage shape. It fits in the door like a dream leaving more shelf space available for other groceries. It is also a fairly thick glass so it should hold up to every day use.
