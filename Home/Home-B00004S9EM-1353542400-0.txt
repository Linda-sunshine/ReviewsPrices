review/summary: Error prone design combined with poor customer servicereview/text: Loved it at first, then the top jammed. Called customer service and it went down hill from there. I attempted to use my iPhone to take a picture of the jammed lid to show the customer service rep what my problem was. They told me they can not take emails from customers. But they were happy to replace the unit. They concluded that I had warped lid my washing it in hot water.(Wouldn't you design a food processor bowl and lid to tolerate a dishwasher?) But were happy to replace the unit. Shipped it off and after a while they replaced the mixing bowl and lid. On the first time I tried to use the replacement the lid jammed similar to the first time. This time they can't say it is that it was warped by hot water.No help on their web site. I searched internet for help with jammed top for this model and found that I was far from the first person to have the problem. I've concluded that the product has great functionality but that the design may be error prone for many owners. The manual and videos show effortless on / off use of the top but my experience and others is that jams are a common problem. Sadly their poor design is combined with an equally poor customer service. Rather than listen to a customer or use everyday customer service technology the representative read his script determined the unit was damaged and replaced the top. I am an average user, I suspect I am making a common mistake with a poorly designed product that allows a typical user to make a common error. Their design and customer service doesn't work well enough together to help me correctly use their product.Based on this experience, the reality of the Cuisinart brand doesn't match their substantial reputation. Avoid this product and Cuisinart.
