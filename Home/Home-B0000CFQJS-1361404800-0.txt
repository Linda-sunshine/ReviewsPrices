review/summary: Works great - great valuereview/text: I bought this permanent filter for less than it would have cost me for a pack of disposable ones. Plus, this works much better - the filter doesn't fold over while brewing letting grounds into the coffee pot. I wish I had bought this when I first got y coffee pot.
