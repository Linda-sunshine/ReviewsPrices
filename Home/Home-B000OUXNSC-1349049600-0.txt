review/summary: very happyreview/text: Purchased this mattress pad for my queen bed which is about 15-16 inches deep and it fits very well with a little room to spare. It stays in place nicely and the padding feels great. I have had this item for about a month at the time of this review and i am pleased with it in every wayso far. As others have mentioned the sides are far from gauzy, they are thick and have a lot of stretch. If you rip the sides putting it on you're doing something wrong. Also, due to the mixed reviews of how this mattress pad stands up to the dryer, i chose the safest option and just line dried it.
