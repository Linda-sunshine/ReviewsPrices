review/summary: Great for intended purposereview/text: I give 5 stars for the sounds therapy aspect. It has a very clear and soothing sound. I use the sound therapy for my 2 yr olds nap and bedtime. However, I give the radio aspect almost 3 stars. I didn't realize it came with nearly 2 feet of wire antennae, which is too much work finding the right reception for each radio station. But I got it for the sound therapy, and it's fantastic for that purpose.
