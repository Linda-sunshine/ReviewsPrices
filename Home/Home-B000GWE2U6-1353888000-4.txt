review/summary: Still running after 3 winters!review/text: I had the Crane penguin and it died after exactly one winter--the bowl cracked first and then the motor itself stopped running. This little piggy on the other hand has never given me any problems. And I find it relatively easy to keep clean. My grandma has had the same model even longer than me and hers is still chugging along too.
