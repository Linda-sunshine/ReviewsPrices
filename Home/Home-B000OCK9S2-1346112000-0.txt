review/summary: I should have listened to the other reviewsreview/text: I wanted to replace another old alarm clock, with relaxing sounds, but it is not working for me, I like to look at the time, from a standing point of view, and you have to lean very very near the clock to be able to read it, and the sounds are of very poor quality. There are not many options for alarm clocks that can wake you up with a relaxing sound, in the market, so I gave it a chance, but I am really disappointed in the product.
