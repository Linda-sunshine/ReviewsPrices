review/summary: Works wellreview/text: I've used it on maybe a dozen knives and it has worked well and produced a nice sharp edge.Some knives it works better on than others for some reason.My only wish is that there was a better way to ensure that the exact angle was consistently used.It's kind of up to you to hold the knife well aligned with the slot.Without consistency you may not be sharpening the actual edge.
