review/summary: Recommended for old folksreview/text: This suits my age because of its light weight. Now I can carry a vacuum up and down stairs with little effort. It does a very good job cleaning carpets, equal to a heavier machine I no longer use. The long cord is very handy, less time stooping to change outlets.
