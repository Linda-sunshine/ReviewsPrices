review/summary: Ahhh Sleep......review/text: I've been contemplating buying a new mattress because of sore hips waking me up during the night even tho my mattress is only 3 years old. So I searched and read all the reviews on the memory foam mattress and thought I'd give it a try. The day it arrived, I unpacked it, laid it out on top of my mattress, and swore to myself, I'm sleeping on this tonight!!! Next morning I could NOT believe how good I felt. No waking up in the middle of the night, no sore hips. I 'strongly' urge others to try this topper. You will not regret it.
