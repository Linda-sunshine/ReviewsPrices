review/summary: a handy gadgetreview/text: This little cup warmer works pretty well, but don't think it will reheat a cup of coffee, it won't. It just keeps what's in there hot. I've found that it will heat up about a half cup from luke warm to drinking strength in about 20 minutes, but that's about it.I use my warmer at work for my last cup of the day that I nurse for a couple hours and it's saved me a lot of time going to and from the office kitchen to use the microwave.I wish it had an auto shut off feature, not that I've left it on overnight, but it gets decently hot, so that could be a concern.
