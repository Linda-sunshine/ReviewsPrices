review/summary: finally a good ironreview/text: Purchased this iron per reviews online. Not a big fan of Black & Decker products, but was pleasantly surprized by this iron. Fairly light & easy to see guidelines on what temps to use for different fabrics. Didn't have to over & over to get out stubborn wrinkles.
