review/summary: Great idea that doesn't workreview/text: I've had several oil sprayers, the first of which was a Misto. I still think it's a wonderful idea. The problem is that any oil is so thick it doesn't readily "spray", even the light types. Instead, it comes out in an anemic stream. I did manage to get one working by cleaning it thoroughly and then mixing up a 1:1 mixture of oil to vinegar. That sprays beautifully, so a light salad dressing is definitely possible. Using this method, you could probably mix oil and enough water to be able to shake it and spray, knowing that it's not pure oil but still getting enough oil to do the job. An earlier review mentioned using a silicone brush, which for me is a better solution to minimal oil--one tool for multiple uses that cleans and stores easily. I won't be buying another oil sprayer, that's for sure.
