review/summary: very poorly packagedreview/text: This unit arrived in a box with the UPC code cut off, torn box taped back together very unprofessionally, and magic marker writing all over the box.When I complained, we were told that this came from a warehouse, and that the unit was fine. The unit does work, but has obviously been used.I wouldn't recommend buying anything from this vendor.
