review/summary: Great Grinderreview/text: I specifically bought this grinder to grind up green chili & fruits to make jams. It has wonderful. The suction on the bottom is excellent & it is very easy to assemble & clean. I haven't tried grind up meat or make pasta, but I'm excited to try it. I liked mine so much that I purchased one for my mom as well.
