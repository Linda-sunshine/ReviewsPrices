review/summary: Better than our air o Swiss humidifierreview/text: We had the super expensive "air washer" air-o-Swiss humidifier for two years and that thing was a pain to clean ... So much so that I finally trashed it and bought this humidifier for 1/4 the price of the AOS.Pros:It last all day and all night, making it super easy to operateDoesn't get dirty like all the other humidifiers out thereHumidifies exceptionally wellNice humming noise for sleeping (I like white noise)Cons:It occasionally rattles on the lowest setting (feels like the parts are jiggling on the base)I would high recommend this for anyone who finds cleaning the humidifier a chore and people who like white noise during the might for sleeping.
