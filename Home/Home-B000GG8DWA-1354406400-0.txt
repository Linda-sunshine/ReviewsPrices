review/summary: Small heater... Big heatreview/text: Good for SF Bay Area. Feels like a fire place. We have Heat is somewhat directed. The reflectors help the heat to spread out well. 400W gives all the heat our bedrooms need. I wish this had an automatic temperature sensor to behave like a thermostatic heater and I would be willing to pay more for that. I had to get a timer to switch it on and off programmatically.Well worth the money.
