review/summary: Very Scratchy Sheetsreview/text: I'd have to agree with a lot of the other reviewers that these sheets are very scratchy. As suggested on other reviews, before using them, I soaked them in fabric softener for 2 hours then washed them, again using fabric softener during the wash cycle. I put them in the dryer with a softener sheet, and when they came out, they were still pretty scratchy, though better than when I had first taken them out of the package. I repeated this process a second time before actually trying them out on the bed. When we tried them out, we were really disappointed with how scratchy they still were. They were so uncomfortable, I don't think I even would have made it one night.The sheets we were using were high thread count (maybe 800?) Hotel Collection sheets, which are very nice. These don't even come close to comparing, so if you are used to nicer sheets or want something very soft, these are not for you. If you are used to rougher sheets or lower thread counts, these might be ok, although I think you could find the same softness (or lack thereof) for less money.Other than the scratchiness, they seem to be pretty good quality and they held up great in the washer/dryer. No pilling or anything. I took them out of the dryer immediately and they really weren't wrinkled very much either, so that was a plus. However, these small positives didn't outweigh the negatives, so I'll be returning them. It was a good try, but I think I'll buy my sheets at a store from now on since it's so hard to tell the quality when shopping online.
