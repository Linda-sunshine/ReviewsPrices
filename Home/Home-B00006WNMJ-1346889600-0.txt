review/summary: Great productreview/text: I love this product, it works as described with no problems. I do not understand why Amazon has suspended shipping, when almost all of the reviews for the last 30 days have been very positive. I think that some people think that this little unit should many months, and thousands of gallons. They need to understand that the size of this unit limits the amount of purified water it can produce. The problem of the flow slowing down, I do not know what their problem is. I have been using a filter like this for years with no problems at all. It is a shame they had to raise the price 22% in the last month!
