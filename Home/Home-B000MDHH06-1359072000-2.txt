review/summary: Gift for my parents.review/text: Bought this for my folks for xmas and from what I've heard it doesn't produce much juice -- but that could just be because they don't know how to use it properly (?) -- hard to give an accurate review because I haven't actually used it. We have a 1,200 watt Breville that is amazing -- I'm sure this is a great juicer as well.
