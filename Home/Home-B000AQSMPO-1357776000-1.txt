review/summary: Amazingreview/text: I will never go back to a standard coffee pot.The difference in taste between my old pot and this machine is astounding. The first time it was fired up the whole kitchen smelled like a coffee shop.The K-Cups are more expensive than brewing a pot of coffee sure, but if you are only looking to have a cup or two of coffee a day I fully believe the extra expense is worth it.
