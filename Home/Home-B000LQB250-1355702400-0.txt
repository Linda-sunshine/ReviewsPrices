review/summary: Great mattress topperreview/text: I really enjoyed this mattress topper. I purchased a king size topper for a queen size bed, and cut the topper to fit my bed, based on other reviews. I was not able to sleep in the bed without my back hurting before I got the topper. The topper eliminated this problem and I was able to sleep through the night without a problem. I would recommend this product to anyone who is uncomfortable in their bed, but does not want to buy a new one.
