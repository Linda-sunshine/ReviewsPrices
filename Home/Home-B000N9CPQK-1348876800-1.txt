review/summary: Works well, relatively small, good price - gets louder with time.review/text: We try to leave this on continually in our small bedroom. It seems to work well - I've cleaned the filter out once after about 4-5 months of continuous use, and it certainly caught a lot of stuff. It was also easy to clean. Our allergies (and our cat's breathing/snoring!) have improved with its use.It's pretty small and unobtrusive, though it does require a space where it can get decent airflow, which can be a challenge. It would be nice if it came in a different color, like black, but for the price, I can't get too picky. I like having the permanent HEPA filter; I expect this will save money over time, but we'll have to see.The only trouble is that it gets louder with time. Even on the lowest setting, it's a bit too grinding for my blood pressure, and I find myself irritated sitting in the bedroom for long periods of time. It's not too bad at night (we sleep pretty heavily) but it does get to me during the day. I hope it doesn't continue to get worse.
