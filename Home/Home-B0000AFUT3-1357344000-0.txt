review/summary: Light bulbs burned out in less than 3 months.review/text: I owned a Jerdon mirror for several years. When it died in Oct. 2012, I ordered another. The lights on the new mirror lasted less than 3 months. You cannot change the light bulbs. I will return the mirror and hopefully receive a refund.
