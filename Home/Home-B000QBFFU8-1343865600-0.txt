review/summary: I could not be happierreview/text: The Breville BJE510XL is our first juicer. We use it at least three times a day and could not be more pleased. Clean up is quick and easy if done right after juicing. The amount of juice extracted is what I expected considering it is not a press type juicer,(or priced like one). There is very little juice lost and the resulting compost waste is easy to clean out. Everything about the Breville Ikon 900 conveys solid design and construction. If this machine continues to perform as it has thus far I would recommend it to anyone.
