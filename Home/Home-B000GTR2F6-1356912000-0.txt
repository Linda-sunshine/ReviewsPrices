review/summary: My Wife Loves Thisreview/text: My sister in law tipped me off that this would be a good Christmas gift for my wife. Over a week after Christmas my wife is still ranting about how much she loves her Keurig. Instead of dealing with cans, filters, and timers every night, she can now wake up and have just the right amount of coffee done in about a minute. I would suggest purchasing the storage shelf and stand. It is a great space saver.
