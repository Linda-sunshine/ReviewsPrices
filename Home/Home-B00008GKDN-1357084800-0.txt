review/summary: Black Beautyreview/text: I have quite a bit of Lodge cast iron cookware, but this little black beauty is hands down my favorite. The L90GE 's diameter is large enough to easily cook breakfast favorites such as pancakes, sausages, and bacon. This griddle also works wonders for grilled and Panini sandwiches. I have even cooked outstanding beef and chicken Fajitas with ease using this item. The griddle already comes pre-seasoned and ready to use right out the box. However, before the first use I did put a good coat of organic flaxseed oil and baked it at 500 degrees for one hour outside on my gas grill. The result was a superior glossy shine that will make the cast iron look like polished black granite. After that type of seasoning, all I use is a light amount of vegetable oil with medium heat with each use and a stainless steel spatula. There is no sticking of food and the griddle cooks perfect every time.The durability of the Lodge cookware is of legend and that holds true with their griddle. With reasonable use and good care (which is incredibly easy) this should be the last griddle you will ever have to buy and will likely be inherited by your children and grandchildren. The griddle is light, easy to use, and distributes heat evenly with no hot spots. The cast iron holds the heat well allowing you do cook numerous items at one setting. This is really nice, especially if you are using your griddle while camping or for outdoor use. Overall, Lodge has really outdone themselves with this griddle. For the very reasonable price you pay, this is simply one of the very best pieces of cookware you could ever use or own. After you have this gem you will wonder how you went so many years without one.
