review/summary: T-Fal is awful!!review/text: What a disappointment! I have wanted a reasonably priced non-stick fry pan and America's Test Kitchen said this was the one. My 12.5" just arrived. I opened it, washed it, oiled it (as directed) and anticipated great results as I prepared to cook an egg. One egg! After waiting a long while for the center to turn solid red, I thought well maybe it is almost red and proceeded. I drop the egg in to the center to fry and it slid to the side. It was domed. After the egg was cooked, I added water to the pan and watched as the water boiled. That is all but the center 2 1/2" to 3". Not a bubble in sight. So not only was it domed, it was not heating evenly, so much so that I could see the pattern of the electric stove top coils through the water. I can hardly wait to get this piece of junk back in the box and returned. I am out S&H on both ends and very amazed that the folks at my trusted ATK did not mention these problems. I did read about the doming on some reveiws but put all my faith in ATK.
