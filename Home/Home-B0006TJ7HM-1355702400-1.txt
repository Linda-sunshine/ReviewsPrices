review/summary: You get what you pay forreview/text: These were cheap so I suppose that I can not complain to much and I should lower my standards slightly. The just feel like they are cheaply made and not very sharp. It's next to impossible to sharpen these properly too. I did like the scissors a lot out of the set though. They've held up nicely so far.
