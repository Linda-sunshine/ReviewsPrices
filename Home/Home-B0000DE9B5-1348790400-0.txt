review/summary: Perfect!!!review/text: I love this jug and, in fact, I am going to get a few more. I read the negative reviews about it breaking when hot water it poured into it and I am not sure why people are making ice tea with hot water anyway. I just place tea bags in the jug, fill it with cold water, and let it steep in the fridge overnight. Voila! Great ice tea, no broken jug.
