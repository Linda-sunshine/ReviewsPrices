review/summary: Aviod this pressure cookerreview/text: I bought this cooker two weeks ago. It worked the first time I used it. Then I could never get it to come up to pressure again. I too called Cuisenarts customer service and all they could say was add more water. That didn't work. The float valve I believe is just not good. Too much steam and water escape from it. A worker in a department store told me that she has this cooker and it can take up to 40 minutes to come up to pressure. So if I want to cook white rice which should take only 3 minutes for one cup, I have to wait 40 minutes to come up to pressure! Better to just cook on the stove in a saucepan! I returned the cooker for a full refund!
