review/summary: A must have accessory for home espresso machinesreview/text: Many home espresso machines come with built in or detachable tamper for packing espresso in the filters. Many of the are plastic or are positioned in an awkward place. Spend a little bit extra and get yourself one of these. These are solidly built and will allow you to perfectly pack your espresso in the filter. Tamping is an important part of pulling a good espresso shot so this will make a difference in your home espresso experience. Make sure to check the size of your filter so that you get the right size.
