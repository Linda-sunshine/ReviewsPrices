review/summary: worked great three times!review/text: I agree with another review for this product (by Nosewiper on July 21, 2011).The motor is very good, the blades are as well, but the piece that connects the two parts is a cheap plastic that when overheats, makes the entire thing worthless.I purchased this item on May 21, 2012 and used it 3 - 4 times.Tried to use it today and the blades no longer turn because the plastic piece no longer works as designed.
