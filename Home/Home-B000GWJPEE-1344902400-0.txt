review/summary: Defective Productreview/text: I just received the new version of this penguin humidifier which has the on/off button integrated into the control knob today. The humidifier generates extremely small amount of mist at max speed. It's almost useless at the moment. I feel disappointed and sent the item back for a replacement.
