review/summary: Hard as a rock!review/text: Was excited to try this pillow... I will say that the quality is great but the pillow is hard as a rock! It is very difficult to shape it and appeares to be too thick. I tried to use it but quickly gave up after 15 minutes, will make covers for the and use as seat cushions for outdoor events.
