review/summary: Good bang for the buck, but very loudreview/text: This purifier is very easy to setup. Just take the unit out of the box, unscrew the bottom, and then whole top lifts off revealing the main HEPA filter. Then you simply wrap the included carbon pre-filter around the main filter and secure it with the attached Velcro straps. To reassembly just place the top back on the unit and screw in the bolt on the bottom.Despite the easy disassembly process (perhaps because of it) the system is very well sealed. I like the overall design of the system that allows air to be sucked in through all sides and then blows the filtered air out the vents on the top.This air purifier offers good performance for the price but unfortunately I found it to be just too loud to leave running, even at the "Medium" setting which is what's recommended for day time use. The "High" speed setting is unbearably loud and the "Medium" just a little quieter (but still too loud to use in a room with the TV, etc.). The nighttime setting is better, but at that level you aren't getting much performance out of the machine.The system did a good job at capturing airborne particles in the pre-filter although it definitely was not at the same level as more expensive units such as IQAir.Overall this is a good system if you can deal with the noise. If you are specifically looking for some type of white noise in your house then this will definitely do the trick!
