review/summary: Powerful and noisyreview/text: This is a great &#34;grinder&#34; for coffee beans. This type of burr mill is much more effective than the less expensive type that pretty much turns coffee beans into a mass if you aren't careful. The only thing that I don't like about it is that it is noisy. Don't throw away your other type grinder though because it is great for processing dry herbs and making bread crumbs in small quantities.
