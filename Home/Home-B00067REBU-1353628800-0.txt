review/summary: Great Bread Machinereview/text: This was my first time using a bread machine and this machine is VERY easy to use. The instructions were easy to understand and it does tell the times for each cycle. The very first loaf that I baked turned out perfectly. I did use the Betty Crocker bread machine cookbook recipe instead of the manual's recipes. I even cooked yeast rolls with the dough cycle and baked them in the oven. Yum! Yum! I had to look on YouTube to see how to shape the rolls but it went great. I LOVE this machine and I would recommend it for first time bakers and if you need extra instruction, you can go to YouTube and look up how to use this same bread machine. Some people say this is a big machine, but I have a very small kitchen and it fits nicely on my counter. I can't wait to try out new recipes.
