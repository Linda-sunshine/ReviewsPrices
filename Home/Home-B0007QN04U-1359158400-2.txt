review/summary: not long lasting! $300 in repairs later ...review/text: We bought this mixer 6 years ago, but only used it about once a month until about a year ago. I started making my own bread about 1x a week. It is a wheat bread 3c white / 3c wheat flour. After a few months, the engine burnt out. I've had to change to 4c white & 2 c wheat because the mixer couldn't handle it. Since then, I've had to take it in two more times & have boon told by the repair tech. to either get a new mixer (he doesn't ever recommend this mixer!) the 5qt one, or quit making bread. So disappointed!! I've spent over $300 in repairs on a "professional" mixer that can not even be used on a weekly basis.
