review/summary: Good but not quite great.review/text: We purchased this unit to replace an identical Bunn coffee maker that we had for a few years. The old unit would not keep the coffee very hot after it brewed. The new unit is an improvement but does not keep it as hot as we think it should. Otherwise the brewer does a fine job. That's the reason for four stars.
