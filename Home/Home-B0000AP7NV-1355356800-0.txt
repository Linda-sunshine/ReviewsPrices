review/summary: Perfect for a small fridgereview/text: This works great and makes water taste very clean and crisp. I would say that if you have a family of two or three you may want to get the larger one. I live alone and find myself filling it up multiple times a day. The replacement filters are inexpensive. As has been suggested, if you do not want to see carbon pebbles in your water, FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS on the filter package. Submerge it in water for a few minutes before installing it in the pitcher for the first time. Some may still show up from time to time but not much and very rarely, if at all. Really not a big deal in my opinion.
