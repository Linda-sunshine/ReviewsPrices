review/summary: Just got it...it's greatreview/text: This lives up to the other reviews, but when I first unboxed it I thought it was broken because when I plugged it in there was no sound whatsoever. Then I started feeling toasty and the rest is..just what the other reviews said. It works fine on my low office carpet, though I wish it didn't look so much like a toaster oven. At the lower setting (400W) it is more than enough heat even 4' away from where I am sitting. Can't imagine putting it under my desk. When I get solar electric, I might switch to these altogether! It sure beats the older fan-style heater I have now replaced.Update: I've had it a few days and it is just as wonderful as I thought. However, because it is silent, and when it is between cycles it doesn't glow, so it is really easy to leave it on when I leave my office and once I ran it all night long. Not energy efficient! Don't know how I'm going to deal with this, but it isn't a deal breaker. I just love how warm it makes me feel without blowing on my skin or making noise.
