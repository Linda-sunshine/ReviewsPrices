review/summary: Fine Coffee Makerreview/text: I first experienced the Keurig B60 at a contractor facility. I thought its ability to make a cup of coffee on the fly with many different flavors to choose from was just great. I had to have one. Now I have my own and have enjoyed not only coffee but several types of tea as well as hot chocolate in the last two days. I've programed the on/off feature to come on each day at 5AM and go off at 8AM. I've also programed the timer feature for two hours - it'll turn off two hours after the last cup is brewed.As for travel mugs, I find my six inch tall (with top removed for filling) mug fits nicely under the output nozzle with the drip pan removed from the coffee maker. The 9.5 oz setting on the maker doesn't fill my mug all the way, but it's close. I've purchased a 16oz mug and plan to fill it by running 9.5 oz and then 5.5 oz - this will dilute the coffee but I find its still good.The unit was packed nice in a cardboard box with only the needed address info on the outside. This is good if you're worried about things being stolen from your front door before you're able to get them. Inside its box the coffee maker was packaged in a nice box with styrofoam surrounding it. Overall the packaging was really fine.
