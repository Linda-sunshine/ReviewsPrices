review/summary: Awesome Egg Cooker!review/text: This is one egg cooker that works perfectly for making poached or hard boiled eggs without dragging out the pan, putting it on the stove and watching it so it doesn't boil dry or boil over. Put in the microwave with a little water and the eggs and they turn out perfectly all the time.
