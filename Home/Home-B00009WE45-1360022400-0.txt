review/summary: Broke after two usesreview/text: I don't have much to say as it broke or got liquid in the display within two weeks. No misuse on my part - just used it in a roast, washed it off and put it with my other utensils on two different occasions. I do like to check the calibration in boiling water, but I can't imagine that broke it.Oh well, back to the old standard. No digital for me.
