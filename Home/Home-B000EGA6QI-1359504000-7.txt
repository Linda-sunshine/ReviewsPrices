review/summary: Love it !review/text: I bought this specifically to blend my Curry Butternut Squash Soup. I had previously blended it in batches - I would end up with a stack of dirty containers. I can use this right in the soup pot - blends everything nice and smooth. Looking forward to finding other uses for this handy little blender
