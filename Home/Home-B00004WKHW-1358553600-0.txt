review/summary: Terrible productreview/text: I bought this mini food processor with the intention of doing easy things, like smoothies and sauces. It is very small and the motor starts to smell like burning after about 10 seconds.It does a very poor job pureeing anything. That is with simple, easy to break down ingredients. I was very unhappy with this product and will now have to buy a new one. Don't waste your money.
