review/summary: What a juicer!!!!review/text: I purchased this juicer because I was tired on cleaning my Jack Lalane juicer. Not only is cleanup significantly easier, the performance is head and shoulders above my old juicer. The motor is much more powerful and extracts the juice in greater volume than the Jack Lalane. Will recommend this juicer to anyone willing to listen. Great value.
