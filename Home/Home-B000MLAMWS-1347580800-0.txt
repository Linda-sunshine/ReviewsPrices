review/summary: I love this mixerreview/text: I bought this mixer to replace a Sunbeam that I had used for years that finally quit. I decided a long time ago that when I replaced my old mixer it would be with a KitchenAid. After reading the reviews of different models, I decided on the Pro 600 with 6 qt bowl. I do a lot of baking & it has handled anything that I have used it for with ease. It is truly a powerhouse. I can mix 2 pound cakes in it at once with no problem & the 6 qt bowl is large enough to hold them. I considered ordering one with a tilt head - it would just make removing the beater a little easier. But, of course, if I had selected the tilt head, I would have had to give up the 6 qt bowl. I am so happy with this purchase.
