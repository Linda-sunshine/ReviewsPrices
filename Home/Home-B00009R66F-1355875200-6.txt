review/summary: Great carpet cleaner, even for 1970's shag carpet!review/text: I rent a cabin with rainbow color shag carpet from the 1970's; the high, thick kind that traps every piece of dirt and dog hair possible. My regular vacuum is useless, and my floor was disgusting. This vacuum is easy to assemble, I did it myself in 30 minutes following the directions, and does a great job getting dirt and hair out of my shag carpet. Read the directions! They are brief but useful and tell you how to tell when your discharge tank is full, etc. The water was black the first two times I used it. As for the dog hair, it pulls it out from the depths of the carpet, but doesn't suck it up, because well, it's not a vacuum. But it pulls the hair up and out to the surface of the carpet so I can then go around and pick up all the clumps. I had a ball of hair the size of a bowling ball that was pulled from my carpet. The cleaning tool to pull the dirt and hair from the vacuum is a really nice addition too, but I haven't found a good place to store it, maybe I overlooked that storage spot...?--that would be my only (minor) complaint. Overall a great carpet cleaner, especially for the price.
