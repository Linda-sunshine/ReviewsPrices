review/summary: Great so Farreview/text: FINALLY home made bread!!!! Love it, simple, and easy to use, bakes great bread, makes great dough, it is a great buy for the price. We use it quite often and many times we dont even know its working. A great purchase. Was not too sure about it at first, but we are not sorry we purchased this machine.
