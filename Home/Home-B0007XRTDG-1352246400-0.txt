review/summary: GREAT SKILLET...Just need to knowreview/text: .. that not only does it say it does NOT need oil to fry, but the surface ACTUALLY REPELS OIL, so the oil all goes to center area instead of spreading out. I used this for my favorite Chicken in White Wine recipe (uses boneless, skinless breasts), which needs the olive oil to mix with the bouillon/sour cream sauce put near end. However, I simply moved each floured piece quickly over center area to capture some of the oil, then tilted skillet a couple times during browning to distribute oil to all pieces. Chicken not only browned beautifully, but after covered later, turned out really nice and tender.I previously had to cook this dish in two skillets and had to divide all ingredients, which was a pain. I am so happy that I can now make this in 1 skillet and, so far, have been delighted with this one.
