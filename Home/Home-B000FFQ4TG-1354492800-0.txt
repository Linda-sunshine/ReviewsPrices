review/summary: Very disappointedreview/text: I've owned Bunn coffee makers since the 80's and swore by them. The first one had a separate container for the water and it lasted over 10 years, then I bought another one and it was fine and then another and it was the first one I had that poured the water in from the decanter. I also had one that was re-conditioned and it lasted several years, now we are at this one that I just bought last July and if I heard the Bunn company was going broke it would make me happy. This piece of garbage must have been made in China. I hate the top that spins around, unless you are at least 5ft 4in tall you will have to stand on your toes to pour the water in without it spilling all over the counter,it leaks water all over and I never get 10 cups out it, today I just moved it from where it was sitting to a new location and the water started dripping out of it while I was carrying it and I almost dropped it because the water is hot. I think this new design is the worst I've ever seen, I call it a design flaw. Why would you change something that's worked for years? With the lift up lid I never had a problem with it spilling but with this lid that you have to turn to pour the water in and then the groves in there that cause the water to over flow is ridiculous. The other day I had to stop pouring the water in before I had pour the whole ten cups in because it was lifting the stupid cheap top up. I will never buy another Bunn coffee maker.
