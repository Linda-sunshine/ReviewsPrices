review/summary: My daily brewreview/text: I have not made a pot of drip since buying this press. I went all in and also bought a Peugeot Coffee Mill.Peugeot PM11765 Bresil 8.75 Inch Coffee Mill, WalnutOnce getting the grind just right and the water temperature from my kettle dialed in, you want it just short of boiling.Revere 2-1/3-Quart Whistling Tea KettleI consistently am making some of the best coffee and am enjoying it on a daily basis, my wife thinks I'm nuts for going through all the steps but when our schedules mess she asks me to make coffee and ignores the drip.I get two nice big cups out of the press, stay away from the bottom of the pot as there is always some grit that makes it through.One tip is the disassemble the plunger on a weekly basis and flip the screen. With use, the lip of the screen will start to bend upward and by reversing it the screen will help to trap the grounds on the bottom of the pot and not in your mug.The pot itself is well built and will probably last a lifetime, the screen is already showing wear after one month and a replacement screen is ridiculously priced at $13 at the time of this review or almost half the price of an entire new press...Bodum Replacement Filter Mesh for 12 Cup French PressSo, if you want an excellent cup o joe and are willing to spend a couple of minutes to produce it, order the press.
