review/summary: Cleans the carpet goodreview/text: This beats all the handheld vacuums out there except for those commercial ones. I used this one on our carpet too and it picked dust and hairs easily. It's not lightweight but I like it that way. Suction is awesome and the spinning brush works like magic, picks up hairs and picks up debris easily. Recommended absolutely.One thing I did not like and totally misleading is the description say Made in (the) USA, but upon closer inspection on the product, it's actually made in China. Other than that I am satisfied with this product.
