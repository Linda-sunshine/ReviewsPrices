review/summary: Coffee tastes oddreview/text: I have cleaned this thing over and over and when I use it in my dorm room the coffee comes out with an odd taste. I have used the city water and I used bottled water and both came out with the same taste. It's a great size and easy to transport, but consider a different brand before you purchase.
