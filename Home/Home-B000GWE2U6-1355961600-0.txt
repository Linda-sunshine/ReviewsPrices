review/summary: Adorable and works *GREAT* with our very hard waterreview/text: We have hard water. By that, I mean we have extremely hard water (new shower heads every couple of years, constant build-up on the faucets, etc...). Most humidifiers either require a filter or distilled water if you have hard water. In terms of price/convenience, that just won't do for us.So, we have gone through a few humidifiers trying to find one that will work well with hard water and regular cleaning. The first was a total bust, and the second was OK (it still works) but it is a bit of a pain to really get it cleaned so over time there has been some scale build up.However, the Crane is a real winner. It is incredibly easy to clean and, after several weeks, still runs like it did on the first day. In addition, it's adorable! I would highly recommend this to anyone, but I especially recommend it to anyone with hard water.
