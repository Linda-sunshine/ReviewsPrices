review/summary: Woo hoo!review/text: Absolute best can opener ever!!! I was just about to give upand deal with all those other irritating painstaking things out thereand then the OXO came along. THANK YOU to whomever inventedit! Once you purchase it.. none of the others will do. Automatic onestip over when opening big cans or get stuck. Other manual models don'tcut smoothly skip all the time and hurt your fingers. Not OXO uebersmooth.Love it! Love it, Love it!!
