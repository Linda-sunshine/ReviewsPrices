review/summary: Wow price and performance!review/text: I bought this for about $50 and I really didn't have high expectaions for it. I didn't have money for a "good" vacuum so thought this would do until I did. This has been great for over a year now and perfect for my 2 bedroom condo. It has some serious suction power and I love that I don't have to change anything to go from carpet to other flooring. The only negative I have is I wish the cord was a few feet longer but not a deal breaker with how it performs. I don't think I'll ever be happy with another vacuum after this powerful little thing!
