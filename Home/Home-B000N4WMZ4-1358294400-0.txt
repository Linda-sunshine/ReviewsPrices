review/summary: Awesome dutch ovenreview/text: This was a gift for my daughter who loves to cook. She had been wanting one of these but they can be very expensive. This one is a gorgeous blue, very nice weight and cooks beautifully. The price was really affordable too. It easily fits a whole chicken in it. This will last her a very long time.
