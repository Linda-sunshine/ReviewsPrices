review/summary: Does the job it was made for.review/text: I have had 2 Krups grinders before. They certainly do the job. I'm planning to retire the old one to spice grinder status and put the new one into the coffee grinding slot. I use a French press and have trouble finding a grind coarse enough to work well for me. The Krups solves that problem.
