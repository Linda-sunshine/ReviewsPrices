review/summary: Great product for the money.review/text: Being truly "non-stick" is very important to me. This is the only pan that I've ever purchased that stayed that way after many many uses. It doesn't even stick when I use it for fried and scrambled eggs. I think that part of the reason it remains "non-stick" so well is that I wash it by hand rather than in the dishwasher. However, it does tend to scratch a bit even though I only use plastic utensils which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.
