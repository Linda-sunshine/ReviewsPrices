review/summary: Great price!review/text: Have been wanting this nativity set. Priced it at stores, and it was $79.99. Found it on Amazon for much less, about 45 or so. The figurines were in great shape. The inner styrafoam is a bit messed up and torn up, but still will work for storage, just a bit messy. Well worth the price. Love this set!
