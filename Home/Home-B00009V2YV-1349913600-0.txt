review/summary: works well... but display is WAY TOO LIGHT !!!!!!!review/text: had this for 2 months took a week til it finally went off on the weekly test. Easy to program so get the county codes you want to be alerted on from online noaa weather gov site. went nuts during thunderstorm activity which i liked all the notifications. however the display is way too light and no adjust for brightness. Shame on midland. I bought way cheapER ELECtronics and they had adjustments for lcd display brightness. am radio reception works well. I also like how you can edit out notifications that you would never get in your area also.
