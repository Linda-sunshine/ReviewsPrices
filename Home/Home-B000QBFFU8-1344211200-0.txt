review/summary: Love this Juicer!review/text: This juicer came highly recommended by a friend that was thinking about buying one, but the price was higher than we wanted to pay (having never even juiced a grape before!).I scoured the net for a comparable juicer for less, read the reviews here on Amazon and decided. Even though there are juicers a third of the price of this one, the reliability and endurance was simply not comparable to the Breville. Many had shoddy reviews across various sales outlets.The Breville cleans easy for the most part. Except for the base, the components dismantle and are dishwasher safe. The spinning screen within the juicer needs to be cleaned by hand immediately after juicing with the included bristled brush so that the pulp residue doesn't harden - the pulp is already fairly dry after juicing, left on the screen for too long and it gets more difficult to clean.Our lid on the pitcher cracked within the first week we had the juicer - it's a hard plastic, but a snug fit that needs to go on perfectly aligned... I tried to force it and it cracked - fair warning. The lid is still usable.This appliance looks great on the counter and often guests to our home want to try it out. Every one loves it.We were amazed at the fresh taste of the juice but this would likely happen with any juicer. Overall, we are very pleased with this purchase.
