review/summary: Works well, looks nice in kitchen, easy to clean and refillreview/text: This was our first single serve machine. I really like it. We use it frequently and have had no problems with it. It cleans and refills easily. The panel is easy to read and directions easy to follow. Different brewing cup sizes is a nice feature. It has a nice look to it and is smaller than many other options we saw, which is nice since it takes up less space. It is lightweight but sturdy. The coffee has been consistently good and the machine seems very reliable in the months that we have had it.
