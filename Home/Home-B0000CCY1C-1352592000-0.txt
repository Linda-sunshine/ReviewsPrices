review/summary: Awesome scoops - and not just for cookies!review/text: I came back here to purchase the large size scoop (I already own small and medium) and saw that it has been over seven years since I purchased my other sizes. Since they are still going strong, I figured it's time for a review!These scoops have made my cookie baking heaven, creating uniform, attractive cookies - love! But I also wanted to point out that I use them for making pancakes (perfect - equal in size, small pancakes for kids) and scooping out batter for cupcakes and muffins, regular or mini size!I bake *a lot* and they are still going strong - and have thrown them in the dishwasher too.
