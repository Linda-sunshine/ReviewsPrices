review/summary: Its pretty big!review/text: I bought this product along with a espresso machine that actually came with one ( I didn't know that at the time) but, This tamper is pretty big to me! Its probably the normal size one (50 MM) Just kinda big ( thick wise) AND its stainless steel! ALWAYS a plus when working with coffee!
