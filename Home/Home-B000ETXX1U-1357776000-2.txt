review/summary: Doesn't hold airreview/text: I was very excited to get this bed because of all the great reviews. I got it for my mother in law so she could have a nice bed while she visited for the holidays. And while it looked nice and the pump seemed to work well, we discovered my mother in law nearly on the floor in the morning. She said she didn't feel it losing air, but every morning she woke up, the mattress had lost nearly half of its air.We continued to inflate it to its maximum level, and never discovered any leaks...we were ultimately discouraged and had to send it back. Maybe it was just a lemon, but it didn't hold up under weight of an average to smaller sized woman.
