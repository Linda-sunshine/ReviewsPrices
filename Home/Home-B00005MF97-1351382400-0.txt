review/summary: Food Chopper So Simple to Operatereview/text: For years I have tried using the choppers that you must figure out just how to get the top screwed on or it will not work. I gave up on them when I turned 60 and gave mine away. I still wanted something to chop onions. I searched for a better chopper, saw this on Amazon, then read the reviews. I am very satisfied with the purchase. This chopper is so simple to operate, my husband and I both love it ! You just add the ingredients to chop, plug in the top with the motor, and then place it on top of the base. There is no turning to lock in place or anything. I just used it to shred some cheese and it did a perfect job. Clean up is easy, too. And I love the lid used for any excess items you want to store in the refrigerator. It is just a great item. It is great for today's economy, since shredding your own cheese can save you some money. I would give it more than 10 stars if I could.
