review/summary: Temporary effect for odorsreview/text: Good circulation and large filter area. If you are in the room, turn down the fan speed to reduce the white noise, that's fair enough. No vibration or other sounds. Odor reduction in the basement seemed to last only a short while I assume the charcoal filter treatment wore off. Good value and sturdy.
