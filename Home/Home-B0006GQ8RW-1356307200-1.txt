review/summary: Changing to another systemreview/text: Although I have used these filters successfully for several years, the most recent supply last only 2-3 weeks before completely clogging. I have always followed the instructions to a T. But, when I contacted Brita "No Customer Service," the reply I received indicated I must have not installed them correctly. After reading through the many low ratings on Amazon, and reading on line about many other problems, it's obvious that Brita refuses to admit they ever have a problem of any kind. Disgusting! Switching to another system.
