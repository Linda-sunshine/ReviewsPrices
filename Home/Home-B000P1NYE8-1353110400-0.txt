review/summary: Do not trust accuracyreview/text: Very cheaply made and questionable regarding the accuracy of the scale. I intended to use it for weighing gold and other precious goods. The scale will certainly fit into your pocke. Looking at the price of the scale, I should have known the quality of this product would be inferior. The seller does have a large variety of other scales that I'm sure are of higher quaility. The seller was very prompt in delivering my order and processing my return.
