review/summary: Cuisinart DLC-10S Pro Classic 7-Cup Food Processorreview/text: This piece of equipment is a must have for my kitchen - I use it a lot. I had one before (25 years) and the motor was still fine. The bowl, however, had long since seen better days. Since the unit was so old, I was not able to get a replacement. Unfortunately, since I could not get a replacement, I was required to purchase a new one. Sigh. New is nice.
