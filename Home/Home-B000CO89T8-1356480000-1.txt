review/summary: Heats up perfectlyreview/text: This product actually does the job. I was a bit afraid of my cup's bottom shape as it was about 40% of the heating diameter of this unit thinking it was not going to transmit heat enough to keep my coffee warm but, it actually did the job very well. My coffee stays not only warm, it actually heats it up for as long as I have it on. I've sipped through my coffee for about an hour and up to the last one I get hot coffee. Great product.
