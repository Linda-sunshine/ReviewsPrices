review/summary: Great low-maintenance coffee makerreview/text: It's no replacement for the local barista, but this is an economical way to drink espresso at home.I haven't had any technical issues with it regarding cleaning or use, but I will update this review if that changes. It is as easy to use as pour-over cones and slightly less maintenance than a French press.It requires a gas burner that can stay on at a low setting.
