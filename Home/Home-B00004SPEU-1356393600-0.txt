review/summary: great coffee grinder!!!review/text: I had just bought this for a christmas present for my father along with some gevalia whole bean, and it grinds i'd say about one pot in under 10 seconds! I have not yet tried it with spices yet but seems good to do so. You can brew fresher coffee with this thing and i'd really recomend to a coffee enthusiast
