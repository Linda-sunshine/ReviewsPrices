review/summary: Works Great. No Overflowsreview/text: I have been using this coffee pot everyday for 7 months and have had no issues with it. No overflows.Regarding complaints about the carafe. I have yet to see any insulated carafe that pours like a none insulated. If they could improve on this, I would be very happy.Because of the overflow complainants. I placed the coffee pot in a large pan for the first month I used it just in case it did overflow. It never happened.If you are looking for a large capacity coffee pot with an insulated carafe. This is for you.
