review/summary: AWESOMEreview/text: IF YOU LIKE TO EAT A BIG BREAKFAST THIS IS A MUST. WE ARE A FOUR PERSON FAMILY, TWO TEEN BOYS ,MY SELF AND MOMMA. WHEN WE EAT A BREAKFAST WE USUALLY USE 12 EEGS, FULL PACK OF BACON OR SAUSAGES AND 12 PANCAKES. BEFOR PURCHASE WE NEEDED ONE NORMAL GRIDDLE AND TWO FRYING PANS! NOW THE BIG GRIDDLE AND ONE PAN DOES THE JOB. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
