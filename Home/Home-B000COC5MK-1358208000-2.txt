review/summary: The noisy beastreview/text: Works like it should. Takes roughly 20 seconds to take a cork off then remove it. Appreciate the stand and the LED lights. One thing to know is that the motor running inside it is loud because of the gears. Just don't show it off in silence because it sounds painful lol. Other than that it ships with no box, just a cardboard holder. It also smelled funky when I got it but that's what you get with an open package. Still a great product and great if you have arthritis.
