review/summary: Miss my oval pressure cookerreview/text: This one seems more complicated to me and I haven't used it yet because the instructions are difficult. Secondly I really miss the cooking surface my previous oval pressure cooker had which allowed for more room especially for browning roast or chicken. I guess this is adequate I bought it because of the reviews but really not happy with it.Yvette from NYC
