review/summary: Keurig b60 brewing systemreview/text: I got this Keurig for christmas even though i told everyone that i absolutley did not want one. I sure am glad no one listend to me. I love my coffee, I drink my coffee black so i like it to taste really good. well normal pot coffee doesnt even have anything on this. Even though you will not get that nice aroma that fills up the house with fresh coffee it sure does taste a lot better. I would not say that it makes a coffee like a french press though but it is pretty close.Make sure you clean this. You wouldnt keep using any other coffee machine without cleaning it right? all you have to do is press the brew button and let some hot water run through into a cup...pretty easy.this on is also nice becase it has three different setting for how big of a cup you want and you can also set the brewing temp. It does not take long at all for the water to heat up either. great productPros-Fasttaste greatdifferent size cupseasy to cleancan use big cups as welleasycons-no great aroma that a standard coffee make can give youkind of on the expensive side.. not just for the system its self but for the k cup...know that before you buy one and the complain about how much stuff cost for itI also do have the make ur own k cup thing...Put ur own coffee in it...save some money...taste great and works great.
