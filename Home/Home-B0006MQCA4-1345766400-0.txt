review/summary: Works for me!review/text: I've only had it a week but I'm enjoying the great tasting water. It's the perfect size for the fridge and not too heavy when full. I checked with my city first to make sure our water isn't fluoridated as this filter does not remove fluoride. No leakage anywhere.
