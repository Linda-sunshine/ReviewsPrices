review/summary: This Borne Mandoline works BETTER than the OXO or CUISINART or BRAUNreview/text: My husband purchased me a CuisinArt Mandoline for Christmas.I was so anxious to use it, so I tried to slice cucumbers & tomatoes. It squiched the veggies.So I went and exchanged it for the upper end CuisinArt model. It squished the veggies.Next I exchanged it for the OXO. Again, it squished the veggies.Next I exchanged it for the Braun. Again, it squished the veggies.FINALLY, I found this complete set of SwissMar Borne Mandoline & blades, at a "Good Will" store for $5 and it works BETTER than the OXO or CuisinArt or Braun!!
