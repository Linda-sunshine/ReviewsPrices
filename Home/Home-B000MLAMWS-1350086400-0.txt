review/summary: Sad sad sadreview/text: How could I possibly rate this product. Arrived without a power plug and not wired to be used in Australia. What a real fizzer this turned out to be. My husband and I were soooooo looking forward to receiving this amazing machine. Huge plans for lots of baking and experimenting with it only to be sorely disappointed. Why on earth would any company supply a machine that is not compatible with the electrical systems of the country it was being sent to.Hard lesson learned never shop outside of Australia. Cheap may not always be what it seems. :(
