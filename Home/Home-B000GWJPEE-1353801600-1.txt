review/summary: Penguin cool mist humidifierreview/text: I love this! it is sooo much quieter than our old 'spaceship looking' humidifier. As for the mist output; Impressive! Fill it up and an adjustable strength jet of cool mist is produced and can last all night. THe tranclucent sides are a plus for monitoring water levels. Also neat is that the'head' can direct the mist stream in any direction in 180 degrees.
