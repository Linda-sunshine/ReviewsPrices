review/summary: Almost perfect vacuum for hardwoodsreview/text: This stick vacuum cleaner is almost perfect for laminate or hardwood floors (I have never tried this vacuum cleaner on carpets). The large wheels on the bottom make navigation effortless, and the vacuum's 7 amp motor is very powerful. Disposing of dirt is very easy and mess-free, and the clear container lets you know when the vacuum cleaner is getting full. There are filters on the vacuum, but it is bagless (I like this, no need to keep buying bags). The vacuum cleaner is not very heavy (the vacuum is a little "top heavy," but the wheels on the bottom are large and make pushing the vacuum cleaner around very easy). This Hoover sucks up everything I put in front of it. The only major drawback is that the cord is a meager 20 feet, but I just attach an extension cord to the vacuum's cord and problem solved. The top hook also drops down for quick release of a rolled up cord-good thinking Hoover!
