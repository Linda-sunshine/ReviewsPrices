review/summary: Not as durable as I hopedreview/text: I have used this processor for 3 years with moderate use. Unfortunately, the small plastic parts on the bowl and top that have to engage broke after two years. Now I have to manually hold the top down for it to work. Replacement pars are too expensive to be a good investment. Enjoyed it immensely other than that. The engineers really should have made parts out of something than plastic.
