review/summary: Great little addition to the housereview/text: Although store bought ice cream will be much cheaper by volume, this little piece of technology offers you the opportunity to make custom home made ice cream. I've used it to make at least a dozen recipes thus far and I have not had an issue yet.Free the canister the day before you plan on using it. I let the machine run for 30-35 minutes as opposed to the 20-25 recommended for a harder ice cream. You'll get soft serve level ice cream if you just do 20-25. You'll still need to freeze the ice cream if you want it to be a little firmer but the extra time gets the ice cream a little more thicker, so you can enjoy some before throwing the finished product in the freezer.Quick and easy to clean by hand. I don't think it's dishwasher worthy and wouldn't recommend it anyway.Be sure to pick up some books on recipes as well or cruise the web.I haven't made any sorbet yet but I'm sure it's quality will be just as good as the ice cream this little machine creates. Great buy if you ask me!!!
