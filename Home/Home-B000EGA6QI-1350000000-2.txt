review/summary: awesome product!review/text: I've only used it a couple of times, but it works and cleans up magnificently. I made a smoothie with frozen fruit, and it cut through it like magic :) I really love that it comes apart so you can easily clean it without worrying about getting soap and water in the electronics. AND, I love the dark purple color!!
