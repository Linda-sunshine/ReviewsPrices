review/summary: Wish I had my old vacuum back...review/text: My old Samsung had a pretty short cord, which drove me a bit crazy, but otherwise it was a great, lightweight, easy to use vacuum cleaner. This Hoover Tempo has a long cord, is fairly lightweight and the bag-changing is easy. But... it doesn't work well on all of my rugs. I have a couple thick ones, and it works pretty well on those, but on the area rugs with low pile it sucks the rug up and makes it very hard to push the vacuum across the rug. I get a work out every time I clean my house. The manual adjustment is easy to use but feels cheesy, as if it will break off soon. I have tried every height adjustment on my thinner area rugs, none of them work. Another pet peeve -the cord wrap design defies logic - really awkward and the person who designed it should be hung by his/her thumbs.
