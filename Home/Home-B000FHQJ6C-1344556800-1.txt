review/summary: Extremely Loudreview/text: I read many reviews and decided that the many 5-star reviews were sufficient enough to ignore the many 1- and 2-star reviews. I'm returning this. It is extremely loud and because the vent doesn't have a screen to cover it, I'll be scraping kale pulp off of every surface on my kitchen for the foreseeable future.
