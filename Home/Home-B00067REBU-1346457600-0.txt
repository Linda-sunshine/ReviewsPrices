review/summary: When the drive belt breaks you have to junk the breadmakerreview/text: I used this breadmaker for four years without problems. Then the drive belt snapped. I wrote to Sunbeam asking for a replacemnt. Their answer was:"The belt is not a replaceable part for this model".So now I cannot fix my breadmaker and I have to junk it.
