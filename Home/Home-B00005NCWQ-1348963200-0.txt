review/summary: Owned it for 7 years - it is still workingreview/text: It's a good story. I bought this from Amazon in Sept. 2005 out of the frustration my Krups coffee maker Glass Carafe was broken by family member who carelessly washed it and banged it against the porcelain sink and I ended up with lots of glass shards in the sink.This percolator cost me one dollar less than the $19 replacement glass carafe that I bought at the same time, and has paid for itself many times over by the #4 paper filter I stop buying for 7 years hence. There is something heartwarming in the coffee made from this percolator, just like a beloved thick wool blanket that kept you warm in the cold winter morning.The coffee made is piping hot just like the ones delivered to you at your favorite NJ Diner, and it stays hot in the percolator for over 2 hours if you brew a full pot. It is as fashionable as it needs to be, as it doesn't look out of place on the set of Mad Men when Mr. Draper really needs a mug of coffee, and we know he needs coffee quite often.Yes, it has minor flaws, you won't be able to get the last few drops out of it; the inward-curl on the top makes rinsing out last few specks of coffee grounds difficult, and everyone dislike the corner cutting of the plastic percolator top; but none of us are perfect, either. We live with it, knowing we can count on a nice pot of coffee, day after day, and for some of us, way past middle age in dog years. When we stumble and accidentally bang the percolator against the counter because we are not quite caffeinated yet, it rings out with a CLANG, and tells you in protest it just saved you another $20 in a new glass replacement carafe.It hasn't changed, except when the bean counters forced it to change, but we don't change, either. It works, and asks nothing except a good scrubbing with steel wool when the coffee stain inside starts to bothers you too much. It is a good friend, and I think I'll keep it.
