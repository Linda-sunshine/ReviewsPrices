review/summary: The most irritating pressure cooker EVER!!review/text: I hate it when it defaults to keep warm. I was told by an AEG rep that I was overfilling it. Well its pretty useless, I am lucky if it stays on longer enough to build up pressure. The manual says it happens when it is too hot after saut&eacute;ing, but this is a load of rubbish. I would definitely NOT recommend buying this appliance it will drive you crazy.
