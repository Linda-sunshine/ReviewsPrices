review/summary: Excellentreview/text: This is probably the best, most versatile kitchen appliance I've ever purchased. My wife & I use it quite frequently and it has never skipped a beat. I think it will last forever. I look forward to buying some of the myriad attachments when I can afford them. Watch for price breaks and buy when the deals are best. You can't get a better mixer IMHO.
