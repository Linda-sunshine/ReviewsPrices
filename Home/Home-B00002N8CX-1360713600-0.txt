review/summary: Amazing vacuum for hard floorsreview/text: This is a great vacuum for hard floors (hardwood, tile, vinyl, etc.) It has no rotating brushes on the vacuum head to scratch or damage these types of floors ... or send the sand flying all around which is what a regular vacuum does. This was the model that a housekeeper I hired used, so I assumed that was recommendation enough for me and I'm very pleased with how well it works. It is easy to use, very powerful, has nice onboard accessories and is so much better than a broom or dry mop. Goes under the bed and furniture easily. I've also used it on area rugs, which is nice. It has adjustable suction to enable this. I've used it on the carpeted stairs, and while it's only OK for them, it's better than bringing out a second carpet vacuum with the rotating brushes. If you have a lot of hard floor surfaces like me, buy it. You will not be disappointed.
