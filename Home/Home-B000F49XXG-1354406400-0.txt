review/summary: Its greatreview/text: The product does get a little loud when you start to make the espresso, but it quiets down after it starts to brew. At first when I started using it, it took so much force to get it into place before brewing, but as I've had it for a while its easy as pie. The cleaning method is amazing. Last machine I had didn't have that option.
