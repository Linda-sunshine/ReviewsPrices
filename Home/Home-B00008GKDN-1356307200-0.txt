review/summary: Not very impressedreview/text: I regularly make pancakes and thought buying an iron griddle would be a good addition to the kitchen as I am trying to reduce the non-stick cookware at home. The quality of the product is very good and just the right size, but the pancakes don't come out that well..they get stuck to the surface and don't come out that easy. I have tried different ways of doing it, but it doesn't seem to work. I was pretty disappointed at the buy..
