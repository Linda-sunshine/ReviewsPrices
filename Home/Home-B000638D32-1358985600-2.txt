review/summary: great knife, especially for the pricereview/text: I've had it for a few months and steeled it about a half-dozen times. It's starting to dull, and it would be nice if it held sharpness a bit longer. Still, it's better than most of the other knives I've had that cost a bit more. Granted, I've never owned a fancy knife that cost more than about $50, but this makes me happy otherwise.
