review/summary: Ok to start with...review/text: We have had 3 of these machines. The first one was wonderful and lasted for over a year. The second one was OK however played out after less than a year. Got the 3rd one and not even 3 months later the pump is going. Soooo on to the Nespesso which is a bit more pricey however the reviews are excellent and to be honest with you we are done with this brand. I feel we gave it ample chances and are moving on.
