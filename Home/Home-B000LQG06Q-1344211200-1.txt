review/summary: This baby saved my poor hip bones!review/text: I purchased a very inexpensive mattress for a new bed from Ikea... it's great and very firm, but there is ZERO plush on top to offset the firmness for side sleepers. So I was having trouble sleeping on my side. My hips and shoulders were getting uncomfortable as were my knees.I found this on Amazon and purchased based on other's reviews. This foam topper SAVED MY LIFE. Well, my body. It is a solid two inches of memory foam, very comfortable, very dense. I have a whole new bed now... I used to dread getting in bed and now I look forward to it.As for the reviewers who indicated there is a smell... it is EXACTLY the same as mint chocolate chip ice cream. I only smelled that when I took it out of the packaging. Once I put it under my mattress pad, I never smelled it again. Kind of disappointed. :)Pros:Substantial (pretty heavy, but manageable for one person!), two solid inches of thickness, offers fantastic support and comfort. I'm going to put the slight mint chocolate chip odor as a pro because I like that smell.Cons:There were little bits and pieces of foam when you unpack it, but again, I am stretching to find a con here.
