review/summary: Great juicer!review/text: I chose this juicer because I have very limited space in my kitchen. The size is just right, and it's a very efficient juicer! Very fun to use, and it has successfully juiced citrus, carrots, and all manner of difficult fruits and veggies. I have no complaints! Also, very easy to clean.
