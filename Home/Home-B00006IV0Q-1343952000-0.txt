review/summary: BEST COFFEEMAKER ON THE PLANET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!review/text: DO NOT LISTEN TO "COFFEE SNOB'S" WHO SAY PERCOLATORS ARE THE WORST WAY TO MAKE COFFEE.Ridiculous. They absolutely do not know what they are talking about and have most likely never even used one. PERCOLATORS DO NOT BOIL THE COFFEE! Ignore that accusation because that is what they base their so called knowledge on.This percolator is awesome, makes fabulous coffee that you can make as strong or as weak as you like, makes it PIPING HOT, and keeps it that way for as long as you want it to. Yes if you leave it plugged in for hours the coffee will start to taste "cooked", but I find that 1 or two hours later it still tastes great to me and everyone else who tries it!Plus, it is elegant and just looks gorgeous sitting there on the counter. You will impress your friends with this thing because most people today are unfamiliar with percolators and when they experience one for the first time they will probably want one too!Yeah...even you coffee snob friends will like it!
