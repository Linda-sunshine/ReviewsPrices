review/summary: Great for the price!review/text: I love this little thing!I live by myself in a 1BR apartment. I don't have a ton of space in the kitchen and I'm usually brewing coffee for one or two people. I used to use a french press, but it got too messy for me. With this, I can just pour in my coffee and water - press on and finish getting ready for the day. When I'm ready to leave, I just pour a cup of coffee, turn the coffee maker off, and I'm on my way. I researched a ton of coffee makers and this one is definitely the best for the price. Haven't had any issues with it so far. Will update if anything breaks, but it's going strong for now!
