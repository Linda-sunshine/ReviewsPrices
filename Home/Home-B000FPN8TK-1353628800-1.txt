review/summary: Best thing I have ever purchased on Amazonreview/text: I have purchased a lot of stuff on Amazon. The Ingenuitea is the best item I have ever purchased from Amazon, hands-down. Let me tell you why.1. I drink a lot of tea, but my passion is great coffee. I live alone, and making a great single cup of coffee is challenging. The Ingenuitea does both, and does them extremely well.2. I have used this every day for the last 15 months - sometimes multiple times per day. The only time I don't use it is if I'm traveling. It still works just like it did on day one.3. It's really easy to clean. The entire thing comes apart (every piece!) so it can be thoroughly cleaned every few days/weeks. I have found that coffee in particular can turn some of the rubber brown after several uses. After breaking it down and giving it a weak Clorox bath, though, it is just as clean and shiny as day one again. It is also dishwasher safe, but I do recommend removing the little strainer because it will pick up a lot of food particles from the dishwasher.4. It consistently makes a great cup of tea or coffee.There's not a lot more I can say. It is well built, it lasts, it's easy to clean, and it does what it is supposed to do. If someone offered to trade me a full sized Barista machine for this, I would say no. I love this device, and I think you will, too. Buy one today, and buy another as a present for a friend. You won't be disappointed.
