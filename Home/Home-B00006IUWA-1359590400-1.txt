review/summary: PERFECT!review/text: Unbelievable machine! Does exactly what it says. An absolute no-brainer. Easy operation. The price, in my opinion, is too low. For the quality of this machine it's well worth over $100. For the $20+ there is nothing to dispute here. It fits snugged away on the counter and the cord is a bit short but it's fine to hide. I just bought the 12 lbs of kernels cause I know this machine is going to be put to use, daily. :-)
