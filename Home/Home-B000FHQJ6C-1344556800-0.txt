review/summary: Great for pricereview/text: Great juicer for the price. Yes I'm sure you get more juice from one of the higher end machines if you want to spend the money. Nice wide mouth easy to insert fruits and vegetables and easy to clean with brush included if you clean it right after use.Three months later this thing has completely burned up making apple juice. Inside plastic melted to motor. Too ate to return to amazon but gonna try to getmy money back directly from Hamilton beach.
