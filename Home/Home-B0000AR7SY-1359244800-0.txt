review/summary: Great little coffee mill for the moneyreview/text: unit arrived on time, it was well packaged and was as described. This coffee mill is very easy to use and is much quieter than my old impact blade grinder. It has a wide range of grinding settings so it can keep most users happy.I am using a course grind setting for a french press and I am very happy with the results. I have only had the press for 6 weeks now but I would buy this unit again.
