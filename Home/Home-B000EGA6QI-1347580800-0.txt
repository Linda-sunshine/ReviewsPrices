review/summary: Broke after 2 momthsreview/text: The unit broke after two months of normal use. Perhaps it was geared wrong, or the rest of the parts couldn't handle the 200-watt motor. It was past the amazon return window, and when I called Cuisinart they were remarkably unhelpful. Had to throw it away. I'll buy a different brand next time.
