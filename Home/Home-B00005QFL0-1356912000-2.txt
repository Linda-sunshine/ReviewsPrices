review/summary: Great machinereview/text: This bread machine is very easy to use and makes great bread. French bread does come out wonderful too - cracking sounds included! It takes long to bake a loaf as there is a resting period up front but the rapid bake function without the rest time works well too. The recipe book that comes with the machine is good - rolls are great. I've also used this machine to make a pizza dough using my own recipe not the one came with the machine, and it did well.
