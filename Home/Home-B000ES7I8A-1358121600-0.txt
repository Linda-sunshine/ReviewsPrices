review/summary: the good and the badreview/text: I've had this teapot for 3 months now - I was very happy with the insulated sides and general ease of use. However, while most of the teapot seems incredibly sturdy and well made, there are two tiny little plastic nibs that move in and out to allow you to open and close the lid of the pot. While seemingly tiny and insignificant, the teapot becomes much less useful when the little nibs get stuck inside the walls of the pot. The lid will no longer stay closed, and the teapot will no longer shut off on its own when it's finished boiling - never mind that there is steam and heat escaping all over the place.I've found that I can use my fingernail to flick down and get them to pop out again, but it's been a few days of this and I'm tired of it. With such a well made product, why would they include such a flimsy lid closure? Fix that and the pot gets 5 stars.
