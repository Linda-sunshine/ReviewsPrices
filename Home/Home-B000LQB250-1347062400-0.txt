review/summary: My son is very happy - updatereview/text: Got it for my son going to college. His feedback was that he is got a very comfortable bed and people are just stopping by to sit on his bed. The only thing about it is that extra long was still just a bit short of the full length of the dorm's bed. But it is not really a big issue.Update: Since my son was happy with the purchase, we decided to get one for us in queen size. Well second purchase was not as successful and we had to return it.1) My wife had severe allergy to it the first night we tried it even though I aired it for over a day.2) I can not be 100% sure, but I think the one we received was slightly different than one we got for my son. Seemed somehow to have a softer feel. But since he is in college and we are here I can't do side by side comparison.Amazon had no problem accepting returns though. But in any case dropping to 4 stars based on our queen model.
