review/summary: How did I get by without an electric kettle?review/text: So quick! So easy!I use this mainly for making coffee with my AeroPress, but it's great for tea, oatmeal, etc.I love the way the induction heating works. The heating element is not hot to touch and the base of the pot will not damage your counter surface.Only downsides, it's another device sitting on the counter... it's shiny stainless (so it shows if you don't keep it polished/clean)... and it heats to one temp (boiling)
