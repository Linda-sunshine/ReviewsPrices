review/summary: Lifesaver!review/text: So it turns out I'm allergic to my girlfriend's pet rats. When she moved in with me into a small apartment, I could barely breathe. I had to hide in the bedroom with the door toweled and the window open with the rats on the other side of the apartment. I frantically looked for a hepa filter and ordered this one--it showed up while I was at work, my girlfriend set it up, and by the time I got home I could breathe again. It's been over a month and so far, so good.
