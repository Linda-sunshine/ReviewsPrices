review/summary: I was only a bit hesitant to order this style of BUNN, because I had read that it was for use in &#34;high altitudes&#34;,review/text: but it works fine for anyone. I'm so glad I bought it. I have used BUNN coffee makers for many years, & I guess I'm a bit spoiled. Nothing else will do.
