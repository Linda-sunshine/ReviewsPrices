review/summary: Breaks under normal usereview/text: After about 3 months, this product sprung a leak between the water chamber and the on/off switch. This shouldn't even be physically possible in a well designed product. My advice is spend the extra $10 and buy a kettle that actually works properly and doesn't carry an electrical shock risk
