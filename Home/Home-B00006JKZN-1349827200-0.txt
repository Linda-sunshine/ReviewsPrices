review/summary: Poor control knob, me tooreview/text: Waffles are every Sunday night tradition. Well over 30 years. Used this model for about 5 years until knob fell off, connection melted. Delighted when new one came 3 months ago. After a week the lever "waffled" between 3 numbers. I usually try to set a highest 5. At 5, waffles were medium at best.Town wide power line problems led me to blame low voltage, but persists.Now green/red cycles at least 4 times while I wait for steam to cease. At first "done" signal batter is still runny. I will take apart and see if I can override, or toss it.Reading other comments seems I am hardly alone. SHAME on Cusinart. I love their coffee maker and deep fry.
