review/summary: iTouch vs. Nine Starsreview/text: Quick Summary:* Solid price/value touchless garbage can* Similar overall dimensions to Nine Stars but narrow and thus extends farther back* Contains odor control panel in lid unlike Nine StarsDetailed Review:The two most popular touchless garbage cans on Amazon appear to be this iTouch and the competingNine Stars DZT-50-9 Infrared Touchless Stainless Steel Trash Can, 13.2-Gallon. I actually bought the Nine Stars first and have had it a few years longer and have had the iTouch for about a year.In reality, unless you're very picky, I'd say both products are solid, have performed without issue, and are much cheaper than the products sold by simpleHuman at Bed, Bath, and Beyond.Differences I've noted:1) The iTouch includes a deodorizer tray area on the lid that helps with odors. I wouldn't say it's dramatic but Nine Stars does not have this feature.2) The lid of the iTouch is slightly tighter than the Nine Stars and fits snug. I do think this helps with odor leakage.3) The iTouch is more slim in profile looked at face on while the Nine Stars is broad. Depending on the space you plan to put it in, one may fit better than the otehr.4) Both take D cell batteries and battery life appears to be similar on both.5) I've had no issues putting standard garbage bags on both and in terms of function of the touchless feature.Both are good buys and I'd say the iTouch may be slightly better due to the fit and odor panel. Of note, both are a light aluminum metal material so neither is as heavy as the simpleHuman products but function the same.
