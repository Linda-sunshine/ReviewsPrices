review/summary: Booger Reducer!review/text: I'm not a air purifier expert or anything. I bought this because of the price and the fact that the filter is "Permanent". The intention was to use it in our kitchen during a remodeling project but my wife didn't like the sound it makes so I put it in my home office. I am pretty sure that it works because I don't need to blow my nose much during the day when the machine is running. It can be loud but doesn't annoy me too much because it is a constant white noise. I turn it to low or off during conference calls because the sound can be picked up by the phone.I would recommend this purifier to use as a litmus test to see if you will really want one since it's fairly inexpensive for what you get. Hope this helps someone.
