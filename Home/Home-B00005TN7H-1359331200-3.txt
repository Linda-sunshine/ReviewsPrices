review/summary: FoodSaver Saves Dollars!review/text: I have had a FoodSaver for years, and NEVER used the jar sealer,until this week. In one morning: walnuts, pecans, almonds, beer can chicken spice rub,dry noodles, and lettuce! Washed and spun one head of romaine; and have 3 quarts readyfor the next 10 days. Yes, it keeps!And I am only just a beginner! I also purchased the regular mouth sealer but give it a thumbs down.I could not get it to seal.
