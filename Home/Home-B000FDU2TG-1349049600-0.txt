review/summary: Works great even after a year.review/text: Writing a bit of a late review, but I've had this blender for over a year now and still feel as though it was a great purchase.Pros:Works well for all tasks even ice crushing. I use this often to make "smoothies" using just fruit or fruit juice and ice and I always crush the ice into a fine powder first when I use the juice, or after pureeing the fruit if I'm using fresh fruit. Either method works well and I've noticed no drop in quality since my purchase in April of 2011.Durable. Aside from one blade getting bent slightly from a dropped spoon, and an occasional bit of extra cleaning on the bottom (see cons) no problem with the unit.Easy to clean. The buttons are all on a pad so there's no area for liquids to fall into the buttons, makes it easy to clean off with just a wipe of the towel.Cons:After several uses you'll begin to notice a rim around the inside of the bottom of the clear blender jar. It always appears to be dark and is possibly caused by rubbing but nothing appears to rub off either the stand or jar. While I don't know what causes it, it's easy to clean off with a finger or sponge and has no impact upon performance that I can tell.
