review/summary: great for brewed iced tea!review/text: i wanted something to use to brew iced tea with- and this was a great buy! the hermetic lid , albeit plastic, is really cool and does a great job of sealing the jug air tight (not at all difficult to use). the jug is glass and is very durable (about a qt and a half). i love bormioli rocco products as they never disappoint with quality!
