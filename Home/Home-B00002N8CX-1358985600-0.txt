review/summary: Great Workout Partnerreview/text: This vacuum has a lot of power for being so small. The noise level is akin to a baby crying on an airplane, so wear some noise cancelling headphones or some earplugs while you clean. The vacuum does a remarkable job of picking up small particles, dust, and even larger/heavier items on the floor. It has many attachments, many of which I don't use, but as for the one pictured (the long extension arm with the roller head in the front) it rolls/sucks great! I have 900 sq. ft. of wood flooring in my apartment which I clean about once a week and I haven't had an issue with this product since I purchased it 6 months ago. You will work up a sweat, however, while you clean since it's manual. This vacuum uses a bag, and it's very easy to pull out and install a new one. I highly recommend this item for it's utility, but I'm downgrading one star based on the noise factor.
