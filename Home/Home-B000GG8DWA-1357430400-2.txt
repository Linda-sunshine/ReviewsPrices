review/summary: Second Winter Great Unitreview/text: I've now used this going into our second winter. Great unit. I typically have it sitting 4-5ft back from where I am sitting in the living room with the central heat off. I normally use the low (400watt) setting and it works perfectly.The cats love it too.... getting &#34;extreamely close to it&#34;... I put an example in the image library.The only modification that I've done is take a black sharpie and mark on the outside of the dial the OFF and two 400watt setting notches and put a line where the setting line is. Much easier to see what you are setting it too instead of trying to read the dial settings which are on the knob facing away from the unit.
