review/summary: exactly what i wanted!review/text: I wanted a large, glass pitcher to make iced tea and iced coffee. I searched all over but didn't find anything that was shock resistant. This jug had excellent reviews but someone said it broke when they put hot liquids in it. But the product description did say it was shock resistant so I ordered it. I LOVE it! When I make tea or coffee I let it cool for 5 minutes and then pour it in the pitcher. I never pour hot liquids in it if it has recently been in the fridge or is has had something cold in it. Just don't be dumb about it and it won't break. The lid is super easy to seal on. No idea what these other people are talking about. I highly recommend this pitcher. It keeps things very cold, easy to clean, and is perfect for making big batches of iced tea or coffee.
