review/summary: i seen it as a bait and switch!!.review/text: i was going to order a white one but liked the denim one better, but didnt notice the 30 dollar diference, till it was to late, then i tried to cancle it the next day, but they gave me no option, but it was a done deal, that it had been shipped , so i checked on it threw fed-x, no such order !!!! that was just the first lie. then it took 10 days to get here, i live in chattanooga ten, 5 miles from a million sq foot facility, and then found out they shipped it from a third party in the state of washington. so they also gave out my credit card number , i wont do bussines with them again , for 5 yrs, thats there fiscal punishment for the lies and deset. i buy a lot, im retired, and have time to look for a good deal, BUT will only deal with honest company's.i tried to reason with them for several day's. over a chair they will lose about, 150.000 dollars in sales over a 5 yr period. probally even more having 2 new grandchildren, if i wouldnt get in trouble i would of took it out to there entrance and burned it, and bought one at wal mart.
