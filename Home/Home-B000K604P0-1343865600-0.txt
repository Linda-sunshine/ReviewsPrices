review/summary: Best Bottle /travel Mug Aroundreview/text: I currently own about 12-15 travel bottles of all makes and models, in a continuing search for something that will keep my coffee hot and drinks cold for hours. They all fail to do what I expect. I was given a Thermos Nissan JMW500P6 (TN for short)as a present and found that it surpassed all the others by far. Unfortunately, it was lost and I bought another from Amazon, equally as good. I have made hot coffee at 8am, put it in the TN and at 1pm it was still as hot as it was when it first went in. For experimental reasons, I tried it at 8pm (12 hours vs. the advertising 8hrs)to find it still hot enough to drink, not warm but hot. I have tried cold beverages too and found that it kept them cold longer than their advertising says to expect. (One thing I do is to preheat or cool the TN before putting the "real" liquid in it.)I've not had leaks in either one, you just have to make sure that the lid is snug and not overfilled. Never had a spill of any kind. It has held up under some rather adverse conditions. The lip is interesting, and I thought it might be a problem but it works better than any of my other bottles and never drips around my mouth. In my experience it also holds more that the other 16 oz. bottles I have. I haven't actually measured its capacity though, probably around 17-18 OZ. It also cleans as easy or easier than my other bottles too. In my experience this is an unbeatable bottle for both hot and cold liquids.One addition: I measured the content of the bottle and it measured 16 oz exactly, which means all my other bottles contain around 14-15 OZ. I want to emphasize that I had some leaking when I filled above the bottle lip inside and also if I didn't close the top snugly. I've had no more leaks since finding this out.
