review/summary: Great Grinderreview/text: I had one of these years ago but when my roommate moved he took it with him. I don't use it for coffee but I do use it to grind nuts and chocolate and it works great. I love sprinkling the mixture over brownies or a cake prior to baking instead of using frosting.
