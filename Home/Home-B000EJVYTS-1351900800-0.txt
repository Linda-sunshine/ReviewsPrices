review/summary: Loved it but then became crazy!review/text: Length:: 0:17 MinsLoved it until it turned crazy on us. We used it for about four months before it started acting weird. Last night it started doing this (watch video). Contacted support and learned that it may be due to moisture. We'll try taking the steps they recommended. If it works properly after that, I'll change my review.
