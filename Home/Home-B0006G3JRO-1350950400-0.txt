review/summary: Not quite What I hopedreview/text: So far I have not had occasion to use this blender for mashing potatoes or beans, so can't speak to that. The whisk will beat eggs, but needs a deeper container than the little flask, or use the covered chopper and blade. It did a good job chopping nuts. Cleaning the blender was easy, the splashed egg took longer.
