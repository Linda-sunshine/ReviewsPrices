review/summary: Uncanny ....review/text: I had a down-filled mattress topper for years and loved it. But a desk job, combined with night classes, meant that I spend about 14 hours a day in a chair, and the feather topper wasn't doing it for my back anymore. After I got the memory foam topper, I'm able to sleep through the night without waking up or tossing, and it's helped with the muscle tension in my back as well.My topper did arrive smelling very strongly of some green tea/lavender combination, which wasn't unpleasant but was very strong. It went away after a week.
