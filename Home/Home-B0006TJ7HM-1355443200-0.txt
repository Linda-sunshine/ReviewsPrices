review/summary: Job Well Donereview/text: I received these items exactly 1 day after placing my order and using &#34;free shipping&#34;. They arrived in a sturdy box, all knives were wrapped in plastic and sealed, blades were sheathed and underneath the sheath was a tip cover...Safety first, well done company. They all fit perfectly, haven't tested em' yet, but they look pretty on my counter.
