review/summary: I love this product!review/text: I have moderate to severe allergies so a vacuum with a heppa filter sounded great. The first time I used this vacuum it was on my new apartment carpet that looked clean, but a once over with this vacuum picked up quite a lot of dust! This Vacuum will pick up anything and does not spit back out any dust or debris. Emptying and cleaning this product is very user friendly, fast, and easy. Certainly an excellent buy especially for the price!
