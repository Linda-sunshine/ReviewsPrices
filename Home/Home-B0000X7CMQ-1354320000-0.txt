review/summary: 2 strikes and you are outreview/text: This seemed to be the only coffee maker I could find with a cone filter and thermal carafe. Bought it and loved it until it died 16 months later. So I bought another one since everybody can have quality control issues. The second one died after 8 months. I won't buy a third - sorry guys; somebody else can have my money.
