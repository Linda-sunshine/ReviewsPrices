review/summary: Great for making hummus, super time-saver!review/text: I've had this chopper for over 8 years, and it still works perfectly! Makes amazing hummus, chops onions, veggies, herbs, nuts, chocolate-everything I need, without taking up the space of a huge processor (I had one but returned it, as I never used it). I bought one for my mother, and she uses hers just as much. Easy to clean-you CAN wash the top part, just soap the underside and rinse quickly, dry it right side up, never had a problem. I use it at least 3x a week for something. Highly recommend-great product at a great price! This would be a perfect gift for anyone who cooks or bakes. LOVE THIS CHOPPER!!!
