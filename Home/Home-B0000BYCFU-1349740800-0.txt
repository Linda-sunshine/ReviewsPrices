review/summary: Why did I wait so Long?review/text: I have been water bath canning food for nearly thirty years and have always been shy of pressure canning. Recently made the decision to order this caner and give it a try... what I discovered was that I cannot believe I waited thirty years to begin pressure canning! Why did I wait so long as I have used a pressure cooker for preparing food since becoming a new bride at 17 years old! I grew up watching my mother cook with a pressure cooker but for some reason was reluctant to use a pressure caner.This caner worked absolutely wonderful and the capacity of jars it can process is much more than I ever expected! If you have feared pressure canning, fear no more because the directions are well explained and easy to understand. As long as you respect this cooking tool for what it is and how it works, you should never have a problem. I love this caner!
