review/summary: Nonstick and very good qualityreview/text: This is a nice, solid heavy pan. Works great and I think it's better quality than Calphalon. The handle has a hard rubber coating that I was concerned about for when I put the pan under the broiler for a few minutes to brown my quiches but it's no problem, doesn't melt.
