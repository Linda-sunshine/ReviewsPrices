review/summary: still works wellreview/text: We've had this (I can't tell if it's exactly the same model, but it looks like it) for 5 years and it still works perfectly. It's steel! Yay! It has plastic parts, but the water containing/heating part is steel. I looked inside and it hasn't deteriorated in there. And it doesn't impart any weird taste into the water. Good stuff.
