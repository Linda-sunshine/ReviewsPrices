review/summary: Throw out the food processor!review/text: The chef (husband) requested one of these blenders to simplify some of his soup recipes. He LOVES it. Easy use, easy clean, easy store. The processor is being pushed further back into the cabinet as he finds more uses for the &#34;stick &#34;.
