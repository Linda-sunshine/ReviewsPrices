review/summary: after 3 months of use- Does exactly what we needed.review/text: Our story with this mattress begins with a limbo of whether or not we were moving across the country. We liquidated all furniture and needed a semi-permanent solution to bedding, at low cost, that could easily be deflated and packed up. The mattress has performed well for a mattress. The built in pump feature has helped tremendously when needed to top off. We top it off every three weeks or so. The inner bladder is a nice touch and helps mitigate some of that spouse moving issue. It does bow a bit, we are average people with average BMI, but it provides some cuddle time. For an air mattress, it's a good temporary sleeper. Long term, I feel our backs and sleep rhythm are starting to feel the effect. I wouldn't recommend an air mattress as a long term solution and advocate of sleep. I'm over all satisfied with the bed. Time to get a real bed though.
