review/summary: Effective, but loudreview/text: I purchased this unit based on online feedback, people saying that it was simply the best filter in its price range.That may be true, but unfortunately, it's incredibly loud, especially in a small apartment or room. In my apartment, the filter was sufficiently loud on its medium setting that I could hear it with both fingers in my ears. The quieter setting is, unfortunately, not that much quieter.It may be an excellent air filter, but for me, in my apartment, it was so loud that I wouldn't be able to keep it on at all while I was at home. So, I returned it. Your mileage may vary.
