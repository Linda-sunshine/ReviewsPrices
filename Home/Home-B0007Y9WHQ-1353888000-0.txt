review/summary: Good idea, bad execution.review/text: World Cuisine A4982799 Spiral Vegetable slicer has very sharp blades and does a wonderful job of making spiral vegetable "noodles", but the guide handle and crank handle are very, very flimsy. The first one they sent me the handle was broken even before it got out of the box. I sent it back and Amazon very quickly replaced it. I was excited to finally get to use my new spiralizer... the first time I grasped the guide handle, it broke off in my hand. I sent it back and received a refund. I think that this particular vegetable slicer is a knock off of a better made piece of equipment, which I will purchase somewhere else. But I must say that Amazon did a great job of making it right.
