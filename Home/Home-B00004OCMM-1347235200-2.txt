review/summary: 4 years and still working!review/text: This was a great buy easy to turn really smooth. Does not bend like the flimsy ones I have used in the past. Not even while opening 10 lbs cans. I have been using Can Opener and washing it in the dish washer after every use. I spray Olive oil or Pam on it when ever the two are in arms reach that's all the care I have taken more or less a habit. I would say pick it up before they add any more plastic or cheap metal.Some times it is worth paying a dollar or two more for quality products. I am always checking grange sales and thrift stores for the old time heavy can openers from 30 or more years ago. But this has worked just fine keep it up OxO.
