review/summary: Great Blenderreview/text: I love this so much I bought a second one after a year so that I would have a spare if it ever conked out. I use it daily to make a blenderized diet version of all the meals we eat. It makes a fine consistent blend. I have had this for nearly 2.5 yrs now and I still love it. The cup cracked but the blender is still going strong.
