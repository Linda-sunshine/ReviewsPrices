review/summary: 4+ years, still holding up!review/text: I bought this set in November 2008. I still use them in a 2 set rotation on my bed. They are heavy and soooo comfortable! Here we are over four years later yet they still come out of the dryer wrinkle-free. I've had no holes. No loose threads. They don't even seem to be fading. I don't know if I'll ever need a new set of sheets, but if I do you can bet I'll buy more of these!
