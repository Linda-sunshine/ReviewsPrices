review/summary: LOVE OURSreview/text: We have had our Keurig for over 3 years and we love it. We have had no problems. At first we had to order most of our K cups onlne because most stores did not sell them. But now most stores have them and a big variety.The taste and strength of the coffee depends on the coffee you buy. So you may have to try several types and flavors of coffee to find the one you like the most.What I really like is when you have several people over and one wants decaf, another want a flavored coffee and someone else wants regular, you have them all covered with one machine and you don't have to brew a whole pot of coffee for just one cup.My husband and I love our Keurig and use it several times everyday. We will purchase another one when this one dies.
