review/summary: The best bread machinereview/text: I made French bread from this machine. It' easy and tasty, it came out prefect every time. My friends love the bread I served them. So, all my friends and their friends are keep buying the machine. I switch the recipe with 3 cups flour, 1 tsp salt, no sugar, 1 1/3 cup water, 1 tsp yeast. It never fail me.
