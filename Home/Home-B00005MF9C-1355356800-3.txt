review/summary: Great!!!!review/text: This is a great little coffee maker. Low price too!!! If it breaks in a few months, it's cheap enough that you can just buy a new one. I was sick and tired of using my big ole Krupps coffee maker for brewing one cup of coffee with its expensive replacement parts too. This is fast and simple and I love it.
