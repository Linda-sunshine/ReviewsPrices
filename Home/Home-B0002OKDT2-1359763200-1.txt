review/summary: So glad I did thisreview/text: This is the best thing I ever did for myself. The juicer is great. Easy to assemble the parts. Easy to use. Easy to take apart. Easy to clean. They give you a brush for cleaning. It comes with a rod to push the veggies/fruit down into it, and two square plastic bowls that fit up against the juicer just right to catch the juice and the pulp, with a strainer to strain the juice as it comes out. And it works great. This is a great product. Do yourself a favor and buy it.
