review/summary: Love it.. But..review/text: The grinder works very well. The grinding process builds static electricity and after running a few &#34;batches&#34; the grounds &#34;leap&#34; from the &#34;catch&#34; cup all over the face of the grinder when you remove the cup. Also, if I were to put as many coffee beans in the cup as the picture shows, the &#34;catch&#34; cup would not be able to hold all the grinds. 1/2 full of beans at medium to fine grind pretty much fills the finish product cup if you shake it or tap it down while grinding. Spillway clogs with buildup.. Not an &#34;easy clean up&#34; if you really want it clean and free of (fine particulate) bean material. Takes me as long to clean as it takes me to grind 3 batches.
