review/summary: It does the trick!review/text: I purchased this to replace my swiffer vac whose battery died off prematurely. I decided to get a floor vac that plugs in. I am pleased with this item. The bagless capacity is much larger than the swiffer vac and I also love how easily it manuvers around. It does a pretty good job on carpets too, when needed, although I really needed a floor vac for pet hair and dirt on my laminate floors. It does what I want it to do and is a great alternative to the swiffer vac.
