review/summary: Panasonic Breadmakerreview/text: The XL loaf was too big. The medium loaf is what I would call regular size. Unless you use Rapid Bake, it takes 4 - 5 + hours...a long time. Also it's a little noisier than my last bread machine. On the plus side, it's easy, bakes well and tastes great!
