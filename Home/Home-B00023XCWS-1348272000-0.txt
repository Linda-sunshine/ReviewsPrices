review/summary: Very good little kettlereview/text: I bought this kettle for making hot water for tea or ramen in my dorm room and it's working great! It's a bit loud when it gets started but that's not really a problem, it doesn't even wake my roommate up. It's easy to tell when the water is hot too because it clicks when it turns off. Just what I was looking for!
