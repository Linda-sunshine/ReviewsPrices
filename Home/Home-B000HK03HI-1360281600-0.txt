review/summary: Problem solvedreview/text: The Zyliss can opener works exceptionally well. It quickly locks onto the can with no slipping. The handle is easy to grip and turns with little effort. My only regret is that I didn't buy a quality can opener sooner. You get what you pay for and for something seemingly as simple as a can opener, that maxim holds especially true.
