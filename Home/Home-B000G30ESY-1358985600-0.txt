review/summary: Works flawlesslyreview/text: Great product. Easy to clean with removable non stick bowl which has not flaked in the year+ I have used it, removable lid and pop off exterior plastic top vent which can be cleaned as well. Quick cook is a live saver If I forget to set one of the two timers in the morning for rice at night or at night for oatmeal in the morning.
