review/summary: Awesome Heaterreview/text: I purchased this for my mother. Her room is at the back of the house and tends to be much cooler. This heater is just wonderful. She loves it. It isn't too big and is very quiet. It heats the room very quickly. There are a multitude of features like remote control and thermostat setting. There is also no learning curve for those who may not be at all mechanically inclined. You don't need to read instructions. Just plug in and push a button you like.
