review/summary: Perfect kitchen toolreview/text: I bought this as a gift for my sister-in-law because I have the same one, and I use it all the time. It's perfect to use for dinner prep when you don't exactly need the Food Processor. And the hand blender works like a dream; pureeing soups in the pot without the need to transfer to a blender.
