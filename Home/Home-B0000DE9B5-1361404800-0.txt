review/summary: Secure Lid and Attractive Designreview/text: This Bormioli jug fits my needs perfectly. I make my own nut milks and juices due to allergies, and need a container that will keep the contents fresh for several days. The hermetic lid is easy to use and reliably does its job preventing spills and helping ensure freshness. The jug's height allows me to wedge it amongst other frequently used items, and its square base fits compactly in the fridge. I can always see the contents and quantity for the sake of planning. I love the handle because it keeps the jug space-savvy and ready-to-grab. I use all sizes of these jugs for various purposes, including on the tabletop where they provide a handy and eye-appealing quick pour. My friends love them and have adopted them to their use as well. Great product!
