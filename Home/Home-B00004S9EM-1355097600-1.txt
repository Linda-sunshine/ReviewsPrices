review/summary: aweful customer servicereview/text: I received a Cusinart food processor as house warming gift. (It is a different model.) It broke down at the very first time I used it. I paid shipping and sent it back for repair. Then I got a letter that asked me to pay for the repair. I called multiple times and they said that it was not under warranty. Two out of three customer service representatives were very rude. They insisted that customers should pay as far as it is not under warranty "regardless if it broke down at the first time or on the first day". That tells you they have no commitment to their product quality and how relentlessly they treat their customers. I would never buy another Cusinart product and return any Cusinart gift. Or I will just tell friends never to give me a Cusinart product.
