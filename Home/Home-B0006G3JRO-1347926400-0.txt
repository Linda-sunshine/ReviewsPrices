review/summary: teeth STRIPPED off FOR SURE using the attachments, do NOT throw away yet...contact me..review/text: DO NOT use the attachment on this model, the teeth on the main handle STRIPPED OFF FOR SURE, because the the length of 2 teeth male pole on the attachment is 3mm short, it can only rieach the mouth of the the handle female teeth hole, so all teeth will be stripped off. Once the teeth gone, everything turns into junk.Do NOT throw them away yet, I am going to china and ask someone there to make metal teeth kits so you can glue it to it.The people have given 4 or 5 stars comments are all lying! This model with attachment having huge design flaw!wait for my repairing kit, I will post it here when I come back.
