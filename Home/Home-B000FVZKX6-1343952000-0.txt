review/summary: Flannel Sheetsreview/text: These sheets are great. They are thick and soft. I washed, and dried, them 2 times immediately after inspecting them. No pills, or color fading. They are soft and comfortable. The last set of flannel sheets I had were from Costco. I was going to buy another set from them, but the price was only $10 less. The sheets are much thicker and softer. For me flannel is cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. I am ordering another set. I am happy with them.
