review/summary: Fabulous for the moneyreview/text: This product if great for the money!! For $37 you have a compact and very effective toaster, and a small but good toaaster oven. I put aluminum foil on the bottom catch tray and it makes cleanup very easy. The cancel button is perfect. Yes, the toast jumps a little highter than you might like, but it's not a problem. AND, I eliminated one of the applicances on my counter top. If it breaks, I won't be too upset considering the cost!! I love it!
