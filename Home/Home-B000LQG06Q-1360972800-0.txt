review/summary: My daughter loves itreview/text: Bought this for my daughter's bed in her furnished college apartment-- it turned a terrible plastic Barbie mattress into a comfortable warm bed. The sheets still fit easily. A great product, especially when you consider the price. She loves it so much we will be ordering one for home-- I think this has spoiled her for life!!
