review/summary: Works great! My wife and I love this pressure cooker.review/text: Without getting into too much of the details, I have to admit this pressure cooker is very well built. It is built solid like a tank. I can't believe how fast things like rice or meat cook in this. We have been very impressed with Cuisinart product, we own a few. Glad to see that Amazon reviews did not disappoint on this purchase.
