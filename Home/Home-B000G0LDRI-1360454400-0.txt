review/summary: I returned this itemreview/text: I really like the fact that this humidifier has such a large reservoir, but the portion of the humidifier that houses the motor vibrated against the portion of the humidifier that holds the water. The noise was annoying to me. I tried reseating both the motor housing and the water reservoir, but this did not resolve the noise, so I returned this item. Maybe I just got a lemon as this product has a lot of positive reviews.
