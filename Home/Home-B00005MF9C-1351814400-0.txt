review/summary: Love itreview/text: I'm the only coffee drinker in our house so I was on the hunt for a coffee maker that would make a small amount, wouldn't take up too much counter space, and wasn't going to break the bank. I ordered this because it fit all my criteria. It brews a nice cup of coffee in just a couple minutes. I start it while I'm making the rest of my breakfast and it's ready when I'm done. I can't speak to the longevity since I've only used it a few times but so far I'm thrilled with it.
