review/summary: no compaintsreview/text: Makes good coffee - can't think of anything to complain about. I have never used the filter packs, because I put filtered water into the reservoir to begin with. I only used the washable filter basket once and was turned off by the fact that it takes far too much time to clean and dry it properly. I don't think that's a knock against this particular filter basket - just a knock against reusable filter baskets in general - since they would all require a very fine mesh. This reusable filter is also painted a gold color, perhaps to appear to be a metal mesh, but it is actually a plastic mesh. When water is poured into the reservoir, it is important to hang the spout of the coffee pot on the edge of the reservoir. This is hard to explain but easy to figure out once you are pouring it. If you don't hang the pot across the edge of the reservoir then it is easy to overshoot the reservoir when you pour, and the water will go into the basket area instead of into the reservoir. I have been very happy with this machine.
