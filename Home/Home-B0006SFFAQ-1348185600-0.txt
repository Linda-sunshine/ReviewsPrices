review/summary: Great Qualityreview/text: Best coffee pot I ever bought. I couldn't really believe that the coffee would taste better, but it does. No dripping when pouring coffee. Couldn't even make it drip. It is solid and great quality materials and workmanship. I'll never buy another cheap coffee maker.
