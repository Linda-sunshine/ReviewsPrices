review/summary: Happy, happy girl!!review/text: I've had this breadmaker for just over a week and I'm already on my 4th loaf. All of the recipes that I tried from the book worked with the exception of the pepperoni cheese bread. That one didn't rise and it could have been my fault as I was rushing but who knows? Yesterday, I used the timer for the first time and came home to a house smelling like amazing whole wheat bread! I also purchased the Progressive Bread Keeper to go along with this product. Making bread in this machine takes maybe 5 minutes so I'm not sure why anyone wouldn't want to! I won't be buying store bought bread again because this is just too foolproof.
