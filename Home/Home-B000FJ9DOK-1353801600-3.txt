review/summary: LOVE IT!review/text: I love this water bottle. I can fill it up with cold water in the morning and by mid-afternoon it's still cold! I find that I drink a lot more water with this bottle than I did when I used those plastic cups with the plastic straws that are reusable. I also like that it has a lock on it so I can toss it in my purse and not worry about it leaking, although it's a bit heavy so I don't usually carry it in my purse.One thing I would like to point out is that it's very easy for your dog to jump from the back seat of your car to the front seat, like their not supposed to, and step on the button and open the lid. Therefore I would recommend not laying it down on the passenger seat without the lock on because then the water will flow out, create a huge puddle on the seat (because of course you have waterproof seat cover since you have a dog!) and you'll be out of town and stranded with nothing to clean up the mess with except a pajama shirt. Just sayin...
