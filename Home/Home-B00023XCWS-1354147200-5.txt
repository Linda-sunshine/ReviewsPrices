review/summary: Great little kettlereview/text: I received this kettle a few weeks ago and so far it is performing very well. It heats the water quickly and easily holds enough for several cups of tea. It is easy to store because the cord is detachable and can be put inside the kettle. The detachable cord also makes it easy to pour.I'd definitely buy this again.
