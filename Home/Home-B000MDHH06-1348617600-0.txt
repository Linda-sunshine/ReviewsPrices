review/summary: great juicer for the pricereview/text: I don't have much experience with juicers but this one seems really good. Juices all kinds of veggies and fruits without effort and leaves behind all the pulp, so you are left with pure juice. It is a little hard to clean but still is a good sturdy machine.
