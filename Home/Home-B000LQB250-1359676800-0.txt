review/summary: by far the best!review/text: I've purchased many many many foam toppers. This one was purchased on a whim - for our fishhouse! I wasn't expecting much. It has exceeded our expectations. In fact, I just ordered another for our regular bed! In our fishhouse, the bed is basically a board that converts from the dinette table. This mattress sits directly on a board - it is so unbelievably comfortable. Best part is - it breathes! Don't let the inexpensive price deter you. Don't waste your money on other mattress pads. I'm a very picky person. In fact, I always tell myself that I'm not gonna like something. That way, I'm not disappointed. This one is a must have!
