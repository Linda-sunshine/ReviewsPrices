review/summary: Awesome...review/text: I LOVE this product... I don't have to waste time in the morning standing by the stove to wait for my water to boil. I turn it on go about my business, and come to pour my tea when I'm ready. Also much better than heating water in microwave it's never hot enough. Only one negative thing about it..This is my second one dueto the glass being so thin... I bumped it while washing it and my last one shattered.
