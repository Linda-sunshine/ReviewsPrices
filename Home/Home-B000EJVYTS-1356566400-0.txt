review/summary: Lasted Christmas Morningreview/text: Purchased as Christmas gift for my son. It worked fine on Christmas morning, but when he got it home the next day lid would not open. Only a grinding sound when passing hand above sensor. For a ONE DAY product it was fine, for long use just junk!
