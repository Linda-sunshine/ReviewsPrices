review/summary: Seals Great, Pours Greatreview/text: I love the fact that this is a nice, sturdy, heavy glass pitcher. I almost didn't buy it because of all the reviews about the top. I am so glad I went ahead and purchased it.This purchase was to replace a similar pitcher by the same maker, but with a blue plastic lid that pours. It broke when it slipped out of wet hands and crashed onto a stone floor. Bummer.This lid is different - it requires removal for the pitcher to pour well. Not a big deal - just twist the center part of the lid and the gasket is pulled away from the mouth of the pitcher. The top easily is removed from the pitcher. Once you are done pouring and want to reseal the unit, just replace the top and twist the center again. It is really not at all difficult. No strength issues.The biggest strength issue is how strong one needs to be to manage the pitcher - it is quite heavy. I can easily manage it, but I can imagine that it might be dicey for someone with arthritis or a weak arm. If you are someone who is thinking about a plastic pitcher because of the weight, you have a reasonable concern with this unit.I like the fact that this pitcher seals. Very effective.I highly recommend the pitcher.
