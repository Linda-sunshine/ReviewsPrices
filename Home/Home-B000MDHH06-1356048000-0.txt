review/summary: Love Itreview/text: I love this thing!! It is great for a novice juicer and has worked wonderfully even though I bought it used! I must say that next time, I will buy one wear the pulp is dispensed out of the back of the juicer. However, this one is meant to be compact and the internal pulp collector does just that! I am more than happy with this Breville juicer and when I do upgrade, I'll buy Breville again.
