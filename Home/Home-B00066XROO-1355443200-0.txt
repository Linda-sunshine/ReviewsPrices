review/summary: Excellent!review/text: We have tried several different brands of electric griddles and there is nothing like this brand. We have had two different styles and both have been superb for cooking eggs, pancakes, french toast, grilled cheese, etc. all at one for famiy of 5. Cooks evenly, doesn't burn and doesn't stick. Highly recommend this griddle specific.
