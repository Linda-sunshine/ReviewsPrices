review/summary: Love This Coffee Press!review/text: Finally a French Press that I won't break! Seems no matter how careful I am I break a glass caraff far before it's time.As an added plus, this French press makes more cups per press and keeps it much warmer.I have noticed that I have a bit more sediment at the bottom of my cup, but I've learned to leave the last sip when drinking any pressed coffee. This may be due to the screen that came with it, so I plan on trying one of the two screens I still have from my broken glass French Presses. Save your screens!
