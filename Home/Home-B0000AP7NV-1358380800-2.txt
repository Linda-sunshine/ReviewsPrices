review/summary: Lots of scratchesreview/text: First time I bought this from Amazon, there were a lot of scratches around the pitcher so I returned and requested for a new one. When I got the new one, there were more scratches all over which should be resulted from the poor packaging. So, I returned it for the second time and requested for refund.Finally, I bought the same product from King Soopers at a slightly higher price but I can choose the one with fewest scratches (out of 4 on the shelf).
