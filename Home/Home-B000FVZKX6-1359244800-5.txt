review/summary: Pinzon Flannel Sheetsreview/text: I wanted flannel sheets that didn't pill after washing them. I read the reviews and decided to order this sheets. They are wonderful! I have only washed them twice, but they are as nice as they were when I purchased them. They first time they were washed they shed a lot of fibers, but they did not lose any of their softness. They were very reasonably priced. I would recommend this to any one that wants flannel sheets.
