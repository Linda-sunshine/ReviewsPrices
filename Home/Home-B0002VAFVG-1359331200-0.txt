review/summary: Best Juicer Aroundreview/text: I can't tell you how much I love this juicer. I originally bought the Breville Juice Fountain JE98XL Plus. I realized how much I loved juicing so I really wanted the best. I was able to sell the old one for a slight loss and am happy I did. Its well worth spending the extra money for the Elite though it's gone up about $55 since my purchase. It might seem a little loud but thats the powerful motor doing its thing. I juice everything. I leave the rind on cantaloups and watermelons but do wash and scrub everything with Environne Fruit & Vegetable Wash.I'm a happy camper with this juicer and highly recommend it. In fact, if I miss a day without juicing my day is just not complete.
