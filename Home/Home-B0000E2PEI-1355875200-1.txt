review/summary: inaccurate weighing and then an error message- all in first day!review/text: I wanted to like this scale so much. Nice design, mainly very good reviews, and despite the negative reviews of the fluctuating inaccurate weigh-ins, I took the chance and bought it. Unfortunately, I am one of the unlucky ones stuck with a scale that doesn't weigh accurately.Not only did it not correspond to my weight as it appeared on my current non-digital scale, but one minute I would weigh a certain # of lbs. and literally 3 minutes later weigh 8 lbs more! Then another few minutes later, 4 lbs less! The scale wildly fluctuates. Then I got the "Err" message on the screen, and immediately stepped off as the instructions say. However,the manual says only to get off the scale if it says ERR. But it doesn't say how to fix this or deal with this.So now I'm returning it and am really annoyed because I have to pay $6 for return shipping and the scale only cost $22! Trust your instincts and listen to the negative reviews- Don't risk it!
