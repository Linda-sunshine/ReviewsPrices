review/summary: ON/OFF Switch wasn't even fully put together.review/text: I received this product on time, but it appeared as if the juicer's on/off switch had never been fully assembled. The switch was lying on the bottom of the box and the piece to keep it on was no where to be found. Obviously I didn't get to use it so I can't really rate the product's abilities.
