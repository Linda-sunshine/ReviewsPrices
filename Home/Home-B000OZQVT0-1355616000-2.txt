review/summary: Difficult to re-light, gives me headachesreview/text: When I first ordered these, I thought they were expensive for what they are, but I figured &#34;Hey, they're supposed to last 3 hours, and sometimes I only want to burn them for an hour.&#34; Well that philosophy doesn't work because these things are extremely difficult to re-light after they have been partially burned, and at the moment I am only able to re-light one of three that have only burned for 1.5 hours. That means you don't have the flexibility to burn them multiple times, which makes them even more expensive to use.I will say that they throw more heat than I thought they would. The packaging and website are definitely at odds with each other -- one says you must &#34;use in a well ventilated area&#34; and the other says &#34;requires no ventilation&#34; when burned. I did send an email asking about this which was almost immediately answered. I was told they do not require ventilation. That said, the alcohol used in these definitely puts off a very distinct odor which permeates the home when burned. It's not a bad smell, it's just a chemical smell which in my case gave me a headache.
