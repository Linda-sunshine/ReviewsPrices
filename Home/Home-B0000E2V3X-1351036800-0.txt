review/summary: Heavy Pizza Panreview/text: We have cooked home made pizza on thin SS pizza pans for years, but the crust never was cooked well on the bottom. We considered stones and the "crisping" pans with holes, but discovered the Lodge cast iron pizza pan and ordered one since we have used cast iron pans previously. As expected for cast iron, it is a bit heavy (a two hander), but the cooking results are excellent with even heating and uniform crispy crust. I am sure we also will use it as a griddle as well as for pizza.
