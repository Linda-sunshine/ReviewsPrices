review/summary: Awesome little vacuum, great price too!review/text: I bought this vacuum about 6 months ago when our Eureka died. Let me tell you this is a great little vacuum cleaner! It's light weight, small, easy to store and sucks up dirt/hair like nothing I've ever seen! Even my 7yr old can use it with ease. I'd recommend this vacuum over any of the pricier brands. Great vaccum, great price, can't beat it!
