review/summary: Amazing.review/text: I'm reading Kris Carr's : Crazy Sexy Diet and she recommended this brand for a juicer. I've been watching many documentaries on vegetarians, raw food diets, and healthy eating. I watched Sick, Fat, and Nearly Dead and It inspired me even more to start juicing. I purchased this juicer not knowing it was the same one that Joe Cross uses in the documentary. I have used this almost every day since i purchased it. It's very easy to use, and clean. I highly recommend it.
