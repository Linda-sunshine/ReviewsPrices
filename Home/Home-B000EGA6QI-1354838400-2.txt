review/summary: Not as fragile as the one stars paint it.review/text: I will have had this product for two years, come Christmas. Mine works like a dream, and I use it at least 2-3 times per week for soups, smoothies (with ice), sauces, etc. My sister and brother both have the same model for the same 2 years, and both of them are still thrilled with their mixers. I just ordered one to give as a gift for Christmas.This thing is so powerful and sturdy that I really only get my stand mixer down for dough. I've made whipped cream and mashed potatoes with this sucker. I gave my traditional blender away last year, because I hadn't used it since I got this one.
