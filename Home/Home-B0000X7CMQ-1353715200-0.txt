review/summary: Makes hot coffeereview/text: Makes hot coffee and the caraf keeps the coffee hot for hours. Ours stopped working 18 days after the warranty ended so I contacted Zorjirshi and spoke with Amy. They agreed to repair it if I paid for shipping to California. I was very happy and when the brewer came back like new, even happier.Great coffee maker and great company! Would have given them 5 stars if it did not stop working. Does anything last more than a year or 2 anymore?
