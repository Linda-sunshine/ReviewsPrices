review/summary: Not as loud as I expected...review/text: ...that is probably a good thing for most people. Even on the highest speed, it is not very loud. However, I was hoping it would serve a dual purpose as both an air purifier and to drown out my obnoxiously loud upstairs neighbor. So many reviews talked about this being pretty loud - maybe I got a "good one" but I find it pretty quiet - so I am still in the market for something that will make living underneath the cement shoe wearing riverdancer a little more tolerable.
