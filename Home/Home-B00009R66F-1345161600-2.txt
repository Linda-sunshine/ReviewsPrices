review/summary: surge button stuck!review/text: This is my second hoover steam vac..first one lasted 15 years. Bought this one from amazon..put it together and the "surge" button is stuck in the depressed mode so all the cleaning fluid surges right out of the machine. Amazon is good with the return though..THANK GOD I saved the box! Anyhoo the old one is going back and the new one is on its way. Hope its NEW and not refurbished. Amazon is GREAT with their return policy! Been doing business with them for years and never had a problem. After 10 years of business only had 2 items that were defective and had to go back! Thanx Amazon!!
