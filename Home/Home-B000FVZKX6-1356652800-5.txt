review/summary: total warming comfortreview/text: This flannel sheet set is amazing. Rich and warm and so very soft. I love being in bed with these. This was a Christmas present to myself...and I'm totally happy. I wish they made pajamas from this material too. At first I was cautious about buying without sneaking my hand in the package first to get a feel. But I am so relieved and comforted by my initially risky purchase. YAY and YAY again!
