review/summary: LOVE IT!review/text: This is a great machine. A few things to be aware of:1. Use the temperatures suggested by Nesco (135F for fruits/vegetables, for example). Many bloggers and websites who give directions are using an Excalibur, which requires about 10 degrees lower temperature than Nesco, so just be aware of that.2. There is no timer. If this is a problem for you, you can make up for this by getting a lamp timer from Amazon or your local hardware store.3. If you are needing a machine to dry massive quantities of food all the time, then consider an Excalibur.I love my Nesco, I've made a number of items on it and all have turned out great. My favorites so far are red bell peppers and pineapple. Even though I wish it held as much food as an Excalibur, the cost more than makes up for it. If I was doing it again, I would still buy this unit 100 times over. Thank you Nesco!
