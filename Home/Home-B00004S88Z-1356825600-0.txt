review/summary: Best pressure cooker ever!review/text: I bought this for my wife to do canning. It is awesome! It is easy to use, maintains an even pressure/temperature and is built with the highest quality materials. There is no doubt this product will last for many, many years. I wouldn't doubt that it will be passed on to other generations.
