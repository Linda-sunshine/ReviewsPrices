review/summary: Skeptic now convertedreview/text: I was a total skeptic regarding burr grinders and the difference between burr and blade grinds. Coffee is my Zen in the morning, so I was willing to try a burr grinder to effect an incremental increase in Zen.The results were fairly significant. I used a Bona Vita coffee maker and 8 o'clock beans. The only variable from the control to the test sample was the burr grinder. Same fresh bag of beans and everything. The end result was a much smoother, richer coffee that actually had some wonderful flavor notes. (Can't believe I'm saying that about 8 o'clock, but that's the brand I can afford with the volume I consume.) The qualitative aspects were impressive, and I doubt I'll ever move away from a burr grinder.I selected this specific grinder based on the quantity of highly-positive reviews.The grinder itself is very nice. The container which holds the beans until they are ground is very tight, so I'm not concerned about the beans being adversely affected by the ambient air. It is great to only have to grind and pour grounds as opposed my previous routine of getting everything out and putting it away. It is MUCH quieter than my Cuisinart blade grinder. It is a big plus to start the grind and move on to other tasks while it automatically grinds. So far it is fairly clean and hasn't created any messes from grounds. It does come with a order form for replacement parts, which is very good: this means you will only buy replacement components as opposed to the whole grinder. The long run cost savings will accrue.All in all, an excellent product which will enhance your cup'o'joe experience specifically when moving up from a blade grinder. A bit pricey at just short of ninety dollars, but well worth it.-Linda's husband
