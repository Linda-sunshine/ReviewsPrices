review/summary: Works great when you follow the directionsreview/text: I read many reviews before purchasing the Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Pro. It seemed that people were not in agreement regarding the moisture in the pulp & the ease of cleaning the filter.In my experience, the pulp is always dry. I gently, slowly guide the plunger, which gets the most juice & the least moisture in the pulp. In my experience it is nearly dry and sticking together--easy to remove with my fingers before washing the top & pulp container. I forgot to line the pulp container today, but it was easy to clean. The machine was not as loud as the disposal.As for the filter, soak in hot, soapy water for about ten minutes. Then rinse under water while brushing the inside & outside. It helps to start with the inside. I hold it by the plastic part.You can do what you want, but I saved at least a couple hundred dollars and have a great juice extracter. I recommend this to anyone who wants a quality juicer. I got the one with the metal clamps.
