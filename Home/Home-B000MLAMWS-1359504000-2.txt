review/summary: Not Your Mama's KitchenAid!review/text: I have been a KitchenAid mixer owner for over 35 years. My first mixer lasted almost 30 years of heavy use when I finally replaced it with a Professional 600 series mixer about 5 years ago. The new mixer had to be replaced under warranty within the first year because of a faulty control switch. The replacement was functioning well until it was stolen last year. My latest quest for another Professional 600 has been a complete nightmare. The first one I purchased failed after 3 months of light use - the motor started smoking and smelling hot when I was mixing a very light bread dough. KitchenAid replaced it with another Professional 600 which smoked heavily and burned on its very first use. I was not mixing dough heavier than the instructions suggest; in fact, I was using the same recipe I have used for 35 years in my previous mixers. Rather than replace the latest model with another questionable Professional 600, KitchenAid agreed to let me upgrade to the Commercial 7-quart model, but they are requiring me to pay the full retail price, less what I paid for this model I purchased through Amazon. (I NEVER pay retail! The replacement is costing me over $100 than if I had purchased it on Amazon to begin with!) I am hoping the commercial model will meet my needs. (It has not yet arrived.)Do yourself a favor - forget the Professional 600 series and head directly to the commercial model or another manufacturer if you are planning to mix anything heavier than a very light batter. This is a suggestion from a former very loyal KitchenAid fan. I loved my old mixer and really wanted to love this one as well. It is just not the mixer of the past!
