review/summary: Nice press...review/text: I've used a press for several years now, & have always made coffee at home then carried a thermos to work. I haven't figured out if my coffee stays hot for the 6 hours the manufacturer claims, but it's certainly stays hot for the few hours it takes to polish off my coffee. Some other review mentioned grounds slipping past the screen into their cup. I've had none of this. *thumbs up*
