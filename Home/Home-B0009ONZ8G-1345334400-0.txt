review/summary: Bought 3 Years ago AND It's Better Than My Mom's $700 Vacuum!review/text: I bought the Hoover Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuum about three years ago and I gotta tell ya, this machine works better than the $700 Oreck machine that my Mom bought 2 years ago! The Hoover Tempo has INCREDIBLE SUCTION POWER... it's like a hurricane of suction. I literally hauled this over to my Mom's to show her and she's ticked she wasted so much money on a very spendy machine. ANY annoyances of a bag and replacing it is just minimal when compared to just how strong this thing is! It is also stronger than the Hoover bagless canister (won in a contest and that sits in the garage!). This little vacuum cleans the house quick, the tools are basic and useful and the cord is a good length. It's a simple but GREAT, POWERFUL, STRONG SUCTION vacuum! Three years on and only had to replace the belt once. Great machine!
