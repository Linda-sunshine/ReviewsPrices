review/summary: Awkward to usereview/text: Of all the thermometers I've bought over the years, this was my least favorite. It took a long time to get to the correct reading and I'd have to use it repeatedly, like a digital thermometer for checking fever...can't trust the first reading. I make candy and also sometimes fry things and needed to have accurate readings. After a couple of uses, I accidentally dropped this one into the fryer grease...and the grease seeped into the the body of the thermometer and it stopped working even though I retrieved it immediately. I have replaced it with a better thermometer that clips to the side of the pan.
