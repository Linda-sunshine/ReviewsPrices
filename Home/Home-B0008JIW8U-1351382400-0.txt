review/summary: Works Great but NOT 4 cupsreview/text: I've been using this for more than a year and am very satisfied with the performance. However, it is NOT 4 cups. In Mr.Coffee language, a cup is 5 ounces (!!). This means the machine suffices for a little more than one large mug of coffee. Since I'm always making coffee for one person at a time this is fine, but if I was making for more people I would have been pretty angry at Mr.Coffee for making up their own definition of the Cup. Deducting 2 stars for deception!
