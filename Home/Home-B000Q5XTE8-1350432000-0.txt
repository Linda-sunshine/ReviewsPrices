review/summary: Bad product, bad packaging: returningreview/text: I received the chair in a box that was thoroughly crushed. The plastic casing on the bottom of the chair had a crack running its entire length. The large screw that is supposed to attach the chair back to the chair seat was so small that none of its threads could even touch the hole in the chair seat. Presumably some of these parts were meant to go with a differently sized chair? Anyhow, I'll be returning this damaged, impossible to assemble chair.
