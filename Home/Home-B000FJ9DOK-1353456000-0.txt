review/summary: Best Water Bottle Everreview/text: I love this thermos. Most people may want one for coffee, but my beverage of choice is water. I fill the bottle with ice and water and the ice will melt a bit, but remain for at least 8 hours. Other, non-insulated bottles would sweat and lose the cool quickly. Not this bottle. I am on my second one.I only wish this: that I could order replacement caps easily. I don't see any on Amazon. I contacted the manufacturer once, and they said they were out of stock and to check back. With constant daily use, the blue seals start to break down. And wash the bottle frequently, too, as a black residue will start to come off with the constant use.
