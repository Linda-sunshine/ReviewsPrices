review/summary: Works with mattress on Tempurpedic Ergo frame.review/text: All the other sheets my wife bought did not work with the mattress on Tempurpedic Ergo bed frame (frame that goes up and down), when I raised the head most bed sheets and fitted sheets would slip off the mattress and it was annoying. These sheets are deep enough and so well designed that it has not slipped off the mattress. The material feels good and is very comfortable.
