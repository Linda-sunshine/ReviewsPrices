review/summary: Great productreview/text: I read the other reviews before buying it and found it lived up to the positives without any of the negatives. Only slight one is the absence of a pouring lip, as mentioned by others. But it works very well on our 5 burner Jenn-Air gas cooktop. Sits very stably on the surface. It does burn hotter directly over the burners, but still works perfectly for eggs, pancakes, or burgers (the three things we've cooked so far). We are big cast iron fans, and this is a great new addition to our kitchen. It is also thin enough to store easily.
