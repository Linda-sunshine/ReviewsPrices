review/summary: Waited years to buy it, so glad I did.review/text: This 6 qt enameled cast iron dutch oven has been on my wish list for YEARS.Well, a couple months ago I finally went ahead and got it, and I am THRILLED.It's the perfect size for my family of 5, it heats evenly, it's pretty enough to take to the table -- and no matter how long I cook cheese onto the side, it cleans up like a breeze.Plus the weight of it is handy for sneaking in some exercise in the kitchen. BONUS!
