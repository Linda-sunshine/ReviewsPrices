review/summary: Love Itreview/text: I have gone through a few french presses, because my husband keeps breaking them when he washes them. I decided to get the aeropress, and Love it. It is easy to use and clean. I love the way it makes the coffee with no bitterness to it. I am the only one that drinks coffee in my house-hold a few times a week only. I love high quality organic, fresh grind coffee.
