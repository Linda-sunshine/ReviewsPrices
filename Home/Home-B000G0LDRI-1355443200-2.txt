review/summary: Great product so farreview/text: I bought this because my wife gets nose bleeds in the winter from the dry air and she has not had any since we got it. I got this for our living room as I already had a Hamilton Beach 3.5 Gal humidifier for the bedroom. So far this unit has worked so well I have not had to turn on the one in the bedroom. I have read the reviews about this humidifier being noisy but I have found mine to be much quieter than the smaller Hamilton Beach humidifier. I've only had it for a month so we will see how it holds up over time.I would defiantly recommend this to a friend.
