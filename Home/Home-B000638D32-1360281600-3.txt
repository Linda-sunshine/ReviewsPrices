review/summary: Excellent price for an everyday use knife!review/text: I use this knife almost every day - extremely sharp, excellent balance and great price for an extremely useful knife! I found a review on Cook's website that said they use these knives in their test kitchens and bought it based on that recommendation - I have not been disappointed. Excellent knife and value!
