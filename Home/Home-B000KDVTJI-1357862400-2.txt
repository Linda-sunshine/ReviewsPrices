review/summary: works great, burns fingersreview/text: This is my first water kettle. I like that this looks really nice on my counter. It boils the water, and shuts off automatically. Works great, boils fast. I love it.There is no insulation, so the outside of it is the temperature of boiling water. I have burned myself twice, maybe I will learn my lesson.
