review/summary: Great Thermometerreview/text: I've yet to find a digital thermometer that provides an 'instant' temperature read like a standard cooking thermometer. However, this thermometer is actually accurate which hasn't been the case with others I've had (tested it with boiling water). The waterproof feature is icing on the cake. Overall, a good purchase.
