review/summary: First time cast iron cookware userreview/text: I bought this skillet on a whim. I was looking for something to cook my morning breakfast in (i.e.: eggs, bacon, hashbrowns), but I also wanted something that wasn't cheap and I didn't want Teflon. My friends, who are chefs and cooks in restaurants, kept insisting that I try cast-iron or copper. Copper is EXPENSIVE, so I decided to look for cast-iron cookware instead. After debating whether or not I wanted the hassle of dealing with the maintenance of cast-iron (washing it with very little soap and hot water, towel drying it, and coating it with veggie oil AFTER EVER USE), I chose this one. I also liked the large number of great reviews - though this doesn't always mean it's any good. Anywho, I have now used it for several weeks, and I LOVE it. It works better than described. I love how it transfers heat evenly so everything on the skillet cooks perfectly. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is even remotely considering buying a new skillet.
