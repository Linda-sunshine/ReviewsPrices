review/summary: Black & Decker DCM18S Brew 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker with Travel Mug by Breview/text: I bought this because sometimes I cannot sleep and well and I get up and have a cup of coffee. Coffee relaxes me and tends to calm me rather than boost me up. Crazy yes, but this pot lets me make that one cup of coffee and it is nice and hot. So many coffee makers the coffee is not hot when you pour a cup. So I like that it is hot and the cup is nice little cup and it works just the way it should. I have used it to make a cup of tea also. Easy and worked well I am very happy with this coffee maker. The nicest thing is it came with a nice little filter. I just knock out the grounds into my recycle bin and wash it out and it is ready to go for the next time. The cup keeps the coffee hot and while it is not spill proof it is a nice enough cup. This would make a great gift for someone who only needs one cup of coffee in the morning. Just a little point of economy. I reused the grounds just to see if I could get away with it. I put in have as much ground on the already used grounds and ran it again and the coffee was fine. I must admit that I do this with my Larger coffee maker as well. So that second cup of coffee for singles just got a little cheaper for the single person on the weekends.
