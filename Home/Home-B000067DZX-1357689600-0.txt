review/summary: Works For Mereview/text: The filters work just like the original which came with the Pur Pitcher. Like the original filter, sometimes it doesn't want to filter some or all the water you pour in the top container. I just shake it lightly once or twice and it will continue to filter down into the lower container. If not for this flaw I would have given the product five stars.
