review/summary: Don't get if you want to make more than an ounce of espresso at a time.review/text: I purchased this for my wife for Christmas and we are going to return it as soon as we can. I am terribly dissapointed, after all the excellent reviews this product received it just does not produce more than 1 ounce of dark thick espresso. So for a good cup of vanilla latte, we need to reload the machine four times. Don't be fooled by the picture with the two shots classes full. You can get that buts its about as weak as my inlaws folgers.Since I know these questions area coming: Yes, we are using espresso grounds. Yes, it is tamped.Get this machine if you want about half a shot to a shot worth of espresso. If you just like a wee amount to sip on. If your hoping to make 16oz coffee store style drinks you should pass.We have owned a Mr. Coffee and Krups, espresso and coffee makers, and I wanted to get my wife a dedicated espresso maker, but it just fails. Part of the reason I believe is that the arm piece that holds the grounds, its basket is just too small. (kinda like the Grinch's heart) It does not hold enough grounds (Yes we were using the larger of the two). With our other machines we could make a solid 5-6oz of espresso that was as dark and strong as you could hope for. With this machine... the espresso tastes fine, but you have to reload 4-5 time to get enough espresso for a 16oz latte.
