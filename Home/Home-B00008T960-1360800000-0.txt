review/summary: Great for bakingreview/text: I now have three Silpats, each in a different size, and I love them. I use them for all my baking - cookies & breads - and I also use them when making candy. Silpats provide a perfect non-stick performance and I use them in place of parchment paper or non-stick spray. One caution, make sure you pay attention to the different sizes available and ensure you order the right size for your needs. I strongly suggest you measure the pan(s) you intend to use your Silpat on and ensure you do not order one too large for your use. You cannot cut or fold the Silpat.
