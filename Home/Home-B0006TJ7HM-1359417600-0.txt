review/summary: Great value!review/text: For the price, I don't think you can beat these knives. Had them for over a year now and they're still just as sharp as the day they came. Some reviewers complained of rust issues. Haven't had any problems with rust thus far, however I had wash my knives, so that seems to help. Bang for your buck, this is a sure bet.
