review/summary: Worst knives you can buyreview/text: Used these knives for a month and now they are in the trash. I should have kept the box to get a refund but I didn't have the box to return. I would not recommend these knives. They began to rust after a few days and all knives have a wavy edge on them so you can't really cut anything well.
