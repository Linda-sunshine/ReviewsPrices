review/summary: scared to tryreview/text: I have been so scared to try Cast Iron Skillets that I almost put it off again. However I did order the Logde Logic 12 and 101/4 inch skillets a few weeks ago. I wanted to use them for awhile before posting so I would know what I was talking about. I have really enjoyed cooking in both of these skillets. I find myself using the 12 incher more. But the clean up has not been a problem and the cooking has been great.... At least my husband says so... LOL. I have not had any issues with sticking or hard to clean... I just make sure I clean it after cooking (I don't let it set) and only with water and a brush and season after every use. I would recommend this product to anyone that loves to cook.
