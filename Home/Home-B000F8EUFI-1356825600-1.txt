review/summary: Garbage. Worthless. Crap.review/text: My wife and I bought this vacuum about 4 months ago from Amazon and today the belt broke. Ok, no problem go buy a new belt, right? Well, then the new belt melts and snaps right after installing it. The brush roll where you attach the belt is scalding hot. So now I've paid for a piece of crap that breaks after 4 months of light use and to add insult to injury, wasted money on a new belt to have it break immediately. I might as well have taken the cash from my wallet and just flushed it down the crapper. After reading a lot of the reviews on here I see that I'm not the only one that has had this exact problem. If you only want to vacuum for a couple of months then this is a great vacuum. Buy two or three though because you will need the replacements. I'm gonna use mine for target practice.
