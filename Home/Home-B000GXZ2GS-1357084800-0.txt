review/summary: Best Cup Of Coffee I Have Hadreview/text: Really glad that I finally tried this. The coffee it makes is unbelievably good for the price. I tested it with my drip coffeemaker and tasted them side by side, and the difference was significant.* Very easy to use* Very easy to clean* Great coffee - espressos or americanosOnly potential downside is that it will only make 4 espressos at once, or about two cups of coffee if you add water. It's easy to clean (takes 5 seconds) and press again, but for a party or a come and go event . . . will be too time intensive to work well. Not sure what I'll use.The coffee is great. Before I had this, I drank coffee mainly for the caffeine boost, now I really like it again. It's the best $30 you can spend on Amazon if you like coffee. Highly, highly recommended.
