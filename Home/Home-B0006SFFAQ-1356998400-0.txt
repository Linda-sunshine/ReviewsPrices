review/summary: coffee tastes bland verses old Micheal graves coffee makerreview/text: i bought this based on the reviews but this is the worst coffee maker i've ever owned. first hard to fill the water. have to use a funnel so i don't make a mess. can't read the clock not lighted. no brew strength control and only takes cone filters and worse yet is the coffee we drank for our Micheal graves machine i think was sunbeam but not sure. at any rate i'm selling mine for $20 and only a month old. i do NOT recommend this to anyone. also forgot to mention the carafe lid is not a flip lid but you have to snap into place. what a pain
