review/summary: works like a charmreview/text: Easy to use, and compact in its size. I bought this to grin meat for making dumplings. It works. Saves us a lot of time and efforts. I have also used it to grin peanuts; it works as well. Although you shouldn't put too many peanuts at one time. Very well designed. I like how it is locked to the counter -- without bolts/nuts, just turn the triangle shaped button using the key provided. I also like their design that the key is used to help pressing meat/peanuts into the grinder.
