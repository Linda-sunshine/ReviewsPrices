review/summary: Great product.review/text: I have had this product for over a year now and we love it. It makes a great cup of expresso that we then use to make a variety of coffee drinks. We use this in conjunction with our Sunbeam 6131 Hot Water Dispenser, a milk frother, and an iSi easy whip to make some fantastic drinks. Enjoy!
