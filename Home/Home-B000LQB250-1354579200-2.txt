review/summary: not so bad for the $review/text: very comfy and I sleep through the night very soundly and I like that/need that rest.i did not noticed any smell/stink like other had noted.other reviews are correct, it is warm and will make you sweat on hot/warm nights. this is the only negative. i dont know why and how to resolve this. maybe sleep with less clothes on during the summer.
