review/summary: Perfectly boiled eggs; No more soggy or carcked eggs!review/text: If you are used to boiling eggs in water, you probably know that there is nothing more frustrating than seeing a frothy layer oozing out of a cracked egg and a resulting wet/soggy boiled egg (Which for me always end up going down the trash). There is also this taxing amount of attention that needs to be paid while boiling eggs. So if you have suffered from one of these or want a quick effortless solution, the Microwave egg boiler is the solution. Oh and for the scientifically curious who wonder why the egg doesn't explode while being microwaved (That's what normal eggs are supposed to do), there is an insulating layer on the top shell which prevents microwaves from reaching the egg. So only the water in the bottom compartments gets heated up, steam flows up and boils the egg. Perfect!So to summarize, a perfect solution for someone who loves their eggs boiled but not cracked and needs them to be done effortlessly :-)
