review/summary: *** CAUTION ***: Only Use This With Distilled Water!!!review/text: The manufacturer should issue a warning that it is ill-advised to use this without distilled water.I was originally very pleased until the white dust started appearing that subsequently became a substantial problem. I assume that it is everywhere but noticed it particularly on my electronics and glasses. I can't see out of my glasses after a day without cleaning the dust off. All of my electronics is coated with the stuff. I assumed that a filter would be included but it is not. I tried to order a filter. However, after struggling for half an hour, increasing the order quantity to three filters, and working with Amazon customer service I found that there is no way to order until I order something else besides the filter. After reading more about the filter I found that the dissatisfaction rate is high and that they don't work at least half the time. I think I'll now start using distilled water and see if that solves the problem.
