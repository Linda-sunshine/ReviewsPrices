review/summary: Bowed in the middlereview/text: I wrote T-Fal with no response. When I received the pan, I noticed it looked bowed in the middle. I thought it was an optical illusion. When I tried to make eggs in it , for the first use, the eggs all ran to the sides of the pan.They cooked non stick, but the pan is thin, and poorly made.
