review/summary: Great popcorn popperreview/text: This is an easy-to-use appliance that makes fantastic air-popped popcorn quite quickly and easily. The only drawbacks are that it doesn't have an on-off switch (if it's plugged in, it's on, which is a little annoying) and if you're using the cup they provide for melting butter/popping popcorn you have to be careful pouring the kernels in (they bounce off the area around the opening to the heating chamber and out all over the room quite quite easily if you just dump the seeds in. This adds just a couple seconds to the overall process, so it's not that big of a deal, unless you're letting younger children put the popcorn in).
