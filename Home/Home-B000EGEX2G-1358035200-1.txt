review/summary: Ok for the pricereview/text: I bought this rocker after the birth of my daughter. We needed a rocker but didn't want to spend a whole lot. I read the other reviews online and I should have listened.The pros: solid wood, looks nice, space saver, great price, and glides smoothly.The cons: developed a squeak the second day. It's not the wood but the cushions rubbing as you glide that causes the noise. The padding goes flat almost instantly making the chair very uncomfortable to sit in for more than 15 minutes. I am 5'4 and weigh 115 and I feel like this rocker is small. My head is taller then the back and so it is not very comfy to rest in. The actual seat seems small as well. My baby is only 4 months only and I feel like there is not enough room for the both of us. My three year old likes to cuddle and read stories too and its not possible in this chairLike I said, if you are looking for something not to pricy and know it won't be used for long, I would highly recommend. It's a good short term rocker. But if you are looking for a rocker that you can use for all of your future children I would suggest spending a bit more and getting something else. I don't think this one will make it a year.
