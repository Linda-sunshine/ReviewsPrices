review/summary: "lithium battery which will likely never fail.." UPDATED!review/text: Or, it will start to fail within a year. Even with infrequent use. And then it will completely fail.Wouldn't buy again.********All I can say is WOW. After writing this review, someone from Taylor contacted me about the problems with my scale. She sent a replacement scale immediately, and it's working great. Along with my new scale, she mailed me a luggage scale as well. Talk about wanting to make sure their customers are happy! Will update if there are any issues. But I'm sure if there are, Taylor will make good again.Mind blowing customer satisfaction, changing the mind of a rather jaded consumer.
