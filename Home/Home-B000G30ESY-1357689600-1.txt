review/summary: Best oatmeal ever!review/text: I'm generally not a fan of using an appliance when a pot on the stove works just as well, but this rice cooker not only makes amazing rice, but it cooks perfect steel-cut oatmeal. Just put the oats and water in at night, set the timer, and perfect oatmeal will await you in the morning. It even works when you add fruit to the mix. (I'm partial to a chopped apple cooked in my oats.)I haven't cooked a lot of rice with it, but the basmati I made last night was restaurant-quality.
