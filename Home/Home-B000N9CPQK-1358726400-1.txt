review/summary: Loud but it worksreview/text: For me it seems a bit loud but for a cheap step into the air cleaning products I like it. Makes a white noise at night. Has a night light and I think it works good enough. Next one I buy will have a remote because we keep it on the floor for the cat hair. You have to bend far down to get to this. Although it would be great for a shelf. My other one is in my office and I turn it on as soon as I get to the office.
