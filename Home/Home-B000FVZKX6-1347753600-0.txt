review/summary: First satisfying sheet purchase of my life.review/text: There was a lot of hype for these sheets to live up to, but they had no problem at all fitting the bill.The Queen set fit perfectly and went on to my bed with no trouble, excessive force or stretching. Climbing into the sheets yielded an "oh wow" moment, and the material is incredibly soft. My first night sleeping in them had me dreaming about ordering more sets and campaigning to my friends about how incredible they are. I woke up and immediately ordered another set while I was still in bed, and I still harass my friends about how great "those sheets from Amazon" are.The pillowcases fit nicely over my sadly understuffed down pillow AND my stupidly heavy buckwheat hull pillow. Even a couple weeks after getting the sheet set, I'm surprised by how soft and nice the cases feel on my face.My only problem with them is a problem of my own--I decided to move away from beige bedding and ordered Jade & Graphite sets. Now I have no idea what color comforter I should be buying to color coordinate. Despite having very soft, very nice sheets, I am still fantastic at being a bachelor.This is very warm bedding, but it's still very usable in the hot Los Angeles summer. I'm looking forward to having these when the colder months come around.
