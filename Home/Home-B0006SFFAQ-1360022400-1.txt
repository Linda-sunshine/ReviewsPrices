review/summary: You friends will be green with envy............review/text: This is a very user friendly coffee maker. I love how easy it was to program and now our coffee is waiting for us when we awaken. It will keep coffee warm for up to 4 hours, which is a great feature since my love has to get up 3 hours before me. We no longer have to make 2 pots of coffee. It has a removal, reusable filter, so it will save you $$, if you choose you can still use paper #4 cone filters as well. The small opening in the back to add water, takes a li'l to get used to. But this is something I find with every coffee maker I have owned. And let me tell you about the color, it will make your friends & family green with envy. It must be popular, everyone on TV has this coffee maker on their counter. From The Big Bang Theory (Penny's is pink) to Two and a Half Men (Ashton's chrome). You know you want it.
