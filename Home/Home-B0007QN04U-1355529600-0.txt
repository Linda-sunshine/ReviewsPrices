review/summary: If you cook alot it might not be for youreview/text: I have had a professional 600 kitchenaid for about 5 or 6 years. I have now gone through 2 motors. It is noisy and vibrates on the counter. It gets hot. The whole kitchenaid machine will move with bread dough kneading. It simply doesn't have the power to do big jobs. I use mine 3-4 times a week for various things, mainly cooking for my family. Buy something that lasts longer and does a better job.
