review/summary: Best Canner ever!review/text: After struggling with many different canners, I purchased this All American Canner. I have to adjust the heat on it once is all...I have had no failures and it's just a pleasure to use. If you want to can easily and efficiently, get this one if any way possible. You won't be sorry. I do have one negative and that is the small gauge. It's not a biggie but I do wish it had been a bit larger so I could see it more easily. But all in all, this is the bomb of canners.
