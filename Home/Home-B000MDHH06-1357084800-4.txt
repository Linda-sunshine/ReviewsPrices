review/summary: Better than Jack'sreview/text: I was given LaLane's juicer as a gift and was thrilled but using it was clunky and messy and did poorly when I tried to juice greens such as kale. I wanted a juicer I could fit in my suitcase when I had to travel for work so I got this one. It's extremely easy to pull apart to clean. It leaves very dry pulp so I believe I'm getting better juice. It juices kale well too. I'm able to prepare 4 juice meals in about 25 minutes in the morning for my whole day if I have all the veggies and fruit separated into bowls the night before. Love it.
