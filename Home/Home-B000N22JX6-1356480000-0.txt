review/summary: Absolutely Wonderful!review/text: This little heater is not only decorative, it also works very well to heat up a mid-sized room in a few minutes. The heat it provides is consistent. The thing I love the most is the thermostat that will automatically turn the heater off when the desired temperature is achieved, and it will turn it on again, when the temperature drops below the set level. I also love that it operates very quietly. You can sleep comfortably when it's running. I would buy it again and again! I highly recommend it!
