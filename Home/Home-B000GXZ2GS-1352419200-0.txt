review/summary: Just what I was looking forreview/text: I had been wanting an espresso maker, but I didn't want an expensive, herky machine. The Aerobie Aeropress is perfect if you're an occasional espresso drinker, which I am. Easy to operate, easy storage and cleanup, and makes a great espresso. It's like a French press on steroids. I heat the water in a measuring cup in the microwave; took just a couple of tries to learn how to get the correct temperature every time.
