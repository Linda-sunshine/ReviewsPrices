review/summary: First Frozen Pizza Successreview/text: We just tried the Pizzazz today on frozen pizza. A Frozen 4 cheese. 16 minutes and it made a nice crispy crust. Temperature measured with a non contact optical thermometer well over 200 Deg F at the outside edge of the pizza where it came out from under the upper heating element. Temperature decreased moving toward the center of the pizza, but it got up to 180 Deg F. Next time probably only 15 minutes would be a better choice of time. Used it before to make grilled cheese sandwiches. They were excellent. Once you learn how, installing the pan is easy. The Pizzazz is going to get a good workout. Trying to get the wife to bake chocolate chip cookiesDisclaimer I own NPK stock, I discovered the Pizzazz while searching their Investor Relations homepage. But I wouldn't shill for the Pizzazz if I didn't like it.
