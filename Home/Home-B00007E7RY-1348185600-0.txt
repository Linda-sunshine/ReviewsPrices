review/summary: Noisier than I wantedreview/text: Unit looks nice and has good features like the filter alerts for replacement, but even at it's lowest speed setting, it's aggravatingly noisy. I had a similar Honeywell unit in the 1980's and I don't recall it being this noisy. It's a 'white noise' about 5db more than I'd like - I'd guess in the high 70's on the decibel scale - noisier than my car at 60mph. Won't ever use it at the 2 higher-speed settings because of the volume.
