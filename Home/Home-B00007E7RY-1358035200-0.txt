review/summary: Loud but Effectivereview/text: It cleans the air well and keeps the room cool. However, people were right when they said this filter is LOUD! I live near street cars so I'm used to noise but if you like a quiet home, this is NOT the product for you. It's so loud that when I turned it on for the first couple of times it literally scared the crap out of my birds and then they flew around confused for a minute or so. Also, it is best for a larger room since it does take up quite a bit of floor space and they suggest it should be at least 3ft away from any walls or items. Good luck and enjoy!
