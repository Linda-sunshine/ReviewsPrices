review/summary: Best Mandoline Everreview/text: We lost one of the pieces of our original v-slicer when we moved and I was heart-broken because it is my favorite and most used piece of kitchen equipment. I came to Amazon doubtful that I would find a replacement because I bought this mandoline at least 12 years ago-so long ago that the manual did not even have an internet address! I would still be using it, had I not lost the piece. It still worked very well after all these years.I highly recommend the v-slicer. It is very easy to use. I have tried others and they are either too cumbersome or to dangerous to use. I am so happy to have found my favorite piece of kitchen equipment!
