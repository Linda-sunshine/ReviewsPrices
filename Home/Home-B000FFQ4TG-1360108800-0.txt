review/summary: Bunn vs Krupsreview/text: As many good reviews I read about this coffee maker I also read as many bad reviews. So I decided to take a chance and see for myself. I had Krups coffee maker that lasted more than 8 years. But what the heck, Bunn had some good reviews.I bought this particular model. What I thought was totally unnecessary was the pre-heated water that has to suck power all the time to keep the water in the tank hot. When the coffee is made, the coffee is no hotter than if you put cold water into an empty tank the water is heated at that moment.Within in 3 days the water started to drip out before I could slide the cover closed and drip onto the hot plate. Bad sign. The coffee didn't taste nearly as rich bold as with my Krups unit. I think that having the the basket style filter is not nearly as good as the screen cone style.I don't care that a lot of the restaurants use it. I also wouldn't buy the coffee most restaurants use, and my home made coffee is better than most restaurants.I would skip over this product.
