review/summary: so far, NOT so good.....review/text: upon reading all the glowing recommendations for this admittedly incredibly-low-priced carpet shampooer, we ordered it. today, my husband put it together, and........it won't turn on!! so we're sending it back for a replacement. i can only hope that the replacement works as well as y'all say it does. will re-review it at whatever time we receive the new one, get it assembled, and use it. (thanks to amazon for their WONDERFUL return policy - it won't cost me anything to send this one back or get a replacement. yet another reason i use amazon for most of my purchases!) [this review from jan, not benjamin.]
