review/summary: Only fill 1/2 way; Unscrew lid to release pressure each time; TELL THE HUBBY to do the same!review/text: As other reviewers have said, the biggest problem is clogging, which can be largely prevented by a quick unscrew of the lid to release the pressure each time.TELL YOUR HUSBAND (and other family members who use the sprayer) to do that as well. When mine became clogged and I asked him why, he said "you know men don't read directions."The red sprayer is gorgeous.
