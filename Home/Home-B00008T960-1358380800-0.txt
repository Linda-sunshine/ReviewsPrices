review/summary: The best of inventions for bakingreview/text: No longer does one have to worry about sticking cookies, bread, or any baked item. I purchased a set from Costco 5 years ago and have loved its uses, but because of the oils the product became sticky/gummy, so I needed a new set - this is as good - pricey - but worth not having to scrape pans for cleaning and ease of baked items.
