review/summary: Great Iron - Short Lifereview/text: As far as performance goes, this is the best iron I've ever used. I am a man, and I iron my work clothes every morning. This iron puts out more steam than anything else I have used.That being said, the life span on these is short. I have owned two thus far. The first one died within 9 months. It would not create any steam. The second lasted over three years. The heating element finally burned out.I am going to order two or three more of these. I am willing to trade the short life for the stellar performance.
