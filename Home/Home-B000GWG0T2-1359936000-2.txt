review/summary: An old name delivers New Performancereview/text: T-fal has been making non-stick for at least 33 years that I remember. That is to say: They know what they are doing.This pan has a nice heft and balance to it.I really like the Silicone Handle; it feels nice and gives good grip without being squishy.The pan is oven-safe to 450 degrees (standard pan is not).This pan is non-stick on the outside too, so you crack-the-egg-on-pan types will have an easy clean up.A Stainless Steel plate bonded to the bottom gives improved heat retention and distribution (as compared to my old all-aluminum T-fal).Though I prefer heavier pans (High thermal mass), this is after all just an "egg pan". I don't use non-stick for much else, and this pan is just brilliant for that. The "Professional" series appears to be slightly heavier-weight than standard; in any event it is very conductive and quickly recovers lost heat. With just a tiny bit of shortening in the pan, eggs slide around like they're on an air-hockey table. You can use the pan without any shortening at all I am told, but I'm not that extreme. Manufacturer instructs that you wash it and oil it prior to first use.Dishwasher safe? Why? It's so easy to clean there is hardly a need to wash it. Just wipe it out put it away.I am extremely satisfied with this purchase, and will buy the 10" or 12.5" for making large omelettes.
