review/summary: Amazing Water Bottle!review/text: I am a busy college student and bring this water bottle with me to campus every time. When not on campus, it sits by my bed at night. I have left ice in it, and 24 to 48 hours later there is still some ice left. Even when left in a hot car all day long, this water bottle keeps the ice frozen and the water cold. 5 Stars!
