review/summary: Warm sheetsreview/text: I previously purchased two sets of these sheets in Dec. one as a present for our adult daughter and one for our vacation condo in the mtns. I then decided that we needed a set on our bed at home. If you do not use an electric blanket these sheets are great in the winter as they are not cold like regular cotton sheets. They are soft and very comfortable. They do pill and release lint when washed. Too early to tell how bad the pilling will be. Stay tuned!
