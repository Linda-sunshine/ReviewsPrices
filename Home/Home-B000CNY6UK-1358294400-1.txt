review/summary: One of the very best ways to make coffee.review/text: To make great coffee its all about the water temperature. (OK, good beans are a major factor also)Most drip coffee maker don't come near the required (just off boiling) temperature needed. This design is genius in that the water never touches the grinds until it is at the boil and moves up through the stem into the grinds. The result is superb coffee.I have the &#34;6 (espresso) cup&#34; model which is just right for 2 normal cups. I use Bustelo coffee which is cheap and delicious. Just fill the bottom with water to the line, fill the filter with coffee to the top, level it, screw on tight. For gas, use low flame. For electric, use medium heat. Watch it and take it off the heat when the top is full.Terrific coffee !!(P.S. my other great ways to make coffee: an ancient Toshiba &#34;MyCafe&#34; which is a coffee legend, and the simple but superlative Vietnamese metal coffee filters)
