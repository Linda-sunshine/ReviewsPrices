review/summary: Makes weak coffeereview/text: I put the same amount of water and grounds in this percolator as I usually use my drip coffee maker. The result was weak and tasteless coffee that was more like tea. I think it stops percolating too soon. It is all stainless steel except for the black plastic parts. The basket and tube are stainless steel. It seems to be really well made. It just doesn't perc long enough.
