review/summary: It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This Modelreview/text: I did an extensive search of other reviews of this model and others before purchasing. I was not disappointed. This machine is way above any other mixer I've ever used with controlled power to spare. It doesn't overheat when kneading heavy doughs, yet the enclosed whisk attachment does a fast and admirable job of whipping heavy cream.The only, (and minor), drawback is that it's a heavy machine which become noticable when I move it from its storage space to the countertop and back again. The weight tells me not many plastic parts are used and it is a truly professional machine.There are other and cheaper Kitchen Aid mixer models, but this one will certainly exceed your expectations.
