review/summary: Fantastic!review/text: I've always bought microwave popcorn, but now I will never do that again! Not only does making your own popcorn taste better, it's fun to watch. My 3 year old thinks it's the coolest thing ever, and she LOVES her some popcorn. All in all I have no complaints about this machine. If you go by the directions and use a maximum of 3tbsp of SOFT butter in the melter it does just fine. It doesn't matter to me that there isn't an on/off switch. I unplug it, and it goes in the cabinet. After popping a 1/4 cup of kernels I only had 5 unpopped kernels. Don't try to immediately pick those suckers out though... they are hot!
