review/summary: Hauntingreview/text: The book was in excellent shape. I had read one before and it was so strange that I got rid of it. However, it kept haunting me. Things would happen that would remind me of this book. I had to read it again and have it handy for reference. I rated it &#34;4&#34; because it's an excellent book but I don't necessarily &#34;like&#34; it. I think it would be good for mature kids (maybe preteen and early teen.......and maybe beyond. I'm an adult!) to make them think what our world could become if we let government gain too much control.
