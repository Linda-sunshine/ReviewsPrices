review/summary: Great suction, not much elsereview/text: This vacuum has the best suction I have seen in this price range. However, the extension hose does not extend at all. Having no light on the vacuum bothers me more than I thought it would. For straightforward vacuuming, the suction can't be beat. Otherwise, this vacuum is what one would expect for the price.
