review/summary: Not Great out of the box / much better with some prepreview/text: These are very nice, but take some preparation to make them cozy. Actually quite scratchy out of the box,,,,BUT, with the right treatment,,,,you are going to have your most FAVORITE SHEETS EVER!!!! I read other reviews about fabric softener. I put them through the washer three times with 2-4X the recommended fabric softener with cold and warm water. They got a little better. BUT,,,when I put them through a fourth time with HOT water, they came out soft and silky. They get softer with every wash. These are the thickest sheets I've found, but they don't feel heavy. THey actually breathe some. My next sheets WILL be Pinzon, and yours will too! I gave it four stars due to the extra mile in washes.
