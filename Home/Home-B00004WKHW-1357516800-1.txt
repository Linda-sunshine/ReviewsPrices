review/summary: the perfect giftreview/text: We bought this as a gift for our parents. They absolutely love it. The fact that is small and stores easily is a feature they love. As far as the performance , it does what it says it will do. It saves time and is much safer than chopping vegetables with a knife which was our primary reason for buying this product for them.
