review/summary: Good while still workingreview/text: We loved this humidifier when we first received it. It's been almost a year (but not quite) and it recently started making this horrible noise and stopped working. I like my other Crane humidifier better (drop shape)... it's more quiet, easier to clean, and is still working. This one is definitely cuter but at this point I'd rather have functionality!
