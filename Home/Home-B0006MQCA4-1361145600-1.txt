review/summary: Water Filterreview/text: After reading several reviews for a water filter, this dispenser was the most highly reviewed and recommended; rightfully so. The water coming out of my faucet was murky, and coming out of the dispenser was crystal clear. If you want clean water, you just found how to get it.
