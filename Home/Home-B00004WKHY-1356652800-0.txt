review/summary: broken in under 6 monthsreview/text: In less than 6 months, the motor just up and quick. Had very gentle and infrequent use, so it wasn't remotely abused. Amazon refund policy very short and doesn't cover. I don't think I'll buy expensive appliances from Amazon anymore. Bought the Breville Sous Chef - now that is a quality machine that will last a lifetime. I believe Cuisinart has gone downhill over the years and isn't remotely what it used to be.
