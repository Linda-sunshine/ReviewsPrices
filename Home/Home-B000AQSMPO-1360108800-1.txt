review/summary: How did I brew coffee before my Keurig??review/text: I honestly cannot remember how I brewed coffee before my lovely little single cup brewer! I love my Keurig Special Edition. I did, however, have to replace my 2 year old with a new one. But even it's shelf life is only 18 months - 2 years, it is totally worth it. Actually, when I replaced my machine, I bought two - hey, I need one at the office too!The only complaint I DO have...even though they have expanded the water tank on the new B60, I still fill it up 2-3 times a week. But that's still better than everyday with a regular brewer!Buy yourself one and enjoy!
