review/summary: meh... ok for dry storagereview/text: Despite the description I read before buying, these lids do not create a watertight seal on the jars. Liquids WILL leak if placed on their sides. That said, if you use them for dry goods or for liquids that are stored upright, say, in the refridgerator, they work ok. definitely not a replacement for the seal created by the usual metal lids.How hard would it have been to add a rubber seal to these??
