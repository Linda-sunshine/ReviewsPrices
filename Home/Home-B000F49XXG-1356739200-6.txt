review/summary: Great for the price!review/text: My husband bought this espresso maker for me for christmas this year. I love it! I use it everyday! The maker its self doesnt look cheap. If you know how to use an espresso maker or not this one is really pretty easy to use. I worked at Starbucks for 3 years so this maker was easy to use and fast. It takes about 10 min to heat up. I did notice after making 2 or 4 coffees you have to fill up the water in the back of the maker. That was everyother day for me so its not that bad. I would suggest that you buy espresso shot glasses, a frothing pitcher and frothing thermometer. Those will make it your espresso maker much more better. Dont wast your money on a tamper. The maker has one on the maker and its perfect. No need to buy one. The maker also makes very good foam and very fast. You dont even really need to try to make the foam it does it on it own. So that was nice. This is a great maker for everyday use and if you are looking for something simple and easy.
