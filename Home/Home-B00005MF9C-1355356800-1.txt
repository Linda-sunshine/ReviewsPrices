review/summary: cruise ship coffeereview/text: Cruise ship (Celebrity) makes terrible coffee.When I go on a cruise I take a pound of Starbucks and my Black & Decker make.It weighs nothing.Great product and I can adjust the strength .Better than Tassimo,and my wife is always,always happy.PERFECT PRODUCT.
