review/summary: This is a monster vacuum cleanerreview/text: Best vacuum cleaner that I have ever owned, Dyson is super expensive and dirtdevil is cheap product that doesn't last and hardly clean. This is just one amazing product, one thing I don't like, is that I had to pay double the price on amazon.ca
