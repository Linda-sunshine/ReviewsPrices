review/summary: Excellent and easy on the wristsreview/text: I have been using this for a couple of months after prolonged frustration with a competing product, and am completely satisfied with it. As I have arthritis in both wrists the Oster greatly reduces the pressure on them. A couple of times a cork has failed to be removed automatically from the opener, but gripping it with needle-nose pliers and pressing the eject button has done the trick. Highly and enthusiastically recommended.
