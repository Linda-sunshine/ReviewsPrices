review/summary: Great alarm clock!review/text: I received this alarm clock quickly and it was just as I expected! It has 2 alarm options which is great if your spouse sleeps later! ;) The only feature that took some time in getting used to was whenever you hit the &#34;snooze&#34; button, the alarm sound just softens, but doesn't completely become quiet. I wasn't used to this at first, but after sometime, I am used to it now and it does make sense - you can either fall back to sleep if you're a deep sleeper, or be like me, and just lay there in bed taking your time to wake up :) You can choose from 3 different settings to wake up to: nature sound, buzzer or radio. I like to wake up to the radio and fall asleep to the nature sounds. Somebody gave a review that the nature sounds weren't that realistic sounding..but I disagree..I think, either way, you *know* you're not at the beach, haha, but it's a good simulation! Great buy! Would recommend!
