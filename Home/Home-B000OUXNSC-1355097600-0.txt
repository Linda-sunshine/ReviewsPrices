review/summary: Good basic mattress padreview/text: Nothing fancy, but a good basic mattress pad. Not waterproof, but in most cases that's unneeded since the pad will absorb moderate amounts of liquid. A non-crinkley (i.e., quite when the sleeper moves) waterproof sheet under this pad wouldn't have the problems associated with waterproof pads (see reviews of those for issues).
