review/summary: Fantastic.review/text: I'm a huge tea fan, and have a lot of different varieties from all over the world--I spend extended time overseas, most recently in Sri Lanka, which is of course known for its tea. With this gadget, it's easy to make and enjoy the different ones I've collected. Can't speak to it's durability since have only had it a short while, but for ease of use, and clean up, it's a great item.
