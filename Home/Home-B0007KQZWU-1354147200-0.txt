review/summary: NOTHING cooks like Stainless steelreview/text: I read all the reviews and they were right on. My friends get a kick to see a grown man get excited about getting a new set of pots and pans. After growing up in a family restaurant you know what a good set of pans mean to the outcome of a meal. Don't go with the new fads, Nonstick only work well till you scratch them. Stainless steel is the way to go. They were beautiful, right out of the box (the day before Thanksgiving none the less) I retired my old tired miss matched set of some 28 year old pots. Time for some new blood or stainless steel. They got a real workout with kids home from college and 17 people over for Thanksgiving Dinner. The lived up to the reviews from "Happy as a steamed Clam!" and" R. P. Poletti" NOTHING cooks like Stainless steel. They were Beautiful to look at and heavy too, but not to heavy that you can't use one hand. I have them stacked in a draw, I hope they don't get too scratched up. I am now looking for a pot rack because they are nice enough to hang. I will add one more 3-quart saucepan before the next Holiday, just to have another handy.
