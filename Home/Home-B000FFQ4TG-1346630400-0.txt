review/summary: Ugh! I do not like this coffee maker!review/text: I am very disappointed in this coffee maker. Have had it now for 2 1/2 years. Must use a ton of grounds to get any flavor. Seems to clog a lot, had to remove small screw on button where the water comes through as it clogs so much. The worst thing is is that the side button to keep the water hot turns off easily. SHOULD be in a different location. I clean under the pot often as it seems to leak under the machine and it is SO easy to accidently turn the switch off when cleaning. No clicking noise, lights or anything to let you know the machine is off. TOOOOOOOO many mornings wake up and cannot make coffee as the machine, once clicked off from the side, has no hot water. Just a cold miserable mess to clean up. Can't wait to throw the whole mess in the garbage can
