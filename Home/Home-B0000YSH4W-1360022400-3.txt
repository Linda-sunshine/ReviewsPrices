review/summary: Masterpiece Novel!review/text: I absolutely loved this book! I should have read this book a lot earlier but I was not impressed by the cover, thinking that it was a boring book about an old man. It turns out that the main character is a young boy, and I fell in love with the Giver's (the man on the cover's) personality! I cannot wait to read the second book.Some parts I thought were very tragic, but that makes you care for the characters more. This is now one of my favorite books. Hooray for Lois Lowry, a writing genius!
