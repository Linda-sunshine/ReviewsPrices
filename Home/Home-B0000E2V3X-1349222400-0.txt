review/summary: Just Greatreview/text: I love this product. I think it is better than a stone. It heats in half the time. I pull it out of the oven, slide the pizza off the peel and put it back in the oven. To me, more control and ease than positioning on a stone in the oven and I don't have to remove a shelf to get angle on the pizza peel. There's more good comparison but this is enough. If you make "stone pizza" just buy it. You will be satisfied
