review/summary: Zojirushi vs Cuisinartreview/text: It was a toss up between the Zojirushi 10 cup thermal and the Cuisinart 12 cup thermal. I decided to go with the Zoji 10 cupper and am a happy customer for over a month. 3 things helped me decide. #1: The Cuisinart has a loud alarm when done brewing. If you have sleeping kids, then you know this will not do. #2: I noticed my doctor had one in his office and said he had it for 5 years and loves it. #3: 10 cups is just right for my wife and I. She drinks a cup, I drink a couple, and I have enough left over for my small Thermos. BTW: The thermal caraffe keeps it hot all day, especially if you rinse it out with hot water before brewing. EZ enough.
