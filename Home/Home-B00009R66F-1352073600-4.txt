review/summary: Cheap plasticreview/text: Received mine today. Immediately noticed it was a return but had not been used. Decided to assemble anyway. I was ready to send it back right away when I saw how the plastic was so thin and looked as if it would snap in just a few uses. Continued on until saw how the hose attachment would need to be hooked up. Very likely that panel would snap with first attachment. Stopped and packed the machine up for a return. I did not run the machine so I cannot attest to its performance. Definitely too cheap for me to risk. I will spend a few more dollars for a more sturdy machine.
