review/summary: The Best Water Filterreview/text: The best water filter opn the market. This has a 99% clean rate so it gets rid of everyone's medications. Your city water is pretty dirty!!!! Of course spring water from a country full flowing well can't be beat but who can afford to haul that pure water. The nearest one to me is 125 miles away called The Togo Spring located in MN. Depend on pure to keep you cleaner!!!! Fred Read
