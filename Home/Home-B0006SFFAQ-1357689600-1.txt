review/summary: Works Great!review/text: I received as a Christmas gift (2012). I've used every day since with no problems. The reservoir is located in the rear right hand corner, and is fairly narrow to fill - you ~might~ spill into the grounds if filling haphazardly. This has not been an issue for me. The programming is a snap and has worked flawlessly. I use paper filters so cannot comment on the gold filter. The instructions clearly state utilizing the gold filter only may result in grounds in the brew - I saw this as a complaint elsewhere...HELLO! Potential for clogs seems pretty obvious to me...The carafe is a durable clear plastic - cleans well. I haven't given it the drop test yet. I have pulled the carafe out mid brew with no issues. Enjoy!
