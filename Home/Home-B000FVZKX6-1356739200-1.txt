review/summary: Great sheets, but wash seperately multiple timesreview/text: Pros:Deep sheets for thick matresssDidnt shrinkDidnt pillExtremely comfortableGreat quality portuguese flannelBig enough on top so that you dont have to depress the corners of the matressCons:If you buy the dark color (i.e. brown) wash seperately MULTIPLE times as the color will run. I stupidly washed them for the second time with some nice cream color 600tc sheets and left splotchy stains on them. I read it in the reviews, but thought the reviewer was nut. I wont subtract a star because it was my own fault, but please do wash them seperately at least the first 6-7 times. Also, the dark color also shows dead skin flakes pretty quickly which is wierd but tells me when its time to wash :&#62;
