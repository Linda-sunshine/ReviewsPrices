review/summary: this holds a lot of water!review/text: this is ALMOST everything we expected from reading the reviews. the only trouble I have with it is that (in our new house) our refrigerator is an older model and this doesn't quite fit in the doorway. In the home we just sold it would have easily fit - we had a nice large fridge... SO, it takes up a bit of fridge space. Since we don't keep much in the fridge unless we're entertaining, it's okay. We just pull it out and move it to another location.It makes our water taste fantastic! We really LOVE it - and I drink over a gallon of water a day - so this was a great buy!
