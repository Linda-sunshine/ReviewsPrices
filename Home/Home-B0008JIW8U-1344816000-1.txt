review/summary: Good valuereview/text: The bottom line is that the coffee tastes good. I only drink Starbucks, ground immediately before brewing, so I'm picky about my coffee maker. For the price of this coffee maker, it brews the coffee at an appropriate temperature, in a reasonable time-frame and has a cone filter. The settings are intuitive and it doesn't really require instructions, unless you've never before owned a coffee maker and haven't programmed one. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.
