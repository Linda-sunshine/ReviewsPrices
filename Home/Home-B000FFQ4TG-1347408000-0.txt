review/summary: BUNN Velocity Brew--Slower than a Mulereview/text: When I first received the product, it looked great and worked good for about 6 weeks, then it got slower and slower, then it started running too much water through. Now, it takes over half-an-hour to make a pot of coffee. I would not recommend purchasing this model of Bunn. Very disappointed.
