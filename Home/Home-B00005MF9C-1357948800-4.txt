review/summary: Lightweight and Convenientreview/text: I had to switch to decaf for a few months and decided on this inexpensive one cup brewing system for use at the office. This machine is a good choice for those who don't like the staleness of pods, and prefer to use fresh, ground coffee. The machine is of cheap, lightweight plastic, with a short chord. It brews a decent cup of coffee in a relatively quick amount of time, so it's perfect for work. The sleek travel mug that comes with it is a bonus. Though the lining is made of plastic, not stainless. Overall, I'd recommend this machine as an addition to a better quality one. The lightweight, compact design makes it perfect for the office, college dorm, boat, etc.
