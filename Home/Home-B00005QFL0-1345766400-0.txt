review/summary: Great!review/text: I bought this machine 2 months ago and I love it. All the programs work great and I always get a perfect loaf! I am not a baker but this machine makes baking so easy. I love that you just put the ingredients in and you push a button and few hours later you have fresh bread. Even the fast cycle works great. I definetly recommend this bread machine!
