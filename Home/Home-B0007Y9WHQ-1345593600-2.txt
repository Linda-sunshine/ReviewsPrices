review/summary: Such a cool devicereview/text: I didn't believe you could replace pasta with something healthy, and have it taste good, but this does just that. My favorite thing so far is cucumber pasta. I didn't even like cucumbers prior to trying this! I placed the cold spiralized cucumbers in a bowl, then placed a combination of heated Kirkland (Costco) brand marinara (75%) with Kirkland Salsa (25%) on top, then sprinkled with a little parmesan. Sooooooo good! I couldn't believe how good it was, and just how great of a pasta substitute this would be. I wish it wasn't plastic, I hide it in a cupboard because of the platic, but I still very highly recommend this device. I think kids would love the cucumber spaghetti too, which would be a huge plus.
