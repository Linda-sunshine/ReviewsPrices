review/summary: Need Regular Cleaning & Short Cupreview/text: I got this for a gift and added the metal steamer cup. However I did not pay attention to the height of the cup. You need to make sure to order a short one. They have it here at Amazon. You really need it unless you want to figure out a short cup at home that can accomplish the same task.It does need cleaning every other month. I got some coffee cleaner at a local store. This is the same stuff you use to clean regular coffee makers. If you don't clean it it will stop working till you do it so make sure you have some on hand to avoid the coffee-less day.It's a great size machine and is rather small for it's power. You do need to heat up the machine about 30m before making a cup so turn it on right when you get up and it will be ready by the time you brush your teeth and fully make it to the kitchen.
