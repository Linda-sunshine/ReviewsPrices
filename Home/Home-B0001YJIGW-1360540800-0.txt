review/summary: Works perfectlyreview/text: If you don't look closely, the picture may be a bit deceiving as far as size is concerned. There is a good bit of space around the fixture in the photo (at the bottom) so if you are expecting this to perfectly fit the circumference of your fixture, you will be disappointed. However, that extra space has no affect on the functionality. It works great! I sat in the tub for quite awhile with it filled to capacity and not once was there a problem with the noisy draining that would happen without this product.
