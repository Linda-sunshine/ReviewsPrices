review/summary: Clean, Clear Waterreview/text: We live in a community which gets its water from a well. The water often looks brown and smells bad. I wouldn't even let my dogs drink the water. We decided to try the Brita water filter and couldn't be happier! It takes just a few minutes to collect clear, clean, great tasting water and no more toting water bottles home. I would highly recommend this.
