review/summary: I've bought the BJE200XL and the BJE820XL -- here is how they comparereview/text: See my review of the BJE820XL.I decided some family should also get into juicing. So I bought a Breville as a gift. Since I already forked out $400 on the 820, I decided to go cheep and get them a 200 for $100.Bottom line: it works just as well. There is little need to spend more on the 820.The main differences are the awesomely powerful motor of the 820: it hums away at a zillion RPM and doesn't break a sweat. However I put every type of vegetable through both and I can't really tell the difference.I would be hesitant to let the 200 run for long periods of time however.The 200 also needs to be emptied more regularly. You are not going to juice 2 full quarts of juice without overflowing the catcher.
