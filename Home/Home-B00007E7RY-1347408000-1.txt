review/summary: Love it. Would love it more if it was $16 cheaper.review/text: We have had our Honeywell 50250 for less than a week and are very pleased so far. One of the "joys" of our project home is dealing with every single window painted and nailed (!) shut. As such, the air is pretty stale and, in some rooms, musty. Right now, we're rotating the Honeywell from room to room. We can already notice a big difference.My reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars is two-fold: One, I've had it for less than a week, so I'm unsure of its durability. My second reason is a petty one, I'm afraid: Amazon is selling it for $16 cheaper than the price I bought it just one week ago.Of course, if Amazon refunds me my $16, I'll happily add back the fifth star! :-)
