review/summary: Very Disappointedreview/text: I was replacing the one I got 6 or 7 years ago that the blade had become dull. This new one, is not very good at all. When you try to chop pickles, celery, onion, chicken, etc...you get big chunks that have not been chopped very well. I did not have this problem with the other Food Chopper. I am going back to the old one. This one doesn't get the job done.
