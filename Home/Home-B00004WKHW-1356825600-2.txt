review/summary: Powerful enough for most usesreview/text: I use this all the time--works great, cleans easily, doesn't overheat. I use it for chopping everything, and especially onions (don't like to cry!)Cool tip that isn't the first thing to come to mind for a food processor: you can make fresh flatbreads in just a few minutes (e.g. Indian naan bread). Just toss the ingredients in it and pulse, the dough comes together quickly. Let it rest/rise as you see fit or as per recipe and then roll it into balls, flatten, and fry it on a non-stick pan.
