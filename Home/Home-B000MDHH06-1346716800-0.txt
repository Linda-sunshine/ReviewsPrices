review/summary: Amazing juicer and incredibly easy to cleanreview/text: I was a bit hesitant to buy a juicer because of how notorious they are to clean. But the Breville really impressed me in that regard. Clean-up took less than two minutes at the most. There are just three components to clean and it is a cinch. It also yields an impressive amount of juice compared with other juicers I have seen, and the Breville is much quieter. I also have to confess that it was a lot of fun to throw the veggies in there and watching them get ameliorated in microseconds while I watched with a child-like glee! I feel that for the price the Breville was an amazing investment. Incredibly satisfied with my purchase.***Update: Tips that really helped me out after a few weeks of juicing:***1) Wash the juicer immediately after use. Dry fruit particles are difficult to wash away on any surface, and the Breville is no exception. Washing immediately after use also prevents discoloring or staining of the plastic components.2) Make sure to remove the pits of fruits or vegetables, the Breville will separate them from the juice it produces, but juicing with the pits are likely to prematurely wear down the blades.3) The motor is quiet for its strength, but particles come out the top if you do not immediately push the plunging mechanism in after throwing the fruits or vegetables inside the juicer.4) Adding a bit of water to highly acidic juices (like fresh OJ) makes the flavor milder, and also yields more juice!
