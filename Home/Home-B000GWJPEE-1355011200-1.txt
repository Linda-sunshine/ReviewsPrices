review/summary: Doesn't circulate well enoughreview/text: I ended up getting this on the recommendation of Consumer Reports magazine and the good reviews here. My major gripe with this humidifier is that I feel that the mist doesn't rise and expand enough. It kind of shoots out of the &#34;mouth&#34; and falls flat. I don't have too much experience with humidifiers but I was expecting something different. I was envisioning this mist enveloping more of the room instead of pretty much just falling flat. If you buy this I would advise setting it up high somewhere for maximum effect.
