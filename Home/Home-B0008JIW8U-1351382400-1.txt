review/summary: Coffee has terrible plastic odor.review/text: I have owned the previous model of Mr. Coffee's 4-cup Coffeemaker for 5 years and was very pleased with it. I thought I would like to upgrade to their newest 4-cup model. Well, after buying and receiving this new model from Amazon, I have brewed around 14 pots of coffee. Each pot of coffee has had a distinct plastic odor and a flavor I can only describe as 'unusual'. Additionally, using the same amount of water and coffee grounds, the resultant brew is consistently much weaker than that of it's predecessor. I am returning this coffee maker for a refund.
