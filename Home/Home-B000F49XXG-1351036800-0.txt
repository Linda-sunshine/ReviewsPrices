review/summary: Broke after a month of usereview/text: I bought this machine because of the price, after two months of use the pump failed. I used to make a cup a day so it was not overused. I sent it to repair to an authorized shop in Texas and the machine never came back!!! not only Delonghi failed with the machine but also with the service and warranty. I would never ever buy this brand again.
