review/summary: willreview/text: Outstanding dutch oven (pot), It is a good pot to cook soups or meats that need to be cooked for long time and it does the job. I have been wanting one for a while because I have Lodge Logic skillets also and use them all the time. I love the way it holdes and spreads the heat over the bottom. This will be very useful this winter when cooking. The price even beat Wal-Mart more than five dollars.
