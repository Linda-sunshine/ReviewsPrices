review/summary: Great pitcher but a little bit heavyreview/text: This is a great jug. I am all about the ease of cleaning. I like this jug because of its wide opening. I can hand wash it easily with my hand all the way in it. Or put it in the dishwasher knowing that the water will be able to reach every spot. The only downside is that it is very heavy. That's why I gave only 4 stars. I will still purchase it again though!
