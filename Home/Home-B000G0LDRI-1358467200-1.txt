review/summary: Excellent humidifier! Worth every penny!review/text: We could not be happier with this unit. I have many valuable musical instruments and we heat by pellet stove. A very bad combination! Since purchasing this Honeywell HCM-6009 we have kept the house at 50% humidity constantly. Previously with a room humidifier we were seeing 16%. You set the unit and forget about it. It does require a couple of refills during the day, but I am able to know my collection is being kept at the recommended humidity. The unit works flawlessly!
