review/summary: Sensational little productreview/text: So with all these 5-star reviews, I thought I would give this nifty little vacuum a try. I wondered if everyone was on crack since they were raving so much about it because really, how much power could it have?? And the answer is: A LOT!!!! The suction is so strong that you have to use a little strength to pull it along the couch but you know, if that's the worst of my complaints, then I'm in shape. And it is. In the interest of full disclosure, the vacuum only arrived today but it's worked fabulously. It comes with an attachment to get into tiny spaces and at first, I thought the only downfall was that there was nowhere to attach it to the unit when it wasn't in use and then I discovered that it could fit into the vent in the back. Snaps right in there which makes me think that's where it was meant to be. This is perfect for couches, cars, minivans, stairs, you name it. Even gave the curtains a going over and it was a champ.Enjoy the power of this mighty little beast.
