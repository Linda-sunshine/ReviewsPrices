review/summary: Amazing productreview/text: I have been using this for many years now. This seems to remove everything leaving only crisp clean water with no noticeable flavor caused by impurities. I definitely noticed a difference. Its a quality product and filters are reasonably priced. It will last you a long long time as long as you dont drop it. I stuck mine in my fridge and I always have clean cold water whenever I want. It doesnt take long to filter all the water. Even holds enough to use for filling large cooking pots if you would like to filter that as well.
