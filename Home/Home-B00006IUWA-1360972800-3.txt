review/summary: Great machinereview/text: Only downside is that it is a bit big. But it pops fast; almost every kernel pops. The resulting corn is huge and fluffy and very tasty. If you love greasy movie theatre popcorn you will probably not like air popped corn, because it is dry - but the payoff is that there is a much stronger popcorn taste when using the air popper. Because there is no oil, you can eat a huge bowlful for around 150 calories (that's about a quarter cup of unpopped corn) - compare that to microwave popcorn which typically is anywhere between 300 and 450 calories for less than half of the quantity of corn you get out of the air popper. If you want a great snack food while you are dieting, this is the only way to go!
