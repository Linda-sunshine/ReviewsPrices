review/summary: I really like this....... butreview/text: So this machine can do something that my machine at work cannot do (Gaggia Classic); I can get a great pull using Lavazza pre-ground espresso with impressive amounts of creama. That said, I typically use Trader Joe's medium roast ground at the store and really enjoy the taste and overall am very happy with this machine. The issues, as I see it, are the following: steel cover on the catch try doesn't want to stay put, The wand is not high enough and the built in tamper makes a mess. None of these are a deal breaker- so yes I am happy
