review/summary: Good product, does the jobreview/text: Good humidifier for bathroom (or small room). It does the job of a dehumidifier. Only problem is, it does not have any kind of automatic sensor so that it starts and shuts off automatically but otherwise it works. Energy footprint is very small (using Kill-A-Watt).Recommended.
