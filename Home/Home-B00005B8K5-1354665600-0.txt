review/summary: Great dishes, but putting the lids on the bowls is hard!review/text: I love Pyrex and always try to purchase there dishes, whether its for storing or baking. I just find that the lids for their bowls, especially the smaller ones like in this set, take forever to put back on. The two smaller bowls in this set have the same problem. I will be giving these away to someone else and keeping the bigger dishes. Maybe they just need to get stretched out. I wish Pyrex fixes this.
