review/summary: Basic classic waffle maker that works wellreview/text: This is a basic classic waffle maker that works well. This type of waffle maker is getting harder to find, as most available waffle makers of this size are the Belgian waffle makers. As other reviews have stated, the temperature control knob mechanism is flimsy, but so far after a few months its fine. I set it at the number 3 setting and leave it alone. The waffles are usually done as the green ready light comes on. Too much batter will result in the overflow near the temperature control, so the use of a measuring cup is recommended. With some trial and error, you should be able to make waffles suited to your tastes.
