review/summary: KDB Momreview/text: I have owned this iron since 2005. This is the greatest iron for any household. I received it as a Christmas gift from my father. He was in the search a iron at my request, although I was just expecting a plain old iron as a gift. I was pleasantly surprised when I received it and have been enjoying it ever since. I ordered another one just to have for guests that stay over night. You will not be disappointed.
