review/summary: Toaster/mini ovenreview/text: I have had this Toastation for about 3 weeks now. The toaster works great, no problems of uneven toast. The oven itself is small. I have cooked veggie burgers, tater tots, and homemade hot pockets with no problem, I don't think a large slice of pizza would work though. The oven itself cooks items very fast, I have to watch it otherwise I have burnt burgers. One drawback, there is no timer. It is a great space saver too!
