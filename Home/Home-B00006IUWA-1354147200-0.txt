review/summary: Fast!...but not as good as stove popped popcornreview/text: This product does make popcorn very fast!...there's no question there. I do have problems with blazing-hot unpopped kernels flying at the speed of sound around the room, but that ends once the corn starts popping at a higher rate.Is it just me, or does air popped corn seem stale? For years, I've been making popcorn on the stove in a huge pot. It's always light and fluffy even though I use a bit of olive oil. The air-popped popcorn seems like it's already several days old immediatly after being popped.I love the convenience of the air popper, but having a hard time getting used to &#34;gummy&#34; popcorn.
