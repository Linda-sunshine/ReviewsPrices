review/summary: Great little coffee makerreview/text: I am the only one in the household who drinks coffee. My little 4 cup maker was getting a little worn and dirty. At work I had a single cup press device that looked great but made the worst cup of coffee. I bought 2 of the Black and Decker Brew'n Go makers and am very happy with them. Easy to use and clean and makes a decent single cup of coffee.
