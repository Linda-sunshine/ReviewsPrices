review/summary: Love the ventilated version!review/text: I no longer can sleep on beds w/o memory foam.A good nights rest depends on it!Before, I had the non ventilated one and it gets real hot in the summer.This one is just perfect! Circulates the hot air and keeps the temperature comparable to any conventional mattress.5 stars!
