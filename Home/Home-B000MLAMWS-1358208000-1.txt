review/summary: Wish I'd bought one decades ago!review/text: FINALLY purchased a stand mixer with a 3 piece pasta attachment kit and I am pleased. I hesitated always because of price, how much space it would take up and how to decide on the size of machine. I have a small kitchen and always talked myself out of it until my remodel. Now with more storage space I splurged and bought a big one. My only complaint WOULD have been that it may not work as well on a small batch of dough as a smaller bowl would and then I found out today I can purchase a 3 qt bowl and whip to use as well! I'm thrilled and wish I'd purchased this years ago. I used the sheet roller pasta attachment for ravioli and it was fun and not too hard. However, don't do as the instruction book says - it suggests that you roll to 4 or 5. That is way too thick for ravioli, so do roll it to the thinnest for ravioli. Downside: really big and really heavy.
