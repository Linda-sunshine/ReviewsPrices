review/summary: only one drawbackreview/text: Great product except that I wish it could be used for smaller amounts of stuff. For example, if I chop up a little garlic, it seems like it all jumps to the outer edges before it gets chopped enough so I add a red pepper to the garlic just so it will work better. I still have to use a spatula to scrape the sides about 3 or 4 times which is not very energy efficient (turning a motor off and on several times is not energy efficient). I don't have any other brands to compare it to, but everything seems to work well. I mostly use it to puree veggies, cooked and raw. I think if you wanted more of a diced product, it would be more of a challenge.
