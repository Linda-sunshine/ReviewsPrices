review/summary: Eureka is awesome!review/text: I just got my hand-held vacuum and took it out of the box and went to use it to clean out my van. I must say this little bugger has some powerful suction! I used the spinning brush option to get the bulk of the dirt and this thing suctioned the carpet so well it was almost stuck to the floorboard. After getting the bigger sections I used the hose to get the smaller areas. WOW! The hose reached everywhere I needed it to and picked up fuzz and grass and little pebbles like a pro. Once I got finished I took the dust cup off to inspect what was picked up. There was long strands of hair, short strands of hair, grass, dust, dirt, and even cat hair... never had a cat in the van before. Once I was finished the carpets look brand new, almost like straight out of the factory!So, I like this thing very much. It was my first use, so I will have to update after a few more uses.Love the way the cord wraps around the end, and it wasn't so short for me as some reviews said it was for them.I bought the mini-vac attachments that Amazon "suggested" to purchase with this handheld and they do fit. Plan on using them to clean keyboards, PS3, and computer tower.UPDATE: Feb. 5th, 2013 and I have had no problems what so ever with this vacuum. I use it at least once a week, more if the kids track grass into my vehicle. This little booger even got pine needles out of my carpet after hauling a Christmas tree in the back of my van. Love this little machine!
