review/summary: Very Loud!review/text: Received the product and set it up as instructed however I was disappointed of how loud it is. It doesn't matter the setting (Low or High) it makes the same loud humming. I took it a part to pin point the culprit and found that the humming comes from the vibration of the plastic enclosure. So far I haven't been able to find an optimal solution to minimize the vibration. Very disappointed with it.
