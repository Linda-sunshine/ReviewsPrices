review/summary: 5 years and this bread maker keeps on trucking along!review/text: I gave this bread maker to my parents for Christmas 5 years ago. They use it at least once a week to make rye and dark/white mixed bread.Thats around 260 loaves already (over 1000 operating hours) and other than some discoloration of plastic over time due to heat (top cover (plastic) is off color with the rest of the unit (metal), but who cares? Its off by a tone, and really, it doesnt look bad at all) this unit is performing 5 years later as it did on day one. No issues at all.With the quality of construction I wouldnt be surprised if it easily lasted another decade or two with regular use.If there was one thing I wish this unit had it would be a window. Window would be neat, but not really that important. Thats just a nitpick.Overall this unit makes great bread, and in our experience if the bread didnt come out right it was due to us experimenting with recipes. Every recipe that is from the book came out perfectly!My parents love it!
