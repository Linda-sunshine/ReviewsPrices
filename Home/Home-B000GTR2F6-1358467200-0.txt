review/summary: PROBLEM BREWER...BEWAREreview/text: There is a probblem with this model brewer. After a short amount of time the selonid leaks onto the air pump and transformer. This will shorten the life of this machine. You know it's going when it can only deliver 4oz or no coffe at all!The other problem is it must remain upright or water leaks back into selonoid and clogs it from opening..thus no coffee.AVOID THIS MODEL!!
