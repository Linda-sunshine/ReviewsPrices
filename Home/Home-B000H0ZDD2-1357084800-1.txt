review/summary: It did not do the job....review/text: I purchased this item for the greenhouse because some of the wintered plants were getting mold on the leaves. The greenhouse is 560 cubic feet and has a 94% humidity at 46 degrees Fahrenheit . I ran the EVD-1100 for 96 hours straight and managed to remove 1 tablespoon of water and the humidity in the greenhouse went up to 96% during the test period. I'm sending it back.
