review/summary: 2 out of 3 leakedreview/text: It's really a pity, because it could be a great kettle: Nice design, the heating element is covered for easy cleaning, it is cordless and has a small-holed sieve which comes in very handy if there is a lot of calcium in the water. BUT: Two out of three leaked when left with water in them. This means that the base ends up standing in a puddle of water - DANGEROUS! I could replace them without problem, and the third one works as it ought to. But it was quite a lot of hassle, which I didn't bargain for.
