review/summary: Sound not great and can't read numbers at different angles.review/text: You can't read the numbers from certain angles on the clock feature. It's really bad, like the numbers fade out depending on how you look at it. The sounds were not great but doable. The antenna broke off when I unpacked it. We returned it between the crappy antenna and not being able to read the clock on our night stand.
