review/summary: Durable, reliable, perfect for small householdsreview/text: I've owned this Zojirushi Rice Cooker for five years, since 2007, and it's still going strong. It cooks the rice perfectly, once you figure out the best rice/water ratio for your taste (which is not necessarily exactly as measured & marked on the cooking bowl). You can also make other dishes, such as cereals and puddings, with this cooker.I love the cute little tunes it plays, rather than the usual buzzer sound, when it starts and finishes cooking. Nice touch. It's also small and compact, and fits nicely on a shelf in a cabinet or unobtrusively on a counter, and is very easily cleaned. It has maintained a 'new' appearance for all these years. It also has a time clock that remains on even when unplugged.The only negative I have with this cooker, and I believe this will be true of all Zojirushi rice cookers, is with the nonstick bowl that you use to cook the rice in. It is too easily scratched. While it doesn't appear that any nonstick particles are flaking off from the one scratch I have on this bowl, I sometimes wonder. I have tried to be very careful with the bowl, using only wood or plastic spatulas to stir and serve (and yes, it does come with a plastic spatula which I long ago lost), but somehow it still got scratched (I think I'll blame my husband for it!). I've rated the product 4 stars rather than 5 because of this bowl issue.I do recommend this rice cooker for anyone who doesn't wish to make large quantities of rice (this will make two+ cups at a time). I think overall Zojirushi manufacturers quality products. I also own one of their bread makers and am likewise pleased with that.
