review/summary: Awful smell and Tastereview/text: This kettle works like a charm and is very easy to keep clean, however it spoils the smell and taste of the tea. There is some kind of rubber or silicone at the base of the kettle, around the heating element. No matter what I tried, (vinegar, lemon juice, baking soda) I can't get rid of it. I always use filtered water, so it's not the water. I'm very disappointed, because it otherwise worked wonderfully and was easy to clean. It was also a good size. But I'm throwing it out. I love tea, but I can't stand it from this kettle. Oddly enough, I gave my mother the same kettle for her birthday a while back and she loves it. That's why I purchased it myself. I've had tea at her house and it's excellent. They must have changed the way they make the kettles. Too bad. Oh, and by the way, the customer care is horrible. They don't care that you wasted your money on their product. ($79.00 at Macy's!) I sure wish I'd saved the box and sales slip. Macy's would have taken it back, no questions...
