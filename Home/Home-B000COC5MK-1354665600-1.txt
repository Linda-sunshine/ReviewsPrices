review/summary: cheap feel, not strong enough, won't hold chargereview/text: Took a chance on this and I am not pleased. This looks okay from a distance, but up close, it has a cheap, plastic, light feel. After the first full charge, it removed a couple of corks okay. Then, even when fully charged, it did not have the power to pull a cork even halfway out. I would stay away from this product. It failed after the return window so now I'm stuck with it. Buying a new lever-action corkscrew now and will be done with this.
