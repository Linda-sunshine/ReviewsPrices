review/summary: is it supposed to be that noisy?review/text: Who doesn't love ice cream?? And how much fun isn't it to make your own??I wanted to figure out the latter part, I already know the answer to the first question.So, I put it all together, and I was ready to make my first home made ice cream. I had already prepared the ingredients, and I put them into the machine.Fast forward 25 minutes (you really don't need to do anything for 25 minutes while the machine does the work for you)The ice cream was ready, it looked really good, almost like some of the soft serve you see all around. I scooped it up and tried it. &#34;Yum... Naaah..&#34; I think I need to work on my recipe.If it doesn't taste good it's not the machines fault, it's you (or your recipe).Pros:- Great machine to have at home for that one day where you really crave ice cream and want something different, or maybe just want something that you can't buy anywhere. You can make your own flavors.- It makes a lot of ice cream. I'd say at least for 4 people, maybe even more.- Fairly quick (this process alone, I'll come back to it)- Easy to store/put together. Only have 4(?) parts.Cons:- Noisy. It was really, unexpectedly loud.- If you want to make less than a full bowl the machine doesn't handle it all too well.- Although the ice cream process is fairly quick (25 minutes) all the preparation is quite time consuming. Bowl needs to be frozen for at least 12 hours before you start making (just keep it in the freezer is my suggestion). You need to prepare the ingredients and mix them well before they go into the machine.- The ice cream melts pretty quick.I like it, and I'll keep using it for sure, I can't wait for the summer!!
