review/summary: Poor qualityreview/text: Our pitcher arrived unscathed, however we were never able to pour with the lid on. We tried everything and were only able to pour with the lid removed. A few days after purchase and the lid broke the plastic handle snapped right off and will not turn anymore. Nice glass pitcher...terrible lid. Very disappointed. Not the usual high quality We have come to expect with our Amazon purchases.
