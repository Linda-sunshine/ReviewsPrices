review/summary: Love these things!review/text: These Silpat things are a Godsend....I have one that I've used and used and used, and bought this as a silly gift knowing that once they get over the tin-foil or greased cookie sheet habit, they'll end up replacing this one kitchen item again, and again, and again. I myself could do with a new one! As my husband says, &#34;Those French make good cooking stuff!&#34;
