review/summary: What a thing!review/text: Look I'll be honest I don't like tea and I don't drink tea (on account of the horrendous flavor), but I sure do love this teapot. Make any kind of drink and put it in there and serve it in the coolest way possible. Also great if you have some crazy person in your house that likes pulp in their orange juice (WTF, right?!). Now you don't need to buy separate orange juice you can just strain out that nasty pulp with this!!
