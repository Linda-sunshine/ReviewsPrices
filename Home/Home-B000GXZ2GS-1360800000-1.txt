review/summary: for 1 or 2 cups. great coffee. not the easiest to use but here's how I do it.review/text: very different. great coffee. not the easiest to use. I am posting because I find it very hard to press the plunger down, but I discovered a way.( if you have good balance)I put it on the floor, cup and all, and carefully use my foot to press it down. Not with shoes on, of course.CAREFULLY as a spill could burn.Also you can rinse off the filter, let it dry and use it again once or twice.
