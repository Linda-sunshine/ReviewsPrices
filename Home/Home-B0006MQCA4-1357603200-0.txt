review/summary: So far so goodreview/text: I do not test my filtered water for every impurity known to man, I have blind faith and drink cold filtered PUR water that came from my kitchen sink, which in my neck of the woods is not high on the clean water list, however it tastes clean so thumbs up. If you are super anal and need to know every impurity that touches your lip move on, and never eat at a restaurant.
