review/summary: My mom loved this and asked for it for Christmasreview/text: When I had my most recent child, my mom came to help out. She fell in love with our can opener and asked for one for Christmas :) We love this can opener too. It is very easy to use which is nice b/c I have early arthritis. This is the BEST can opener I have ever had. I would definitely recommend it and many of the other Zyliss products!
