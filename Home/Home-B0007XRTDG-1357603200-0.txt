review/summary: Far Superior to a Frying Pan!review/text: I have wanted one of these for years! While visiting relatives this Christmas, I saw they had one and asked them how much they are. Needless to say I was surprised by the low cost! I've had mine for about a week now and I use it almost every day.Function: It was interesting to read the reviews with the users saying it was too large. I find it's too small! I guess I cook a lot of food but I am not able to cook bacon for the whole family and pancakes or eggs at the same time. While I still have to cook some of the food separately due to space, it is far more convenient that using frying pans on the stove top! As others have said, the heat range on this device is great. It heats up/cools fast, and heat is pretty consistent along the surface. I did notice that the outer edges are hotter, but it's not much of an issue.Clean Up: Two words, incredibly easy. The non-stick works very well, and I'm able to clean left-over food/grease with no problem. There's no grease traps, you must pour the grease out via one of the corners, but it's easy enough to do it without spilling due to the large plastic handles.Overview: I would highly recommend this unit for anyone out there considering buying one. I feel like it is well worth the low cost and will pay for itself many times over by the time saved cooking less and cleaning less over conventional methods!
