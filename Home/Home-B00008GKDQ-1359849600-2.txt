review/summary: Great griddle, not great for induction stovesreview/text: We got this to replace our All-Clad 14" round griddle, which was not compatible with our new Jenn-Air induction stove. We liked the large form-factor, especially since the Jenn-Air has a "bridge" setting that connects two adjacent cooking coils to produce one large, coherent induction field.The griddle itself is top-notch, I love cooking on it. But it is marginal at best with the Jenn-Air. The problem appears to be that the grease-retention ridges around the outside of the griddle are too tall, so the main plate does not couple well with the induction coils.What do I mean by "marginal at best"? Well, induction stoves detect the presence of ferrous metal by probing the resonant frequency of the heating coil. If the resonant frequency is too high, then the stove will refuse to drive power into the field (lest it cook itself and interfere with local AM stations... :-). With the grill side down (griddle side up) our stove detects the Lodge Logic Pro ... sometimes. With the grill side up (griddle side down) it never detects it.We've found that by lowering our downdraft fan until griddle is hot, we can reliably use the griddle side to cook pancakes and eggs - but if the downdraft is up, the slight change in the field response is enough that the stove won't respond.In short: I you have a conventional stove by all means get it. But if you have an induction stove, be very wary. It is cast iron, but the geometry makes it probably not What You Want.
