review/summary: Good Potreview/text: After Hurricane Sandy I wanted a percolator so that I can make coffee without having to be creative. I read a lot of the reviews and decided to give this a try. We made a few pots of coffee already and they were the best we tasted in a while. The construction is good and I tried making coffee with and without a filter in the basket. Both worked fine. There were very few grounds when we did not use a filter and I would do it again. It is simply easier to clean if a basket or circular filter is used, but as I said, it's not necessary.The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars was the plastic top to view the coffee as it is brewing. Otherwise, it seems solid and makes great coffee.
