review/summary: Truth in Advertising!review/text: Was a bit leery getting this kettle after reading some reviews .. but I really have to say "Wow" it's small, boils water almost immediately and gets this simple task done simply. I smelled the "plastic" smell, but after one full-pot boil it was gone.One thing .. the very first time I ever used it, it took awhile to heat up .. now it goes like gangbusters... guess it has to prime or something.
