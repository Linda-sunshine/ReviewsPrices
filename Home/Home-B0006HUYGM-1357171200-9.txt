review/summary: Works Great!!review/text: This is all I need for my couch and area rug!!!! I have 2 cats and their fur imbeds in my corduroy couch like crazy. This vacuum pulls ALL of it out! I love the bristles, they work perfectly and literally pull the cat hair that is stuck out of the couch. The attachment is perfect too. Plus, I get a great work out when I use it, as it is a tad bit heavy. I use it on my small flat area rug too. The rest of the house is hardwood so this really fits my needs for removing cat hair. That's all I wanted it for, and it does it perfectly!
