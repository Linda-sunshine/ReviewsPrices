review/summary: Made my back straighter the first nightreview/text: I won't lie, my husband and I both woke up in pain after the first night. However, as many others have reported, it is a different kind of pain. It was fascinating to look in the mirror and see myself standing straighter and walking straighter from better spine alignment. We have been using it 3-4 weeks now and it definitely is not as &#34;cushy&#34; as it started out, but it still has extended the life of our sagging mattress. And ours smelled of the green tea treatment and we found it to be a lovely relaxing and clean scent for bed. Will purchase another when this one is done.
