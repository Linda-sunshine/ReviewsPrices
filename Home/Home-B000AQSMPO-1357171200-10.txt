review/summary: One Year Wonder!review/text: There seems to be some sort of flaw with this machine.Like many of the other reviews We had ours for just over a year and in that time period the B60 worked wonderfully. The coffee was very good, fast, easy, no mess exactly what we wanted. Then one day it started making a weird noise when it was pumping water to heat it up. That noise lasted about 2 months until all of the sudden it only produced about 3/4 of an inch of coffee at a time. The machine still turns on, functions normally, just won't make more than that 3/4 inch of coffee.I don't think it's a coincidence that everyone has problems around the same time period.Buyer Beware you are probably going to need to buy a new one every year and a half!
