review/summary: Horrible user designreview/text: Does it's job in cleaning the water. Instantly tastes better.Does take a few minutes for the thing to fill. You fill the reservoir in the top and wait for it to drain to the bottom, come back a few minutes later and repeat until filled.It has a filter use counter in the top that measures the number of pours and then tells you to replace the filter. The filters are expensive - bad for the consumer and good for the company. I would guess the counter runs a little on the short use side.The design is horrible though when pouring. The lid doesn't anchor to the top - it simply lays on it. Tilt to pour and "BAM" the lid falls off onto your glass of water. I have cleaned up more filtered water than I have drank with this.I'm not sure what that does to the filter counter - probably throws it off.Really BRITA - how did this make it through user testing?I would tell you to look at some of the other models.
