review/summary: Durable and Versatilereview/text: We have had this water kettle for 6 years and use it at least every day. It is still just as good as the first day we got it. We use it for french press coffee, instant oatmeal, tea, and to heat up bottles for our little guy. It isn't much faster than boiling the same amount of water on an electric stove, but it is so much more convenient to just flip a switch! It is a little noisy, but we have been nothing but pleased with this product and are happy that it is still going strong, as we have gotten a few small appliances recently that have not lasted as well or as long.
