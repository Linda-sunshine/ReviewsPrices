review/summary: Bargain for the pricereview/text: I have purchased this knife a total of three times; one for my girlfriend, one for my mother, and most recently, one for me. Both my girlfriend's and my mother's have stayed sharp for a very long period of time and have shown great performance. Mine however, became dull very quickly. I am not sure why this is. I always hand wash and store appropriately. Either way, I would still recommend this to anyone looking for a good, affordable knife. I have also used this knife with a sharpener (diamond rotary sharpener) and it sharpens very nicely.
