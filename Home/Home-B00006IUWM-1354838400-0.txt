review/summary: I'd give this a zero rating if it were possiblereview/text: This electric sharpener nearly ruined my good knives. I followed the directions very carefully and after trying several times to get a good edge on my knives, realized that it was actually harming the blades rather than sharpening them. I took it and the knives to a professional for sharpening. We found that it had blunted the edges because one of its grinding stones was misshapen and out of alignment and could not be fixed. Fortunately, my knives could be saved.This is a really cheap sharpening instrument and you don't know if you're going to get one that's been properly constructed or not. My advice is that is you value your knives and want an electric sharpener, pay up and get a really good one, or do as I do. I am now back to having my knives professionally sharpened and keeping the edge with a ceramic 'steel' in between. Since I didn't want a replacement, I tossed this one. Regained some cupboard space and learned my lesson.
