review/summary: Preppers - listen upreview/text: This is for just the cap only... see the picture. The hose is a separate item. I have the brake bleeder, and now the cap. I had to order the hose direct from food saver. they were $3 each. if you order 2 from food saver, the shipping stays the same. so it pays to order 2 when you do order. When I get the hose attachment I will figure out how to connect at that time.As always, I write my reviews as comprehensive as possible. Hope it helps.
