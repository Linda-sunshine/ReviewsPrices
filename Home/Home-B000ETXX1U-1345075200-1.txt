review/summary: Great for long periods of usereview/text: I purchased a much more expensive air mattress from Amazon as a primary sleeping surface before buying an Insta-bed. I must admit that i was a little skeptical having faced daily leaks on the more expensive, albeit smaller AeroBed ($279.00), which i used for about 3 weeks. Once i got my new mattress, along with the "Pinzon Basics/Pike Street Overfilled Ultra Soft Microplush Queen Mattress Pad" & "LINENSPA Wrinkle-Free Lightweight Oversized Microfiber 4-Piece Bed Sheet Set, QUEEN SILVER SAGE", i was all ready for a good nights sleep. Much to my surprise, that's EXACTLY what i got! As a matter of fact, i got a great nights sleep on the mattress for the next 5 months! Yes folks, i slept on the mattress for 5 solid months with never a leak and only putting air in the mattress about every 4 - 5 weeks, simply to adjust the firmness of either the internal (center) or external (surrounding) air chambers.So... if you're looking for a GREAT mattress, for one night or for 5 months for that matter, this is the mattress you should choose!!
