review/summary: Indispensable in my kitchenreview/text: I've had this kitchen tool for about a year now. While I use it to puree soups, etc., the major use is to make a fruit smoothie every morning for my breakfast. I had used a regular tabletop blender before as well as trying out a Nutibullet, and neither worked as well as the SmartStick. Typically I start with OJ and a banana, then add a lot of frozen fruit, including some whole strawberries and fairly large pieces of other fruit. I get beautiful, smooth, creamy smoothies every time. Although the rotar blade detaches to put in the dishwasher, I never bother. I just run the end under the tap to clean, dry it, and put it away ready for the next morning. I have read reviews here about how the SmartSticks break easily, but I haven't had that problem. If I do, I will just buy another one, since they are so cheap.
