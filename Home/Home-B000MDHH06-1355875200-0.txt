review/summary: works very well!review/text: i love this juicer, it arrived on time and i couldn't be more pleased with it. The only thing is the food trapper thing, the part that needs to be scabbed cause the food gets in it did loose its shape. Meaning the metal bent a little and it most likey will need to be replaced, but i think that happens and its something that most likely needs to be replaced with time. Anyway I'm pleased!
