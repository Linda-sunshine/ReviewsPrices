review/summary: Easiest, fastest, cheapest, and best coffee I have hadreview/text: Having just moved back to the US from Europe, I was eager to find a way to get a great cup of coffee. Having just completed an expensive move I was also eager to not pay a lot. I bought the AeroPress after hearing the great reviews but still did not expect much. I expected to get this to hold me over till I could get something better. I was blown away by the results. This definitely produces the best cup of coffee I have had in years.Some things to keep in mind. Buy cheap beans or ground beans, and you will get boring, tasteless coffee. This isnt going to perform magic. As soon as you pour in the water, stir it for a few seconds, otherwise its likely the water will just drain through. Finally when you start pushing the plunger down, stop pushing. Just rest your arm on the plunger and let it fall slowly. I tend to boil my water to 190 or 200 F (still deciding which I like better).I have read some of the negative reviews. I don't understand how they came to such a vastly different conclusion about this thing.
