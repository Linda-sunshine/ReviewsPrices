review/summary: Silicon Ice Traysreview/text: When we got this product, we were in love. They were fantastic ice trays but after a few months of using them, we noticed that our ice started to taste foul. After a while, we stopped using ice all together and figured that it was the odors in the freezer that were being absorbed by the ice. I finally decided to try different ice trays by rubbermaid and discovered that the ice tasted normal again and had no after taste. Turns out that these silicon trays were making our ice taste bad which is pretty scary to think that something has been leaching from the silicon trays into our ice. I would never recommend or use these silicon trays ever again. Immediately throw into the trash!
