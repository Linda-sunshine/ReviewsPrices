review/summary: Great Until the Head Fell Off of the Stickreview/text: Good suction, not too loud, great pivoting action, long cord, easy emptying, except that you have to dig in there with your fingers because all the hair and gunk settles up at the top of the filter. Crazy that the vacuum doesn't stand up on its own. You have to lean it up against a counter or put it flat on the floor if you need to stop vacuuming for any reason. But 10 months into owning this the head fell off of the stick. You can attempt to screw it back on but the threading is such that it won't hold.
