review/summary: Great sheetsreview/text: I have several sets of Pinzon flannel sheets and love them all. There are well made and launder well.The flannel is soft and the weight is comfortable even when the temperatures are well above freezing. If you like mid-weight to light weight flannel sheets you should love these.
