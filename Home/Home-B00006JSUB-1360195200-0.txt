review/summary: great panreview/text: This is a great alternative to a higher-end steel pan. Of course it is a little heavy because it's caste iron, but it has an even distribution of heat and retains heat much better than regular aluminum pans. And if you prime it properly, it's much better than a non-stick coating as well. And as usual, amazon's price is unreal.
