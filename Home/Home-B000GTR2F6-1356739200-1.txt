review/summary: It's a giftreview/text: My daughter asked for this product for her birthday. To me it's wasteful, in that you always toss the the k cups after one use, so I bought a refillable filter as well. The coffee is always fresh and hot and takes just a minute. If the beans are good, the coffee is good.
