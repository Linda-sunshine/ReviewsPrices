review/summary: Great Coffee Potreview/text: This is our third Cuisinart Coffee Maker. The second 1200 Brew Central. The one inbetween was not this model.We really like it. Makes great coffee, you can set the heat of the warming element which is a good feature.It also makes a small pot (1 to 4 cups) that tastes as good as a full pot. This feature is one of the main reasonsI buy this coffeemaker. Durable, easily programed, and great coffee.
