review/summary: Excellent Dispenserreview/text: I have had this product for about 6 months now with no problems. The holder in the top that feeds the water through the filter had a wave barrier which is just a piece of plastic with a channel cut in it which effectively prevents the 'sloshing' when filling. I was interested to see if the flip top knob dispenser would leak, but so far I haven't seen any leakage or dripping for it and I use it several times a day, every day. Changing the filter is very easy and the filters seem to be available in the places I shop. The volume seems to be very adequate and I haven't had issues so far with going to fill a glass and not having enough.
