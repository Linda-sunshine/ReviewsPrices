review/summary: To get rid of that plastic/metallic smell and taste of your new Keurigreview/text: Just bought my second Keurig. Our first one was about 5 or 6 years old. These newer models are not made the same - cheaper parts, and many people seem to have problems with a plastic/metallic taste and smell. We did, so I searched for a solution to this problem, and found it - see below. Just got done following the instructions, and it worked perfectly! Here they are, good luck!:1) Rinse, rinse rinse the reservoir, really, really well, but do not dry inside with any kind of cloth or towel. Apparently you are not supposed to do so as lint can be left behind and could cause a potential problem2) Fill reservoir to the top with half water, half vinegar. Put the K cup holder in its slot. Run three or four large brews and dump in sink. Again, basically same as doing a descale, but you don't need as much vinegar.The idea is to get the diluted vinegar solution inside the same as descaling and let it sit inside, machine ON. Give it about two hours, empty the reservoir, rinse really well and fill. Run the water through until reservoir needs refilling. Fill the reservoir again, run a couple more cups and then test the water. It works like a charm.Passing along as it may be of help for someone else who purchased or will be receiving a Keurig..
