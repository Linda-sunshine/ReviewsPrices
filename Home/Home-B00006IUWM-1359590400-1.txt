review/summary: 2 years and still sharpeningreview/text: I've had this sharpener for 2 years now. It is one of the best purchases I've made in the kitchen. Every month or two I sharpen all of the knives in my collection, and whether it's the starter knife set I bought in college or the fancy brand-name ones I bought much later it makes them all cut effortlessly. Easy to use and even after sharpening for the hundredth time it still works great.
