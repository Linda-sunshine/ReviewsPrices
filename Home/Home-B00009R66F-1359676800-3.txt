review/summary: cheaply made, not worth the price.review/text: I have had a hoover steamvac for over 10 years and when it finally gave out went and bought this new version. Hoover should be ashamed of itself. They took a durable, well made,easy to use product and replaced it with a machine made of cheap plastics (that by the way requires some assembly). The once so easy to use stair/upholstery assembly tool, replaced with a multi-step, time consuming set up. I don't mind paying more for a quality product that will last.....with this model the price went up,but the quality tanked. I cannot see this product lasting very long. Don't waste your money.
