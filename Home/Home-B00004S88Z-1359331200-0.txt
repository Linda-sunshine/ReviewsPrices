review/summary: All American Cannerreview/text: I just started canning last year and bought a smaller canner thinking that was all I needed but after doing several batches, I realized that if I had only bought the larger canner I could do twice as much in one shot but now I couldn't justify spending all that money when I already had one.I saw on youtube that this one was on sale and I couldn't believe it was under $200 so I couldn't help myself. I can a lot of chicken and ground beef in pints and my husband and I have been doing a lot of salmon fishing last fall so I'm going to try my hand at canning fish too along with all the vegetables from my garden this year. Can't wait!
