review/summary: OK but nothing specialreview/text: The iron works OK but it is nothing to rave about. It gets plenty hot but does not steam as well as other irons I have had. It has a huge water reservoir and seems to quit steaming at about 1/3 to 1/4 full so you end up refilling just as often. The auto shutoff is a little too fast -- I am a quilter so I am back and forth to the iron a lot. However it is nice after the auto shut off to just hit the button and it comes back on to the setting you had previously selectd. Overall it is acceptable for a mid-priced product.
