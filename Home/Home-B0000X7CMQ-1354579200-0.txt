review/summary: Very Disappointed... Don't Buyreview/text: The Carafe on this unit is a big disappointment. The vacuum seal on the carafe has failed. Both water and air are seeping into the internal walls of the unit. This is preventing the carafe from functioning properly and maintaining coffee at a hot temperature for any long length of time.I called the customer service department at Zojirushi to report this issue. Boy, was that a big waste of time!I would strongly recommend getting a different product due to the fact that a replacement carafe will set up back about $38.00. Not worth it!!!BTW... the carafe lasted less than 1 1/2 years.
