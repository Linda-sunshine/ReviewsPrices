review/summary: Silpat Non-Stick Baking Matreview/text: I was a little doubtful when I saw this but I thought I'd give it a try. I am really very happy with it. It works just as they advertise. I am planning on getting another one for me and one for a gift. If you're baking a lot (as I did over the holidays) it would be nice to have one for each cookie sheet. I would definitely recommend this.
