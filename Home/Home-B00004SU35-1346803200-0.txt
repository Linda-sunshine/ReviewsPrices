review/summary: Best $20 ever spentreview/text: I love popcorn, but was getting sick of air popped and tired of making it on the stove with all the shaking and scratching of my pots. I heard alot of people liked the Whirley Pop so I tried it out and am glad I did! It is super simple to use, makes plenty of popcorn quickly, and tastes great. My only down side is that it doesn't clean up very well, there are alot of small nooks where oil gets into and doesn't leave, like under the middle of the top and under the wooden pegs. Hopefully it doesn't affect it in the long term!
