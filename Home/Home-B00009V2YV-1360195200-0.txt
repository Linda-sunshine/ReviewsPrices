review/summary: Works Like A Charmreview/text: Just got my 1st alert today, a winter storm warning, before it even came over the TV. The unit is very well made and thought out. Everything can be customized from alert sounds to alarm settings to S.A.M.E. codes. There is a choice for high or low siren, continuous or normal backlight display, alerts on/off, weather channel on/off and lots more. You can also scroll through each alert and enable or disable it.The display is beautiful and easy to read, set up is fast and easy and the unit is a perfect size to fit anywhere. I really am glad I spent the extra money for this model as it's everything a good weather radio should be and then some. I have seen some reviews complaining about the beeps when you push any of the buttons, but I didn't find them loud at all and actually liked the feedback.A very nice option is the jack on the back of the unit where you can add a strobe light for the hearing impaired or if you wish a visual instead of auditory alert.
