review/summary: Newbie cannerreview/text: I have only used this for water bath canning. I have an electric stove, and I can do about 7 pints at a time (8 if I am desperate). It takes forever and a day to boil water with this, but that's because it can hold so much water. I haven't pressure cooked in it yet, but plan to do pressure canning soon.
