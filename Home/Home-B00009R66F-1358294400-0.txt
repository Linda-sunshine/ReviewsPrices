review/summary: good machine at a good pricereview/text: Bought this after we got a second puppy. Cleaned up the stains better than the rental unit we rented a month earlier. Amazing how dirty the water is when you dump it. The hand brush attachment is great for stairs and spot stains. Assembly was reasonably simple. Name is a little mis-leading as it does not produce steam but hot water mixed with the solution plus the brushes cleans very well. $135.00 price on amazon is cost of 2 rentals and less hiring pros. It is actually kind of fun to use.
