review/summary: Drips During Pourreview/text: Very disappointed at the mess - filtered for the first time last night - chilled the water; pouring this morning - it drips while pouring, regardless of the speed of pour. OK - it's &#34;only water&#34; but it's very disappointing to have a pitcher that cannot pour!!!
