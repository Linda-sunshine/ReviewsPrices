review/summary: Very nice, especially for the price!review/text: Seems to only have .2 lb increments, I guess that's pretty good. I can't tell how consistent it is, though, as my weight fluctuates up and down pretty wildly. My only complaint is that I wished it beeped once it locked in a weight. I think it's a pretty nice scale, though!
