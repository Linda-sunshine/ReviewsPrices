review/summary: Cuisinart DLC-2ABC Mini Food Processorreview/text: This is an attractive and highly functional Mini Food Processor useful for chopping and grinding. It's small profile allows one to use it easily without major setup. It performs tasks very well and can be left permanently on a kitchen counter because it takes very little space. As with all such devices, one must be very careful in handling the sharp blade.
