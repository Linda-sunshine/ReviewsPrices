review/summary: Quiet and warmreview/text: I get cold at work (office environment, little heat reaches me). I'm tired of bundling up indoors so I thought I would get my own heater. I love this thing. It's completely silent, toasty warm on two levels, and relatively small. I keep it halfway under my desk. On the lower setting I'm quite warm, on the higher setting I almost get too hot. I'm not sure how it heats up an entire room. I keep it about a foot and a half from me and it's great.
