review/summary: Now THIS is a Juicer I will use!review/text: I bought an Omega juicer last year after reading all the great reviews about drier pulp and more juice per unit. Used it maybe 10 times but the prepping of the fruits and veggie to fit the small shoot and it seemed to take forever to make ONE glass of juice. That became tedious real fast so I put it away to gather dust. I admit I'm lazy and a fan of instant gratification so I will sacrifice a little less juice per squeeze for the speed and convenience of this juicer. (Clean-up was no problem either.)
