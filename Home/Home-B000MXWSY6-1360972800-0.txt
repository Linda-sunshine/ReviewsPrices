review/summary: Amazing alarm clock for a great pricereview/text: Awesome alarm clock I got as a gift. Replacing my 20 y/o GE alarm clock with the faux wood top. Anyway, there are a TON of features in this little thing, but simple enough to use. The time auto sets itself when you first plug it in, and the battery backup is great and much better than the 9V my old alarm took. There's an awesome option in here to change the snooze length, really nice for those days when you might have a little extra time to kill. Definitely recommend reading the instructions the first time out, don't end up being late to work!
