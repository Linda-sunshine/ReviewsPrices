review/summary: It's so, so.review/text: I had the older version of this bread maker; I used it for 13 years, every other day, until the pan wore out, the machine itself was fine. It had a smaller pan, almost a square bottom as I recall. I could set it up and come back when the whole wheat cycle was finished; perfect bread every time.This newer version has a larger pan with a rectangular bottom shape. Unless I push the dough down about an hour and a half before the end of a whole wheat bread cycle, the bread comes out in odd shapes. I'm a bit disappointed. I don't wake up to fresh bread like I did with the old machine; who needs weird looking bread for breakfast?This machine bakes fine but it needs some personal intervention to get a decent looking loaf. I only make whole wheat bread.
