review/summary: Low Quality Junk!review/text: A few hours ago I bought this as my first stand mixer after seeing many chefs on TV use similar models (and seeing the $30 rebate!). I couldn't wait to use it, but took some time to read over the instructions before using it. Good thing I did because when I looked at the flat paddle-to-bowl clearance, I noticed the paddle was touching the bowl and adjusted as per the instructions. I decided to try the very first recipe in the Kitchenaid book (Mushroom-onion Tartlets). Everything work well until I added the 3/4 cup of flour. The mixer mixed for about 10 seconds and then froze up. I tilted the head back and made sure nothing was binding, then put it back down and it ran for another 5 seconds before freezing again. I finished the recipe with a hand-held mixer and it was delicious. As for the mixer, it's back in the box and will be returned to the store in the morning. After reading all the negative reviews (which seem to come from actual non-paid reviewers), I can see that this is just the beginning of the trouble I would have with it. I think I will save up some more money and get one of the other brand names.
