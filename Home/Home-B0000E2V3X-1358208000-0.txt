review/summary: Great pizzas!review/text: We have used this pizza pan weekly (or more) on top of our wood stove since we purchased it and have been consistently pleased with the results. The pan is sturdy, well-made, and well-seasoned, and does a great even job of cooking the pizza. Everybody should cook with cast iron! (in my opinion)
