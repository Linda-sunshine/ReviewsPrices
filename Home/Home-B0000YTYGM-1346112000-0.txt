review/summary: Keeps Coffee HOT!review/text: I've had this coffee maker for about 3 months now...and I selected it based on two reasons: 1. I love hot coffee...and I wanted a maker that made it hot and kept it hot, and 2. I wanted a coffee maker that doesn't burn coffee and change its taste as it sits on the warmer. I tried the Melitta 46894 10-Cup Thermal Coffeemaker, which didn't brew the coffee nearly as hot as I like it.On both accounts, this coffee maker is great. It brews REALLY hot coffee, and the thermal carafe keeps it hot for probably an hour or two, and then keeps it warm for a few hours after that (although I rarely drink it more than 2-3 hours afterwards, so other reviews are better to look at if you want something that you can keep going back to during the day).Other reviews have complained about the lid being hard to screw on and the fact that you need to tilt the carafe quite a bit to get the last cup out. Both of these things are slightly true...but hey, we're all adults, and we can figure these things out. These things pale in comparison to the benefits of this coffee maker if you're looking for a coffee maker that brews hot coffee and keeps it hot.
