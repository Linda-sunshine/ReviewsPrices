review/summary: Nice Boilerreview/text: The Procter Silex is a stylish addition to you kitchen counter or to your private cubicle corner where you keep your mini fridge. It boils quickly and detaches from its cord so you can tote the hot water to the table. My only regret is that it's size limits its capacity to 2 mugs or 20 ounces, which makes it unsuitable for preparing hot tea for more than two.
