review/summary: Excellent choice for a family kitchenreview/text: I purchased this set almost a year ago. It is the first actual set we have had in our 12 years of marriage. Our cheap-o pans finally gave up, after warping and peeling and such, thanks to heavy use. I knew this would be our only set for many years to come, so I researched many, many sets of pans. I have to say, this is an excellent choice. The pans are heavy, solid, and well made. The handles do not loosen. The handles also stay cool when cooking. The heat distribution is amazingly even, and they maintain heat very well. I have an old electric range, and these pans make me feel like I am cooking on a top-notch gas range. The cleanup is a breeze. I use cooking spray for any protein, but even without, a quick soak loosens even the worst stuck-on foods. When I first got them, I noticed a little discoloration after a few uses, and a couple "rust" spots, which I don't believe were actually rust. However, after a couple weeks, this stopped happening. I think something in the finishing had to just get worn off. I know they are dishwasher safe, but I never put them in the dishwasher. They clean up very nicely with simple dish soap and a blue (non-scratch) scrubbing spongeScotch-Brite 3M Non-Scratch Scrub Sponges - 18-Count. I have heard people use Barkeeper's FriendBar Keepers Friend Cleanser & Polish: 12 OZ, but I have never needed anything like that to keep them looking new. These pots and pans are an excellent choice for anyone that wants to cook like Gordon Ramsey at a very affordable price!
