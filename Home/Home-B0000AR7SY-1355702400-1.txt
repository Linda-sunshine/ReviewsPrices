review/summary: Heavy stable base, selection of amount is oddreview/text: It works very well at grinding since it has a heavy stable base, but the way to select the amount is not very tuneable for single cups of coffee or espresso. If you turn the knob too far it has to run all the way through and you can't stop it.
