review/summary: Makes really good waffles consistentlyreview/text: We've had a chance to use this waffle maker for a couple months now and we love it. This is our fourth waffle maker and it's by far the best we've had. It consistently produces waffles that are crunchy on the outside and tender inside with any number of recipes.Only thing to remember is to season it by brushing with oil and letting it head up upon first use. As soon as it's properly seasoned any stickiness will disappear.
