review/summary: Good productreview/text: This is less to do with the quality and more with the design- my wrist really hurts after operating this for a few minutes. Maybe my ergonomics are funny, but I don't think so. I use this occasionally and it works well. My wrist wouldn't hold out for a long task though.
