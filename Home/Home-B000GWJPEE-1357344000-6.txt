review/summary: Cute Little Owl Friendreview/text: I read tons of the reviews on here before purchasing this product. I ended up buying the Owl, and I am in love. I have been using it for 4 days so far and I have had no problems with burning electronics, noise level, it using too much water, etc.I can barely hear it. I think the noise level is on par with our ceiling fan, which runs all year long except in the winter. It produces a nice little stream of cool mist and after the first night of use I woke up without a dry, sore throat and nose. My apartment is so dry I have been getting nose bleeds in the morning from my nose cracking. It has been WONDERFUL! I feel so much better.I was hesitant about buying a $40 humidifier when I could get a Vick's hot steam from Walgreens for $12. I am glad I bought this instead. With the cool steam, I am not worried about my place catching fire from a faulty heating element.I set the dial to about 3/4 the way, and a full gallon of water lasted 3 nights. I have been using high purity water to prevent mineral build up and hopefully this little guy will last me a long time.
