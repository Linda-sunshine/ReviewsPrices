review/summary: Worth the moneyreview/text: I bought my Keurig at Wal-Mart, but I will still write a review on here. This machine is wonderful! It heats up quickly in the morning (in about 3 minutes), brews a cup of coffee in less than 1 minute, is very quiet, plus makes wonderful iced tea! My husband wasn't very excited about me wanting to buy one of these, but he let me anyways. On the way home from Wal-Mart, he told me, "I can't believe we just spent $150 on a coffee maker. You better use it a lot, because I won't be using it." Well, when we got home, he made himself TWO cups of coffee before I was in bed, when I woke up the next morning he had already had TWO more cups and then later that day he made himself some iced tea with the Keurig. HE HAS USED IT MORE THAN I HAVE!!! We also bought the optional warranty from Wal-Mart for an additional $15. So for those who complain about their machines not working after a year and a half - you should have bought a warranty! Our new Keurig is covered for the next TWO YEARS! I now have peace of mind with this machine. I love waking up in the morning and having a cup of coffee in my hand in less than 5 minutes, without having to deal with coffee filters, glass coffee pots, and measuring coffee grounds.
