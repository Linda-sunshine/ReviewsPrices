review/summary: Can't beat it for the pricereview/text: I've only used this quite a bit for grinding meats and it works just fine.Although a lot of it is plastic, the &#34;business&#34; components are stainless steel, and the plastic is a very hard smooth plastic that's easy to clean. Everything comes apart easily for cleaning and there are really no parts that would trap any particles. All internal parts are easily accessible.The suction cup base holds fine on any reasonably smooth surface. The handle is quite long, which makes it easy to turn, but it extends past the bottom of the base so you have to position it so that it hangs off the edge of the table or countertop.Have to say that I have no complaints, especially at this price.
