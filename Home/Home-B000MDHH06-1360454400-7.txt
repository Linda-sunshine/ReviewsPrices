review/summary: As it is intended:review/text: I bought this particular juicer for 2 reasons.First, it is a Breville that I thought Joe Cross used. I was mistaken. This was not the model that was used on his film, &#34;Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead&#34;.Secondly, it was the cheapest model.My complaint is that there is no waste chute as a separate compartment. I knew this going in. Not the design fault. In retrospect, I should had spent another $50.00 to get the one with a separate waster/garbage chute.
