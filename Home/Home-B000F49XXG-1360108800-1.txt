review/summary: De'Longhi Espresso Makerreview/text: Love this espresso maker. The shipping was fast and the maker works great!I have had the maker for about 3 months now and it still works as well as it did the first day I used it. It's easy to clean and great space saver for those with limited counter space. The frother also works great, however the wand could be a little longer.Great espresso maker!
