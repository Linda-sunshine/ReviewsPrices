review/summary: DANGEROUS!review/text: I heard coffee boiling, ran into kitchen, and saw smoke coming from cord where it went into coffeemaker. Unit had been turned off earlier in the day. I carried unit outside where it continued to smoke for a few minutes. We bought unit in Feb. 2011. I have e-mailed Cuisinart twice, but have received no response. Luckily I was home and our whole kitchen didn't go up in flames.
