review/summary: no longer boiling on the stove.review/text: this makes perfect eggs.i use it in many microwaves also while travelling to cook andd have fresh boiled eggs on the go. read the directions for different wattages though and check your oven before you use it (especially it you are using different ovens). i kept it and no longer cook them on the stove. but to cook perfect eggs on the stove (hard centers) cook for 6 minutes on boiling water, after it starts to boil. then rinse with cold water and crack immediately for perfect eggs stovetop. i like this because it clearly uses less watts than a stove that takes forever to warm up. this takes 10 minutes to produce the eggs, remove the shells, and they are ready to go.
