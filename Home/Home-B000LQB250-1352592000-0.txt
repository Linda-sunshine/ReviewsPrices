review/summary: Very comfy; no more tossing and turning!review/text: Our bed is only five years old and is holding up well, but over time due to joint problems it's felt increasingly hard. I found myself tossing and turning for hours trying to get into a comfortable position, often waking up my spouse in the process. We tried several different reputable mattress replacements but they were all priced over the range we're willing to pay at this point, so we decided to try this memory foam mattress topper. So far, we've had it for two months and it has been such a relief! It is incredibly soft and comfortable. We're using it in combination with a contoured memory foam pillow and have been getting much better sleep lately.
