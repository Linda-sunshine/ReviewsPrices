review/summary: Very Solid Ice Cream Makerreview/text: Remember buying rock salt and turning the crank? If you're my age, homemade ice cream conjurers up a mix of bad memories.This ice cream maker has a freezable bowl. You HAVE to put the bowl in freezer OVERNIGHT. There is absolutely no skipping this step. You can then make ice cream the next day. We just keep the bowl in the freezer, and take it out when we want ice cream, so there is no delay.During the summer, my family of 6 saved a fortune ( We had been hooked on Brusters...) It is more fun, and it is not hard to make vanilla and chocolate. The ice cream tastes great.The only negative is that some may think the ice cream is too soft. Arguable ... but EASILY fixed by putting the finished ice cream in the freezer for 30 minutes of variable length of time. Also, if you make the ice cream and store in the freezer, it becomes hard like store bought ice cream.Very nice finish, and does not take up much counter space. This size was perfect. Also, the quality is very good. There are a few plastic pieces, but this is a good quality unit. It is not industrial, but not cheap.
