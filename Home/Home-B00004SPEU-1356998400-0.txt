review/summary: useful spice grinderreview/text: I bought this as a spice grinder and as very happy with the unit until I tried to grind cloves. The cloves left a sticky residue on the lid and damaged it so that it is now opaque. I'm not sure if there was a chemical reaction with the plastic. I had to buy a brush to clean the blade because it does not come apart for washing. I just use the brush to get out as much of the spice as possible. Sometimes, I use a damp paper towel to wipe the inside as best as possible.
