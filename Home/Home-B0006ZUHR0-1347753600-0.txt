review/summary: Better than Rowenta!!review/text: Just test-drove this B&D; iron after reading consumer reports' raving reviews on it. Love it. I actually don't mind ironing as much. I had a high-end Rowenta previously. It was supposed to be fool-proof, German, and effective. Boy was I wrong; it leaked horribly, it didn't get wrinkles out and as a result, I ended up laundering my shirts professionally. I was hopeful when reading the reviews and was convinced after today's test drive that I made the right choice. Here's what I like:1. It works well on wrinkles. No starch needed, powerful steam. SST plate worked as advertise: no issues, no stains.2. LCD readout. For the first time ever, I actually made adjustments during ironing because the LCD was simple and the beeps that told you you've reached the proper temp worked and was quick.3. Doesn't leak. Kinda defeats the purpose of ironing when you leak water over a recently dried clothing.4. Nice cord ball design. Less entanglements5. Weight. Balanced: not too heavy, not too light/flimsy6. Autoclean.7. Simple. Not too many buttons and features that you have to figure out (and risk breaking). This is a no-frills iron that has just the right amount of useful features.
