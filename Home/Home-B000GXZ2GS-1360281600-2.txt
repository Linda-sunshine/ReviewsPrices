review/summary: No more wasted coffeereview/text: Usually I make an entire pot of coffee every morning. I get up, grind my beans, and turn on my pot. I will drink an entire pot of coffee throughout the day without even a blink. I realized after a while, that I really didn't need to drink that much, so I was throwing out a lot of my coffee every day.With the AeroPress, I make just enough for a cup or two every day. Nothing is wasted. It's a lot more durable than a normal french press, and I've taken it backpacking with me numerous times. I would love it if they made a gold reusable filter instead of having to use paper.All in all, the best thing to happen to coffee since chocolate covered beans!
