review/summary: This is a Wonderful Panreview/text: I use this pan more than any other hanging in my kitchen. And I cook a lot and well! At first I was disappointed that it was so thin and light...until I used it. It is kind to my aging wrists (though I am not about to give up my cast iron skillets and dutch ovens). I use it not only for stir fries, but for many other dishes. It is large enough to stir fry or saute veggies and then toss in pasta or cooked grain at the end to feed a whole family; yet it is not too big for the two of us. On high heat, it easily gets food cooked on and looks discolored after stir frying garlic and ginger--but it cleans up easily with steel wool and Barkeepers Friend (also a five star). After more than a year of use, mine still looks as shiny and nice as it did the day it arrived. For quick, fast heat with a gas stove, this is perfect.
