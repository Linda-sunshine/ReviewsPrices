review/summary: Nice replacement for my Tassimoreview/text: I bought a Tassimo coffeemaker several years ago, and I liked it, but it broke a few months ago. I chose this Keurig coffeemaker as the replacement.The Tassimo had lots of features, such as reading barcodes on the coffee pack to determine how to brew that particular style of coffee. The Keurig, by comparison, is a glorified water heater, but it's very simplicity is a good thing ... there's not much that can go wrong.I love the selection of Starbucks coffees that are available for the Keurig. Starbucks was not available on the Tassimo.
