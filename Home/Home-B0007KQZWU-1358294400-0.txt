review/summary: You Guys Nailed It!!!!!!review/text: Five Stars for sure both for the product and customer service. A gift from my husband for Christmas...I am so very picky and he researched every available brand on the internet and this set had the best rating of any set. Received as stated (before Dec. 24th) short of a miracle for any company!! A skillet had a factory flaw....Called, Set up return...followed instructions...all went well without a hitch. A true judge of any company is how well they handle issues that come up....and they all have them...this was the best customer service resolution I have ever had bar none...any company..Thank you for that!!!! .I have used all the pans.....LOVE LOVE them ..beyond my expectations....Thank you Amazon for the service, great product and rocking price......I am a loyal customer...always check you first.....and have never been dissapointed..always quality products with the best price points.
