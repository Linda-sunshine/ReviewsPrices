review/summary: Best ever!!review/text: Unbelievably great alarm clock for a fantastic price. I have to have a duel set. This is a small one that doesn't take up all my nightstand space like my old model. Easy to set up and nice big digital display numbers to see from across the room while getting ready for work.
