review/summary: Mehreview/text: I've had this coffee maker for almost two months now. It's ok. I agree with other posters' comments about deign flaws (reservoir, led display, etc.). My big complaint is that the coffee isn't really hot, and after adding a LITTLE milk, it's lukewarm. I've actually heated it up in the microwave on occasion. I know there is a low medium high knob for the warming plate, but even on high it's still not really hot. I had the cuisinart grind n brew for six years and loved it. This one, not as much. I wouldn't buy this model again.
