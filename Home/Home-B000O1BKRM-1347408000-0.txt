review/summary: Not as good as the green onesreview/text: I have to say the quality of these blue trays are not the same as the green ones I purchased years ago. THOSE ones have been amazing for ice and other things. I decided to get these blue ones for just the ice because I ended up occupying the green ones for forming pesto cubes - perfect for 1oz portions. The flavor of my pesto was tainting the ice cubes and that's not good. So anyway, I purchased these blue ones. The inner walls are thinner than those on my green trays. This has led to tearing after just a handful of uses! It also led to misshapen cubes that are much more dificult to remove from the tray. My attempts to release the cubes result in shattered cubes. Ugh. I'm going to attempt to return these things and maybe try another set of green. We'll see.***UPDATE - 11/14/12***As mentioned, I attempted to return my trays to Amazon for replacements. Well the 30 days had passed so that was a no-can-do. Instead I contacted Tovolo directly with an email to their customer service department. I received an IMMEDIATE response taking my concern seriously. They asked me to send them the trays directly for examination (even providing a pre-paid mailing label to do so). Seems that they had a concern that the trays were counterfeit. So I did, and they immediately sent me NEW blue trays PLUS a red King Ice Cube tray. Needless to say the quality of these replacement trays was of superior quality to the ones I received from Amazon. Not implying that Amazon did anything knowingly wrong, but wherever they received their product from wasn't right. The staff af Tovolo were fantastic! I really appreciated their prompt attention and for making me a satisfied customer. These trays are wonderful. But I'm leaving my rating as-is since it was my initial reaction to the original purchase.
