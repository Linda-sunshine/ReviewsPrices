review/summary: Better than expected.review/text: I ordered this as kind of a last second christmas gift not expecting a whole lot because of the price. But honestly I'm pretty impressed with the performance. Since I got it we've only had to charge it once and it pulls out the corks effortlessly. The wine chiller works great and is an added bonus. You can't beat what you're getting for the price on this one. Also, the cutter for the foil on top works great and is pretty handy to have too. A wine enthusiasts must have.
