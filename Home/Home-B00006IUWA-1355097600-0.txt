review/summary: Are you kidding me??review/text: This was the WORST shipping job I have ever seen in my life! ( and I shop online A LOT)! it was shipped it it's actual box only, nothing to protect it, so to no surprise the box is tore open! For the eight bucks they charge for shipping it was a joke! I'd rather pay more so they can spring for at least bubble wrap and masking tape! Just received it today so I have yet to see if it works. It would be a miracle if it does! We got it for a gift, I am embarrassed to give a box looking like this, so to avoid the hassle of returning and hoping I get the gift in time I'm heading to Target! Be wary ordering from here, unless u enjoy getting broken items in the mail. I'm giving it 2 stars on the chance it may work when I plug it in.
