review/summary: Timer still does not work in dough modereview/text: My previous panasonic breadmaker lasted ~20 years before the pan started leaking. I hoped panasonic would have realized by now that the timer would be a great addition to the dough mode. They didn't. I am hoping to get another 20 years out of this unit and would have given it 5 stars if not for the timer issue.
