review/summary: Filter basket so-so as filterreview/text: This basket lets a fine residue through, and I'd rather be able to drink my entire pot. Cleaning is simple, but unlike the quick toss away of a paper filter, it must be rinsed clean after each use. After a week, I went back to paper filters.
