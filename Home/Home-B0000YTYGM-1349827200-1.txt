review/summary: Used properly it's a gemreview/text: I've had this Cusinart for about 4 years (owned the same model previously for about 2-3 years) and it performs flawlessly. Makes as good a cup of coffee as your beans and proper grinding allow. For those who've had a hair pulling experience here are a couple of tips that might turn your diappointment to appreciation:-Use a quality paper filter and ensure it's opened and hugging the sides of the filter holder-Make certain the filter holder is seated perfectly in the unit. Anything less will create a mess! In all the years I've owned these machines, we've not followed our own advice a couple of time and indeed it's not a pretty sight!-Use beans that are ground for drip. Courser will produce a tastless cup, too fine (a la espresso)may produce a bitter cup or worse, not allow the water to flow feely through the grounds and overflow!-Experiment with the ratio of measures of coffee to cups of water. An extra scoop or two can often be the difference between mediocre and wonderful.-Clean the filter holder after every use including pressing up the spring loaded coffee stop to allow clean water to wash through the bottom of the holder.-Wash the carafe daily and monthly add a spoonful of Oxy-Clean to the carafe wash to thoroughly remove coffee buildup.Hope this helps.All the above sounds like a lot of work but it's not. It becomes habit in a couple of days and your reward is a wonderful cup of coffee.
