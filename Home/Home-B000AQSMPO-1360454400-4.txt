review/summary: Best purchase in years!review/text: This is a great product and the first gift I have given my wife in years that she didn't pretend to object to. The price on Amazon is terrific and 2 days from order to it being on my porch? How can you beat that? The new internal water filter is a nice feature. Mainly, this machine is quick and convenient. The K-cups are nice but we leave them mostly for guests. (Register the machine on-line and you can purchase 4 boxes of K-cups for the price of 2.) However, the real secret is to get a refillable coffee holder. I like the red Solofils (also from Amazon) but hear others work fine. Takes the per cup cost down from 70 cents per to 5 cents. With that per cup price and no waste, this machine now makes a lot of sense.
