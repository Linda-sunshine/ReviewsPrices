review/summary: Best small appliance ever inventedreview/text: I use this all the time to cook meat. I also use it to make quick &#34;baked potatoes.&#34; Much better texture than microwaving. Also great for dried beans. Cuts out 75% -80% cooking time. A must have for all working moms. Better than the crock pot! Easy to clean and operate.
