review/summary: Bought as a present, but I own onereview/text: Lately I've been doing a lot of cooking. One of the things I love to do is to make an entire meal in a skillet. That means I'm just dumping things in at different stages, sometimes requiring me to toss it in the oven. This cast iron skillet is perfect for that. I haven't tried any cast iron skillet baking, but I'm thinking I might make a cookie or a cake in this thing. Right now, I mostly make steak and potatoes in it. Either way, it's fantastic. I'd recommend it.
