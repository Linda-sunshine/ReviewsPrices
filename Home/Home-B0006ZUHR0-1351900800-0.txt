review/summary: Wonderful iron!review/text: After thoroughly researching irons, I decided on this one and I am very satisfied! I rarely ever purchase anything without first reading countless reviews on whatever it is I am looking to buy. This one seemed to fit the bill.*It's very reasonably priced for exactly what I need.*The digital readout is nice -- not that it's absolutely necessary, but it's nice to know when the desired temperature is reached.*The cord is plenty long enough and somehow never seems to get in the way.*I actually noticed how easy it is to pour in the water for the steaming feature. I like the water dispenser cup...it's a convenient, slim shape, sort of like a mini watering can. The steam feature worked wonderfully, and it also has a spray feature that sprays water out just above the pointed tip.*The feel and sturdiness of the iron is great and I like the weight of it. Supposedly it's a little lighter than a really heavy duty one, but plenty heavy enough to do most of the work.*And the best part of all, it works like an iron is supposed to work -- all the clothes I have ironed thus far easily became wrinkle-free!This is definitely the best iron I've owned. I love it!
