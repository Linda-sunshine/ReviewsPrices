review/summary: Works Wellreview/text: I bought this strictly for my carpeted steps and light pick ups. It works great, super powerful and easy to use and empty. Much more powerful than any onboard brush I've used (including my dyson). The hose is convenient for quick pickups of spilt dog food or for cleaning your car. I've tried a bunch of these, the dirt devil's while visually appealing burn out and do not have the power this unit does. I would highly recommend this
