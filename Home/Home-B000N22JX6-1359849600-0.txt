review/summary: Great little heaterreview/text: Very satisfied with this. Throws out an amazing amount of heat for a small heater on the high setting. On low it's perfect if you're sitting on the couch and keep it close to you, keeps you warm without getting too hot. We have a big house which is expensive to heat and usually spend the evening reading or watching TV on the couch so we can keep the house quite cool and yet be comfortable all night. The oscillating feature is a nice plus as is the remote and the ability to set a timer.
