review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I am not one to complain , but am very dissappointed with this item. This clock lights up like a Christmas tree...way too bright. I use a towel to cover it up at night and have another clock in my room to see the time. I bought this for the purpose of waking up to soothing sounds but I cannot choose the sound I want. I have to settle for the one that it is set to. I would have returned it, but didn't think paying for the shipping to do so was worth it.
