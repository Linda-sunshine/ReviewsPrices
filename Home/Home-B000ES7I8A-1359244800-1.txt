review/summary: Right combination of featuresreview/text: Bought this as a gift for my wife. It's seamless stainless steel and cordless, which are the two basic features she wanted. It heats water fairly quickly (&#60; 5 minutes), stays mostly cool to the touch, and doesn't get too loud. The kettle holds a little less water than it seems, since the &#34;Max fill&#34; line is about halfway up the side.We also have extremely hard water, so I wanted a kettle that would be easy to clean. The wide mouth, and easy removal of the lid, makes it easy to clean the inside. There's also the mineral-filter that hangs down in front of the spout &#8211; I'm not sure how useful it will prove to be, but so far it seems to be holding up quite well.
