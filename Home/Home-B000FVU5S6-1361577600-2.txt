review/summary: Listen to the Bad Reviewsreview/text: We had read the reviews and we simply could not believe that a company would make such bad quality sheets. We were wrong!We got those sheets and my wife soaked them for 2 hours in water and washed them. We then took them and compared them to our 4-year old sheets they are replacing and which are falling apart at seams. The 4 year old sheets still felt smooth in most areas while the new sheets felt like peach fuzz all over - the noise from light friction caused by the new sheet compared to the quiet old sheet was shocking. Quite possibly the worst sateen sheets ever made in the history of mankind.
