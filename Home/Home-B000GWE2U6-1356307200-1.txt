review/summary: Read The Instructions and it Works Great!review/text: I had to have a humidifier for a medical condition and, being a penguin afficianado, this was the one for me. But the mixed reviews concerned me a bit. Still, I went for it. I read the instructions, which are easy to follow & comprehend, and followed them explicitly. And I have had NONE of the problems other users experienced. On the contrary, I found it easy to assemble, fill & use, and the water in the reservoir lasts far longer than I expected. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if you point the &#34;spout&#34; towards bedding, furniture, etc., said bedding, furniture, etc. is going to get wet. DUH!! So I followed the directions & pointed it toward an empty are - no wet anything, including carpet. Nor has there been any leakage at all, even though I placed it on a towel after reading other reviews.This is worth every penny, in my book, if you're smart enough to read & follow directions!
