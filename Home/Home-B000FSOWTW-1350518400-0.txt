review/summary: Love the wine opener!review/text: Ok, so I bought this item for myself and as a gift for a friend. We're both excited about the wine opener, but not about the Chiller. It's just a little bucket that you put ice and water in to chill the wine. My opinion, it should have had a cord or some type of attachment that can help the water get colder faster in order to chill the wine faster. So bump the lil bucket, and just put your wine in the freezer for the same amount of time as the Chiller and get the same result if not colder.
