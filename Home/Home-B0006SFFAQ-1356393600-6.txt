review/summary: I'm going to miss this coffee pot, but.... (update - bought another)review/text: Update. Bought another Cuisinart 1200 in spite of the below, having tried a KitchenAid that was horrible on many levels.KitchenAid 12-Cup Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker, Countour SilverWe now have good coffee again, but we treat this pot as we would a lighted candle - unplug whenever not actively in use. Bye-bye having coffee ready when we get up - we unplug it overnight and plug it in and flip the switch in the morning. Fortunately it makes a pot pretty fast.***************It was hard to fill and program, but it made the best cup of coffee I've ever had and the carafe didn't drip. RIP, it died during the night.I was getting ready to replace it with the exact same thing, before I was lucky enough to see the reviews indicating it is a fire hazard, 50 of them. Bump them up, please, so people will see them.I feel very lucky - 1) I saw a recent review indicating it was a fire hazard, and then searched the reviews for same, finding 50, count 'em, 50. I'm going to do the same search as I look for a new coffee maker, *not* this one. 2) Ours didn't actually catch on fire, but I woke up to an odd smell during the night, which I am now sure was something melting in the coffee maker.To top it off, it appears, from the small amount of research I did, that Cuisinart is ignoring this issue.I'm really sorry not to be able to just get another one of the same, but I'd always be nervous.
