review/summary: Base diameter makes a differencereview/text: The wide base completely covers the smaller units on our ceramic cook-top stove, thus it is more energy efficient and the coffee seems to brew more quickly than in our less expensive Medelco Pyrex peculator. The coffee can be poured without removing the basket and peculator tube. The plastic knob seems adequate, but it easily unscrews and I have ordered a glass replacement.
