review/summary: Good for the pricereview/text: So far, I've used it twice. The 1st time, no problems. I drained the water after my 1st use and stored it. 2nd time using it, it was going fine until I had to refill it. It took a while (like 7-10 min) to reheat and start steaming. Maybe because i unplugged it for 1 minute but still, it was too long since it usually starts to give steam within 1 minute or less. After the 7 min., it was up and running well. I even steamed my bed after that. Overall, I like it.Tip: I use purified water only to reduce chance of build up (also as directed).
