review/summary: broke within 2 months and 1 usereview/text: This product is a piece of crap. Within 2 months and one use of the unit, the base suction unit broke off from the broom/stick part of the vacuum. If you look at it, it's only a tiny piece of black plastic that holds these two very important parts together. I tried to push it back together, but the plastic just completely broke. I tried to get warranty service since it was within the one-year warranty period, and the rather unhelpful person on the phone said that "that part" wasn't under warranty. ?? How worthless.So I wasted $50 on being able to vacuum an area rug once. Great, I could have used my dust buster for that.
