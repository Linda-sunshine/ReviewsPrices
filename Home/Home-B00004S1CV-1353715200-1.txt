review/summary: Don't worry about losing the capreview/text: Just wanted to write a quick review to add to the others -- first, it is a fantastic product. I've purchased three: two for myself, one for a friend, and recommended it to countless others. Everything people say about the tumbler is true. I love mine so much that I even bring it while traveling, attending conferences, even when working at coffee shops because it is so handy and keeps the drink hot.I originally bought mine because I was a big looseleaf tea drinker, but now I've switched primarily to coffee and it works great for a "smaller" amount of a beverage (oh, America).I did want to address a possible drawback that you might have with the design. I was worried I'd lose the lid since it is separate from the main body of the Thermos. I've had my tumblers 2+ years now and haven't, you get surprisingly used to the two-part design. However my roommate recently borrowed one and promptly lost the lid (should've seen that one coming :)). I contacted Thermos customer support directly through their website and they allow you to purchase replacement lids for their products for just a few dollars, plus S&H.; So don't worry! I bought three extra lids so I can lend out my tough little Thermos without fear!
