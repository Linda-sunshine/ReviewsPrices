review/summary: Kaput Kettlereview/text: Kettle was a disappointment for us. We bought it and were thrilled with it at first. Nice action on the depressing lever and handsome chrome. But it started leaking from we know not where. And then it stopped heating the water entirely after just four months of use. Of course the return window has now closed so we're outta luck. I'd avoid this model.
