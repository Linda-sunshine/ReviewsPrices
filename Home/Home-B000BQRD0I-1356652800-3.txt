review/summary: Use only as directed. Burns scalp!review/text: My mother recently bought one of these steamers, and it appears to be a fine product. I mean I have not actually steamed any clothing yet. But over the Christmas holidays I was up late drinking with my uncles. And the conversation drifted towards the new steamer. And on a dare I let one of my drunken uncles actually steam my hair!I had really long hair, and this seemed like a hilarious idea at the time.All went well for the first few passes, but uncle Bobo got too close to my scalp, and I suffered severe burns. At the emergency room they staff had no sympathy for me or my entourage. They had to cut off my glorious locks to treat the burns. Fortunately for me the burns were not as bad as we initially thought. I walked with only second degree burns(some blistering).Now I will forever remember my Christmas vacation at the emergency room with Uncle Bobo.Hey but the steamer works great!
