review/summary: THE BESTreview/text: THIS IS THE HANDIEST little appliance for thr kitchen. Virtually NO cleanup time and so many uses. The additional beauty is using it directly in a pot....or a bowl. I hardly take out a big guns food processor (often accompanied by a strainer for pureed food) This gizmo is a gem and I sing its praises everytime it comes out of the cabinet .... and that's often. GREAT to have. WONDERFUL gift for those unsuspecting or unaware. So inexpensive and does the job of so many bigger ticket items easily. If you don't have one....get one. Cuisinart, by the way makes the best of these.
