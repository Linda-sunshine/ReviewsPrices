review/summary: So far so goodreview/text: I bought this product as a less pricey alternative the stainless Simple Human trash cans. The iTouchless has the added benefit of the infrared sensor which is nice. When I first bought it, my wife thought I was nuts and she just wanted the typical foot action lid with no frills. Since we have been using it, she has had no complaints. I would like the infrared sensor to have bit more reach. You have to get your hand pretty close to activate but other than that it's perfect. We have had it for 3/4 months and it works great.Added benefits: The kids have fun toying with it and it's a conversation piece when we have guests. Most people think it's a much more pricey device.Highly recommended for the gadget junkies like me.
