review/summary: AMAZINGreview/text: I admit, I am addicted to kitchen gadgets, but this little kitchen tool is incredible! I could not wait to try it, and when I did, it did not dissapoint me. I made perfect noodles from a zucchini in less than one minute! Clean up was a breeze. I cannot wait to try other vegetables and fruits. This is my new "go to" kitchen gadget. I highly recommend this tool to anyone who is changing their diet to Vegan or Vegetarian. Get one of these, and start using it right away. It will make a huge difference in meal planning and prep. If I were to ask for one modification it would be to add a little catch basket. I used a shallow bowl and it worked fine; but having something made specifically for this unit would be ideal.
