review/summary: Didn't work as I expectedreview/text: I followed the recommendation of another reviewer and let the popper heat up some before putting the corn in. Unfortunately, the airflow was so strong that half the kernels got blown out before they could get hot enough, so half the corn was left unpopped. Also, the plastic top part of the popper got too hot to handle. And, last but not least, the corn that did get popped were tough and chewy and tasted like cardboard.Overall I was not happy with my purchase and had to return the unit. Customer service was great. Too bad the popper wasn't. :(
