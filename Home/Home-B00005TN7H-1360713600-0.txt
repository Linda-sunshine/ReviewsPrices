review/summary: works greatreview/text: I've used this for a couple of years now and I'm really happy with it. Jars filled with spices sealed well and stayed sealed with one exception. After cleaning the edge of the jar again - that jar sealed too. It feels like you will pull the seal off when you remove the Sealer but so far I haven't done that. Quick and easy!!
