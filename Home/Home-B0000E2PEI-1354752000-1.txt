review/summary: It's okay.review/text: It's attractive, but I have a feeling that the scale is lying to me. On some days, it tells me that it hates me, I stink, and that I weigh a ton. Then five minutes later, it'd apologize, cry a bit, and tell me that I weigh as light as a feather.Seriously though, this thing is giving me whiplash with how much it fluctuates. I've tried the tips I've seen some commenters posted about and they don't work very well.At the same time, I don't want to give it a bad rating because it gives me a nice little number that I want to see...but I'm certainly certain that it's just lying to me. =/
