review/summary: Good Coffee potreview/text: We replaced a braun coffee maker which was about 10 yrs old. All of the reviews were so mixed, I did not know which one to buy. A fellow shopper was buying this one to replace a similar older model which her daughter took to college. She said the older model was 6 years old and still worked perfectly. So I bought this one. Now maybe our previous brewer was so old this new one seems great in comparison, but this pot brews great mellow coffee. I do not find the water reservoir to be small- put on your glasses. I do not get grounds all over the lid. I find the whole thing easy to clean. I especially like the pour spout on the pot. On the braun, It would pour all over the place if you went too fast. This one pours nicely. The programmable feature is easy to use. The warmer can be set at several temperatures. We have had the pot now about a month and really like it. As with anything else, we will see how long it lasts. Understand that nothing in the kitchen gets 5 stars in my opinion unless it brewed itself.
