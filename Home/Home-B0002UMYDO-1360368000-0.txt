review/summary: Very reliablereview/text: This can opener is attractive and I like the fact that you can adjust the length of the exposed cord. It works reliably and the cutter mechanism is easy to remove and clean. The unit is heavy enough to hold a large can and it stays in place. We have only had it for a short time but if it remains &#34;as is&#34; it is the best one I have ever purchased.
