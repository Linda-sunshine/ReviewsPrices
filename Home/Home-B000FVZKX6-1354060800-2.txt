review/summary: Quality productreview/text: The material is nice and thick and feels good. I was a little worried about getting too hot, but I haven't had any issues like that. It's nice and deep too, so the pockets can be tucked in and the mattress cover stays in place. I've washed it around 4 times since i got it and its not pilling or tearing. It seems like it'll last for quite a while.
