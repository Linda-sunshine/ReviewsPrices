review/summary: I love love this kettle and will replace it with the SAME if it failsreview/text: I read the reviews about this kettle, and after using mine for a while have some observations, that may help others.About the smell some folks seem to object to. The lid is plastic. If you look at the pictures, you will see that the maximum fill line is at the 2 quart line, which is about half way up. If you fill too high, and boil too hard, it will give off an odor from the proximity of the boiling water to the lid. Also, overfilling it makes it very heavy, and will put undue strain on the two screws that secure the handle to the body of the kettle.A response to those who commented that the handle was only secured with two small screws: TRUE! But, if you do NOT OVERFILL and make it too heavy, the screws will last longer. Also, I check the screws regularly now, and plan to, if they loosen, secure them with Gorilla glue. I also try to have the habit of supporting the kettle by the base, after lifting it, when it is close to the max fill line.Yes, my hard water does cause DEPOSITS on the stainless steel dome. The choice is between tasteless demineralized water, or getting the deposits on the heating element. I LOVE the fact that I can SEE the deposits because of the clear sides, rather than "out of sight, out of mind" which was the case with the heating element on the stainless kettle I used to have.All that I do is put white vinegar into it, just past the stainless heating unit, boil it till the deposits come off (a couple minutes) and rinse it out. It still looks bright and shiny.I have used mine for over a year now. It is still in perfect condition. But, I was affected by the reviewers, and decided that I must buy another one (despite the fact that my first, original, one is still in pristine condition and working perfectly).THAT'S HOW MUCH I LIKE THIS KETTLE. I DO NOT WANT TO BE A WEEK WITHOUT ONE IF IT FAILS.
