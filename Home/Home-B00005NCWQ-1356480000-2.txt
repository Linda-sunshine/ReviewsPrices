review/summary: Basic functionality and beautiful designreview/text: I purchased this for my girlfriend for Christmas and we used it on Christmas day to make a batch of coffee. The pot itself is really nice to look at with shiny stainless steel and the black handle. The components within (pump and basket) are constructed of stainless steel and are very well made. The first batch of coffee came out perfect and piping hot. I recommend this to anyone looking for a more traditional way of brewing coffee.
