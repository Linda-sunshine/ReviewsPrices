review/summary: so great for fat free popcornreview/text: I read the bad reviews and saw enough good ones to give it a try. Works so beautifully. There is not that much that doesn't pop, no different than if I put the corn in my pot on top of the stove. And when I pop it that way, I have to add oil. I don't add any oil and it's not bad that way. Sometimes I add salt but it won't stick to any piece at all. So that's good for me.If you face the exit for the corn slightly towards the wall, you will get most any that shoots way out, staying on the counter.I have had it for at least a month now and have used it most nights. The only problem is me. Sometimes I forget to empty the remaining kernels but luckily I remember the next time I use it. The funny thing is, No matter how long I keep it on after all popping stops, the second after I pull the plug, pop goes one more kernel. It's rather comical, well to me it is.
