review/summary: great cookwarereview/text: costco(in-stores) has it for between 159 and 199$ (with their on again, off again coupons)and the difference is that you get glass lids instead of stainless and also you get a bonus 12" skillet, I missed out on it though, I had bought my set about 4 years ago, from amazon, but no regrets, they have been great,I got my money's worth already and know that they are going to last me a lifetime.The only thing I use non stick for, is crepes(dosa), thinking of getting a cast iron for that.
