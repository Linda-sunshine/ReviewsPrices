review/summary: GREAT (while it works)review/text: Eventually, this machine (and all other Keurig models, based on my brief Google searching) will break. Ours lasted about 2 years, but we don't use it every day. It just stopped brewing altogether. I tried every troubleshooting suggestion in the manual and a few others I could find online. I descaled. I used filters. I poked the needle holes with paper clips. Still broken.Do you know what happens when your Keurig stops brewing? It's garbage. Seriously, that's what the Keurig customer service person told me. If all troubleshooting methods fail, your machine is garbage. They don't even bother to refurb them. They will, however, offer you a discounted replacement. Gee, isn't that nice? I supposed it's nicer than no discount, but it is a sad thing, to me, when a company will only warrant a product for 1 year and then make you buy a replacement. I can't imagine the technology doesn't exist to make these things last longer.I spend enough on k-cups, but now I have to plan to buy a new brewer on a bi-annual basis. I took the bait anyway because we rely on this thing for coffee. I just hope this one breaks BEFORE the warranty expires! If you REALLY want a single cup brewer, I don't know of a better one, but just know, that the Keurig honeymoon won't last forever.
