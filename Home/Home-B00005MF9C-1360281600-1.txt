review/summary: Great coffeemaker and a real bargainreview/text: This a great little personal coffee maker, which I received a month ago. I've previously had Mr. Coffee Jr. and other 4 cup cofee makers and none of them came close to brewing coffee as hot as this. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a single cup brewer. While others have mentioned it is a little noisy while brewing, it certainly isn't too loud and I'm using it in the kitchen not the bedroom so it's no problem at all. Because this brews so hot, I also use it for tea and cocoa. It is used several times a day and so far so good.
