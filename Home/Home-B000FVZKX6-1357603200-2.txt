review/summary: Very softreview/text: I was a little hesitant about flannel sheets. I get hot very easily and like a cooler room and cool to touch sheets to sleep. However, I live in a colder climate and my feet get really cold. These are really soft to the feel very comfortable. The sheets are warm right when you get into bed which has helped with my cold feet as well. I had started wearing socks to bed but have since stopped. They maintain a steady warm temp all night. I do not get too warm. They are worth the price and would recommed to anyone.
