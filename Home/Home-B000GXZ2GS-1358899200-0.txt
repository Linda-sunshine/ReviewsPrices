review/summary: Simply a Great Cup of Coffeereview/text: A simple way to make a great a cup of coffee. I use it at work where we can't have personal coffee makers. By default it makes a great double-shot of espresso, which can be watered down to your taste.Only two downsides:1) Several pieces to keep track of. Can be tricky, but after a couple of times you get the hang of it.2) It will forever ruin any chance of stomaching the coffee sitting in the common coffee maker.
