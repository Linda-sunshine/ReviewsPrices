review/summary: Great Vacuumreview/text: I bought this vacuum for my carpeted steps that get full of hair from my dog. I needed something powerful and this does the job. I love the removable little hose as well. Only draw back is that it is a bit heavy for me and I keep changing hands when using it, but that's not that big of a deal. Also love that it does not require bags and has a nice little cup that can be emptied, so it is a money saver as well.
