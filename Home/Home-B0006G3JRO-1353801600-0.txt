review/summary: Love this model!review/text: I bought this model a year ago, and still love it! I used to use an industrial hand blender in a restaurant at work and decided to get one for myself. I got it for the main use of pureeing soups in the pot. The little food processor and whisk was an unexpected delight. I love how easy it is to use, and clean because of its detachable parts. I also love how powerful it is. I highly recommend this item and I think it is a great alternative to the expensive commercial types.
