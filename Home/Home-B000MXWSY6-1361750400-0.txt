review/summary: Alarm clock with easy to read digital displayreview/text: Out of the box, the time adjusted itself - what a great concept. Digital display is large and easy to read in the dark. I would recommend. I've always been satisfied with Sony products. It was easy to set both alarms. Met my expectation at a great price.
