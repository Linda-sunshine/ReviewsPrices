review/summary: Disappointing waste of a Saturday morning. LEAKS!!!!!review/text: I bought this unit to replace another Hoover on which the brushes broke and stopped working. This morning I moved my living room furniture and assembled the unit. I filled the solution tank and when I lifted it out of the sink all the water poured out of a leak on the bottom of the tank. Upon inspection it looks like there is a part that isn't sealed. My husband has run to the hardware store for epoxy which I hope we can use to fix the leak so I can actually try the unit out. So far it's been a waste of a Saturday morning.Update: We were able to fix the leak on the solution tank with some waterproof sealant. When I started to clean the carpet I noticed it wasn't getting wet and no water was being pulled up when I was pushing the regular trigger. I did figure that that using the Clean Surge button did work but holding that down the whole time I cleaned the carpet was a big pain. I attempted several times to get the regular trigger to work but no luck. I have owned many different carpet cleaners in the past and I'm greatly disappointed in this one. SNow that the carpet has totally dried there are big streaks in it probably from only being able to use the Clean Surge button and not getting a constant spray of cleaning solution. This is going back.
