review/summary: I'm so glad I got these because it's been cold!review/text: Yes, Very soft, very warm. Fits my very thick mattress where most don't.Over all very pleased. Only gripe is it's shedding.It has started to make little tiny flannel pellets from where we toss or rub in the sheets.I really like them and hope a couple more washes will get the shedding over with.Other than that, they are solf and warm and cozy and hard to get out of in the morning.
