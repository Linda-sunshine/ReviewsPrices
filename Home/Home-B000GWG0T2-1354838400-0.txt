review/summary: Great little panreview/text: Great little fry pan. Works well and clean up is a breeze, but I still can't figure out how the thermo-spot is supposed to tell me when my pan is ready. Either I'm way too impatient, or I lack the psychic abilities to properly interpret what the spot is trying to say. Regardless I've lived this long without communicating with fry pans so no complaints in that department.
