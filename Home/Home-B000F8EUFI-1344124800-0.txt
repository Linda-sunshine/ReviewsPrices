review/summary: Small but Awesome!review/text: Bought this because I wanted a new vacuum for the apartment I moved into. When I opened it I was a surprisingly disappointed by the size but the first time I used it I feel in love with the size. It can go into a lot of corners without having to move as much and it is POWERFUL!!
