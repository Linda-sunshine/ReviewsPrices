review/summary: Great coffee pressreview/text: Great product and makes great coffee. No worries about breaking the caraffe (which happended within two weeks of my last coffee press purchase). This is as close to the coffee a good coffee house coffee as I have gotten at home. Keeps the coffee warm for a while too. All internal parts are metal Which is so nice.
