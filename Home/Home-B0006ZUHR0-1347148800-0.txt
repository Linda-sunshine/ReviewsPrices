review/summary: Expectations met.review/text: I was extremely excited when I received my package after reading all of the reviews on this product. I've used it twice now, and I am pleased with my purchase. I previously owned a shark iron, which was a complete failure- a disturbing smell that would not dissipate. This iron has a smell as well, but it is definitely much better compared to the shark. As for the settings, it'll take a little while to get used to, but the lcd makes it much easier to work with. Auto-off is a great feature, especially since I'm usually too lazy to walk over to the outlet to unplug it.. haha. I would definitely recommend this to my friends, and I am also thinking about purchasing another in case this one breaks. Cheers.
