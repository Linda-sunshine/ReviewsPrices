review/summary: My mixer broke tooreview/text: I purchased a kitchenaid 6 quart mixer and the plastic transmission housing broke. Unlike others who this happened to, Kitchenaid told me tough luck, it's out of warranty.One would think a professional grade mixer could mix bread dough with the supplied dough hook.
