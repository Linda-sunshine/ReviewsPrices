review/summary: A perfect chef's knife.review/text: I purchased this knife for two reasons: 1) America's Test Kitchen rates it their best chef knife and 2) my 40 year old Sabatier 8&#34; chef knife while still in good shape and very satisfactory doesn't have the large blade that the Victorinox has.I absolutely love the Victorinox and highly, highly recommend it to any one. The only thing the Sabatier does better is smash garlic due to its heavier, thicker blade.I'm planning on getting the 12&#34; granton edge Victorinox slicer in the near future.By the way, the pronounciation of Victorinox according to their website is Victor-E-knocks.If 10 stars were an option, I would give this knife a 10.
