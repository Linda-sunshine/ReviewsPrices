review/summary: Fabulousreview/text: Absolutely no complaints! This juicer is great. I've used it with every vegetable and fruit under the sun and it just breezes right through....pulp, skin, seeds and all. Makes delicious juice and is fairly easy to clean by hand but it also dishwasher safe so, that's a big plus.
