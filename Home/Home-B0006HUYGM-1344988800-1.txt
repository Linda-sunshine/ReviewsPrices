review/summary: More powerful than I expected!review/text: This is a great little vacuum. I was originally looking for a cordless, but went with this one because of its great reviews. And I'm very glad I did. I use it for my stairs and it is more than I had hoped for. Very powerful suction, even with the hose. I now pull out this vacuum to do my edges and baseboards in the rest of the house because the hose is so great. My full size Dyson doesn't have near as good hose suction. The cord is very long, so it's not an annoyance at all. I'm very happy with this machine.
