review/summary: Looks so cute and works greatreview/text: Is not the tiger cute? I like it's look and well it works well too. We did use it when my 1 yr got cold and having slight breathing problem and it helped. The mist comes out very nicely from the vent on the tigers ear! The control is easy and easy to fill the water in too. I recommend it.
