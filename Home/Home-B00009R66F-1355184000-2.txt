review/summary: So far, so good...review/text: I had the Bissell Powersteamer for 2 years. Did a great job, but lost suction over time and was hard to clean.This one is very easy to clean. No bagged water tank. Bigger clean water tank for less refilling.Gave it 4 stars because I found it didn't pull up stains as well as my previous wet vac did. I found that I needed to press the &#34;clean surge&#34; button for regular cleaning, not just stubborn stains.
