review/summary: Kicks Buttreview/text: This thing is amazing. It inflates in minutes and is very sturdy and comfortable. It's quite firm. In fact, we've set it up just for the hell of it and slept on it in the living room before. It also deflates itself, removing all the air from it. Stores up easily. It's basically set up in about 5-7 minutes and then deflated in about another 5-7 minutes. Tip: Put the sheets on it while it's still deflated and let it inflate into the sheet. ;)
