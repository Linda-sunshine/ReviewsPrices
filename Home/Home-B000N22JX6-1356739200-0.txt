review/summary: Good heat output - goofy remote systemreview/text: This odd looking little heater works great! It has remarkably good heat output and all the functions seem to work after 3 weeks of use. I recommend you purchase this if you have a small or medium size room to heat. Ours is 18' x 12' with 8' ceilings, so it is not a small room. The remote: Is a joke. It works just fine but you have to stand right over the heater to be able to see the settings. The only way this would be useful is basic on/off - UNLESS ... you memorize exactly how many times to hit any particular button to get a setting you want. The remote use of the rotate function is simple and useful. So if you are really planning on being dependent on a remote, you might consider something else OR plan to work at this one to memorize what the top settings look like and how many button pushes it takes to get what you want.February 2013 Update: I still like the heater, but I wanted to add another annoyance. We have our heater sitting in the vicinity of our home theater setup (TV, satellite box, audio, etc.) and use of the AV system remotes (Sony, Dish, Vizio) messes with the heater if it is on. If it is off, it is not affected.
