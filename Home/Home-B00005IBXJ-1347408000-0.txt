review/summary: Makes stuff tastyreview/text: I just bought one of these and always though this thing was some kind of gimmick. However, it was more like any secondary thing you buy to cook food. The thing is surprisingly fun as well. The fun factor comes of course when it rotates, but its actually more fun to cook different foods on this. Most of them seem to come out just as good as the pizza it delivers. Aside from that this thing can save you money from heating up the oven. If you eat lots of chicken wings/nuggets/pizza/fish fillets then this thing can really save you time and actually make it taste better. The only problem I have with it is the pan that sits on a little head to balance it. It can be inconvenient at times because you can loose your whole load of food, with one wrongly made move. Get one of these things they are great!!
