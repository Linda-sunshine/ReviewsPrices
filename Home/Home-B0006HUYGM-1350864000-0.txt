review/summary: Great for Stairways - Not-So-Good for Most Dust-Buster Tasksreview/text: When my Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum arrived, I immediately noticed that the box proclaimed it to be "light weight." There was even a picture of a feather on the box. No kidding."But", I wondered. "Why the devil is this box so heavy? And why is it so big?" Too bad the box didn't also contain some dumbbells, so that I could buff-up.The Eureka has great suction, and it does a great job on stairs. And if you don't mind a bit of bending, it does a great job of picking up those messy crumbs. No doubt, it also does a great job of picking up pet hairs.Since, however, the hose is quite short, I cannot perch it up on my car seat while I vacuum. It is quite large, and it's design contributes to its appearing even heavier than it is. I think that it might more aptly be called a hands-held vacuum (yes, the plural).Anyway, I plan to keep it. I think that it will come in quite handy on stairs and on horizontal upholstery surfaces. Also, it is quite reasonably priced for the amount of suction. And maybe I'll actually buy some dumbbells.
