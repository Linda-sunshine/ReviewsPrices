review/summary: Love, love, love!review/text: I absolutely love this product. I don't consider myself an extreme juicer and bought it so my toddlers could have fresh real juice, instead of the high fructose corn syrup that you get in the store. Super fast and when you juice carrots the remaining pulp comes out as dry as sawdust! I freeze the leftover pulp to use in other recipes. I would recommend this product to anyone who has toddlers just starting on juice and for adults who just love fresh pure juice!
