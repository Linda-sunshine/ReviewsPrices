review/summary: Back to basicsreview/text: I'm so happy when we dumped our klunky, loud, unsanitary and ineffective countertop can opener! Not all appliances are better than the old fashion manual gadgets. The OXO easily opens cans of all sizes in a flash. No more fighting with an electric opener that can't seem to grip the edge of the can! This opener is so easy, fast & quiet to use and it isn't an eyesore in my kitchen. To keep it clean, we just toss it in the dish washer. After 3 years, I still love it!
