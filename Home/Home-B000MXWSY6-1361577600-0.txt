review/summary: Best clock everreview/text: At first I bought the white one for my truck and bought this black one from my home. Perhaps the only alarm clock in history that doesn't have a piercing laser like bright LCD display that lights up your whole room while you are trying to sleep as if someone parked their car in your room. I love the knobs to easily set the time, at first it looked weird but in use I am surprised not all clocks are this way. I think the alarm could be slightly louder but hey it seems to wake me up.
