review/summary: Excellent Filtered Water Dispenserreview/text: I have a water dispenser built into my refrigerator, but wanted something that produces better, colder water with faster dispensing. (My fridge takes forever to fill a glass and the water is not as cold.) This dispenser is economical and makes great tasting water, better tasting than my fridge's water, and just as good, if not better, than bottled water. It is larger and more convenient than a filtered water pitcher. I have to refill it with water less frequently than a pitcher, the dispensing is very easy, and it fits snugly off to the side inside my fridge. I recommend!
