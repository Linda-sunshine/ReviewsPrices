review/summary: Keeps my coffee warm, but...review/text: A great little product at a friendly price. I got this as a gift and couldn't be more pleased. Only draws 17 watts, about the same as a medium-sized CFL lamp. One caution: the warming surface gets hot -- as it's supposed to -- so keep it away from small children and be careful yourself. This product should not be used with plastic or double-walled insulated cups or mugs. Works fine with any ceramic cup -- anything ceramic or glass that's microwave safe is OK.Update a month later: One of the three units we purchased failed and has been returned to Amazon for replacement. Stay tuned and I'll update this review further if we have any more problems.
