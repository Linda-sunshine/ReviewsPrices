review/summary: nicereview/text: i use this wok a lot it has its own glass lid which is very heavy, this wok is pretty big and you can cook a lot of food in it, i really like it because you do not need to maintain it like the other types, the only reason that i gave it 4 stars is because the walls are a little thin and they can burn food when using high temperature.
