review/summary: Love this coffee makerreview/text: I bought this unit about 8 years ago and still works great. I use filtered water for brewing (RO system ) so no scale problems. Clean approximately every 2 or 3 weeks with 1/2 scoop of oxyclean in full carafe of hot tap water with cover on loose. Let soak for couple hours, than tighten cap and pour out through cap. Rinse pot and cap real good, and it will be as clean as the day you got it. I Believe this will keep it working properly with no more clogging, etc.This along with others advice will hopefully help with most of the problems.Best coffee maker I have ever owned.
