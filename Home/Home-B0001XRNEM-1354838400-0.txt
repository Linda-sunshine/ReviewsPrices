review/summary: Tamperreview/text: I use this Espresso Tamper every morning. I start my day with a Latte and found that the tamper connected to my machine to be very unhandy and not give me a consistent tamp. One can purchase much more expensive and fancier tampers, but this one works very well. I can not imagine needing a fancier one other than just the esthetics of it. This works and looks good.
