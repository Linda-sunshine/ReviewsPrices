review/summary: Amazingly Fun for Kidsreview/text: I've used this to chop cabbage, make zucchini &#34;noodles&#34; and spiral sweet potato fries. My son loves to help twirl the food and although the construction is super flimsy, I've had it for half a year and it's still working. If it breaks at this point, I'm pretty sure I'd just buy a new one because it works so well.
