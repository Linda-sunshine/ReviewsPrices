review/summary: Not worth bothering.review/text: I got this machine because people said it was OK for what it cost. Granted it does not cost a lot. Problem is it makes expresso and it foams milk, but by the time you get the two steps done it has all gone cold. This unit doesn't make the water hot enough and by time you put it all together it is just warm. Seems to take a long time for the water to get hot and doesn't stay that way. If you go to make more than one cup you will be waiting a long time between brews so don't plan on having friends over to get together for expessos unless you like to drink one at a time or have cold expesso. I guess if you want a good expesso you have to pay a lot more for a good machine or just go out.
