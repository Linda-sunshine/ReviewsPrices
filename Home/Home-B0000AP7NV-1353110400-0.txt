review/summary: Takes the "swampy" taste out of my well waterreview/text: I've got am expensive water system that kills microbes in my well water, but it always tasted swampy. The Brita makes the water very palatable and easy to drink and saves money on bottled water as well as landfill space from all of the bottles.The slim pitcher doesn't take up much room in the fridge and works fine for the three adults in my household.
