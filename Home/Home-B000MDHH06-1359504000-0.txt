review/summary: My favorite Juicerreview/text: I bought this about two years ago, and it is still going strong. It is easy to clean, compact, and overall very user friendly. Sometimes super juicy (citrus) fruits do make a bit of a mess, but not horrible. I would recommend this for someone who has small counter space, or someone new to the juice movement. I would buy it again!
