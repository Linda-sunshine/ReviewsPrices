review/summary: Well made, but heavyreview/text: Since it's cast iron, it's pretty heavy, but it cooks great once you let it get hot. Another thing about cast iron is that it takes a little while for it to get hot, but once it gets hot, it stay hot.Since you don't use soap to clean it, it's a little easier to just rinse it off w/ hot water and wipe it down. Even though it isn't &#34;non stick&#34;, since it's cured correctly when you get it, things don't stick to it, especially if you let it get hot before you put anything on it. So far, we love it. Just be sure you have two hands available when you need to move it.
