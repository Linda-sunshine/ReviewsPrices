review/summary: After 2 yearsreview/text: I love this mixer.I have been using it for 2 years now. I bake pizza and muffins every week, more than once per week.Occasionally I make my own pasta and I use for other things too.For the Pizza is perfect, the dough is quite soft so I can knit about 8 cups of flour for batch without any problem.The Muffins butter is even softer (almost liquid), so the limit is the volume of the bowl (which is quite large).For the pasta, the dough is significantly harder, so I can knit about 5 - 6 cups at the time, which is the rated capacity, so OK, I bought and I use all the time the pasta accessories too.What can I say, for a non professional, but quite serious user like me, this mixer is just perfect (and beside that, it looks great to me, but that is subjective)
