review/summary: Good but not good enoughreview/text: This is a great coffee maker but full of design flaws. When put the lid on, not even real tight it will be impossible to get off after making coffee. The lid expands and makes removal it almost impossible.The thermal carafe must be directly under the hole or coffee maker or it will spill. The guts of this product are all plastic, and when you get the water extra hot as this product does, you can't help but get that plastic taste that you would not get with stainless steel.I would not recommend buying this product.
