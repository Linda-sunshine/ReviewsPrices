review/summary: mixed bagreview/text: Pros:Easy setup. box to running in just a few minutes.wheels. easily rolls from room to room2 water tanks. You don't have to fill and carry a 3 gallon tank.Humidifies very well. In the front of my house with cathedral ceilings the humidity increase about 1% every 30 minutes running on low.Not evaporative so there is no heating element that gets coated in mineral deposits. Works similar to the in home units that mount to the furnace, room temperature air blowing through a water soaked filter.Cons:The main body just rests on top of the bottom tray and as such the plastic rattles from the fan vibration. adjusting the water tanks to get a good settled position does help.NOT quiet. On low the fan is acceptable, but on high you would have to have it in the basement and check the noise from the second floor to think it is relatively quiet. Some consider the noise level very acceptable but I do not, especially because of the rattly plastic body.Summary:I would recommend getting this if the noise is not an issue. I don't know if even on low that this could be in the bedroom as I slept (on high there is no chance unless you enjoy sleeping in wind tunnels). I purchased this from Amazon for $85, but now it looks priced at $144. I would recommend it at $85 but I don't think I would at $144.
