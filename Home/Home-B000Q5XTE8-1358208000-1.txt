review/summary: popular chairreview/text: We already had one of these in the office and i love it. Another gal had it first and gave it to me because I'm older and she's so generous. I felt a little guilty, but not enough to give it up! I was glad when we could order more, she got this one! I would love to replace every chair we have with this model. It is adjustable and comfortable. Everyone likes it.
