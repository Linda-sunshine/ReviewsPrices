review/summary: Wonderfulreview/text: I read all the reviews on this one before purchasing it, they were very helpful. This is a great vac, I have tile throughout the first floor of the house and it works great on tile. As in other reviews it is ok on carpeting, and they are right. It is good for a quick spot pick up on carpeting but not a full vacuum. I didn't buy it for carpeting. The suction on this canister is powerful and I would recommend it.
