review/summary: Awsomereview/text: I like to make my meals for the week. I throw a full bag of FROZEN chicken breasts with enough water and seasonings to cover the chicken, set the timer and have them all cooked up in less than 15 minutes, tender and juicy. It's all that I have used it for, but it's much better than waiting 4 - 6 hours for the crockpot to accomplish the same task!
