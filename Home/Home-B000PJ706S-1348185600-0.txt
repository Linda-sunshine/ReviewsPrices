review/summary: Nailed it...review/text: What do you need to know? Built well. Looks good. Heats water fast. Used nearly every day in my house (actually a replacement for one that was knocked off our counter). That would be my one knock on this...It won't survive a 3 foot drop onto hardwood floors.If you buy this, you'll be glad you did.
