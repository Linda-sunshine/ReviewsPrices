review/summary: Paid for itself the first weekreview/text: I'm not that big a fan of dehydrated food although I like jerky as a snack once in a while. My dog's however love jerky treats! Dog jerky goes for $20 ib and up while human grade jerky costs $15 and up (go figure). So I bought the Nesco FD-74A. My dogs love the jerky from this little machine. I've made it out of chicken, cut round steak, and hamburger meat. They love it all. I saw that some reviewers complained that there was no timer on the FD-75a but I just used a wall timer that I use for my Christmas lights and no problems. Easy to use and easy to clean. This is the one to buy!
