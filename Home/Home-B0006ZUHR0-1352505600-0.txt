review/summary: Excellent Productreview/text: My wife and I have used this item now for several months, just about on a daily basis. I paid a little more than I had orginally wanted, but the overall rating was one of the best and I figured we would get our money's worth within a few months. Some reviews indicate the iron is too heavy or too light. I suppose that simply has to do with how strong you are. Both my wife (5' 2" @ 100 lbs) and I (6' 1" @ 205 lbs) both found the weight to be just right for ironing everything from denim jeans, to cotton shirts, to light weight fabrics. Some reviews indicate the water would leak. The only one time I recall this happening was when I filled the reservoir beyond the max fill line. My fault, shame on me. Now I fill it to about an inch below the line and haven't had it happen again. The water still lasts for a few days and, afterall, how much water/steam do you really need to iron out a few garments at a time. Nothing's perfect in this world. Some things are made better than others. Judging from the one example I received from this assembly line, I give this product my full endorsement.
