review/summary: The Way to Cook Steaksreview/text: It's fantastic that such a great way for cooking meat is so highly recommended by chefs and foodies everywhere yet is still so affordable and accessible to everyone.The Lodge Logic cast iron skillets are amazingly solid and heavy skillets that are pre-seasoned and coated so they are ready to use and grill.These things literally last for years and have the important characteristic of getting extremely hot compared to an ordinary pan that will do wonders for your steak cooking.A few notes/advice:1) Don't put a lot of oil on this. A tiny bit is fine, but the char and coating of the skillet add to the flavor of the steak.2) Don't use soap to clean this. Just water. It's a bit harder to get the grease out, but it will be fine.3) Finally, allow the item to completely dry and wipe it dry. I made the mistake of not doing so and the cast iron can quickly rust. In most cases, the rust can be scrubbed off, but after a few times it can definitely be an issue and I bought a new one.4) These are great for placing in ovens. But they get very hot. If you are gonna handle when it is hot, definitely use something like anOve' Glove Hot Surface Handler, 1 Glove (Pack of 2)or theLodge ASHH11 Silicone Hot Handle Holder, Blackfor safety.
