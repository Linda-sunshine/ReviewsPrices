review/summary: Works wonderfullyreview/text: We've owned several Moka makers, all of dubious quality. We finally decided to get a legit one, and boy what a difference. Definitely works better than any of the others we have owned in the past. Note that a 6-cup espresso maker doesn't make 6 cups of coffee, it makes 6 espressos, which is considerably smaller (just in case that's not obvious).
