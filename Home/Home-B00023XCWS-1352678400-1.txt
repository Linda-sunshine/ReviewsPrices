review/summary: Handy unwatched pot.review/text: This is the handiest thing on my kitchen counter. I use it almost every day. My wife got it for my son ten years back when he went off to college. It still works like new. It's way better than a tea kettle on the stove because it turns itself off. I use the hot water for oatmeal, ramen, mac & cheese....... The uses for quick boiling water seem to be endless. "A watched pot never boils" A unwatched pot can boil away. This kettle solves the problem.
