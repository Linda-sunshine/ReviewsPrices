review/summary: Poorly made.review/text: I realized in reading the other reviews that this unit is plastic, not close to restaurant grade but I would have expected even a modestly priced light-duty unit to get through more than one potato before breaking.One Yukon Gold, one thin skinned, new potato was all that it could slice before the handle broke into 3 pieces in my hand.The basic idea of the unit is sound so I'll make a trip to the local home center and see if I can come up with a fix.God help anyone that tries a carrot or harder root vegetable.
