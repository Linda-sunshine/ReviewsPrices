review/summary: Brita Filter Pitcher, but the indicator is either broken or very confusing...review/text: Very tasty water, as I expected from Brita, after the filtration. I can tell a significant difference between the filtered and unfiltered water. Very easy to use, too. The size is good, big but not too big to fit in the fridge.My only complaint is that, the filter indicator somehow doesn't work. Only very few times it will blink when water goes through the filter, but this doesn't even happen all the time. Don't know if I missed a trick or something.
