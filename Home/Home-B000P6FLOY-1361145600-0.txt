review/summary: Great product!review/text: I originally bought this to use for roasting meat in the oven - the temperature alarm set is great for that purpose. Now I use it for all kinds of other things - I make cheese and yogurt and it is a great tool for measuring temperature for those purposes as well. Nice that it comes with a pot clip. You can use it for making custard and egg sauces as well if you don't want to overheat your eggs. Controls are very easy to master, very intuitive. Clever of them to have included a magnetic strip on the back as well, so you can clip the readout device to any magnetic surface. Super easy to clean up. All in all, I'm finding it to be a great kitchen tool which I use often, and I would highly recommend.
