review/summary: Pepper Bobreview/text: Got my Nesco FD-75 700 watt Food Dehydrator in 2 days.The price went up $8.00 just before I ordered it that's why I only gave a 4 star rating.I am a Hot Pepper Chili Head and I will be using this wonderful Nesco dehydrator to dry Hot PEPPERS and much more. Its hard to dry the peppers outside on the east coast.Amazon Shipping gets a 7 star rating for the speedy delivery.I am hoping to make some Beef Jerky very soon !Well I made the Beef Jerky in only 2 hours for 2 lbs of beef. I added more heat to my jerky and it was delicious. It came out perfect on my first try.I dried about 7 lbs of apples and that took very long about 12 hours.I had 7 trays of apples.The apples came out a bit hard to chew.I added cinnamon and sugar.Love how quite it runs and easy to clean in a big sink. Just soak it for about 1 hour and use a scrub brush to clean between each groove and clevis.Knowing when pepper season starts again my Nesco will get lots of use.Drying peppers and seeds. I got the Krups GX4100 200 w Coffee Grinder to grind up my Pepper to make pepper powder and flakes.I love it when a good plan comes together.
