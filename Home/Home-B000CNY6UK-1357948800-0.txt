review/summary: For anyone who likes real coffeereview/text: This little espresso maker is perfect for anyone who wants more than the brown water that an automatic drip maker offers. It does take longer to brew, but is worth the wait. It takes 15 minutes on low- medium heat (#4 on my glass top stove) This Italian model is superior to the cheap Spanish ones from local grocery stores. A very good buy!
