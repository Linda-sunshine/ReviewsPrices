review/summary: Excellent one problemreview/text: Watch how you load the batter to much will allow it to spill over the front on top of the heat control if you are a clean freak use a toothbrush to clean in the crevis. This will allow you to continue with your cooking of normal waffles. This is a issue with several other reviews I knew it before I purchased the product. ALWAYS READ REVIEWS!
