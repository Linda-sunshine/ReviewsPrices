review/summary: Comfortablereview/text: I don't use the super tight pillowcase that came with the pillow, allowing me too mod the pillow into the shape I want. It is a bit noisy as you lay on it with your ear, but I put a throw blanket over it and it decreases the sound without affecting the comfort
