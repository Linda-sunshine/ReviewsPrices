review/summary: Great coffee maker until it diedreview/text: I've been using my B70 brewer for about 1.5 years and haven't had any problems until recently. A few weeks ago, my brewer started brewing parital cups, then a couple days ago I got the descale message. While I was descaling, the brewer started putting out less and less water until nothing came out at all, even though the machine would still say brewing.I had no idea so many other people had the same problem until I tried to look up troubleshooting tips. I tried several suggestions - unclogging the needles (both), and cleaning the filter and nothing worked. Finally I called customer service to see if they could do anything to help. Well my disappointment with Keurig's customer service was almost as great as my disappointment with the coffee maker. The only trouble shooting the representative offered was for me to unclog the needles, which I'd already done, and that was it! No offer for replacement parts, other tips to try, nothing. Well he did offer to sell me another Keurig at at steep discount of $117 which I promptly declined.If I'm going to spend $100+ on a coffee maker, I expect it to be a quality one and last more than 1.5 years (though that seems to be longer than a lot of other people based on reviews). I think this time around I'm going to try a different coffee maker. Maybe then I'll at least get a longer warranty on the machine.If you're looking for a nice coffee maker that will last please don't purchase this Keurig. You might be happy momentarily but it won't last.
