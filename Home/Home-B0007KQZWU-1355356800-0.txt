review/summary: Beautiful, fantastic cookware!review/text: These pans are a treat! My wife and I received them as a wedding gift, and use them daily. Here are a few tips to keep your pans cooking and looking like new:Use on MEDIUM heat, no higher, unless you are simply boiling water. They are extremely efficient at distributing heat to the whole pan, thanks to their multi-clad design, so your food will not "cook faster" at a higher heat, it will simply burn.Most of the time, the pan will come clean with soap and water, sometimes you need to scrub a little with a plastic bristle brush to remove debris. For discoloration and stuck on food, use a little bit of lime juice. The citric acid breaks down the food, and is totally natural. Lime juice from concentrate works fine. Coat the bottom of the pan with enough lime juice that the whole bottom is wet, and set on high heat for 2 minutes or until it starts to boil, then remove from heat. Without rinsing, immediately scrub with a bristle brush to loosen any debris, then rinse, and clean with soap and water. The pan will return to it's factory shine. Repeat if necessary. We've used these pans daily for almost a year, and this has kept them looking like new.For clingy foods, like eggs, do a "quick season" before using. Heat the pan until it is very hot, then put a small amount of oil or lard in it. Swirl the oil around to coat the pan, then add roughly 1 tsp of kosher salt. With a wad of paper towels, grind the salt into the pan. Dump the salt out and wipe clean with a paper towel. DO NOT use soap or water to clean the pan, simply wipe clean with a paper towel, allow to cool, then use as necessary.Finally, avoid using metal utensils in the pans. It will not affect their cooking functionality, but it will leave scratch marks that will remain for the life of the pan. Instead, use wooden utensils or silicon utensils rated for high heat.Enjoy!
