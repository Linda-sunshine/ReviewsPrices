review/summary: If u want sharp & cheap knife this is the one ur looking forreview/text: I'm a culinary academy student and I bought this because I lost my knife kit. The first impression of this knife was bad.It was light and seems too thin to me. Also the metal felt like some kind of cheap plastic. But this knife!!I haven't used many knives but compare to this, my previous stupid expensive french standard chef knife is just a dull heavy metal stick.The one more thing I really like about this knife is the long deep. It's almost as long as santoku which is japanese style knife and it has less curve at the tip and shorter length than chef knife.What I mean is this knife has the pros both chef knife & santoku. This is a huge advantage when you want to cut different styles.It's been about a week and I used it alot. Maybe couple jumbo bags of onions and carrots. And it's still freaking sharp. All I did is using steel frequentely to keep the edge. But it's important to use it right way. Otherwise it dulls ur knife.Anyway, if u need a knife go for it. You won't be disappointed!p.s. I found my knife kit few days ago and I wrapped my previous chef knife and put it in the storage room. I guess I won't need to see that knife ever again.
