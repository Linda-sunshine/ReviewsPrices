review/summary: Electric Pressure Cookerreview/text: I have one of these. I just purchased another one for my son as a gift. It is amazing to cook a pot of dry beans in less than 45 minutes. I don't have to soak them. A good bowl of soup without spending much time, is great. I cut up some fresh vegetables in it, and they are perfect everytime. A wonderful gift for your loved one.
