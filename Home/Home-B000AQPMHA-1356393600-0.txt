review/summary: Defectivereview/text: About 20 percent of reviews on this product state it was defective. Ours was no exception. You have to wiggle the handle to get it to work,and then, it only works part time. We're returning it tomorrow. I found another model for less money that will do a whole pot and a single serving. And the ratings are much higher. Look around. This isn't a reliable machine.
