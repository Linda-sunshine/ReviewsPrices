review/summary: Beware when washing!review/text: I have gotten this set and although it looks nice, you must keep the supposedly STAINLESS set very very dry at all times, otherwise you get rusty spots. I have hand washed these and placed them to dry with the rest. The Ginsu are the only ones who got rusty spots. I even tried a couple on a dishwasher to see if it would do any better but it was the same (the Dishwasher actually dried them better but it didn't fix the problem).I am considering throwing the entire set because of this. Really, you don't want rusty spots in your knives!I took a photo to demonstrate how bad it is, but Amazon won't let me place links.Despite that, the knives and the whole set is nice, and if you don't have anything it ought to be a nice starting (and cheap) point. But I'd recommend looking elsewhere due to the above problem.
