review/summary: Perfect Waffle Maker!review/text: I rarely write reviews, but I couldn't resist raving about this waffle maker. I read about every model out there, and decided on the Cuisinart because it's one of my favorite brands. I wanted one that would be easy to use, but still make the perfect waffle. This one didn't disappoint. I used the basic waffle recipe from the back of the bisquick box, heated up the waffle maker, poured in 1/2 cup of batter, closed the lid and waited for the light to change from red to green.What came out was the perfect, most delicious waffle. I then finished up the batter to make more waffles, put them in a Ziploc, and put them in the freezer. Tomorrow morning, I'll just pop the frozen waffles into the toaster.This waffle maker works exactly as described, and in minutes made restaurant quality waffles. I highly recommend it!
