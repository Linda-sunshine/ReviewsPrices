review/summary: this made all the difference, for mereview/text: I have a DeLonghi EC155 espresso machine. It's got a built-in tamper. I bought this because Amazon suggested it, some coffee blogs echoed the recommendation, because the built-in tamper's a bit awkward to use, and, most importantly of all, because my espresso machine's tamper size is 52mm, which means a lot of the other tampers I saw on Amazon were too big.I had my doubts about this but I said why not, it's only $7. turned out great. without this, my espresso machine is OK. with this, my espresso machine creates absolutely fantastic espresso.essential product in my opinion.
