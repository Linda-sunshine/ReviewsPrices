review/summary: Travel coffee doesn't get any betterreview/text: I have an espresso machine at home but the AeroPress keeps me covered at work or while traveling. As the other reviews say, it makes great coffee and is very simple to use. It's also very light weight and easy to take along. I find is especially well suited for camping and other outdoor activities where you don't want to settle for instant coffee but also wouldn't want to drag a glass french press along.
