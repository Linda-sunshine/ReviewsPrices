review/summary: confusing setupreview/text: We use this for summer storm season. It does 'work' but I have to go online and get it setup every year. perhaps there's something wrong with it and I just don't know what I'm doing, but I have a portable hand held device that we end up using instead just because it's such a pain to deal with.the hand held we use is Oregon Scientific WR602 and I *love* it!
