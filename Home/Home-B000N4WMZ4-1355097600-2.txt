review/summary: Amazing Dutch oven!review/text: I did a lot of research online and at a local kitchen store before deciding to buy the Lodge Dutch oven. I have no regrets! It is great. It cooks wonderfully, nothing sticks to it and is easy to clean. They recommend using cooking spray before cooking in it for easier cleaning but I don't and still no problem cleaning it. I love the way my food cooks and tastes. I make casseroles, Sheppard pie, soups, stew and even made a tall layered lasagna! I recommend this to anyone. Much cheaper than the expensive Le Creuset and even the lady at the kitchen store told me it was tested in a kitchen and performed as well at the &#34;Le Creuset&#34;.
