review/summary: AMAZING!review/text: If I could give this TEN stars, I would! I had a crappy carpet cleaner (stationary brush, terrible suction) for years, but it was good for basic spill cleanups. It finally died and I wanted to get something that would clean my WHOLE carpet and not leave the it saturated for 2 days afterwards. This one is perfect! I have 2 dogs, 2 cats that occasionally come in the house, an 11-year old boy and his 3 year old brother - the carpet is slate blue and hides stains well, but with pets and kids and a husband that often forgets to take his dirty workboots off, the carpet gets dirty fast. I put this together as soon as I got it and used it THAT night (it came with a bottle of cleaner - bonus!!) I was AMAZED at how much dirt and grossness it pulled out of my carpet - as a mom and housewife, I was actually kind of ashamed I let ANYONE sit on that nasty carpet! The spinning brushes do an amazing job, and the rotating brush handtool gets my stairs cleaner than I ever thought they could be. I won't lie, attaching the handtool in under 5 minutes takes some practice, and it's kind of a pain at first, but it's SO worth it for stairs and upholstery! Shipping was FAST and this is the best product I have purchased in a LONG time, and I will definitely buy another one of these when the day comes!
