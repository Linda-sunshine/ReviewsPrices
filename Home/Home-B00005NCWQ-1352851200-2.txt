review/summary: Good stovetop percolatorreview/text: I ordered this when I had to do without my electric Faberware percolator during the Post-Sandy blackout. When I was without power following the Noreaster snowstorm it was good to be able to make coffee on the stovetop. It works well, and after making one pot that was a little weak I got the hand of it. It is key to lower the heat as soon as it starts perking and to continue for at least 7-8 minutes. Overall it seems a good product, at least for the hopefully occasional use I will need it for.
