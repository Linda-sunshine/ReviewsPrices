review/summary: A great cooker!review/text: This past Christmas I had to prepare dinner for my kids, their spouses and girlfriends plus one or two others. I decided to buy the Presto 6 qt cooker to cut down on prep time. Wow, did it ever! The pork roast and mashed potatoes cooked quickly and came out quite tasty. I just followed the directions and Presto! (Sorry for the pun!) A good quality cooker for a great price!
