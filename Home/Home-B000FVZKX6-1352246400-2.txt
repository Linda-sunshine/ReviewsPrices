review/summary: Velvety flannel sheetsreview/text: The Pinzon flannel sheets are like sleeping on velvet! They are soft, warm, and comforting on our cold Montana nights. We got one set, used them for a week, and ordered a second set. They are also very wide, so they drape a good 12 inches on either side of our Cal King bed, so they keep out the cold air even when one person rolls over and takes a bit more than his/her share of the sheets. Would we buy them again? You bet!!!!!
