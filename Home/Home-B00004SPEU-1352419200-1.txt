review/summary: Not for real espresso, but a good grinderreview/text: I purchased this to grind espresso. See, it became VERY hard to source a burr in a lower price range. I thought MAYBE I could grind it fine enough with the blades. I was wrong.If you're looking for something similar to a burr, then dont get this.However, it is a quality grinder. I did end up using this to grind drip coffee(to spare my later purchased real burr some extra work), spices, and flax seeds and it did a wonderful job at that.It did not serve its original purpose, however, It did serve other purposes in my household.It is a quality machine, that will hold up over time. I will say the plastic cup did get chipped easily, hence 4 star rating.
