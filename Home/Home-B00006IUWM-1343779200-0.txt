review/summary: Not Worth The Pricereview/text: My previous review is gone, so I will post again since all the positive reviews are wrong. This will get your knife no sharper than a cheap handheld sharpener. As others have stated, the motor seizes with little pressure. Either purchase the expensive high grade sharpener or the cheap one. This middle grade sharpens no better than the cheap ones.
