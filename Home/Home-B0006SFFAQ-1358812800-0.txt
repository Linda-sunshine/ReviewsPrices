review/summary: Almost perfect for me.review/text: I do like this coffee maker and hope that it lasts longer that the Mr Coffee brand makers that I have used previously.Attractive product and works well. As others have mentioned the con for me is difficult to see what line the water is at. The water area is small and dark. It is a bit taller than many other coffee makers. Overall I like it and if it lasts I will certainly buy another when it's time.
