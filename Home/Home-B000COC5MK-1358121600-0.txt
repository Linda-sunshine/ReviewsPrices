review/summary: Great productreview/text: Love this wine opener! It has this sleek stand and look to it, it goes very well in my kitchen. I only bought this out of curiosity (if this actually works) and because of the price I figured I couldn't go wrong. At first, I wasn't quite sure that this would push through with its usage. But when I started opening bottles of wine with this amazing wine opener, I was astonished that it actually delivers quality work. Almost no effort is required because this opener does all the work for you. its pretty cool
