review/summary: Ok - You get what you pay forreview/text: I paid $10 for this item and that is what it is worth. The cord is too short, if you attempt to pour too fast, boiling water spills out of the top and scalds your hand. It is cheaply made and sometimes it does not shut off at all (supposed to shut off automatically when water boils). Top cover is cheap plastic and hard to open..know it will break within a year. Product was scratched and somewhat dirty (black stains and marks on exterior) and appeared reconditioned...but for $10.00, I'll use it til it breaks. Would not recommend or purchase again.
