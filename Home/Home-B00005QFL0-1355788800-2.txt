review/summary: Used only once, but had to writereview/text: Made our first loaf last night and it came out incredibly good. We've had bread from other bread machines, but something about this bread is special. I'm giving it 5 stars on how the bread came out.. however, I will say that the machine inside had some scratches and some debris from the factory maybe? Not too reassuring knowing that it was built in China (what else is new?).. But the bread (even without adding dry milk powder as the recipe suggests), came out fantastic, fluffy, light, with a beautiful golden crust.. If it lasts, this could easily be our favorite kitchen device.
