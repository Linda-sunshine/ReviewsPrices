review/summary: Pro's & Con'sreview/text: This is a value carpet extractor but be aware of a few issues.Pro&#8217;s:The solution and dirty water reservoir are separate and bigger then a Bissell bladder.After extracting the water from the carpet, the carpet seems much dryer then my previous Bissell pro-heat.It&#8217;s heavy but seems easy to push and pull when cleaning.Cons:The handheld solution hose needs to be manually connectedThe bottom tank can be a little bit of a pain to remove and empty.Some of the movable parts seem flimsy, although I haven&#8217;t had an issue yetIts loud and heavy if you have many of stairsSometimes it leaks after useIt doesn&#8217;t heat the water like the Bissell pro-heat.
