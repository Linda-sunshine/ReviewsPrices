review/summary: Pretty cool ice cube tray :)review/text: When I first read the description I thought it a bit over the top. They're ice cubes, after all. How amazing can they be?Well... the answer, apparently, is pretty amazing. The only knock I have on the finished product is that for a narrow glass you'll only get one stack - no side by side action. Otherwise - no complaints. Easy to empty the tray, nothing sticks, there's no channels that end up making one big mega-cube, and you don't spend 20 minutes twisting and bending and fearing you'll break your tray. They're big enough you can drop mint leaves or bits of fruit in and make some fancy drinks - a hit if you're hosting a party. They stack well - no sticking to one another in the freezer. They're dishwasher safe. What's not to love?
