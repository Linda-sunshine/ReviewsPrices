review/summary: MY FAVORITE KITCHEN TOOL!review/text: I got this immersion blender last year for Christmas - I absolutely LOVE it! And so does my son, who uses it to make milkshakes and protein drinks (with strawberries, bananas, ice cream, etc.) It is very powerful and takes seconds to complete the task... and it is so easy to clean. Takes minimal space to store. I use it most often to emulsify soups. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves to cook and appreciates a great tool! You may never use your blender again with any food you wish you to blend or emulsify!
