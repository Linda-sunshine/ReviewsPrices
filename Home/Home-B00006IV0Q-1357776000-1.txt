review/summary: Simplicity at Lastreview/text: Why did we ever switch to coffeemakers? This perker's retro/kitch looks are cool, and it takes up less room on my countertop. It's MUCH easier to clean around than a big coffeemaker, but most importantly, it makes hotter, BETTER coffee than my expensive Cuisinart (which constantly leaked and poured badly). Set-up is simple with the Presto, and I've had no trouble with grounds, as others have complained about. Of course, it doesn't have a clock and isn't programmable, but so what. I'd rather grind fresh beans and wait a bit than fuss with all that stuff, anyway.
