review/summary: Broke on first usereview/text: Great idea, but the craftsmanship leaves something to be desired. I bought this to use with cookies for the holidays. On the first recipe I used it, I was disappointed to find that the peg holding one of the black handle covers broke off. Now the black cover wiggles a lot when I squeeze to release the scooped contents. Not happy about that!
