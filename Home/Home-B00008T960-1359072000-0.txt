review/summary: Magic.review/text: These things are awesome. Food that would stick to anything slides right off of this, which when you're baking sugar cookies in the crankiest oven ever, is a godsend.Unfortunately, I bought this for my mother, so I will have to continue to sneak over to her house to bake until I manage to acquire one for my own kitchen.It is only a matter of time.
