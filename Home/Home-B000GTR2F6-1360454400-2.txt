review/summary: Worth The Moneyreview/text: When I got pregnant with my second child I couldn't have caffeine we were wasting so much coffee in our regular pot making regular and decaf pot fulls. We weren't able to figure out the right ratio to make smaller pots. Costco had a great sale on the Keurig machine so we got it. From the moment we set it up we were super impressed with it. The only down side is the largest cup doesn't fill out cups (we have large cups) and the coffee is a bit expensive but overall I'd give it 4 1/2 stars.
