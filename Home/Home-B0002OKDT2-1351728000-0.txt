review/summary: This product is highly dangerous! The engine is burning!review/text: Item ordered few week ago. A white smoke and a burning smell appeared immediately after switching it on. Then the juice maker switched off. I returned it and ask for a replacement. The second item was delivered today and the same problem happened. There is a major defect with that product. This is highly disappointing as it shows that no action was taken after I returned the first defective product. Also Amazon reimbursed only $ 20 for the return cost from Hong Kong to the USA while it costed me 9 times more.
