review/summary: Awesome, effective little heater for a great pricereview/text: Like most other reviewers, I bought this heater to put in my bathroom during the winter. For whatever reason, that room gets the chilliest during the cold season and it's pretty miserable. I looked all over Amazon, read reviews, and almost went with Vornado (a personal favorite). I am glad I ended up with this nice looking Lasko. It has given me ZERO problems, keeps my bathroom nice and toasty, and the designer look fits well in the room. You can't beat setting this heater to a specific setting (in my case 70 degrees) and knowing the room will be kept at that temperature until you turn the heater off. If I want a lot of heat in a small period of time, I crank it up to max heat, and it has no trouble throwing out some serious heat in the bathroom. The remote is a nice feature too, but I don't use it much. I am glad I went with this one, even though I was wary of the Lasko brand. It has not let me down yet, and tends to run almost night and day. It's never hot to the touch, and never gives off any kind of smell. If you're using this for a smaller room, it will not disappoint. But don't expect a small heater like this to heat a large room efficiently. Thank you Amazon and reviewers for leading me to this heater, which so far is the best I've owned!
