review/summary: not badreview/text: I have been using this juicer since the day I got it, which is about 3 to 4 weeks. Not daily (time consuming), but with more than average consistency. The following is based on personal opinion only. This is my first juicer as well as first time juicing.Pros:- handles all veggies and fruits I've used so far including apples and carrots.- seems to be a strong motor.- extracts a lot of juice. pulp is for the most part dry. not sawdust dry, logically i expect some moisture.Cons: - when placing harder fruits or vegetables whole, like carrots or quarter slices of apples, the pieces tend to get stuck at the bottom.- cleanup is also time consumingOverall this juicer has done the job well and still going strong. I hope it stays this way for a long time. I have a full schedule, so I can't always juice as much as i would like since there is a lot of prep work as well as the clean up. Other than that, if time is not an issue for you or if you can administer yourself around this factor, I definitely recommend this juicer.
