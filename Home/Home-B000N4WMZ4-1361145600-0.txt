review/summary: Better Than Le Creuset and Other Cookware That Is 5X more expensivereview/text: The durability, looks, heft, and lid fitting are in many ways better than a Le Creuset. For one, the lid handle is metal (and thus oven safe for higher temps) and the weight is more in line with Staub or other high end dutch ovens (Le Creuset runs a tad light). Lastly, the fit of the lid is especially good, which is usually the fatal flaw of the non-brand name dutch/french ovens. I would recommend this over a Staub or Le Creuset even if they were all the same price. Now only if it came in an oval shape...
