review/summary: Absolutely NOT the same as Le Creusetreview/text: I purchased this exact item and was elated at first. It is absolutely BEAUTIFUL. But in time I found that the bottom interior surface stained and it chipped easily. I was unhappily surprised to say the least. Lodge's non-enameled cast iron products,which I also own are superlative.Despite this experience with Lodge's enameled dutch oven, I purchased a Le Creuset enameled cast iron dutch oven because I found it on sale. There is a world of difference!!!The Le Creuset is flawlessly beautiful and it will last you forever just like my French and Belgian Friends said it would. After many months of use.....there are no chips, and no stains. Food comes out as expected. It is Non-stick, reliable cooking and easy to clean. So don't pinch those poor pennies of yours. Give them a rest. Purchase a Le Crueset dutch oven and you'll never need to have regret.
