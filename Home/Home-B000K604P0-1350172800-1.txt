review/summary: Does as promised by Thermosreview/text: I bought this because I wanted something to keep my coffee hot now that it's starting to get cold here in Minneapolis. I bought a grande Starbucks at 9am and the drink burnt my tongue at 6pm! The only thing you have to watch out is that the barista might fill the coffee above the neck of the flask, which could result in leaks, so just tell them where is the limit of the bottle.
