review/summary: AMAZING!!review/text: I just have to say this mirror is fantastic! I had previously owned the Conair tri-fold mirror before I bought this one. Worst mistake EVER! The lights went out after only 2 weeks of use. It was a disappointment, but based on the other reviews on that mirror, I should have expected that. Unlike the Conair tri-fold mirror, the Jerdon tri-fold mirror is an amazing product. I really recommend this for someone who is looking for all lighting situations from one mirror. I use this everyday, and haven't been disappointed. Hope this is helpful for your future mirror shopping c:
