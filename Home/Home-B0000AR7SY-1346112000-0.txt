review/summary: Needs an On / Off Switchreview/text: First off, let me say that this Burr Grinder is very good at grinding coffee. I like the low motor speed, variable grind size and relatively quiet operation. Now that I have that out of the way, let me say what I don't like: There is no on/off switch! Instead there is a timer switch which you twist to turn the grinder on and it will shut itself off when the timer runs down. I find this very awkward to use. If you don't turn the knob far enough, it will stop before all the beans are ground and you have to twist it again. If you just turn the knob all the way, it will run on well after the beans are ground up which is annoying. Of course, you can turn the knob back to zero to stop it (again annoying) or you can turn the grind size control to the index dot and remove the bean chamber from the grinder (really annoying).Why is there a timer on this machine at all? It only runs for approx 20 seconds max anyway. It is not like I was going to start the grind and go off to do a load of laundry or mow the lawn. If I am grinding beans, I am going to have a cup of coffee before I do anything else! So I stand there and wait ten seconds for the beans to grind, why do I need a timer switch?
