review/summary: great to start, big problems laterreview/text: We bought this sound machine for our baby, and it has helped her sleep very well for the last 5 months However, 5 out of the last 7 nights, I have been woken up because the sound machine stopped working and made this awful, VERY loud beeping in the middle of the night. It works again if I turn the power off and then back on again, resuming the noise I want. It's a mixed bag, works for a while and then this starts. I would probably not buy this product again, and search another company's options.
