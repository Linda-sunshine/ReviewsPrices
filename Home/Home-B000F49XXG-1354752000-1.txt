review/summary: Great Productreview/text: I have used this for 2 months now and get delicious creamy shots every time. It's really hard to produce anything but a perfect shot, but I use freshly ground beans every time. This machine can make people question why they pay $5 bucks at Starbucks. It is very easy to use and clean. The directions are straight forward, and tell you everything you need to know about producing good shots. I'm glad I bought this instead of a $200+ machine. You need to buy small shot glasses though. Anything over 3 inches tall is too tall. Keep that in mind.
