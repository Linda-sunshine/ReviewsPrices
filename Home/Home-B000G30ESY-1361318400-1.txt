review/summary: Great rice cooker!review/text: Great rice cooker it plays a tune when you start the cooker and when it is finished! to start my review think of a perfect rice cooker and that's it! has a measuring cup and a water level line on the inside to help anyone make rice easy!! only flaw is their is no count down from the beginning usually it will take 40-60min to cook but only at the last 10min does it do a count down. Which is a tad annoying if you are trying to time everything to be done at the same time but still the rice cooker has a function keep the rice warm for a while after it is done cooking! The instructions are a bit confusing for me but once you figure it out it's pretty easy the cooker is built very well and looks to be able to last some time I would recommend it to everyone who doesn't have time or know how to make rice perfectly the way the rice comes out if you put the right amount of water in is PERFECT every time!
