review/summary: Save time and energy with this handy gadget!!review/text: I have been using this product for quite a while now and could not be happier with it. It is well built and has truly made cooking quicker and more convenient. If you frequently make your own sauces, you will be satisfied with this blender. You do not have to transfer anything to a blender and then back to the pot after blending (and then cleanup!). You simply put the blender down into the mixture that you want to blend and it is done right in the pot. It also makes great smoothies with ease!! To clean, you simply remove the blade piece and rinse under hot water. For the price, it is a bargain!
