review/summary: Excellentreview/text: I read reviews for hours before ordering this, it was worth the time. It works really well and is easy to clean, something people complained about in other models.The only thing I don't like is that dial setting. Since I always want to make the same amount, 4 scoops for a French Press, it would be nice to have a repeatable setting or something that stayed and you'd just press start. With this you twist the know to an approximate area and release it. You can't stop it in the middle either.However 2 1/2 seems to come pretty easily with a twist if I look what I'm doing, so all is fine.As to the grind it took me a few pots to find the right setting and quantity. Contrary to everything I read using Coarse is not best for the French Press, I have it on the coarse side of medium and that works great. Coarse made too weak coffee, so I kept getting less and less coarse until it tasted right. No problem with the grinds getting around the press filter thing.Great coffee.
