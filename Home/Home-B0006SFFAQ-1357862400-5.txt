review/summary: some bad features and poor performancereview/text: My last 3 coffeemakers have been Cuisinart and this is my last one. Malfunctioned after 13 months, it was a replacement for an original coffeemaker and now they will not honor the 3 year warranty. The small opening for the water is a problem, the water level is very difficult to see and all black makes it difficult to read the clock too. I had a white one before and it stained badly. Don't recommend Cuisinart anymore. Also had two Cuisinart coffee grinders and they both malfunctioned and returned to the store. The store clerk guessed what was wrong before I even told them because they had had so many returns. I have never written a review before but so disappointed in a company that used to make good small appliances.
