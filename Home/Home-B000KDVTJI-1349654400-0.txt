review/summary: Broke on fourth usereview/text: Purchased some months and used it once to confirm it worked. Started using it again this week but after four times it won't work anymore. Heating flap stays down and light comes on but unit won't heat and also won't automatically shut off. Called toll free number and it looks like they may send a replacement or just a new base power unit since this is on backorder? Anyway it appears they are taking care of the issue.
