review/summary: Amazingreview/text: I got the Hoover SteamVac to try and keep my carpets looking newer longer despite a dog with piddle problems and a cat that pukes just about every other day. The steamvac was easy to assemble and even easier to use! I used the detergent that came with it (Hoover Deep Cleanser) for my first try on the living room carpet. What a difference! The carpet looks so bright and clean. My dog's accidents vanished and my cat's icky puke stains are a thing of the past. The whole room just looks so much better with a nice clean carpet! I plan on buying the pet stain formula detergent when the free stuff runs out, but it still did a fantastic job! When I removed the dirty water tank to dump it out, the water was black it was so filthy. I highly recommend this SteamVac to anyone with pets that aren't as housetrained as you'd like them to be.
