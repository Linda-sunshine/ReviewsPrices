review/summary: Not precise or durablereview/text: This gadget has saved me a good deal of time in the kitchen since I cook from scratch and always need some amount of onions, garlic, peppers, mushrooms etc chopped to begin cooking. It is easy to use, clean, and store and it has a safety feature to keep the blade from activating when the lid is not securely in place. However there are several issues with this. I have found that the 3-cup bowl is not big enough for my needs and it isn't very durable. The divet that holds the blade in place cracked and a piece came off but the chopper is still usable. Luckily I saw the piece fall off and was able to throw it away but what if it had just gotten chopped into my food? Further the chopper doesn't distinguish between big pieces and small pieces. It always minces which is not ok for some recipes leaving me to cut the items by hand. Further, it often leaves quite a few big chunks. In other words, this is doable but doesn't offer precision or durability. It feels weird to say I don't like it since I still use it but I gave it two stars because I am certain there is something better out there.
