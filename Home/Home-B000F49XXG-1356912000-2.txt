review/summary: very happyreview/text: I got this espresso maker after reviewing others. But I wanted a low price. Very happy with it so far. I am using an relatively cheap ground espresso coffee labled medaglia dora. It does the job. A couple tips: All you need to do to "pre-heat" is run the filter and filter container device under some hot tap water. Then dry the filter, then add the coffee and tamp VERY LIGHTLY, twisting the tamper a bit on the coffee grounds (I read somewhere you should do that). Anyway, this produces the best crema in the final product. If you tamp too heavily, it will produce less crema. Also, do not over extract the coffee. You only want about an ounce or so in a single shot. Turn it off after the ounce (or maybe 1.25 oz) are reached. I havent tried the double shot filter, so my comments are only for the single shot. Anyway I am very happy with this product so far.
