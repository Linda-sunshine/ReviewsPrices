review/summary: Hate itreview/text: Why? It seems to work sporadically. Also, I didn't expect it to be quite, but it has a nasty vibration as it runs as well. And finally, a filter seems to last about one week max before it starts to smell awful. Water is a variable...but there filter prices are crazy high. If it makes it through the season, it is gone after this... I hate this filter and feel as though I got ripped off.
