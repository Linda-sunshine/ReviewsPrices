review/summary: Had some trouble blending large ice cubes, but not sure if it's intended for thatreview/text: Got this as a sort of convenient blender that is easier to set-up and use than a standard countertop blender.I used it the other morning to lazily mix pancake mix, and it whipped it up in like 5 seconds. (There were some powder volcanoes along the base of the mixing bowl, so a quick swish of a bowl scraper solved that)Last night I was curious if I could use it to make a faux-frappucino with coffee, soy milk and ice cubes (from an ice cube tray). The blender had trouble with the ice only because the cubes don't fit between the walls of the blending blade and the blade. I was determined, and used the blending head to "smash" the ice cubes against the bottom of the cup, and ultimately it worked! Not sure if this is supposed to blend ice and liquid, but it sort of worked! :)I haven't tried it for soups yet, but I'm excited to make a squash-like soup soon for the fall season...
