review/summary: Works great for keeping lettuce and veggies fresh longer!review/text: I bought this on a recommendation I saw in a blog, to preserve lettuce and other green veggies longer, and so far it has worked great. All I do is pack a quart size jar full of my leafy greens and let the FoodSaver jar sealer do the rest. This gives me a lunch-sized portion for every day of the week with no browning, wilting or moisture.Well worth the money for the attachment and extra jars. I am sure I have already gotten my investment back from the decrease in produce wasted.
