review/summary: Great kettle except for the horrible smell.review/text: There are plenty of reviews for this kettle so I'm just giving my two cents and will state that yes, it heats water really fast, looks really good, pours very well and SMELLS really bad. I've had it for 2 weeks now and I've ordered a different model. This one is going back, unfortunately, because other than the plastic smell I really liked it.
