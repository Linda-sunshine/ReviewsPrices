review/summary: why did I wait so long to buy these?review/text: LOVE these flannel sheets. They have made winter so much nicer! It is amazing how cozy they are -- no more cold sheet feeling when you move at night. They don't make me super hot, which is something I was worried about -- I didn't necessarily need a ton more warmth, just didn't want to be jolted by cold sheets. These are beautiful. Love the dark grey color, and so far they've been washed about 5 times and look fine. Love them. Want to buy a spare set in case mine dies for some reason! If you live anywhere even remotely chilly during the winter, get them!
