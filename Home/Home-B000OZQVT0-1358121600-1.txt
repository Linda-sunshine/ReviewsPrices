review/summary: Good Heat from a litle can!review/text: This is a great product! It does what it's advertised to do and works well in our gel can fire place. I gave it only 4 stars, however, because I really think the price is pretty high and I wish there was a way to make the gel smell better. When first lit, it smells like what it is, basically a can of sterno. After it gets going the smell dissapates, but it would be nice if they could make it smell a little like cinnamon, or pine, etc. It crackles like a real fire, though, and that's nice. It heats our whole living room with 2 cans. 3 cans put off a lot of heat, sometimes too much, but we try to stick to 2, because of the expense.
