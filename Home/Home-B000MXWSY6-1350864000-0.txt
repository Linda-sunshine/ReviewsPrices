review/summary: Problemreview/text: This is a fine product except : Several times a night it emitts an odd noise, a bit like a " barking dog " . It does four of these " barks " then is quiet for 1 to 3 hrs then does it again and the volume seems to increase a bit, never very loud but just enough to awaken you. This happens 2 to 4 time a night, every night. I returned it for exchange and the new unit does the same thing. I installed two RFI chokes on the power cord but it didn't help and a web search didn't turn up anything. We seem to be the only two people in the world expienceing the problem. It's a bummer as we like the unit.
