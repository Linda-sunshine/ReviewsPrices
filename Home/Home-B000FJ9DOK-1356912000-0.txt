review/summary: Very good, but not excellentreview/text: Pros:Well constructed steel bottle.Has a latch so if you drop the bottle, the lid does not open and spill the contentsActually keeps the contents cold for up to 12 hours.Easy to function with one hand and easy to drink from.Cons:After about 2 months, the rubber grip will be able to move up and down the bottle, it is not glued on very well.Overall, I would recommend that product.
