review/summary: cold coffeereview/text: I've had this coffee maker for less than two months. Yesterday I noticed that the coffee didn't seem very hot and today the light that goes on when you turn on the warmer didn't go on and the plate didn't warm up at all. The carafe is also a pain the neck that you have to hold just so if you don't want water all over the place. To take advantage of the warranty I'd have to waste many hours getting to an "authorized repair center" where I'm sure I'd be told to come back some other day, at great inconvenience, to pick it up. I've had Bunns in the past that I really loved but this is it for me.
