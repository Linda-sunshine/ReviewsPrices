review/summary: Hot Air POP CORN POPPERreview/text: I love this Hot Air Popcorn Popper. It is so simple and easy to use. It takes a few seconds to start popping and when it does it pops almost every kernel. So have your bowl under it and waiting. Pull out the cord when the last few kernels are popping and step back because some corn will pop wildly out the pot, and it will be hot. If you get one you won't regret it.
