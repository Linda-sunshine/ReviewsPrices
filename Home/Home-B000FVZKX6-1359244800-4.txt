review/summary: Very comfy!review/text: These sheets are very soft and comfortable. The only reason they recieved four stars instead of five is the color. I ordered the ivory sheets and these are ivory but there appear to be patches on the sheets that are more yellow than others. The top and bottom sheet are slightly off from each other as well. The difference is small enough that I don't always notice it, only in certain lighting. The sheets are soft and warm enough that I would get them again.
