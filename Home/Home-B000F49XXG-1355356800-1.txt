review/summary: Quick little espresso/cappuccino machinereview/text: We had a combination espresso and coffee maker machine before deciding to buy this De'Longhi machine. Love that it heats up water very quickly and makes real good thick crema. Also, you can make multiple espressos without having to refill the water tank after each espresso. The milk steamer is easy to clean with a screw off attachment.My only complaint is that it can't fit regular size mugs or cups and doesn't come with any type of espresso cup or pitcher. You need to buy a separate pitcher and/or steaming cup.
