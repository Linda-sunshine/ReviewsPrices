review/summary: nice soft heavy sheetsreview/text: these sheets are fantastic! they are really soft and feel a bit heavy, but in a comfortable way.Drawbacks:- they smelled bad when opening the package, had to wash them before first use.- I have a 14&#34; mattress and the bottom sheet isn't long enough to fit to the bottom of the mattress on all sides.
