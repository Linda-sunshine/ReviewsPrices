review/summary: Lodge Logic 7 qt Dutch Ovenreview/text: I bought this Lodge 7 quart dutch oven for indoor use in the kitchen because the 5 quart we already have is some times not large enough. All my cooking is done with cast iron and this oven is exactly what I was hoping it would be. I love the sturdy feel, the handles are nice, and the size is not big to handle in the kitchen. So far we have been using it for soups, stews, pot roasts, and even used it to cook a large chicken and it worked great. Also the factory pre-seasoning was great out of box too. Always remember to wash and dry thoroughly after each use and wipe down with light coat of cooking oil after each use. This dutch oven should last forever if properly taken care of.
