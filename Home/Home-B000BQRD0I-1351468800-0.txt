review/summary: Works as Expectedreview/text: I bought this product because I was tired of getting the ironing board out and ironing every single day of my life. the steamer works great - especially if you use the brush attachment and approach the clothes by placing the steam head on the inside of the garment, with the steam facing you and working in strokes from top to bottom. There are some more serious wrinkles that still need ironing but for the most part, this is the only product I use when getting ready for the day. I would absolutely recommend it.
