review/summary: Really great waffle maker!review/text: I love this waffle maker, it does the job wonderfully! It gets really hot very quickly and the waffles are always cooked at a beautiful golden brown! Tips: Use pam or any other similar product to spray/coat before pouring batter mix to be cooked.
