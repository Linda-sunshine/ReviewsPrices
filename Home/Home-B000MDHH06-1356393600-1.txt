review/summary: Excellent Powerreview/text: Just got the BJE200XL today. This thing demolishes whatever you put into it. Not too loud, about the same as a handheld dust vac. The electrical plug has a hollowed center, making it easy to pull out of the wall.There's only 5-6 parts, and the parts don't take too long to clean. Overall, love it so far.
