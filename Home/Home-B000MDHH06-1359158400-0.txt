review/summary: Excellentreview/text: I love this juicer! It is great for a single person or for 2 people. It does a great job of extracting the juice, and I'm amazed at the things I can put in there, like whole apples. If I want to do cilantro or something small and leafy, I bunch it up and wrap it with a big leaf of lettuce to keep it together for easier juicing. Also, I love it because it's quite easy to clean!
