review/summary: water leakage on arrivalreview/text: After looking at the review, I am really impressed. 4-star rating over 1000 reviewed customers. I told myself it would never go wrong. BUT I am so wrong. The kettle arrives in good condition. It works fine too. But the water will not stop leaking from the bottom. If I had to describe in detail, I think the water is out near the switch. To me, water leakage with an ELECTRIC kettle. Not acceptable. Without saying, I am returning the product.Update: I placed another order on 9/4/2012. But there is water leakage near to the switch again. Am I unfortunate to receive 2 dead on arrival product?
