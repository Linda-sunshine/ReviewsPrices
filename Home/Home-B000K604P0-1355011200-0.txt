review/summary: This thing holds heat like crazy!review/text: I bought this thermos about 3 years ago and it still works so well. Last month, I left hot tea in it and I fell asleep. The next morning, I opened it to see if it had cooled down...NOPE. Still very, very warm. Not piping hot, but warm. Highly recommended.
