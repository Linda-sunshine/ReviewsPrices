review/summary: Lousy for Non-Pressurized Basketsreview/text: If you are using a Non-Pressurized Espresso basket, don't bother with this tamper. However, if you plan on using it for the pressuzied kind, go for it, and that is where it earns its two stars.Another troubling concern that I have with this product is that in no way is it 60mm and not even 58mm. I could not get this to even come close to fitting the commercial 58mm basket I use. I would say that it's probably closer to 55-56mm on the larger end.again, I could be wrong, but based on tampers i've used in the past, this one seems severely undersized.
