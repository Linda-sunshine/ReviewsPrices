review/summary: Amazing!review/text: This dehumidifier changed our lives! Our stuffy old apartment had a huge mold problem in the bathroom where there was no ventilation. We had mold growing faster than we could clean it off. Then we put this little thing on the bathroom counter and our mold problem basically disappeared overnight. This is not a placebo effect - you can see the water filling up in it really quickly (we had to empty the water tank every day because it would fill up that quickly).Then we moved to a nicer apartment with much better ventilation and the dehumidifier doesn't fill up very quickly anymore at all because there just isn't that much moisture in the air. But I'm still glad we have it and we do still keep it plugged in. It is very quiet, which is a bonus too. We bought the mid-size one for our bedroom and that one is great too. It all depends on how big the room is and how much moisture you have.Great product. Would buy again.
