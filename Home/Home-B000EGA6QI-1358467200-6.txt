review/summary: Really do love it.review/text: I am so pleased with Amazon's service, it has made things quite easy for me around the holidays. Talk about an appliance that I wish I would have got years ago. My favorite use is for making &#34;blizzard&#34; ice cream treats at home. I have not even begun to get the full use of it with making sauces, soups and gravies. The only draw back is maybe a reminder of the 50 second rule in bold lettering on the handle because for the first time using you have just read the instruction booklet, the next few times you may forget that rule and when you do that handle heats up and almost smells like it is burning up. So be careful with that!
