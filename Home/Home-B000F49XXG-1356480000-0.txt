review/summary: This little Espresso Machine is all it takesreview/text: I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and we have already set it up and have been using it happily. It's easy to use, hardly takes up space on the counter, doesn't use those wasteful coffee k-cup or pods and purrs like a kitten when its working. For the price it is pretty awesome. It has clearance for a coffee mug as well and a espresso cup heater on the top.What I didn't like about it is the built in plastic tamper, I bought one separate but its too big!! So will be on the look out for a new one that fits. The built in tamper works well enough, I just think I'll break it before to long. That's about all the 'complaints' I have if you can even call this a complaint.Espresso machines are so expensive, so I'm really impressed with this affordable little gem.
