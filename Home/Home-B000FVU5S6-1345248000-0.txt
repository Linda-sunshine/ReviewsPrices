review/summary: Thick, very soft, wash & dry wellreview/text: I am very pleased with these sheets - the color is lovely (maize) and the stitching is strong on the decorative hem. These are listed as sateen, but they are not shiney and I really like that. The sheets are very soft on the skin and the fabric feels thick and substantial. They have survived a initial washing in hot water with no ill effects or shrinking. I'll buy these again for sure.
