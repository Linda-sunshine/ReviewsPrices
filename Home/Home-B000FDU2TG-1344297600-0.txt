review/summary: LOVE IT- Powerful and Impressive!review/text: Best Blender you can get for under $150- hands down. If you can't afford a vitamix - this is the best option and it's much prettier if that's important to you ;)It's heavy and after the first smooth green shake I was in love.. I've also used it to make milk with raw nuts.. love it.
