review/summary: Worth Every Centreview/text: Received sharpener today and set to work sharpening all my knives. I took a sheet of paper and tried to gently slice it with each knife. Not one knife would slice the paper. Then I sharpened each knife and --WOW ! very, very impressive. Each blade gained such a sharp edge gently slicing through paper with incredible ease. Later, when I was preparing food I actually sliced my index finger accidently. This is something I rarely do and almost never draw blood. I write this wearing a bandaid so be careful. I'm very pleased with this product. It's quite heavy and has suction cups on the base to hold it in place. Definitely a 5 star item.
