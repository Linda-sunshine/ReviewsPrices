review/summary: Love, Love, Lovereview/text: I've had mine for five years now. Never a leak, nor a crack. I've dropped this bottle on concrete several times, and left it on the car roof a few times as well. There are a few dents in it, which don't affect the usage at all. Very worth the money, and I'm thrilled to see it's still being produced.
