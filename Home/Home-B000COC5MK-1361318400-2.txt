review/summary: It works as promised and it's reliablereview/text: But.....it's much larger than I expected it to be (perhaps my own fault for not reading the specs closely enough) and as such, it takes up more counter space and room than I had intended. Also it pulls the cork by ramming the corkscrew all the way through the cork and just keeps going until it climbs all the way up the screw. It also might skew the screw in the cork enough to go in at an angle and come out the side near the bottom of the cork (although it still pulls the cork out even then). I know some people who open a bottle every time and put the corkscrew all the way through like that, but it's not how I wish to do it. On the positive side: It works. I have to say that it is simple and reliable, and it works every time. For the price it is a good unit. Even though it screws all the way through cork, the screw is sharp enough that it is not depositing cork fragments into the wine. If you just need a strong, reliable opener, and the things I mentioned won't bother you, then: it's a bargain. Enjoy!
