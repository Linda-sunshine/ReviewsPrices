review/summary: Amazing Healthy Popcorn!review/text: I have been trying to lose weight and get in shape, and get a summer beach body, and I have been working out like a mad man for the past couple weeks and this has helped me out a lot. I love snacks and I have been looking for healthy snacks, been researching and researching. This makes really low calorie popcorn and it tastes great, what else could you ask for. Instead of having another meal, when you're hungry just have a little bowl of popcorn and it can hold you out, until your next meal.I couldn't recommend this enough, if you are looking to lose weight, I would recommend picking up one of these, might not help you kick the soda but this has you covered on the snack part of things. It also saves a lot of money, instead of buying 1 dollar or 2 dollar boxes of snacks, you can make a huge bowl of popcorn for less then a dollar and it will fill you way more then these other snacks ever will.Popcorn has a lot of fiber in it, and air popped adds more to it and has less calories. Fiber keeps you filled and actually gets your digestive system working faster, so you will use the bathroom more, which in turn will make you thinner and leaner.This product just wow's me, in so many aspects, the only bad thing I can say is it isn't healthy in say cause it doesn't have like vitamins or protein, but it is low in calories and will defiantly not make you gain weight. You could try adding a sauce or something to the popcorn to make it healthier, but I have yet to find anything that adds protein to it, which I need, since I am trying to bulk up.5/5 does what it is meant to do and saves money.
