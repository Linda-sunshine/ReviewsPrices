review/summary: Wished they all workedreview/text: Usually at leasrt one out of each package doesn't work for more than 2-3 uses. When it takes 24 to 30 hours for the water to filter through, I do get impatient. Usually I just take the one that doesn't work, throw it in the trash and proceed with another one.
