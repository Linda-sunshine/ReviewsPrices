review/summary: Tinted water in the morning just doesn't work.review/text: This percolator made really good coffee for less than a year, then it began to perk less and less time and the coffee became weaker and weaker. Don't bother contacting the company if something goes wrong with it. I wrote from their website and got a confirmation of what I wrote and was told that they would respond within 2 days. Two weeks later and still no response. I used to think Farberware sold quality goods. No more and customer support is a misnomer. I won't buy from them again.
