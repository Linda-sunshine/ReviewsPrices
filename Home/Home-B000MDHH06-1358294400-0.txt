review/summary: LOVE IT!!!!!!review/text: I HAD BEEN USING A JUICER THAT WAS OVER 20 YEARS OLD. IT WAS STILL WORKING BUT COULDN'T JUICE LEAFY VEGGIES AND IT HAD A CHUTE THAT SPIT OUT THE PULP. I HAD A SYSTEM DOWN TO MINIMIZE THE MESS BUT KNEW I WAS READY FOR AN UPGRADE. GOT THIS FOR CHRISTMAS AND HAVE USED IT ON A DAILY BASIS. I LOVE THAT EVERYTHING IS CONTAINED AND I EVEN SCOOP OUT THE PULP AND REJUICE IT VERY SLOWLY TO MAKE SURE I GET EVERY NUTRITIOUS DIP OF DELICIOUSNESS!!! I'M METICULOUS ABOUT THE CLEANING PROCESS AS TO NOT GET ANY BACTERIA AND THAT IS PROBABLY WHY MY OLD JUICER LASTED AS LONG AS IT DID. I JUICE THINGS SLOW AND GENTLY AND DON'T JAM TOO MUCH IN THE CHUTE. FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE IN THAT MUCH OF A HURRY, MAYBE YOU SHOULD FIND A LOCAL JUICE BAR. THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT AND DOES THE TRICK. REMEMBER, WHEN YOU TREAT THINGS KINDLY IT ALWAYS COMES BACK IN TEN FOLD!
