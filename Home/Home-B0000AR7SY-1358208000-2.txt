review/summary: Same Coffee Tastes Much Better!review/text: Being a scientific type (Engineer with minor in Biology), I almost hesitate to say this, but the same coffee tastes better with this grinder. I have been grinding my own beans since 1986 and this is my third grinder. The grinder is relatively quiet and appears to be well made. However, the most significant difference between this grinder and my past grinders is the consistency of the grind and I believe this must be the reason the coffee tastes better. My wife, who has been drinking my coffee for 25 years has said a number of times in the last couple weeks that the coffee is better and I had been thinking the same thing. I can now taste subtle flavors that I had missed before. The only thing I don't like about the grinder is the mess it makes on the counter, but this may be a function of the static electricity in the air in our house. When I pull the catch container from the grinder, I can actually see coffee particles spring up and out of the grinder/catch container onto my hand and the counter. It is almost comical to watch. Because of the minor mess created (that takes a whole 30 seconds to wipe up), I considered giving a rating of 4 stars, but then I remembered that nothing is more important than the taste of my coffee in the morning. If this gives me the best cup of coffee I have ever tasted, who cares about a little mess. By the way, I use a Bodum Chambord 3 Cup French Press to make my coffee and I have found nothing better.
