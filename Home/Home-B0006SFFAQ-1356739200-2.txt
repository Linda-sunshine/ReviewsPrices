review/summary: A rare product that stands the test of time.review/text: I'll admit I bought this for its looks . . . a decade ago. This thing is so durable and so flawless, I can no longer remember owning any other coffee maker. I loved it so much, and I was so sure that, like most appliances, it would be here today and gone tomorrow, I bought a second one just to tuck away. Eight years later, it is still in the box, buried in the back of a closet.We have great water, and simply threw away the water filter after the first year or two. The thing makes a perfect cup of coffee every time. Perfect. And holds the carafe temp perfectly, too. The adjustable temperature setting is my favorite feature. Now we are getting ready to remodel, and I am considering a new color. Wow, what a rainbow these come in. I'm not even sure why I'm writing this review, given that 3,000 other folks have already sung its praises. I guess I feel I owe this contraption after all its years of loyal service.
