review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised!review/text: I bought the stick blender 1 1/2 weeks ago, and was a little doubtful about my purchase. This is my first stick blender. I read the reviews and decided to try it. I am on the Weight Watchers Program and used my old standard blender just about each day, until it went kaput! I have used the stick blender to make smoothies and shakes with frozen fruit and ice. Put the ice or frozen fruit in last for easier processing. I am amazed how creamy they turn out. Cleanup in so easy and it stores easily next to my glasses. I'm looking forward to making soups, potatoes, and many other delicious dishes! I'd recommend this blender to anyone.
