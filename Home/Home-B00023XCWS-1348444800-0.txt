review/summary: Top leaksreview/text: Not as good as the Bodum electric kettle I used to have. The design is attractive and it does heat water up quickly, but water often leaks from the edges of the lid as you pour it out which is both messy and dangerous. I am going to keep it - it doesn't seem worth the hassle of returning it - but I use this only at work and would NOT have it anywhere near children or older people due to the risk of burns.
