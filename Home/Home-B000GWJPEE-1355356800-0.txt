review/summary: Wouldn't go with the Frog - choose another animalreview/text: After being satisfied with the elephant version of these, we decided to purchase another humidifier for a different bedroom. We decided on the frog. The problem is, you really have to pay attention to the location of the hole for discharge of the moist air. The problem with the frog,and many others, is that it discharges the mist vertically. Thus, a substantial amount of moisture settles where the frog is sitting. If it is wood furniture, the moisture will likely damage the wood and the finish. While they tell you not to place it on wood or a towel (what to place it on then?), I still think this problem is largely mitigated by the animals that discharge the mist up and at an angle. The elephant discharges through the snout. The penguin we just bought is another good choice; it discharges through the beak on its adjustable head (another nice feature).Other than that, these are great devices and are reasonably priced. The capacity is good; the amount of moisture it produces is ample; and they are reliable.Beware that because, like many consumer products these days, it is made of plastic that can easily crack. I don't fault the product design for this because it isn't like there are alternatives that are not made of plastic. But it requires care that you don't drop the container in the sink while you are filling it, or you break the top. The elephant we have has a crack forming in the tank because we dropped it while moving; our mistake. The price is such that you just buy another.
