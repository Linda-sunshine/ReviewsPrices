review/summary: Best value for an uprightreview/text: I purchased this vacuum over two years ago and it is still running strong. I had to replace my expensive Hoover vacuum when it died. This one was less then a third of the price of my "top of the line" Hoover. The only differences I can see are: no headlight (that's fine, I don't use it in the dark), and the electrical cord is about 2 feet shorter. That's OK too because my house has many outlets. If you MUST have a longer cord, spend 3 or 4 bucks and get an extension cord. The suction is just as strong as the "high priced" model. I don't know the specs on this model but I wouldn't be surprised if it had the same motor as my old Hoover. For the price you can't beat it.
