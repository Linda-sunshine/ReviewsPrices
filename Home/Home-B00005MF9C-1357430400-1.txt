review/summary: Love itreview/text: This is the best answer for a quick cup of coffee. The filter insert rinses clean quickly. The coffee brews in a couple of minutes and shuts itself off. Make a perfect mug full everytime, just the way I want it, with my favorite coffee. So inexpensive, so fast, so perfect. Why would you want a overpriced one cup maker that you have to buy very expensive single use coffee packs when you can do it here for next to nothing. I will never be without my Brew 'n Go, in fact I'm going to buy a second one just in case something happens to this one.
