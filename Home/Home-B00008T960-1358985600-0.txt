review/summary: it's a silpatreview/text: it works. it's easy to clean. Just don't broil chicken or pork chops or any other meats... it will discolor the silpat and then your wife will yell at you about it. Then, you'll have to buy another one to replace it.So, those who don't know....this is for BAKING, no broiling. You can't cook fish sticks or fries or a chicken breast on it, and expect it to stay clean.I know...even dirty looking this works nicely without wasting a piece of foil. However, the baker in the family will want a nice clean silpat for her christmas cookies.
