review/summary: excellent kitchen toolreview/text: This machine is amazing . It makes wonderful raw vegetable pasta from zucchini , beets , carrots ...slices fabulous curly fries ,cucumbers , cabbage and even eggplant .Easy to use, easy to clean and safe for your fingers ( comparing to mandolin slicers ) - just perfect .I have a lots of experience with different slicers and tool but I was never impressed like this before . I looked the other people reviews and I think that people who had bad experience with it was simple because they did not know how to use it .
