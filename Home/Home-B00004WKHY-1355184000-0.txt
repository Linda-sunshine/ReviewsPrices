review/summary: My first processorreview/text: This is my first food processor so I tried to do as much research as possible before making the purchase. I kept in mind that when using liquids it can only be filled up half way (once I filled it up a bit past half way and it started leaking down the sides; my own miscalculation). It's really easy to take apart and hand wash or put in the dishwasher. And since everything can be taken apart, I have no trouble storing it. I really love this machine and am glad this is the one I decided on!
