review/summary: Good but could be betterreview/text: My small Bissell carpet cleaner finally gave up the ghost after performing brilliantly for 12+ years. We chose to replace it with a Hoover SteamVac F5914-900. Item arrived in good order and wasn't too complicated to assemble. I'd planned on cleaning all the carpeting but quickly noticed that the water suction was a bit disappointing and therefore could only finish half, continuing the next day after the first half had dried . The carpet was being left, even after several passes, considerably damper than I was used to with my old Bissell. Today I cleaned a couch and chairs, same problem. What a shame because I otherwise like the cleaning power. Fortunately we live in a dry and mostly warm/hot part of the country so this drawback isn't major but for someone in a more humid area it could be.
