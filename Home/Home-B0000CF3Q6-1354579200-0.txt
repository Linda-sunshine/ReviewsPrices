review/summary: Great to satisfy espresso cravingsreview/text: This is a great little coffee maker. It is very easy to use, and consistently makes a great cup. It makes a brew somewhere between French pressed coffee and espresso. It's not a true espresso, but it satisfies my cravings when I don't have time to visit the local espresso bar.Some considerations:1. Consider a larger size. This makes 3 'demitasse' cups, which is about 3 shot glasses by my measure. If you like a large cup I'd recommend going for a 6 cup or larger moka pot.2. Consider grinding your own beans. I have found pre-ground coffee will tend to be too fine, and can lead to a slightly sludgy coffee.3. Personally, I prefer to use very dark roast, french roast, or espresso roast with my moka pot. I find it approximates an espresso better with darker roasts. Lighter roasts do not tend to come out as well in the moka pot from my experience.4. When you first get your moka pot, brew a pot of coffee, let it rest, and rinse it out. Repeat a couple times. This will 'season' it (like a cast iron pot) and prevent any metallic taste from the alluminum.
