review/summary: Great Price on OK Knivesreview/text: I purchased this knife set because of another Ginsu set I owned in the past. This set was not the same quality as the original set I purchased at Sears. That being said, the set from Sears was $100 and this one was only $33. The knifes work well enough, but the steel seems pretty thin. The chef's knife flexes quite a bit when using it, but still gets the job done. To sum it up, the knives get the job done and you don't have to spend a fortune. Just don't expect anything top of the line.
