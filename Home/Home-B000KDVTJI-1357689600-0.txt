review/summary: Very nice Stainless Kettle that is cordless, fast, prettyreview/text: Just bought a second for the office.Had my first Aroma Hot H2O XPress kettle for about a year. I use it to boil water for almost everything since it is so much faster than other methods for getting hot water. The fact that it is cordless and stainless are just nice additions to a great kettle.I was concerned about BPC's and started researching Stainless kettles.My wife says this looks great on our counter.As an added note, I got both of mine at a good discount by buying both from the Amazon Warehouse (listed with the used or refurbished models). Amazon Warehouse was very good about listing any dings or imperfections on the pot. However, it was VERY HARD to find any of the imperfections once I received the items (better than described). Oh, I saw the listed abnormalities, but they were VERY MINOR and I doubt I would have noticed them even had I bought it as brand new. But, you may be more picky than I. My wife didn't notice them at all...and she is more picky than I. Of course, I didn't tell her that there were imperfections. In short, I think most people would be happy with the condition of the items from Amazon Warehouse. But, your mileage may vary. :)
