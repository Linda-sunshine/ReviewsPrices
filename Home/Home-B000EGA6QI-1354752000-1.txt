review/summary: Get rid of your mixer and save some spacereview/text: I don't do much baking so I don't have a need for a traditional mixer. So this hand blender has been perfect for me. It is so much easier to use this product than a food processor or a blender for making pureed soups--no transferring of ingredients--just place the smart stick in the pot and blend. This also is great for making hummus.
