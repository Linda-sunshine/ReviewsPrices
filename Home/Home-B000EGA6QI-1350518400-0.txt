review/summary: Not as good as I expectreview/text: I bought this blender for the purpose of grinding food for baby. It does not work well. It worked badly for green vegetables. Even with chicken, I have to position the food around so that the blade of the blinder can touch the food. I want to return the product, but have not found a better alternative except chopping the food with my own hand.
