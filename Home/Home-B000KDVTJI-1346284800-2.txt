review/summary: The second kettle works just finereview/text: The first kettle delivered sprung a leak that caused a small puddle to form on the counter top. Amazon was contacted and there replacement precedure went into action very quickly and smoothly. A second kettle was dispatched almost immediatly and a FedEx return lable for the defective item provided. This whole procedure was remarkably simple. An occasional defective item will occur and is annoying but the procedure to replace the defective item worked very well and reduced the annoyance to a minimum.The replacement kettle has worked as designed without any sign of leakage for close to month now, and assuming it contiues to do so, we would be happy to recommend this kettle.
