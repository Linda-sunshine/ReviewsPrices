review/summary: So useful!review/text: It is so must faster to boil water in one of these automatic electric kettles, I can't believe I used the stove for so many years! For the home my Sweetie & I got the larger modelProctor Silex K4070 1.7-Liter Automatic Electric Kettlefor our kitchen (in black, to match the decor), when it came time to get one for the office I went with the Proctor Silex brand again for a good price and quality.My lone complaint about this 1-Liter model is that the power cord is I think less than 2 feet long. This would be fine on my kitchen counter where there are plenty of plugs, but not so in my office. Fortunately, it's a fairly standard plug type so I can probably find another longer cable from something else (or resort to an extension cord, of course).
