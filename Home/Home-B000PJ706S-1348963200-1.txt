review/summary: Smell exists --review/text: I purchased this product this week. It looks very cool. However, I purchased the kettle to avoid using the plastic coffee maker. Now there is a smell at least during the first few uses that the Capresso gives off. I hope this goes away.If United States corporations did not make every damn thing in China- where there really exists little concern for quality and consumer safety-- these sort of things would happen less frequently...
