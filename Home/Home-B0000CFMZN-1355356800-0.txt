review/summary: A kitchen essential and classicreview/text: I grew up baking and cooking with the Pyrex 1-cup measuring cup as a child. As I started to collect kitchen accessories of my own as a college student, I naturally gravitated back to Pyrex. This time, I went for the 2-cup version as I cook a fair amount and in larger batches.It's only after using a competitor's measuring cup did I realize how fantastic the Pyrex measuring cup is. I borrowed my roommate's Anchor measuring cup, a 2 cup version which looks likeAnchor Hocking 55178OL11 Measuring Cup (Pack of 1). There are two issues with the Anchor cup: the lack of a 1/4 cup line and the pour spout of the cup.The bigger issue was the pour spout - if you look closely, the glass is shaped such that there is a small fold at the bottom of the pour spout which traps food. My roommates' cup had food trapped in it upon close inspection and no amount of scrubbing would get it out. The Pyrex has no such issue.The Pyrex cup will last you a lifetime if you take care of it. In fact, I'm looking to get a second one soon - one for dry ingredients and one for wet - to ease up timing in the kitchen.
