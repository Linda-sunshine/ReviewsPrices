review/summary: If you buy it - don't blame mereview/text: I saw all the 4 & 5 stars but this is, in fact, a piece of China crap that can burn your house down.Me? no expert but Consumer Reports is. AFTER (and I mean a day after) I bought this they came out and said it has no over-heating device to shut it off and they were going to the cunsumner protection to have them pull these things. THEY SAY don't buy it and if you have it STOP USING IT AND THROW IT OUT.Google it. So, if a curtain lands on it or a tie or a 'thing' is too close, it won't shut off until the house burns down.Realy, the electric will go before the house. But it will not shut off if it overheats - nice option for a heater. Oh, it will heat all right.So, I turned it on and it takes forever to get you warm - it's a loser of a product. If you buy it, don't blame me.
