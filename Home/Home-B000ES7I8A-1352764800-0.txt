review/summary: STICKER LEAVES UN-REMOVABLE MARK!?!?!review/text: I purchased this kettle as it was predominately stainless steel. IT'S A BRILLIANT kettle! It works well, I have no problem with the way it pours, it boils at a decent speed, the small amount of plastic in the lid does not bother me - it's not that poisonous people!.. it looks great and the quality seems good. I REALLY would like to have given it 5 stars but unfortunately I believe the manufacturer shot themselves in the foot with such a pathetic reason. *THIS ITEM COMES WITH A STICKER AFFIXED TO THE SIDE OF THE KETTLE - THE KETTLE IS A BRUSHED STAINLESS STEEL FINISH. UPON REMOVING THIS STICKER ALL YOU ARE LEFT WITH IS A BIG ROUND MARK WHERE THE STICKER WAS - SAID MARK IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE & THEREFOR LEAVING THE KETTLE LOOKING LIKE CRAP. THIS IS SUCH A PATHETIC FLAW I HAD TO RETURN THE ITEM. WHAT A WASTE!
