review/summary: Serves its purpose well!review/text: I always swore by pots of coffee, but since I'm now the only coffee drinker in the house, it didn't make sense to have a pot going all the time. My best friend had this particular model of Keurig, so I was at least somewhat familiar with it before purchasing my own.All told, the convenience aspect of it is wonderful without feeling I'm sacrificing quality to my hot beverages. The machine only takes a couple of minutes to warm up and my beverages take about a minute to come out. I've had good luck with K-cups of varying types (particularly coffee and hot chocolate), and I've also had good luck with refillable, eco-friendly cups. The water reservoir is big enough for my purpose without making me feel like I'm constantly filling it.The recommendation for filtered water is not to be taken lightly. I tried it with some tap water at first and the beverages didn't taste quite right. I switched to filtered water and have had no problems with my beverages ever since.Overall, this machine is a perfect fit for me. Of course, I highly recommend shopping the various Keurig options out there to find the one that is right for you, but I have been pleased with the quality of this one!
