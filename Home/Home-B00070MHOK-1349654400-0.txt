review/summary: glad I purchasedreview/text: I purchased this steamer to take with me to attend an out-of-state wedding in case my satin dress wrinkled. The bridal place told me I made a good choice and they recommend putting a cheesecloth over the spout and not filing to the top. I also packed an oven mitt as I heard this is a good idea to prevent yourself from getting burned. I am keeping this steamer because of all the great reviews. I know it will come in handy soon enough!
