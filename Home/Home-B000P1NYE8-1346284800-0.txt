review/summary: A Shirt-Pocket-Sized Scale That Deliversreview/text: Was surprised at the actual size when it arrived (quite compact), but it seems to perform as promised. Since it's so small, weighing kitchen items in any large-sized bowl can be a bit of a challenge (the LED display is blocked), but to remedy this just balance the bowl on a smaller jar or container of some kind (remember to subtract the additional tare), and then the display should be visible again. This is what I do.
