review/summary: Worked okay for four months, then didn'treview/text: This is an okay trash can, but I've come to the conclusion that stepping on a pedal to open the trash can is much better. It's quicker and it doesn't break like this one. With the touchless ones you have to hover your hand in front of the trash can waiting for it to open. Then, when it breaks, and according to many reviews here it will break eventually, you hover your hand, nothing happens, then you pull up the lid yourself. Ours lasted about four months.I can't tell if the odor control part works or not, since I don't smell anything, maybe it's working, maybe the lid on the trash can is already containing any odors, anyway, I don't notice any odors.I would never buy another one of these things. I'm going to buy one with a pedal I can step on. Still touchless, much faster and won't break.
