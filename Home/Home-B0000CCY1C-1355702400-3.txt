review/summary: works - but doesn't!review/text: I just gave one of these to my wife as an early christmas present and on the first scoop the gear at the bottom nudged up a bit and the lever got dislodged. It appears that the rod the gear is on can move about 1/8" up and the lever cannot... so depending on the angle of which you squeeze, the whole thing stops working. I'm sure there's a way to bend something back in to place - but I've never seen it working, so I'm not sure what's really wrong with the design... seems flawed.
