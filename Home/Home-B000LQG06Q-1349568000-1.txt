review/summary: Memory Foam Reviewreview/text: My bed was becoming a little too firm for my liking and I decided to try out a memory foam topper, but the thicker ones in store were so expensive! After reading the reviews on this topper, I decided to try it and I am satisfied. It created more cushion for my back and I don't wake up with a sore back. When I received the topper, it did smell like mint chocolate chips or something like that, but it only lasted about 48 hours. Don't let the "smell factor" weigh in your decision, because after those 48 hours, the smell was completely gone. I would recommend this product to someone who is not ready to buy a new mattress, but would like some more cushion for their back.
