review/summary: Cannot Grind Meatreview/text: Perhaps employees of Norpro wrote the raving reviews of this product, because I did put it together correctly and still it could not grind even already ground meat. I first tried regrinding meatloaf mix bought from the supermarket with the small grinder fitting and that did not work, so I switched to the larger one. Then the next day I tried grinding a chuck roast for ground meat I wanted to make and put the meat in the freezer for an hour like someone suggested, trimmed almost all the fat and cartilage that was humanly possible and this thing jammed at the slightest bit of cartilage to where I had to take it apart several times and clean away the jam to get a 1/2 pound of ground beef. Needless to say I am returning this product, I am going to try the attachment for a Kitchen Aid which I should have tried in the first place but did not want to spend the money if I wasn't into grinding my own meat.Save yourself the aggravation and purchase a better quality product - I should have known better by the price.
