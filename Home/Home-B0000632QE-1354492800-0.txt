review/summary: 5 years old and still going strongreview/text: Got this for my wife because she wanted one for her kitchen.Pro: 5 years old, used a few times a month and still sharp. Does a great job with thin/thick cuts, etc. Fast and easy to use.Con: Sharp; like loose a finger sharp. I would recommend either a glove or just using the attached holder.Overall: German engineering at its finest.
