review/summary: Great machine for the pricereview/text: Although our garlic took WAY longer than the instruction book said (it said 4-12 hours, it took over 60), for the price this is a fantastic machine.We also have dried oregano and a few other herbs in it. We got the unit after fruit season here so we haven't been able to try it out for that yet but are really looking forward to it
