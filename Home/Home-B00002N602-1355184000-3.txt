review/summary: one tough cookerreview/text: this is a good product for everyday use. securing the lid is little cumbersome but you get used to it in time. We used to have a rubberless locking system but it slowly failed to keep pressure in. Cooking speed is close to the expected ones. At this price level, it is quite satisfactory.
