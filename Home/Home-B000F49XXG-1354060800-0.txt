review/summary: EC155 plastic aroma coffeereview/text: Just recently purchased this item as I found several videos of users pulling some nice shots by making a few mods here and there. Thinking that this was a good starter device to experiment with I managed to nab one at a decent price. Unpacked and made the modifications (converted to non-pressurized). Then fired the thing up.To check out the steam, I turned the nob and ended up being blasted with this plastic aroma from the steam. Then I swapped the main dial over to push out some water and again was hit with this aroma which was pretty disgusting. I cannot even imagine trying to drink something from this device.So after reading some forums and various posts online. I attempted to try and flush and clean as much as humanly possible to try and get this stench out from the unit. Just a few minutes ago, feeling adventurous, I decided to attempt to grind up some beans and give it another go. Hoping that the unit will 'air out' or 'off gas' or pretty much anything which could possibly get rid of the funk.Fired it up, pushed some water through and took a whiff without even pulling a shot just to check. Again, I was met with the nasty smell. Thinking it was just my nose, I asked my wife to take a whiff and I received a verbal threat that should I make her a cup using this device she'll leave me. *grin*Needless to say, it is somewhat of a disappointment as I have hacked and modified this device so it cannot be returned. I'm wondering if it is just a bad batch manufactured or what exactly is causing this stench but essentially I have a $100 paperweight which will remind me to spend the extra cash on something worth while. If any other fellow EC155 users are out there with any suggestions... I'm totally game! Shoot up some comments and offer some suggestions other than making this thing my new doorstop.
