review/summary: Love this dehydratorreview/text: Use it all the time. Love the temp settings. You do have to unplug it to turn it off. I bought two spare trays and 2 fruit leather trays. Easy clean up with this product. I make snacks for the kids and everyone at work. Not to mention if I cant eat fresh fruit or veggies fast I just chunk them in here until I can use them. Great product and saves me from wasting food.
