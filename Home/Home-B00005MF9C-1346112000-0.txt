review/summary: A very handy coffee brewer...review/text: I'm amazed at how fast this little brewer makes a cup of Joe. Within minutes, you have a delicious hot cup of coffee to savor. If only the end result was just a bit hotter. The speed of operation makes up for it, however; hence, the four stars.
