review/summary: I am the waffle King! I can do anything.review/text: This was my &#34;Christmas Present&#34; from the kids. Guess who is eating all of the waffles? It does an excellent job though. There are five settings and after experimenting you will find the one that suits you. Waffles come out soft and fluffy with just the right amount crunchy outside. I made Blueberry waffles for the first time today and they were excellent. I would definitely recommend this waffle maker.
