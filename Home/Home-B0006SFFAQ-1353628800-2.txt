review/summary: It was fine until it caught fire this morningreview/text: We've had it for a few years. I was sitting on the couch this morning when it started making a strange noise. When I got up to check on it, smoke was pouring from beneath the warming plate. I'm glad I never left this thing plugged up when not in use. I found other stories in the reviews here, plus more in a quick search, about this model catching fire. Beware.
