review/summary: good choicereview/text: This slicer does a very good job on everything that we have tried it on so far. While it does not have its own container. The design does fit onto containers that most kitchens have on hand. The blades are very sharp and using the mandoline should not be an option for any user. Unlike the mandolines on many slicers, the one that comes with this unit is excellent and does not allow for any wasted material.The negative to this slicer is that it is not recommended for cleaning in a dishwasher. A minor inconvenience that says more about my own laziness than a flaw in this slicer.
