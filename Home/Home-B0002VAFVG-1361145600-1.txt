review/summary: This juicer is wonderful!review/text: I love this juicer. The pulp bin and juice cup are large enough to make a big glass (32oz +/-) of juice. Its super easy to clean, and really extracts a ton of juice from the fruit or vegetable you put into it. I'm on a 30 day juice feast and because of this wonderful machine i have been able to stick to my plan, and at 11 days i've already lost 7.5 lbs!
