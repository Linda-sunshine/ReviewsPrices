review/summary: Perfect Juicerreview/text: This is a great juicer, it handles everything. I have had it about 3 weeks and use it every morning. No problems. Do remember to keep the cleaning brush, it fits perfectly into the mechanism and makes cleaning easy. I don't know if it says dishwasher safe, but I put mine in once every 3 or 4 days to a full scrub - no problems so far.
