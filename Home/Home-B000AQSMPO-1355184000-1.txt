review/summary: Expensive, wears out before time, parts hard to replace, no more magnificent than a traditional coffee maker.review/text: At first this machine worked well, it made an okay amount of coffee at an acceptable potency about twice as fast as a normal coffee machine, but with a longer (it seemed) warm up time. It only had a few size options (3) which was disappointing. The K-cups are pointlessly expensive, and really not worth the convenience. If you loose the k-cup holder for the machine, it is VERY hard to find a replacement. Last to mention is the quality and lifespan. At nine months this coffee maker started to fail, we only used it 1 time a day, five days a week, and we only occasionally made two cups of coffee at a time. We had to retire this machine at 1 year because it wasn't making coffee anymore, just hot, coffee flavored water.In conclusion, it lasted about as long as a $15 coffee maker, and was only convenient when you bought the overpriced K-cups. You also lose the portion control of a traditional coffee maker. Just a bad overall investment.
