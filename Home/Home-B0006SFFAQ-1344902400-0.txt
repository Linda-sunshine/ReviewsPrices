review/summary: Not satisfiedreview/text: This coffee maker had a few problems for us, maybe others would not see them as problems. First, we found it too tall especially with the lid open, we had to move it too far beyond the kitchen cabinets above it to fill it. Then the area to be filled, is very tiny, it is not large like our old coffee maker and you have to really aim the faucet hose or water carefully to fill it, that was a deal breaker. Finally, the lid on the carafe was impossible to get off, my wife could not snap it off at all and I found it hard to remove, all in all, not a good experience for us.
