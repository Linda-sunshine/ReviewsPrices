review/summary: Solid purchase, keeps drinks cold for long durationsreview/text: This was a great purchase. It keeps your drinks chilled all day. I love the spring action pop-open top that locks the lid in the open and closed positions. 18oz size is perfect for keeping chilled water at your office desk all day - don't bother with those non-insulated plastic water bottles (e.g., camelbak)
