review/summary: Nice blenderreview/text: Bought this to make fruit smoothies, shakes, etc...There have been comments about not pushing down too hard on it or you'll make the base start leaking. So far, mine hasn't been leaking. But, depending on what you're doing, you do need to hold this guy down a bit to keep it from walking off the counter.It's a nice heavy blender, though, so it's pretty easy to keep in place.
