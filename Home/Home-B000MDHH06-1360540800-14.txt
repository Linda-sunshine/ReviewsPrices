review/summary: Love it!review/text: This juicer is super easy to use and easy to clean. It must be cleaned after each use (especially the basket with the included brush!). It rinses easily, then a warm, soapy wash, rinse and air dry is sufficient. It is top shelf dishwasher safe, however the large top piece is too tall for my dishwasher. I can usually juice two recipes before needing to empty the hopper. I've found the pulp to be very dry! I do peel citrus fruits and waxy veggies (like cucumbers, removing the seeds also). I core my apples too but otherwise the whole leaf veggies, carrots, fruits, etc. processes very efficiently. It is a bit loud, but given what it's doing...I'd guess so. :) I LOVE IT!
