review/summary: well worth the money!review/text: This machine really brings an old carpet back to life. I had not cleaned our living room carpet for a very long time and thought it was hopeless. I purchased this machine because it cost less than having the carpet professionally cleaned one time so figured I couldn't lose. I was amazed at how clean the carpet was (much cleaner than the last professional job I had done) and how easy the machine was to use. I have had the machine over 2 years and it is still going strong. I have loaned it out several times and always get the comment of what a great job it does. I use the Hoover professional strength soap to go with it and it does a great job. I recommend you rinse the carpet after cleaning as it leaves it much softer and more natural looking. The carpet is also nearly dry when you are finished so there's not much time to be off of it. A definite thumbs up!
