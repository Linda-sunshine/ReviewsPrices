review/summary: Beyond expectationsreview/text: I've always had a passion for cast iron cookware and was excited to find out Lodge had an economical version of a enamel/cast iron Dutch Oven. It is gorgeous, and mine came with a stainless knob. I've prepared several meals using the Dutch Oven and love it, especially considering the affordable price!
