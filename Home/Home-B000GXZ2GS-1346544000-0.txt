review/summary: What a great product.review/text: I am very surprised at how easy this is to use. The coffee came out perfect on the 2nd try. The first time I put in water up to the 4 line and the coffee came out bitter. The manual says to fill it to 2. I tried it to 2 and boom, perfect coffee. Cleans in seconds and no mess. If you fill it to the 2nd line its like an espresso shot. I tried it and it was good and not bitter. But I usually add water to the shot to make it like a mug of coffee and its good that way too.Even when you mess up a bit like not waiting too long for it to brew or even waiting too long before you press it still comes out good!I was using really good organic espress coffee beans so maybe that has something to do with it.
