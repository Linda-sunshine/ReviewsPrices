review/summary: Really handy gadget - first time immersion blender userreview/text: This is my first immersion blender so I don't have anything to compare it with, but it's done what I've asked of it so far. I've only used it twice, though. I used it to make carrot soup--easy peasy, and I was able to get just the texture I was looking for (not completely smooth)--and to make non-traditional apricot, fig and hazelnut mince pies. For the latter, I chopped the dried fruit and toasted nuts by hand first, and made sure to blend in short bursts. I was a bit concerned that the texture might be a bit much for the blender to handle but the banana and orange juice provided enough moisture/liquid to keep things moving. It worked a treat. It's really easy to clean after use, even when it's been used to make something really sticky (like the mince pie filling). I'm delighted with it so far.
