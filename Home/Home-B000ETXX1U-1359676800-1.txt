review/summary: Defective from first usereview/text: We bought the Wenzel to weather the holiday season while traveling to family. We should have tested it out before our trip! One entire half of the bed simply would not inflate to the fullest, or hold air at all. I suppose we got a defective unit (which we since returned), but I would be hesitant to buy another Wenzel in the future.
