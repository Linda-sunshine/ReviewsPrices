review/summary: Awesome breing thermometerreview/text: I brew beer, and I use this thermometer to test the temperature of my mash before sealing it up for an hour. I used to use an infrared thermometer, but it was pretty inaccurate. This one reads so quickly that you don't lose any significant heat to the open air. I recommend it.
