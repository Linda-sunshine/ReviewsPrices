review/summary: Better tasting waterreview/text: We've used this filter, from other local stores, and like the convenience and less expensive alternatives to installing an under the sink alternative.I labelled it with a 4 star because one of the filters only lasted less than 3 weeks and water would not longer filter. We do use the filtered water for cooking and drinking (2 people and 2 pets) and each one usually averages 2 1/2 months
