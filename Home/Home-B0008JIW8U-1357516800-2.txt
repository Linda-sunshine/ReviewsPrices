review/summary: Mr. Coffee 4-cup programable coffee makerreview/text: I purchased this coffee maker for my daughter. She loves to have her coffee waiting for her when she gets up to get ready for work in the morning. She had a regular Mr. Coffee 4-cup coffee maker and loved it. This one is just as good as the regular one and has her coffee waiting for her in the morning.
