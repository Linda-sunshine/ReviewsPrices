review/summary: A novice reviewreview/text: I purchased this for $80 and have found it worth the money (I save $1-2 on each 16oz latte I make at home, rather than going out for a coffeehouse latte). A decade ago, I purchased a steam-driven Mr. Coffee espressomaker, but found that it fell apart after a year of use and produced some off-tasting coffee.I do not have a very discerning coffee palate, but I am impressed with the espresso that the EC155 brews. It seems that the crema quality has decreased over time, but the machine does continue to produce a decent brew with store-bought preground espresso. I have yet to find their espresso singles in stores.Cleanup can be a bit of a hassle. The leftover grounds (puck) are kinda sludgy, and requires you to take the filter over a sink or trashcan fairly soon. Still, without wanting to drop mid three figures on an espressomaker, this is a decent purchase.
