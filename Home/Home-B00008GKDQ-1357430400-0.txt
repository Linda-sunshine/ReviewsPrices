review/summary: love this griddle!review/text: Thanks to the reviewers who suggested using bacon to season the griddle. The first couple of times the bacon stuck to it, even though there was a ton of grease, but by the 3rd time it was seasoned. Now I've used it for hoe cakes, pancakes, chicken, all turning out great and not sticking. I have a 5 burner gas cooktop and I keep it over 2 burners. It fits well and looks good enough to leave it there full time. By the way, it's not that heavy considering it's cast iron. I'm 5'3' , 115 lbs and I have no trouble cleaning/moving it around.
