review/summary: Awesome Kettlereview/text: This kettle works perfectly. My only complaint is that the box says &#34;works faster than a microwave&#34; or something like that, and it definitely doesn't heat water faster than a microwave. This kettle takes a few minutes. Oh, another thing is that it would be nice if the kettle made a noise when it's finished. The orange light on the thumb-button in the upper-right hand corner turns off, but unless you are watching the kettle, you don't know when it's finished. But I like it and I would get it again.
