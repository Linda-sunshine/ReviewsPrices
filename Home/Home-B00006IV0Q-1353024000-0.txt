review/summary: Not completely stainless steelreview/text: We are trying to get away from the plastic in drip coffee makers and after researching a variety of options, we chose to go with a percolator. The 12 cup Presto Percolator got good reviews and appeared to be just what we wanted. However, a few of the reviews said that there is aluminum in the percolator. This bothered me since everything else indicated it was completely stainless steel - so I called Presto (1-800-877-0441) and asked about the aluminum. The representative said that the perk well - which is the part that the perk tube sits into - is aluminum so that the water can heat faster. All other parts are stainless steel. To me this is deceptive advertising since Presto does not indicate anything but stainless steel anywhere on their information. May not be an issue to some but was a deal breaker for us. Just an FYI..
