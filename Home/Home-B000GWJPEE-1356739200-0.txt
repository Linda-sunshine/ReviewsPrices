review/summary: Fun humidifierreview/text: Bought this for my 3 year olds bedroom. Works as expected and puts out a good amount of moisture. I had the Crane Elephant Humidifier for years it it had an on/off switch in the back. This one has only one knob...you turn it on with the knob and adjust the amount of mist coming out as well. Very convenient. The auto shut off is nice as well. Filling it is easy and it is cute for a child's bedroom, especially if your child is like mine and loves Daniel Tiger. One note: The handle on top cannot be used for carrying this once it is full of water. My husband made the mistake of using the handle to carry it and it broke off. Not sure why they have a handle on it if you can't use it. I believe I read that another reviewer had this same problem. We didn't even bother gluing it back on...it isn't necessary to have it on in order for it to function properly. All in all, a decent humidifier that I would purchase again.
