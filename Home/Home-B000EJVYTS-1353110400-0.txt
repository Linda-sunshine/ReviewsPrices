review/summary: Sensor on lid stopped working in 2 months. Replacement failed on delivery!review/text: The sensor on the lid was able to open the trash can from over a foot away until after two months it stopped working. I tried all the tricks posted on line to try to fix it with no success. So I asked customer service for a replacement. They wanted to charge me shipping & handling to send the lid back and replace it after only 2 months! After some haggling, they agreed to waive the return and just make me pay for the replacement lid's shipping and handling. After receiving the replacement lid...it never worked! It was defective on delivery!!! Same problem. The sensor would only open the trash can with your hand about 1 inch from the sensor. Something is seriously wrong with their quality assurance or engineering. Don't buy their products until they fix their problems.
