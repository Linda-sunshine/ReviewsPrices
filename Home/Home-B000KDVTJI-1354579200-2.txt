review/summary: Great little kettlereview/text: How did I ever live without this kettle? It seems to be in use constantly while the microwave and stove look on jealously. Only buy stainless kettles to avoid that plastic taste that comes the those non-metal kettles. The price is great and the simplicity of design is very nice. I highly recommend.
