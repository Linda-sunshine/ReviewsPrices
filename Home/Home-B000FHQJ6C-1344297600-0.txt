review/summary: Don't Buy This Juicer!!review/text: I bought this item in May 2012. My wife and I were using it daily to prepare juice for our baby girls, but on August 2012, the plastic gear attached at the top of the metal motor shaft melted off. The motor shaft still spins, but is no longer attached to the blades, so it does nothing. Save yourself the headache and spend the money up front on a better quality product.
