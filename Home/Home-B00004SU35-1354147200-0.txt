review/summary: 2nd Wabash Popper Boughtreview/text: I was disappointed with the new Wabash popper because it seems to be made of a lighter material, the top wasn't as tight a fit as the first, and i had to buy the second popper because the plastic gears wore out. The now popper has the same type gears so will wear out around the same time. We love the way the popcorn turns out, but this first time we used the new one, the you couldn't turn the handle near the end of the popping cycle and the left side of the top started to come up. I always use the same measure of popcorn,and the first popper top never came up like that.
