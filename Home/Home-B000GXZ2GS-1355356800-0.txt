review/summary: GREAT AND EASYreview/text: My Title says it all... 5 stars from me is hard to get... I was going to get this here but BB&B; had for same price and a 20% off coupon saved me over $5... Sorry Amazon I needed it real fastDont be afraid to experiment like, I just fill it up to the #4 mark with almost 200+ degree water... (1 minute in the microwave in a 1 cup pyrex measuring cup) After putting in 2 scoops of coffee... I don't notice the result being much different than filling the cup with water (American Coffee)after pressing from the #2 mark... You get more extraction that way from your grind and I didnt notice it being bitter or acidity.... When I filled it with heated water to the #2 mark with 2 scoops the result was very good... not real expresso but "pretty darned good" I then removed the plunger and filled the tube to the #2 line again and pressed the already pressed grind and the result was a decent tasteing coffee... just saying! again I didn't notice it being bitter or acidity and got the most I could from my grind... I didnt try it 3 times, I pretty much got my moneies worth from the coffee... Just Saying dont be afraid to experiment!All in all a very decent product.. a lot cleaner result than the French presses I have been using and actually easier than using my expensive espresso machine... no thick sludge and gritty grinds like the French presses always seem to make!! So the filter system works great and you can get packages of the filters here or at BB&B; for less than 1 cent each... and yes if your are really Frugal (cheap) HAHA you can reuse them as the instructions say! I usually just use one in the morning but I don't drink coffee all day.. comes with a large supply and a nice filter holder!I don't think you will be unhappy with this product... just experiment, you can make brew as strong or weak as you desire! JUST SAYING!!!
