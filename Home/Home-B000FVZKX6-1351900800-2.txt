review/summary: It's exactly what it says it is.review/text: I feel bad that I don't love this product b/c I don't feel I was deceived by the advertising in any way. It definitely feels like velvet. It's strong feeling and feels well made. But I don't like how the velvet feels against my skin. I have extraordinarily dry skin and the sheet kind of makes me notice how dry my skin is during this cold weather. It doesn't glide against my skin like some other sheets I've owned. I do like the color though. And it, along with my comforter, keeps me very warm.
