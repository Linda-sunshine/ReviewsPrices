review/summary: Finally a can opener that a lefty can use!review/text: I am left handed and have tried all kinds of can openers. I did not like the 'safety' type of can opener because the threads of glue that pulled up with the lid was a real turn-off. The Zyliss can opener is a right handed can opener that has a locking mechanism which grips the can so tighly that even a left handed person can use it. This is the best thing since the invention of left-handed scissors.
