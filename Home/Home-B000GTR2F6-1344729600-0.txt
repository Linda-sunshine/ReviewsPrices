review/summary: Love keurig!review/text: I always wanted a keurig and Im really glad I bought it. The coffee and cocoas are soooo good. Even the iced teas are delivious. Totally in love in with it. No problems. Using my pur and brita filters to filter the water for it. So great! Also the b70 has more settings and a bigger reservoir!
