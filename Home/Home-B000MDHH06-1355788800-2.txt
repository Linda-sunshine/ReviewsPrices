review/summary: Thanks Guys!review/text: I just received my Breville BJE200XL juicer (I just placed my order a few days ago...Amazon is in a league of its own with shipping!) I really just wanted to take the time to say thanks to everyone who actually took time out to write a review on this particular juicer...the reviews REALLY makes a difference and was a deciding factor in me purchasing the Breville after tons and tons of research.On to the juicer: It is just as everyone stated; simply stunning! It arrived in excellent condition. I was so excited and even a little nervous unpacking it because of my excitment of actually having it. Juicig was SUPER easy guys! No leaks, the instructions were straight forward, and clean up was not as scary as some had stated...no difference than cleaning a blender. So many comments were made in regards to the plug? This intrigued me...what could possibly be SO special about a plug; seen one seen them all...You guys were SO spot on! Brilliant attention to something as simple as a plug. Way to go Breville!I did see some of the veggies fly out as some had stated, BUT, as someone else had stated, that is just a powerful motor at work (smile).The possibilities are going to be endless!To anyone on the fence I would say, read the reviews (I did) I felt that they were very honest with their opinions...the good and the bad and I really liked that. Take a chance and Happy Juicing!Thanks as always Amazon!
