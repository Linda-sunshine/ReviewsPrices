review/summary: Lasted 3 yearsreview/text: Can't make coffee this morning because the plastic hopper that holds the beans on my Capresso burr grinder broke. I was browsing Amazon for a replacement and learned I bought this item on December 23, 2009, exactly 3 years ago today. I ordered another. It gave me a good grind with daily use for 3 years; not bad. I long for the products of the past. I still use my mother's waffle iron from the forties, her mixer from the fifties, and her sewing machine from the sixties. Give me a clunky old metal appliance any day over the flimsy plastic items that are our only choices today.
