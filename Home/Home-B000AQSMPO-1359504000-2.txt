review/summary: Not for True Coffee Loversreview/text: I bought the Keurig a few weeks ago and have tried various blends. After using vinegar to remove a chemical/plastic taste, the coffee tastes okay.If you are a true coffee lover and have 5 extra minutes, I recommend continuing with your a traditional brewer. Here are my primary issues with this type of brewing system:*Coffee doesn't stay warm. Temperature goes to 192 degrees F but I understand that coffee should be brewed at 200 degrees F.*The K cups are not good for the environment. Everyone is in an uproar about global warming, recycling etc. Why isn't there more of an outcry? There are reusable K cups but I understand they don't work as well.*I have tried 5 different Colombian blends but they are not as good as the coffee brewed with a traditional system. The coffee just doesn't taste as authentic.If you just need a small, quick cup, maybe this is for you. Again, the flavor is okay.
