review/summary: Good product for the pricereview/text: I use this product for weighing ingredients for my home-made cosmetics, and it works great. I tried to use it for cooking, when preparing small amounts of food, but the tray is too small for this purpose. You can use it to weigh food ingredients up to 500g, it is just not very convenient, hence only 4 starts.
