review/summary: It's okayreview/text: I have used these for over a month (4-5 washes) and they still do not feel as soft as I expected them to be (and yes I did soak them for hours in water and fabric softener, as other reviewers have recommended). hey also hold wrinkles very well; it doesn't bother me - just sharing.They feel 400 thread count and I really hope they loosen up a bit and last for a while.
