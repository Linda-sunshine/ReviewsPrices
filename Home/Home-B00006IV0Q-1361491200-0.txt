review/summary: Great coffee _ Quality productreview/text: I bought this coffee maker in 2009 andperked 2 to 3 pots of coffee a day every day.the coffee pot is on from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.We certainly got our money's worth as itjust stopped working due to a bad cordwhich was replaced for $5.60.My first Presto coffee pot lasted over ten years.
