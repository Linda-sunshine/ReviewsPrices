review/summary: Great Valuereview/text: The pressure Canner/Cooker was an exceptional value. It had a better price than those found in stores and with Free Shipping and Handling made it a great deal. The canner arrived with all parts. It was easy to assemble and use. This is larger than the pressure cooker used by most people at home to cook in. It is made to allow quart jars to be pressurized for canning.It is advisable to buy an extra rubber gasket/ring to have for replacement in a few of years.
