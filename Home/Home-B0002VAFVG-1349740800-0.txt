review/summary: upgraded juicerreview/text: I started with a 5 year old Jack La Lanne juicer Power Juicer and it was all I knew. worked well, was hard to get produce through it, and seemed to bog down often, I juice the same thing every day and prep, juice and clean up took me 10 minutes almost perfectly every day. I got a new one at Costco last week and it was far worse, less juice, same juice time, no faster but a bit more convenient due to being a bit higher and wider opening.I wasn't thrilled with the new one so I looked around and found the 1000 watt Breville, and thought i would give it a try, 3x more money but i wanted to know if it was worth it.my first juice took me 5 minutes flat. I almost thought something was wrong it went so fast. I was using low speed even. the juice pitcher kept everything clean which saved a minute, it was so fast at juicing that saved at least 4-5 minutes and it cleaned far easier and without a tool to remove the blade. also the juice was noticeably cooler, the Power Juicer was at least 5-8 degrees warmer. The Breville tasted cleaner as well, more fresh, can't tell you why, it just does.All in all, for me it was well worth the price! very happy!
