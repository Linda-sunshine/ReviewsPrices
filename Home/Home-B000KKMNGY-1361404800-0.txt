review/summary: Requires modification to do what it shouldreview/text: The basket is sized properly and holds about 8 boxes of cling wrap, foil, wax paper, etc. I haven't tried parchment, which is longer, so I can't speak to that. I gave it only two stars because it's very flimsy. It's meant to be a space saver, but when you put a box in it, it sags noticeably in the back. That cuts into your cabinet space so you can't put taller items under or behind it. It doesn't come with anything to secure the basket to the upper shelf, and the upper arms aren't strong enough or long enough to hold the basket with any weight. (I posted a picture to show you how my whole hand can fit in the gap at the back.)For a $12 basket like this, I don't think I should have to make the 20 minute trip to the hardware store so I can purchase extra fixtures to make it function as it should. It's not worth the shipping cost to return, so I'll make do, but I would not recommend this to anyone unless you WANT to spend extra time and money securing the basket.
