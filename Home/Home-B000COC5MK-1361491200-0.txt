review/summary: Simply amazing -- amazingly simplereview/text: After purchasing the first of these Oster electric wine bottle openers for my personal use, I was so impressed with it that I bought two more as gifts. I had previously used a manual wine opener (using a similar process), and wanted something easier. I cannot imagine a wine opener that could be easier to use. The foil cutter works perfectly and the wine opener never misses. If I could give it SIX stars I would!
