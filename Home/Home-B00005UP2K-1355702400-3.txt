review/summary: part is missingreview/text: I am not satisfied with this purchase. Unfortunately, one part was missing which makes me think that I got a refurbished unit. The attachment hub cover which has the &#8220;KitchenAid&#8221; logo on it was not in the box. Because this was a gift I don&#8217;t want to send it back for replacement but the ugly opening on the front has to be covered. Please have this part sent to me as soon as possible. Thank you.
