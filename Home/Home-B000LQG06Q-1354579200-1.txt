review/summary: Increased the quality of my life!review/text: I decided to purchase this when I went off for college and it has definitely been worth every penny in my wallet. My college provides mattresses that are as hard as a rock, but putting this memory foam on top makes it feel like a normal bed, and that says a lot!The memory foam is incredibly soft and you can see your hand print slowly dissipate after you push down on the surface of the foam. Not only that, but this mattress top is definitely going to last me a while (maybe my entire life). I've owned it for almost two years and the performance has never let me down.The only minor issues that I have is trying to find a place to store it when it is not being used. The foam simply came wrapped up in plastic in a cardboard box and after you discard that, then its all up to your imagination as to tie/store it. Not only that but after long uses, the foam starts to develop a darker shade.
