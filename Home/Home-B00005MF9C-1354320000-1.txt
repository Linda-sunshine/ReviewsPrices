review/summary: Extremely easy and convenientreview/text: I bought this almost a year ago and never had any issues. I use it make my coffee and my tea. It is very useful, easy, and it only takes a couple minutes to brew. You put the coffee grounds in the filter and the water in back and turn it on. When you're done, clean out the coffee grounds and rinse the cup, or wait until its time to make another cup. I don't understand why people have issues with it. If you put too many coffee grounds in it, or put a filter over the filter that is already in it, then it will make a mess. That is with any coffee maker, it should be common sense. Enough said about that. I would recommend this coffee maker to anyone that I know. It's inexpensive, it's fast, and works exactly how it should.
