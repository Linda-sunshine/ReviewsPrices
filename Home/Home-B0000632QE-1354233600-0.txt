review/summary: Good for some veg, not so good for othersreview/text: I like the mandoline for slicing potatoes, onions, zucchini, and cucumbers. Not so much for carrots. I tried using it for carrots, and the carrot needs to be cut to the perfect length to fit into the safety holder. It also seems like the carrot is way too hard for the mandoline to handle.Please do use the safety holder. And make sure your hands are dry, so they don't slip. Seems like common sense, but after reading some 2 star reviews, guess it's not actually common sense... lol. Also, this device is meant to slice/chop larger vegetables. Not mushrooms. Mushrooms are tiny, and a knife works just fine on them. Not every kitchen utensil can be used on every piece of vegetable/fruit.Overall, I am finding that the mandoline is very useful for most vegetables I would need to chop on a daily basis. Immediately after I use it, I just rinse it off and dip it in hot soapy water, and it's come clean every time. This is my first mandoline purchase, and I am fairly happy with it. I do wish the safety guard locked into the mandoline some how, to prevent any slippage. It hasn't slipped for me so far, but I do get nervous that it might.
