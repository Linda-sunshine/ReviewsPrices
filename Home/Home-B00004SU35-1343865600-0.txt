review/summary: I LOVE this thing!review/text: A friend told me about the Whirley-Pop a month ago, so I decided to research it and see what the hoopla was all about.Well...let me tell you. THE HYPE IS JUSTIFIED! This popper is AWESOME! It took me a few tries to perfect the art, though. Here are a few tips and lessons learned:- The directions say medium heat. I have a gas stove, and medium-high work betters (my knob has numbers 1-9, so I put it on 7.) When the popping slows down significantly, I turn it off and let it finish popping. Usually about 98 percent of the corn actually pops; I have very few left unpopped.- I use Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (3 tbsp per 1/2 cup of corn), sea salt, few dashes of black pepper, and about 3 seconds worth of Garlic Cooking & Seasoning Spray (I get it from the WEBstaurant Store.) SOOOOOO DARN YUMMY!!- I wait almost a minute before I start whirling (the coconut oil is solid, so it has to melt first.) I give it a few whirls and then wait until it starts popping before I keep whirling. It's usually done within 3 minutes! That's faster than a microwave, and WAY, WAY tastier and healthier!- My favorite popcorn so far is the Amish Country Popcorn- the Baby White. It's really small, but I think the seasoning and oil dispurse a lot better because of it. It's also hulless, so you don't have stuff getting stuck in your gums!- Some of the reviews complain about the pot being really flimsy. Actually, it's not. I mean, it's not a heavy-duty pot, obviously. But, it's not as thin and flimsy as that first set of pots you bought at Wal-mart when you got your first apartment! Basically, it won't bend or warp if you drop it. The thin aluminum construction is what allows the heat to build quickly and evenly, thus popping the corn fast and efficiently.Bottom line: I highly recommend this gadget!
