review/summary: When I'm not going to Starbucks, I use my Bialettireview/text: I love myBialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker! When I have the time (usually on weekends), I enjoy making my own espresso with premium beans (usually from Blue Bottle) finely ground with myBreville Conical Burr Grinder. Like other reviewers have stated, take gentle care of your Bialetti - simply wash with water and no detergent whenever possible. Like a cast iron skillet, the magic comes from prior uses - the result is a fine coffee-layered patina that adds to the richness of the flavor. Always use filtered drinking water - the quality of your coffee is greatly affected by the quality of the water used to make it. The traditional Italian engineering in these espresso makers cannot be matched. Additionally, theBialetti Moka Expressis actually MADE IN ITALY! You can't beat the price and the quality of this product considering the deliciousness of the coffee it produces. If you don't have a Bialetti, what in the world are you waiting for?! Discover for yourself what Italians have known for decades. Every time I take a sip of espresso made from my Bialetti, fond memories of Rome suddenly appear.
