review/summary: So impressed, I brought two for my sons away at college!review/text: Well, this will be short and sweet. My wife does not drink coffee and making a whole pot and not finishing what I make, the mom tape plays, "finish all your food, there are starving children in...", you get the gist. So I was thinking of a Keurig but let's face it seventy bucks to make one cup of coffee, plus the pods! Not!Found this little gem and it works. Simple to use, I like strong coffee and put in one and half scoops of java. Put in water, press the button. Five minutes later, presto, hot coffee. Yeah!Save your money, buy this, it works!I liked this so much I did buy two more for my sons away at college. They really like it Plus I don't have to keep refilling the Starbucks cards.
