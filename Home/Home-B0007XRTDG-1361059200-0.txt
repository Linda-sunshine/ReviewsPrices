review/summary: Glad I bought this unitreview/text: I needed a new electric skillet since the coating on the old one had come off due to wear and tear. I liked the idea of a glass top to see how the food would be cooking while at the same time preventing grease and splattering from the food go on the counter. I have used this unit twice and I like it a lot. The heat was even throughout the skillet. It said that it could be cleaned in the dishwasher but I don't think I want to subject the coating to an hours worth of pounding water and dish soap. That's just me talking. I cleaned it both times by hand with a dish cloth and soap and it became clean easily. I haven't had any heavy grease or stains,crust,etc. on it yet but I I imagine that would come of also pretty easily. The directions said not to use a brillo pad or real abrasive pad to clean it since it could harm the coating. I like the unit. I also like pancakes which cooked well!!
