review/summary: Honeywell Compact Air Purifier with Permanent HEPA Filterreview/text: I got this air purifier for my dorm room. It's a two room suite with a common area. My suitemate loves scented air fresheners and candles. I have asthma, so it got to the point that I couldn't breathe. As a trombone player/music major, it was kind of important that I be able to breathe. This gets rid of the scents of her candles, her scented Febreeze, her little gas-station-bathroom-air-fresheners-that-smell-terrible and everything else. It took about a week on high with the HEPA filter going to get the scent out of clothes, the walls, etc. Now, however, I just keep it on low without the HEPA on. It's a charm. The noise it produces even works wonderfully as a white noise cover.
