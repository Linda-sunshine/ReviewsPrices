review/summary: Everyone needs one!review/text: We recently got one from a store and all we can think is why we didn't have one sooner! So I found it's the ideal gift for college students. I got some for friends that went off to their dorms and they use it more than me. It's a life saver, time saver, and energy saver. 15 min. for any frozen pizza, never burned, always delicious. The only downside is if it's plugged in then it's on. There is no off/on switch.
