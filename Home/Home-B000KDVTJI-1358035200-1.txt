review/summary: Great kettle!review/text: This is a great kettle that I would recommend. I bought it because we do not have a way to boil hot water at work and I love tea. I've been using it for about a week.Pros:- Boils water in 5 minutes or less- Keeps water hot enough to enjoy a second glass without having to reheat- It's cordless- It looks very nice and there is no metal/plastic tasteCons:- It will not let you boil water for an indefinite amount of time. As I use tap water it would be nice to have the option to keep the water boiling to kill everything.- It builds up mineral deposits fairly quickly so I anticipate I will have to clean it with vinegar at least once a week.- The water level indicator is hard to see when filling up water. I have had to pour it out several times because I want past max.The pros outweigh the cons though, and I have to say I am very happy with this kettle!
