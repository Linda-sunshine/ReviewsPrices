review/summary: Great at first - Pooped out Quicklyreview/text: I purchased this product a little more than a year ago. At first, it seemed a great upgrade to the Mr. Coffee espresso maker I had, which never really produced crema. The Delonghi was hot enough, had plenty of pressure, and created a beautiful crema. However, within 6 months, the performance of this machine went from a perfect stream of espresso, to coming out in drips. I cleaned everything meticulously. I sought support from Delonghi, primed the pump as instructed, etc. No improvement in pressure, so they determined the pump went bad. They replaced the unit, and I was up and running again. Almost. This replacement, which I believe was used/reconditioned, never had the performance of the original one when it was new, and now we're at a dribble again. My $20 Mr. Coffee lasted 3 times as long as this $80 Delonghi. Very disappointed.
