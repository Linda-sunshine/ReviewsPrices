review/summary: sharp but not like the first generation Ginsu from 20 years agoreview/text: I love this knife set because it is a good size and all the knives have teeth on it which i love. it is pretty sharp for what you paid for but not like the original Ginsu from 20 years ago..... Not sure if its even the same makers but def a good deal for the price!
