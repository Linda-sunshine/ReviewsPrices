review/summary: Very happy with my purchasereview/text: After trying to use both my knife and my food processor to grind spices, I decided to resort to the KRUPS Grinder, which has been SUPER convenient. You can basically grind anything to powder in a very short period of time. It also has a gentle whir that isn't at all obnoxious. I typically buy my coffee pre-ground, but with this nifty gadget, I am definitely buying beans from now on. Nothing beats a fresh brew!
