review/summary: WEAK Coffee - Better BIALETTI Stovetopreview/text: WEAK COFFEE ...I've used this for over a year, checking all of the reviews and online videos, but the coffee comes out TOO WEAK for my taste. I've resorted to leaving the plunger in the top of the funnel to let it sit and steep like tea (to make it stronger) and I've even tried different coffees and grinds ... but that's defeating the purpose of 1 cup coffee convenience.It's better for use in traveling, etc as long as you have a source for hot water.For Coffee at Home, I've gone back to my Bialetti Stovetop from ITALY (do NOT get the import from China or India).Just make sure that you get the right size. These cups are the small expresso size measure. Bialetti 12 cup is actually 2 American coffee mugs.AeroPress is a waste of money.Bialetti Moka Express 12-Cup Stovetop Espresso MakerBialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso MakerBialetti Venus, 6 CupCaffe Kimbo Kimbo Tasters Trio Pack - 3 Ground Espresso Packs
