review/summary: Seems to be high qualityreview/text: I recieved our sheet set in a timely fashion. I washed them on perm press cycle and dried them on medium heat, they didnt shrink up like some of our previous sheets. The pillow cases were very roomy and not too small for the king size pillows we have. The sheets seem to be of a heavy cotton and feel a little stiff still, and they were wrinkled coming out of the dryer, but I dont care about that, because we are just going to sleep on them anyway. I hope they soften up some, but all in all, they seem to be a set of high quality sheets. I would def buy another set of these.
