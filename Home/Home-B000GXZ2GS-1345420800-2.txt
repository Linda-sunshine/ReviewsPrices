review/summary: Best coffee!!!review/text: OK, if you are a coffee snob (like me) and want the best taste out of your beans then get the AeroPress! I gave away my french press and only make coffee out of my Aero. In fact, I bought a couple for some friends of mine because I thought it unfair for them to make coffee any other way :)P.S. Get on YouTube and check out other ways to brew a cup! :)Enjoy
