review/summary: 3+ Year Review, Not so good anymorereview/text: Bought this over 3, almost 4 years ago, to vacuum my 1,200 sq ft, one-floor house. I've got one wool rug in the living room, and a smaller one in the dining room, maybe 200 sq ft total. The rest of my house is wood floors and ceramic tile. This little Hoover used to work pretty well, I could usually manage to do a quick whole-house vacuum, minus the rugs. Now, I can barely get two bedrooms done without it shutting down due to overheating. Takes at least a half-hour for mine to cool down, sometimes more. I do keep filters clean, it certainly runs nicely when I start, but having to take a couple of long breaks during cleaning is just unacceptable. Maybe they are only meant to last a few years, maybe keep it around for just quick pickups. But will probably just trash it and look for something else. Ultimately, after 3 years, I'm disappointed.
