review/summary: Finally, a can opener that works!review/text: I don't know what it is nowadays, but it seemed it was impossible to find a decent can opener that actually would work? I know, such a novel idea, a can opener that can actually open a can! Haa haa!! I had purchased at least 6 can openers in a period of one year. Every single one of them had problems within the first week, some on first use. This one actually worked! I have had it a while now and it is still working. And a bonus is that it is very pretty and matches my stainless steel kitchen well!
