review/summary: Works Greatreview/text: I was a bit nervous after reading some of the reviews on here, but my experience has been wonderful. I have been dehydrating apples, nectarines, bananas, kiwis, and other fruit every day since I received it. It dries the fruit perfectly in 9-10 hours. I like it very dry like fruit leather. It is well worth the money. Like others have said, it would be nice to have an off/on switch as I do not like seeing the electric spark as I pull the cord out of the wall to turn off. It stays cool enough to touch on the outside of the machine while it is working so if you have kids, it won't burn them if they get close. Yes, I am quite happy with this little machine. As a matter of fact I just ordered more trays and clean a screens today. :)
