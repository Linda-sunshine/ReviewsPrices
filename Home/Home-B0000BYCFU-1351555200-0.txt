review/summary: Works like it shouldreview/text: It does work just like it should, no issues with pressure gauge, gaskets, etc. I don't know if it's my stove or this cooker, but it takes forever to start building pressure and then takes some tinkering to slow it down. Also, my mineral-ly well water discolors the inside, which is fine for canning, but makes me not want to use it for cooking.
