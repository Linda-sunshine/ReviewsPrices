review/summary: Pleased With Juicerreview/text: I am very pleased with the Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Juice Extractor. I've had it for several mouths and use it 3 to 4 times a week. I like to prep all fruits and veggie's I use in the juicer, even if it says you can add whole fruits. I use plastic bags in the container that catches all the peels and pulp, it makes clean up a breeze. I baby all kitchen appliances and wash, clean and dry everything immediately after using. Just save the plastic bags you get when you buy your fruits etc. I read many ratings doing a search online for a good juicer for the best price. One consumer site rated it 2nd in line to another very higher priced juice extractor. I'm sure others may not have had the same experience as I have, but so far it works great for me.
