review/summary: It's okreview/text: Does a decent job in extracting juice. I compared results with my neighbors Omega juicer and there was not that much of a difference in the amount of juice or taste. Assembly was very easy. Clean up in less than 10mins. The amount of pulp to discard seems like a huge waste.Updating as i am using it more and more. Comparing to friends with other juicers and it's just as good. Juicing mainly veggies and hard fruit. Using mason jars for the juice so i can have a supply for several days. That can be time consuming but it's worth it. As long as you use a bag in the pulp container and clean within 20 minutes after using, clean up really is not that bad.
