review/summary: Great Overall Productreview/text: I have had one for 2 years 9 months. It just stop working yesterday. It just would not peculate. It worked as far as the electrical portion but would not do anything. I call Customer Support, tried vinegar and water soak. It would not start to circulate after soaking. Cuisinart is sending me another we just the serial # info. I use a funnel to fill it up and paper filters to catch dust and wipe underside of lid after brewing. Their is not problem that does not have simple remedy.
