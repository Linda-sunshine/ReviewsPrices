review/summary: Cookies made easy.review/text: These cookie scoops are so nice. I have them in the largest and smallest sizes. I make my own dog treats and these help with proper portion control. I also love that my cookes and meatballs come out the same size and bake more evenly. They are super easy on the hands and seems like they will last for many years. They are easy to clean if you don't let the dough dry on them. I also throw them in the dishwasher if I am making things like meatballs. I recently had an issue with another OKO product and the company made good on their lifetime warranty.
