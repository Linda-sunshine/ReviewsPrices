review/summary: Excellent grinder for the money and consistent.review/text: I have looked at all the negative reviews about the "stale" grounds. Give me a break. It is in the instruction manual to make sure the chamber clears. If you want your beans fresh then you wouldn't have them set out in a grinder. Grind only what you need. Simple as that. It grinds so consistently on all the settings because of the conical design. The less static claim is true compared to my old burr grinder. Amazing product, and it will grind really fine up to a good coarse setting. If you have problems emptying the chamber, just tilt a little at the end of the grind and let gravity help. Very happy with this purchase.
