review/summary: Easy to work with and clean up afterwards.review/text: My daughter-in-law had many different dehydrators before the Nesco. She told me the good aspects about it like the fan in the top so it is easier to clean and trays are easy to assemble and clean and the air gets down to the fifth tray, plus several controls. It is fairly quiet while running and has so many things you can do with it from fruit, jerky, fruit roll ups and more. Easy to run and operate for me as a senior citizen.
