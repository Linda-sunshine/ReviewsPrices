review/summary: Great coffee - Great unitreview/text: I love this unit so much, I bought two!! One for the home and the other for the office. Yes, we have a regular coffee maker at the office that burns a pot of coffee at least once a week. With this unit, you put in your single cup of coffee and in less than a minute you have a fresh cup of great coffee. Don't pay attention to the noise complaints, this is not a drip coffee maker. It does use air pressure to force the water through the unit, then a little air to flush the water from the coffee bean holder. The noise is not loud, but it does make a little noise. It is a machine, not just a water heater. The noise is not a problem once you taste the great coffee it produces. Once you try it, you will not go back to the drip method of coffee making. Enjoy!!
