review/summary: It's Okay, Not Great but It Is Useful for Something Else....review/text: I ordered the Mr. Coffee warmer because I found myself boiling the kettle in my office several times a day trying to get a hot cup of tea/coffee. Well,if it wasn't for the fact that my kettle finally died, I think I would prefer to just keep boiling new cups of tea because the warmer only keeps hot beverages lukewarm at best. It just isn't warm enough to make the beverage enjoyable. I wish it had a thermostat or something so that each person could adjust the heat level best for them. The only word I can use to assess its functionality is, "OK"; HOWEVER, I have found another great use for it. Now, I'm, not telling anyone else to use it for this purpose because it WAS NOT designed to be used this way and we all know that if any injuries are sustained one cannot blame the manufacturer. Okay, here goes....ladies, I use it as a heating pad at work when I get cramps. I stick it between the desk and my stomach and voila! no more pain. It's best to use a towel to ensure you don't get burned,but by far, this has been the best use for this product. Sorry MR.Coffee, but MRS. Cramps says she can find a better use for this piece of equipment.
