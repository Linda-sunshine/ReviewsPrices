review/summary: Great little coffee makerreview/text: Had this for about a year & use it every weekend & on weekdays before work when I have time. I've tried a few different types of coffees & frothers and have been most pleased with Illy's Moka grind used w the bonjour frother. Very good cup every time & can't beat the price. As other reviewers have commented it's not true espresso but I prefer this over any of the chain coffee places cappuccinos & lattes.I have the 3 cup & it makes a decent size for one serving. Am planning on purchasing the 6 cup for use when having company. Overall very happy, was planning on eventually buying a real espresso machine but now can't justify spending the $$ when this little thing works so well.
