review/summary: Be Careful When Washingreview/text: The juicer worked great, until I had to clean it... The manual states that the pulp container and the juice cover are dishwasher safe. Apparently that was a lie. Those two parts came out warped and unusable, rendering my unit worthless. I've only had it for two days! But the one time I did use it, it worked well. So if you want a one time use $100 juicer this is for you. You have to be a rich person who throws money away like tissues to be able to use this thing.EDIT: I contacted Breville and they agreed to replace the parts at no charge. Just as a warning to anyone who purchases this and hopes to clean the parts in the dishwasher, be very wary. Even if it is more trouble, just wash this by hand. Unless if you want a few pieces of modern art.
