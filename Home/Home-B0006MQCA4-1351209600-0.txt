review/summary: Taste the PUR difference!review/text: I noticed the thing with water filters is we never really know what is in our water or what is being removed, but I can definatly taste the difference. This fits perfectly on the second shelf of my fridge and gives me a great tasting, fresh, crisp cup of water when I want it. Compared to my city water(I live in Tulsa), its like night and day on the taste and I trust that the filters remove what they say they do. The cost of the replacement filters are not expensive either when you compare it to the wastefullness(is that word?) and cost of bottled water. Very happy with this and will be investing in the regular pitcher so I can have filtered water for my tea and to boil.
