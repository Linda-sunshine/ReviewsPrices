review/summary: Great Juicer, a bit messyreview/text: I really enjoy this product. I think I've had it about 9 months and it's still going strong. I use it on average 3 times a week. The one caveat, it seems to leak/spray from around the top of the unit, so I have to drape paper towels around it for each use. Perhaps a defect, but I can't see that as the case. Still worth it in my book, hence the minus 1 star, bringing the rating to 4.
