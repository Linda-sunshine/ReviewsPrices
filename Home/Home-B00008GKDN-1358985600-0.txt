review/summary: griddle reviewreview/text: I bought this product to make dosa an Indian crepe this was supposed to be a substitute for my non stick crepe pan which was too old and peeling so Ihad to throw it away. I thought that the preseasoned pan would help me make my crepes easily. They stuck to the griddle and had to be scraped off. Disappointing
