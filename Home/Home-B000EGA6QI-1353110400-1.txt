review/summary: Make creamy soups without cream!review/text: This is my second Cuisinart Smartstick Hand Blender. The previous one eventually died, but I liked it well enough to order a new one. I have arthritis in my hands, so ergonomics and the weight of the tool are important aspects in my decision. This tool is easy to use, easy to clean, and does an excellent job. I love being able to cook a pot of soup, then use the hand blender to create a soup that is creamy in texture but does not have any additional fat. Every soup comes out looking beautiful. I use this to make smoothies too; it's a quick way to whip up a frosty beverage.
