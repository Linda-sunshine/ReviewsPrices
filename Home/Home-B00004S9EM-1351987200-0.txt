review/summary: DLC-10S Food Processorreview/text: The DLC-10S Food Processor, does all that it claims to do very effectively. The only thing that I haven't done with it is mix dough for bread and cakes, but that's next. The one thing that I did find is that it has a lot of parts. but if you're careful enough they will all fit in the large processor bowl, that is all except the Extra lid. I only gave it 4 stars because I always leave room for error that someone else might find. :0)I would recommend this product.
