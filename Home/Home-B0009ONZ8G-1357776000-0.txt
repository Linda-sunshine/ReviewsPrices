review/summary: Don't Waste Your Time or $-BUY IT!review/text: I am very picky about stuff and research what I am buying like crazy! This vacuum is the best! I had another higher end model that was bagless and had an off/on switch for the roller depending if you were on tile or carpet. I will NEVER buy a bagless vacuum again. The filters cost $! With two shedding dogs they wouldn't last long. This Hoover Tempo is great on tile or carpet. I leave the setting on bare floor all the time. Sucks up dog hair and every thing else like a dream. Besides two indoor big dogs, we heat with wood. So, if you have a woodstove you know what I am saying concerning dirt and dust. No problem for the Hoover. Even if it only lasts a couple of years for $80 I will gladly buy another one. It's the price of taking a high end one in to the repair shop for one repair. With this thing on the market, I really don't know why anyone would spend $100+ on a vacuum.
