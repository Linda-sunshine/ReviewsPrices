review/summary: Great little, but powerful machinereview/text: I bought this product, because I wanted to use it for food prep that did not require taking out larger processor. This processor is perfect for chopping fruits and vegetables, and making bread crumbs. I also use it for chopping up chicken, as I make my own dog food.My mom liked it so much, I bought her one for Christmas.I highly recommend this product.
