review/summary: RIP Keurigreview/text: I enjoyed my Keurig B70 for the two years that it was alive. It would stop working and then I descaled it with Dezkal which worked wonders. This time however, nothing could bring it back to life. I tried three rounds of descaler even leaving it overnight. I tried the paperclip. Nothing but the terrible sounds of what seemed like the pump dying. I spent hours trying to revive it but I am declaring my Keurig dead now. My only consoling thought is that this was a Christmas gift from two years ago so I didn't have to be upset about paying so much money for it. Now I have to make the decision: Electronics recycling or a Free on Craigslist ad..maybe someone knows how to actually fix this thing.The Keuring is wonderful when it works...just take into consideration the price and perhaps buying it somewhere that offers extended warranties. I usually don't get those but considering the reputation of these machines failing soon after warranty, I think it would be worth getting one.
