review/summary: Where do I begin with this thing?review/text: First can - it took 5 tries to get it to just pierce the can. Once it did, it opened just fine. I tried the magnet. Wasn't strong enough to lift the lid, so why did they even bother? Second can - I tried to get it to pierce the lid at least 10 times. I gave up and went back to my trusty old can opener which, while very dull, opened the can easily the first try. How can a company make a product that is this useless? Avoid this product (and company) at all costs.
