review/summary: just bought another...love itreview/text: I have had one for a couple of years now and have had no issues. The plastic parts that some reviewers have mentioned do concern me but I am very careful with it and so far so good. But man does this thing do a great job. It handels ice and frosen strawberries with ease. This new version is a bit more compact than my first one and I like it better and I'm sure my son who I bought it for will get lots of use out of it. I use it primarily for smoothy, protein rinks and smoothing out sauces and gravies and it sure beats a standard blender. Cleanup is a cakewalk.Love the convenience and with limited counter space its perfect.
