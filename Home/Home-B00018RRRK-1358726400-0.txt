review/summary: Awesome Burr Mill for the Pricereview/text: I know that if you are willing to spend a couple hundred bucks you can get a superb Burr Mill. This one is a great coffee mill for under $50 bucks. The only issue we have had is there can be some static build up when doing larger batches so we open the container over the sink to contain the mess. The grind is consistent and since we grind our coffee for a coffee press having a consistent grind is important. For the price point and purpose we are very pleased with this purchase.
