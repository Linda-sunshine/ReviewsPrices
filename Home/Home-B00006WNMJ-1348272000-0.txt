review/summary: Practical water filtrationreview/text: I live in an apartment, and don't feel compelled to install an elaborate under-the-sink filtration system, or lose any counter space, so this works out perfectly. I'm sure many of those systems are better, but diminishing returns factor in, and I'm confident this gets most of the bad stuff out, for minimal cost and fuss.
