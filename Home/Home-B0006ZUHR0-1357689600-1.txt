review/summary: Small but mightyreview/text: I bought this unit as a sewist iron because of it's size mostly and a few other reviews. I can't yet speak to it's long term reliability but after just a week or so and plenty of use it's what I needed. Plenty of function without all manner of whistle and bell, loads of steam that's adjustable and ability to turn off completely, easy to manipulate, plenty of cord. If it will last a few years well worth the cost. Have been using a Rowenta Steamium for several years. I'll take this little jewel any time.
