review/summary: Seems great!review/text: I bought this vacuum about a month ago because I live in a room in a shared house. Our &#34;house&#34; vacuum doesnt work very well and the carpet in my room always seemed dirty. I decided to buy this vacuum just for the room and it really works well. I really like the fact that it has an attachment and that it is a small vacuum, yet it still has a cord. I had to return a &#34;cordless&#34; vac earlier in the year because it wasn't strong enough and didn't hold a very good charge. This Eureka vacuum was even cheaper and works MUCH better. So far I enjoy it and have no complaints. I guess it would be nice if it had a HEPA filter, but my boyfriend and I both have allergies to cats and dust and since using this vacuum have noticed an improvement (there is a cat living in the house). I think it's great for use in a small space, such as a dorm room, closet, bedroom, car, etc. Enjoy!
