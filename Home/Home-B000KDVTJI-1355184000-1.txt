review/summary: Good Kettlereview/text: I use a kettle regularly about 3-4 times per day. I really like these ones that sit on a base but in my experience it is the contact in the base that goes bad before anything else. This kettle replaces a plastic T Fal I had for about 5 years. It works just great, and I enjoy the kind of retro chic look of it. Some reviewers complained that it gets hot when the water boils and if your only experience has been with plastic, I guess it does. But most of the kettles I have had, apart from the T Fal were metal so I sort of expect them to get hot. I was not concerned about boiling water in plastic until I started to read reviews when my last kettle went bad, but I think I would have bought this kettle regardless because of the good reviews and the way it looks. I have had it for a bout 6 weeks now and am very happy with it.
