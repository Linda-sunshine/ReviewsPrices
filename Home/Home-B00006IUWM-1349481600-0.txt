review/summary: Amazing !review/text: This incredible sharpener is worth its weight in gold. I have sharpened my own ( badly, I discovered), had them done professionally, and bought numerous sharpeners hawked as "great". The Presto is the best I have ever owned. The blade stays sharpened for a long time, and it is literally minutes to resharpen when's needed. I recommend it highly. The best one I've found in over 50 years of cooking.
