review/summary: Makes awful coffeereview/text: The price was great, the shipping wonderful - the product itself is worthless! I have used it numerous times, scrubbed it, ran it through the dishwasher, and it still leaves a cloudy residue in the coffee pot - not grounds as I first suspected, but just a residue - yuck! I won't use it any more.
