review/summary: Okay for a whilereview/text: This is my second DeLonghi pump espresso maker. The first (the Retro model) died after 15 months. I replaced with another DeLonghi mostly because it is the only available pump machine in this price range. Two issues with this one: the space for cups is even smaller than on the Retro model (otherwise identical). I can barely fit a small cup underneath, while on the Retro I could get a short mug in there. Also, after 3 months the pressure seems to be decreasing....even after repeated cleaning and descaling it flows VERY slowly. When this dies I will try a different brand.
