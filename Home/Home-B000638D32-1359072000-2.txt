review/summary: Buy itreview/text: Needed a solid chefs knife and thought of getting a more expansive one. After reading the reviews here and around the web. Decided this was worth a shot. Like it has been said, great knife for the price and even better than much higher priced options out there too.Comes very sharp out of the box. Handle has a nice texture and even when wet the knife is still easy to use[not much slippage]. The pictures do not do this knife justice. Has a solid feel, looking forward to using this knife for many years to come.
