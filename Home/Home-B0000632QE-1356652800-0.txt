review/summary: Wife loves this slicerreview/text: We went through 2 other mandoline slicers from other brands and both of them broke on us while slicing some butternut squash. Given that particular squash is very hard those mandolines were brand new. This mandoline with its v-shape cuts through anything without effort. My mother in law has had the original version of this for decades and was still holding on to it because it still worked. It had lost some of the parts and feet but worked great. She thought they were not around anymore until I showed her that she can get them on here. She immediately bought a new one and loves it even more! Very good mandoline!
