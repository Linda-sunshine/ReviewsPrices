review/summary: Good Product worth 4 1/2 stars!review/text: I would have given it 4 1/2 stars if possible. Please make sure you either stir or shake up this product well before using it and it will burn all the way down and will not give you that weird smell when it burns. IT MUST BE MIXED PROPERLY to work right.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is when it pops and crackles sometimes it will pop out of the fireplace so make sure you have a fire resistant rug under your fireplace especially if you have the ones you hang on the wall and they do not have a 1/2 glass section in front. Just use caution like you would with any flame. I also got the mini logs to put in front to really make it look like a fireplace.I had this same kind of product years ago when I had a floor model with the hearth and it was no where near as good as it is now. They have come a long way in 10 years! It used to never burn all the way down and it smelled horrible. So I got rid of the fireplace.Since then kids have grown up and they got a gel fireplace and loved it and told me about this product. I tried it out for myself and I love it. NO smell and burns great. I would recommend anyone with a gel fireplace or a log burner they don't want to burn logs in to use this gel and Amazon has the best price anywhere!
