review/summary: Stainless Lookreview/text: I tried to find a pot that had the least amount of plastic possible. This was the one. It also matches my appliances. Other than that, it does as advertised. Automatically shuts off when boiled for a few seconds.They all do the same thing, boil water, but it was finding a non-plastic one that was tough. This was my option and worked out great.
