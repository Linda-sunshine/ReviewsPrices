review/summary: Turns off on its ownreview/text: I've purchased 2 of these machines. One lasted 1 month and the other lasted 1 year. They both began to turn off on their own - without anyone touching any buttons. Also, the buttons began to stop working. For instance, when I would press power numerous times nothing would happen. I did love the white noise sound while it lasted for my baby.
