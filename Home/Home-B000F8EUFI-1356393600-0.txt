review/summary: Dirt Devil Dynamitereview/text: Vacuum has very good ratings on Amazon. I support them. We purchased this looking for a light weight vacuum that still cleaned like a full size vacuum. This unit works well. It works as well as any vacuum we have ever had. It is light weight but still has the power. The only cons I may mention is that due to its light weight, to some people, it may appear a bit small and has a relatively small container that needs to be emptied about every other time.
