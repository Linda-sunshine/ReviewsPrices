review/summary: Well donereview/text: I have never used a pan as durable as this, or had one cook more evenly. This is my first cast iron pan, and definitely won't be my last. I have ruined countless non-stick pans, and am impressed by the durability of the factory sprayed "pre-seasoning." So far I've had no food stick to this pan at all. Cleanup is very easy with a stiff brush and some hot water.
