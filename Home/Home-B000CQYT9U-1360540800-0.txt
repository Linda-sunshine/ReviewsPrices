review/summary: Bought this for my wifereview/text: Come on guys, if your girl likes these Willow Tree figurines, this is a must. I have first hand experience with how self-conscious the ladies feel when they start to add the weight, and possibly the stretch marks, so help them know you are excited and love who they are carrying for you. Taking time to make the Dr. appts with her, feel the baby kick, talk to the baby, and doing thoughtful little things like this really goes a long way to help her feel good.
