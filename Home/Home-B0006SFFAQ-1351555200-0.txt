review/summary: Dead at only 1.5 yearsreview/text: When I bought this in 2010, I figured I would buy a quality machine we could have for the next 10 years or so. It made great coffee and had nice features, but obviously not made to the high quality the price would indicate.In the past few weeks, the machine has been shutting down well before the autoshutdown time should have been. This morning it started giving off that awful burnt electronics smell and it appears the machine is now dead. I don't think 1.5 years is an acceptable time frame for a machine of this cost. Stay away from Cuisinart if you are looking for something to last awhile.
