review/summary: Great for Cloth Diaperingreview/text: We bought this can as a diaper pail 18 months ago. We have been very happy with its performance. Unfortunately, the diapers do produce a bit of ammonia-- which aggressively attacks the batteries; it did not shorten the life of the batteries, but they did corrode and leak a bit. We switched to an external DC power adapter to fix.Looking to buy another one for our second nursery.
