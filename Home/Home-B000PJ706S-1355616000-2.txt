review/summary: Great looking kettlereview/text: I am someone that makes their own tea at home for myself and my girlfriend and she originally purchased this one because of the look of it. It works pretty well, but it does leak some which can be annoying. There is another one that isn't too much more and it works even better. It is stainless steel which matches the kitchen perfectly. It is also an electric and cordless kettle. You do not have to place it on a stove top. It is all touch (buttons)with a see through center to see just how much water you are boiling. It works even better than the first one and isn't as much of a hassle. Definitely worth the price.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KYSLNQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B003KYSLNQ&linkCode;=as2&tag;=wwwworkoutwei-20
