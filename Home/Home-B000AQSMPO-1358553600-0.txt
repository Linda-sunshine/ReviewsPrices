review/summary: Keurigreview/text: Atlas I am writing a review about a product my office uses. Its a great invention, I love the individual cups of coffee it produces. However it isnt giving me the best tasting coffee. Its a mess to clean up and takes up too much water. I need to find a new solution for the cups, some of the reviews here will be helping me! Overall its an average brewer that does its job.
