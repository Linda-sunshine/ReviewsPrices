review/summary: great waffle makerreview/text: The waffles come out right every time. It does need to be sprayed with Pam or some other oil when I first start using it and every third waffle after that. I find that settings 1-3 are too light therefore not useful for me. The timer light works great and as long as I use an oil spray nothing ever sticks.
