review/summary: D E L I G H T F U L ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~review/text: This is my third Cuisinart food processor - the first one lasted until I gave it away to get a bigger one, the second one lasted until I gave it way to downsize again to this 9-cup, my third, and to catch up with all the latest updates/features/improvements - they just keep getting better. I'd be hard pressed to find any more good things to say about this food processor that haven't already been said in the all the other 5-star reviews.One bit of praise that I've not seen mentioned elsewhere, is the brilliance of the little hole in the bottom of the small pusher. I make most of my own salad dressings, and most require emulsification - you know the procedure - slowly drizzling oil while whisking/mixing rapidly with an emulsifier (egg, mustard, etc.) and the rest of the otherwise unblendable liquids.Well, the little hole at the bottom of this food processor works perfectly for this procedure. Depending on the amount, you can pour all or portions of the oil into the little round pusher, and it slowly, evenly falls into the work bowl in a fine stream, while pulsing it in with the other ingredients.Along with all the other great features of this food processor, the little drizzle hole in the bottom of the small pusher is BRILLIANT.
