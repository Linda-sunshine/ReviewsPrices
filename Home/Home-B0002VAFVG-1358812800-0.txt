review/summary: What's not to love?review/text: First, I chose the product due to the amount of positive feedback left.... and haven't been disappointed. It's very easy to operate and clean. It extracts so much more juice than my old juicer - it's amazing. I do line the disgard canister with a plastic bag to make it easy - and add the leftovers to my compost bin to feed my garden this spring.
