review/summary: Poor "Pre-Seasoning" = Rustreview/text: I wish I could give this pan a better review however, the one I received did not come properly "Pre-Seasoned." I can detect rust underneath which was not cleaned off prior to factory seasoning. Some of the rust is alredy surfacing. I will have to remove the old seasoning and rust and then properly season before actually using it. I have noticed that Lodge is not pre-seasoning their products as well as they used to. The last three items I purchased via AMAZON have the same problem. AMAZON should contact Lodge regarding this continuing trend. I suggest anyone interested in purchasing any of the Lodge line of products to consider the aforementioned first. One reason Lodge pre-seasoned products are higher is becasue they are supposed to be pre-seasoned and ready for immediate use.
