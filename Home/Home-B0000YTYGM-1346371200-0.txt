review/summary: Best coffeemaker I've ever ownedreview/text: My husband got me this for Christmas last year. I read the reviews and was a little worried because of the reports of coffee spewing all over the place. However, I've been using it now for 8 months and have not had a single problem with it. It brews great-tasting coffee, and the coffee stays hot for hours. I was so sick of burnt-tasting coffee, and this has solved that problem. I highly recommend it.
