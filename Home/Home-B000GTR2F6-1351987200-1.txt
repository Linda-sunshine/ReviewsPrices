review/summary: Works okay with the K-cups, but filter system with own coffee doesn't workreview/text: For years, I've considered buying this machine, but the thought of polluting the earth with those endless K-cups for one cup of coffee turned me off. So, when I saw that the company had included a "add your own coffee filter" to the machine, I thought this would be the answer for me. So, I purchased the B70 platinum, tried a couple of cups with the K-cups, which were included, and it made an adequate cup of coffee. I like my coffee strong, so I had to limit the amount of water used, by the way, so that there is less water in proportion to the cup. So, in essence, to get one good sized cup of strong coffee, I would need to brew two times (using two K-cups).Anyway, back to the rest of the story. I then tried brewing my own grind. I must have tried five different coffees, 10 different levels of grind, and each cup turned out terrible. I perused several reviews on this site, and sure enough, there were lots of complaints about this. Since this was the only reason I bought this machine, it is going back.In sum, if you like strong coffee or wanted to use your own coffee to avoid using all those plastic disposable cups, I would not recommend this machine.
