review/summary: Took a chance and it paid off great!review/text: I work from home in front of a computer pretty much all day. My old chair was killing my back, I had terrible persistent back pain, and I'm mid 30's and in good shape! I was looking for something under $300 that I could try out before giving in and spending big bucks on a professional series of chair. Well, I'm very glad I gave this one a go. I've been using it now for about 3mths, and my lower back pain is gone. It is no longer a hardship to spend most of the day sitting down. I'm 6' tall and about 175lbs and this chair fits me perfectly. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a great sitting experience for a great price!
