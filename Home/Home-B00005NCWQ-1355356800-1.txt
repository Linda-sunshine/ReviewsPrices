review/summary: Coffee the way I remember it.review/text: Haven't had a percolator since I was quite young. Over cooked my first attempt, but every pot since then has been terrific. Great aroma permeates the kitchen and the taste is so much richer. Easy to clean and well made. only downside is you need to hang around to turn down the heat once it begins to boil, and then time to completion. It's not set and forget like your drip coffee maker, but then the coffee tastes so much better. Recommended.
