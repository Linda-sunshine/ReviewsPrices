review/summary: Great Cookwarereview/text: Ordered this cookware last Christmas and it arrived in one day. I have used most of the pieces & find they cook well.The heat is well dispersed & foods cook fast. You have to watch the heat. I have an electric stove & have used other stainless cookware so I was used to adjusting the heat. I do not like the frying pans. No matter what I do (and I did follow the manufacturer's advice) food sticks in them. But I use my cast iron pan for frying anyway. I have made fudge, puddings, sauces, & other foods in the pots & they have cooked up well. Stains do appear inside & no matter what I use to clean the pots they remain. They look like water stains, but I'm not disturbed by this as they are for cooking & not for display. I wish they weren't so narrow & high. I would have liked them to be more shallow, wider and to have a &#34;loop&#34; handle to lift & control the pan.
