review/summary: Good little vacreview/text: Very good suction. Nice to have the handheld hose and adapter to reach small places. The brush guard flip feature so you can easily do stair risers is nice. You can turn the brushes on or off.Not as light as they make it out to be, but has a nice long cord and does a great job.
