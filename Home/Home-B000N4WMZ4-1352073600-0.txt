review/summary: Made in China (and not by Lodge Mfg)review/text: When asked where the enameled cookware is made, the company sent this:"Our enamel cookware is imported from China. We do not make the enamel cookware. We do have it 3rd party tested."Anything made in France, even a cheaper version of Le Creuset, has to be better than relying on China's safety standards.
