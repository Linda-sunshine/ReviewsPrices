review/summary: Baby food must-have!review/text: I make 99% of all my daughter's baby food and I was sick of freezing in baby food jars or having food spoil in the fridge. I spent tons of time researching freezing options and read reviews for everything from BPA-free ice cube trays to dedicated baby food storage containers, and decided upon these. I LOVE THEM! They make freezing and storing soooo easy. I simply cook the food, blend it with my BlendTec (couldn't live without that thing), freeze the food with these trays, and pop the perfect, 1-ounce cubes into freezer bags. At mealtime, I'm able to mix and match foods by grabbing a couple cubes, which I throw in a saucepan over low heat until heated through.I have never noticed a strange odor or flavor with these trays, and I don't have any problems getting the food out. When frozen, I simply put the trays on the counter for just a couple minutes, and the food slides out very easily. They're also super easy to clean. LOVE!
