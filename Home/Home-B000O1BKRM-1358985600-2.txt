review/summary: YAY! FUN!review/text: These are so cool. Love the fact that after the water's frozen, we have perfect ice cubes. Many silicone ice trays make it difficult to remove ice. The design of these trays makes it easier to remove the ice than many other trays we've used. Be sure to wash the trays thoroughly before using the first time.
