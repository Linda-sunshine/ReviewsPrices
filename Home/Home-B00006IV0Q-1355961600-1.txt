review/summary: Express Coffeereview/text: It makes a great smooth brew in short time. It is a slight pain to clean all the parts though. However I am lazy with cleaning dishes so it's not really a con, but a shortcoming of myself. I still prefer the standard coffee maker, but this makes a great backup.
