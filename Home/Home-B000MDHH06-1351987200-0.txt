review/summary: Perfect juicer -- I wouldn't change a thing!review/text: I'm really satisfied with this juicer. It works beautifully and quickly. It's very powerful - I was actually a bit surprised by this! The remaining pulp/rinds are very dry - much drier than my previous juicer so it's really getting the job done well as far as I can tell!It's not excruciatingly loud, as other juicers tend to be, so no earplugs required! And it's very easy to take apart and clean, which is another definite plus.I make a lot of smoothies - I recently bought two books with great smoothie and snack recipes:The Ultimate Healthy Snack List including Healthy Snacks for Adults & Healthy Snacks for Kids: Discover over 130 Healthy Snack Recipes - Fruit Snacks, ... Recipes, Gluten-Free Snacks and more!andGreen Smoothie Recipes & other Healthy Smoothie Recipes: Discover over 50 Easy Smoothie Recipes - breakfast smoothies, green smoothies, healthy ... treat smoothies and fruit smoothie recipes- and it has been wonderful making my own juice for them!All in all, I really enjoy this juicer. It was a great buy and the design and craftsmanship is high quality. I definitely recommend it. I can't really think of anything that I'd change!
