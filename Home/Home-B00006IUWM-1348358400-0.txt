review/summary: This thing WORKS....review/text: Over 15 years ago, I've purchased expensive German knives, but over time the knives became dull. I've used a plethora of "so called" knife sharpeners; however, none of them did the job. I recently purchased the Presto 08800 knife sharpener and sharpened all my knives. WOW, my knives are now as sharp as they were when I first used them. The Presto knife sharpener works and it works really well. So far, I'm very happy with this product.
