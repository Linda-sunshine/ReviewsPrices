review/summary: Awesome, and works on rooibos!review/text: My sister got me this as a gift from Amazon. I love it. I had recently bought some loose leaf rooibos tea from a local tea shop and I had ordered an in-cup steeper from Amazon that I thought would do the trick with those tiny rooibos leaves. It didn't quite, but I was going to live with it. Then this came and I tried it with my rooibos. Not a leaf in the cup. I can't believe it. I don't know how it does it. So, that's the first good reason to buy it, if you drink rooibos. Secondly, steeping in the teapot and then placing on top of a mug or my insulated, wide-mouth Kleen Kanteen works great to release the tea, sans leaves, into your receptacle. I've used it a dozen times and never had an issue, with regular sized mugs (8 oz) or slightly larger mugs (12-14 oz). Thirdly, the plastic handle doesn't hold heat, so I've had no issues with touching the handle; and it provides a steady, balanced grip. The box says throw it in the dishwasher when you're done. Well, I don't have one. So I dump the leaves and wash with soap, water and a bottle brush and it seems just fine. I'd like to thank my sister for her ingenious gift idea of an Ingenuitea Teapot! :)
