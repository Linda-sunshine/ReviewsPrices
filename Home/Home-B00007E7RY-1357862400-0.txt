review/summary: Works like a charm for dust and cat dander in my apartmentreview/text: I was worried about the noise, but it really isn't distracting at all. I typically leave it on high if I'm not home, and leave it on medium to low for bedtime, but have slept with it on high without it being too bothersome. I was also worried about the sound of any buffeting, but it's more of a constant 'shhhhhhhhhhhh'. I love it and it has really cut down on the dust in my apartment and helped with my roommate's allergy to my cat. Even friends who have allergies can come over without taking an allergy pill. I just move the unit by them and they've been good and notice the difference in how much less they are sniffling and sneezing. The unit is also easy to move around and I rotate it from room to room almost everyday. Probably will invest in another so i don't have to keep moving it.
