review/summary: The hose is too shortreview/text: This is the 3rd Tempo that I have purchased in 10 years, I put a lot of miles on these vacuums, 30 minutes a day and run them to death. I love a bagged vacuum and you can't beat this for the price, the long cord is a bonus too. The most recent one that I purchased came with a hose that is just a smidge too short and I am constantly stopping to pop it back in. I should have saved my old one, but it went out to garbage in the new box. Overall, I would recommend this product.
