review/summary: Saves my armreview/text: I have a very heavy Kerby vacuum that works very well, however I don't always want to pull it out and put on the right attachment when I want to do a little clean up of the stairs or get crumbs out of the couch crevices. This is perfect for small jobs. It is light, powerful and just works well. The little attachment which helps you get to the edges is stowed on the unit and really helped me get to areas of the stairs where my Kerby doesn't (without the crevice tool). I was actually surprised to see how much dust I picked up and I hope this vacuum can stand the test of time.
