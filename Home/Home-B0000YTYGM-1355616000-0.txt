review/summary: Great coffee, but lasted 1 monthreview/text: We've been waiting 8 days for the warranty replacement and Starbucks is costing me a fortune because I can't make my own coffee. I sure hope the new one lasts longer. 2 stars for good hot coffee. Minus three for lasting about a month.Since this machine doesn't need to stay on after brewing (because it has a thermal carafe) it has an automatic shut off after brewing. That's a great feature except after we filled it with water and turned it on, about 30 seconds later it would beep and turn itself off as if it were finished .
