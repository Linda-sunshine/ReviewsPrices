review/summary: FYI, the bottom is *NOT* filteredreview/text: Ordered this to replaced an existing gold tone permanent filter, thinking they are all the same. Unfortunately, I was incorrect, as this filter does *NOT* filter coffee through the bottom. Instead, it's a solid piece of plastic. This makes it very difficult to clean, as you can't run water through it from the bottom, like my existing filter.Other than that, seems like a 'normal' gold tone permanent filter. Just an FYI to others regarding the bottom.
