review/summary: High Quality for a Great Pricereview/text: This was my first real set of pots and pans and I absolutely love them. They are oven-ready and all stainless steel. I seared and broiled a steak in the pan and it cooked beautifully. The pots also get warm really quickly and you never need to have the heat on high. I have not had them for too long, but I plan on taking great care of them and really think that they are built to last.
