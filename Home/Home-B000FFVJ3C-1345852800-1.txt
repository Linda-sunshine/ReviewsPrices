review/summary: Makes yummies:)review/text: So far i have dehydrated just about every fruit and this does a great job,made a few fruit roll ups that turned out an absolute hit! Keeping it in mind,i am new at dehydrating,i did however seem to have a drying problem with some fresh basil,seemed to not want to dry. Other wise i love my dehydrator and if you like watermelon and cantaloupe,this works great. I still have not done jerky as of yet,which is what i bought it for so unknown to how well it works for that. I can tell you i love this dehydrator and the only thing i can see,if you go crazy dehydrating like i have you need to buy extra shelves,5 is no where near enough for me..lol Great product Thank you
