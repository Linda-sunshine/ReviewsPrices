review/summary: Brita Pitcher water filtersreview/text: I ordered through Amazon cause it was coming with the best price.The product came faster than promised and was original and in the original package! ( very important! )I had red reviews that they were sending out of date products but this was not the case and I was very pleased.I would recomend amazon and I do cause their prices are always cheaper ( Go Amazon!! do not change )Recomended to all having Brita Pitchers and love quality water ..and themselves!
