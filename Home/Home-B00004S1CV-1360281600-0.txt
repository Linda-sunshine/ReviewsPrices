review/summary: Keeps my tea super hot, even in MN winters!review/text: This tumbler has incredible insulation and keeps things super hot. I mistakenly left my hot tea out in my car during a -1 degree day for an hour and a half. When I realized I didn&#8217;t have it with me, I trudged back out to my car, thinking at least I would have some iced tea for lunch. I grabbed the tumbler out of my car, the exterior of the thermos was cold to the touch. When I got back to my desk, to my surprise contents of the tumbler were still extremely hot (too hot to drink even). Con: the drinking spout is a separate screw on piece, I have to bring both pieces which do take up some space in my lunch bag..
