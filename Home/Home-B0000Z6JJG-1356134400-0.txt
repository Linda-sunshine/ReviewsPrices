review/summary: ***Disappointed***review/text: Husband purchased the professional to replace the smaller one I had worn out. I can't begin to say how disappointed I am with it. First it is so much bigger it's awkward, cumbersome and too heavy. Second I like to grate chocolate for my hot cocoa mix. The grate blade teeth are so far apart it takes a whole lot more revolutions to get the job done of the smaller ones. It didn't do any better on cheese. Same issue with the slicing blades. The cone thing is a nuisance. The motor smells the whole time it's on. I only wish I still had the packaging to ship it back. What a waste of money!
