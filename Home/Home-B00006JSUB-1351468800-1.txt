review/summary: Best Pan Everreview/text: I was leery at first to purchase this after several reviewers said theirs cracked when heated. I have not had that problem. In fact this is my favorite cooking utensil in my kitchen arsenal. It makes the best fried chicken, bacon, or pretty much anything you want to fry, saute, or braise. The box said it was pre-seasoned, so I didn't have to bother coating it in oil and baking it on like I have other cast iron utensils I've had. This was ready to go out of the box. I rinsed it before using it the first time of course.Some tips on care I will recommend. Do not use soap. This breaks down the oil that "seasons" the pan. This pan is remarkably non stick. We just clean ours with warm water and we use a nylon scraper to remove anything that may be stuck on. If something is especially stubborn, you can add a little water to the bottom of the pan, heat it up then use a nylon scraper to remove stuck on food after the pan and water cools. Be sure to do that ASAP though as leaving water in contact with the pan for a prolonged period of time will make it rust. Towel dry you pan immediately after washing and add a thin coat of canola or other vegetable oil to keep the pan from rusting. This also keeps the pan seasoned and helps keep it non-stick and easy to clean.
