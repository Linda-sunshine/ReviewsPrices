review/summary: How can you beat it?!review/text: It may not be a (insert expensive knife brand here), but it's a very good knife, and at under $19 (what I paid - on sale at Amazon) it's a great value. Sharp and comfortable, it's now one of my favorite knives. When doing cooking demos, it's great to have quality equipment that isn't financially out of reach of the average audience member. For comparison, I've also got Henckels 4 star, Kai Wasabi, Kyocera... I'd definitely recommend the 8&#34; Fibrox, and I'd buy another if I had a need for one or to give as a gift. I like it enough that I expect to add its larger brother, the 10&#34; Fibrox, to my collection soon.If there's a better chef's knife available for less money, tell me what it is - I want one.
