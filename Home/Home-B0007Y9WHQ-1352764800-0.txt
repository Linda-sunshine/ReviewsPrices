review/summary: You get what you pay for.review/text: There is a reason this is so much cheaper than other alternatives. It is the most flimsy piece of kitchen equipment imaginable. We used it one time with great results. Packed it away in it's box and had the same exact vegetable (zucchini) ready to &#34;noodle&#34; with the same blade in the same configuration. And no slicing, no noodling, no nothing. The whole machine seems to just fall apart. I ended up using the blade to hand slice rounds of zucchini, and sliced off the tip of my thumb in the process. Difficult to operate, inconsistent results, and total lack of substance make this a terrible purchase. Stay away.
