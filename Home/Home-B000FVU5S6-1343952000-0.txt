review/summary: Worst Sheets Everreview/text: I purchased these sheets not quite 3 months ago. I have tried everything I can think of to make them comfortable. They wrinkle extremely easy and instantly become uncomfortable to sleep on. I have even tried ironing them but to no avail. Minutes after putting them on the bed they are all bunched up again. They also fit quite poorly on my standard king size bed.Amazon usually has great stuff. This is a real miss. I have now purchased a replacement for these sheets as I am hopeful I can get some sleep again. I have dreaded getting into bed on these sheets. Look forward to something different.
