review/summary: NOT DRYABLE!review/text: It does not matter the heat setting, when this pad is dried in the drier, the backing melts. I washed mine before putting on the bed due to grandson's allergies, so it has never even been used and is already ruined. Just as well have thrown my money out the window. Very disappointing!!!!!
