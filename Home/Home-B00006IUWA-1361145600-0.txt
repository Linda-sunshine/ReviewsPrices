review/summary: This popper is a pain!review/text: I ordered this popper because of the price and the air-pop instead of oil feature. Unpopped kernels fly out of the opening and I have to hold the popper back at an angle to prevent so much of the kernels flying out. Also, there are too many kernels unpopped. I will keep it because of the price and the fact that I can get some popped popcorn out of it if I hold it right but I am not too happy with this popper.
