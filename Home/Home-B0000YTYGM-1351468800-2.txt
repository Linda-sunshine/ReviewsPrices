review/summary: Coffe Potreview/text: I love this coffee maker with the exception of the thermal insulated pot. When I first start using it, the coffee stays hot for hours but after several uses it does not. Replacing the pot every time can be very expensive & the coffee maker is not reasonable to begin with.
