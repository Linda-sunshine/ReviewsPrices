review/summary: Your makeup will always be perfect with this great mirror!review/text: I bought this 3-fold lit mirror to replace another one I mistakenly left behind after a wonderful vacation. The magnification option of the center mirror is great in applying eyeliner or checking for any stray unwelcome eyebrow hairs. It is so easy to angle the side mirrors to be able to see BOTH sides of your face which is ideal for makeup and hair perfection. The lights in this are SO long lasting I have never needed to replace the bulbs and I use this every day. I will not be without this marvelous mirror....it folds so you don't even see the mirrors once you're done. A great invention which will blend in any decor and has a relatively small &#34;footprint&#34; when closed if you don't have a lot of space. You owe it to yourself, after purchasing great beauty products and makeup, to LOOK your best self. This mirror is a perfect helper!!!
