review/summary: Weighed myself several times... got different weights each timereview/text: I bought this scale to replace one I've had for at least a decade, a Salter model that was highly rated at the time. It's been a great scale, but it needs some repair work (a wire worked loose and needs to be soldered) and the batteries are expensive and hard to find. Taylor is a good scale brand, and I figured I'd give this one a try. For me the selling point was that it takes three AAA batteries and got good reviews from Consumer Reports. Got it home, put in the batteries, put it on a flat, smooth hardwood surface and weighed myself. Stepped off, and weighed myself again -- this time the weight was a half-pound lighter. Weighed myself again in 15 minutes, this time it was a full pound lighter. 15 minutes after that, it was back to the original weight. Immediately after that... half a pound lighter. You get the idea. I took out the batteries, repackaged the scale, and it's going back today. I guess I'll see if I can repair my good ol' Salter, and if not, it's apparently worth spending a bit more for an accurate bathroom scale.
