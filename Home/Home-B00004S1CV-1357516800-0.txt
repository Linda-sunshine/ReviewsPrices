review/summary: Works too well (if that's possible)review/text: I added tea leaves, some hot water, then tossed the tumbler into my jacket and headed out for a day on the mountain. On the 2.5 hour drive I forgot that I had thrown my jacket into the back of the car (with the tumbler inside). Not wanting to waste the tea before heading to the lifts, I opened it and took a sip. Immediately burned my tongue. This thing can definitely keep beverages piping hot.
