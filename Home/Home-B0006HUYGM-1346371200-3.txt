review/summary: Loved it!!!!!!review/text: Bought this because my vacuum was just not getting the cat hair of the furniture. This is amazing, it has more suction then my vacuum and the hair and dust that come off the furniture was a bit alarming. I vacuum my couches every week if not more and I never got this much hair off them. The only thing I had to get use to is, I have a soft cushioned couch and the suction is so much that you can only go one way with the vacuum. But I got use to that quick and I would recommend this to everyone.
