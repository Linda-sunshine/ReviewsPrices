review/summary: WORKS WELLreview/text: I'll start by saying I use the Rabbit opener most of the time, and the wife wanted to try an electrical opener. While tis does the job, I still prefer the Rabbit. I supposed if you had arthritis or weak hand strength, this electrical system might work better for you.I can't tell you how many bottles it opens a single charge because we keep it in the charging stand on the bar.A bonus from ordering this on Amazon is the chiller that comes with the set. You put the chiller in the freezer, and when you need to chill a bottle, just drop it in the now frozen &#34;Wine Koozie&#34;. The price of this set on Amazon is the same as other box stores but you do not get the chiller at the box stores.Overall, for your money, it's a good deal and a good performer.
