review/summary: Just want i was looking for.review/text: I bought this from all the positive reviews i read. Once I got my waffle baker, i had to go out and purchase an adaptor, since i live in Japan and we don't have the three prong plugs. I was so happy with a recipe i found online and the waffles turned out perfectly!!Very crispy and soft inside. be careful not to put to much batter in or you'll spill over the sides, happened to me a few time.Easy to clean. It did seem to take a little long to cook, but, wasn't that bad.Doesn't take up that much space.very happy with this product.
