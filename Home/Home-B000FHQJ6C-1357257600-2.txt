review/summary: Great juicer for beginners (and for the money!)review/text: This was our first juicer. We wanted something good quality and inexpensive. Thank god for amazon reviews because that is what helped me end up choosing this one.PROS:*Easy and quick cleaning (all juicers are going to take a few minutes and some effort to clean up, I wish more people could know and consider that when they write reviews on any juicer)*You can place a plastic shopping bag in the pulp bin for even more convenient cleanup.*Very powerful*Fairly compactCONS:*LOUD AS HELL and actually made me worry about our eardrums/hearing damageI'd like to offer some pointers for making the most of this juicer.-The blades will become clogged with plant matter that ends up turning into an almost cement-like substance. ALWAYS IMMEDIATELY at least soak the basket in water and never let it dry, even briefly. This was a huge issue for me and had I known how important this is I could have saved myself many hours of soaking in all kinds of solvents and lots of chipping away at the gunk.-Rejuicing your pulp will get you a little extra juice and is well worth the small effort-Always READ the instructions before using any juicer. There are certain things you must avoid doing or you will end up wearing it out or breaking it way ahead of schedule.
