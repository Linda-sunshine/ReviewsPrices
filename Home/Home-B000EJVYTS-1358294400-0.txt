review/summary: Good trash can, conversation piece, and sanitaryreview/text: We have had ours for a little over 2 years and really enjoyed the ownership of it. To avoid the D-cell consumption, I got a compatible AC adapter so it is plugged in. It gets attention in the house, especially from kids, but this encourages the usage of it reducing the collection of items that should be discarded at parties. Luckily my german shepherd isn't interested in it when his tail swings by it and opens the can occasionally.The bad news is this only lasted 2 years for functional use of automatic open/close. It started first to open more slowly or only 3/4 the way open. Shortly after it just stopped altogether. We are looking to replace it now with another one, just disappointed it didn't last all more than 2 years for us.Overall I would recommend it. I am sure my family has given it a heavy use, not excessive, but understandably a lot of open and closes in our ownership. I am looking at another iTouchless trash can to replace it. So hopefully you will consider it as well.
