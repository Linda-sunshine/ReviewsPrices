review/summary: Awesome little machinereview/text: I've only had this machine a week but am very impressed with it. This vacuum cleaner is great for picking up dog hair off the dog beds because it's powerful enough to suck up the hair but will not suck up the dog bed with it. Same for small carpets. It's also great for my mini van because the handle retracts. I also used it on the cover of the couch and it worked great with the dog hair. I can retract the handle and store it under my buffet in the sun room. It's light and easy to handle even if you have arthritis. Does the job I wanted it to do with the dog hair. Great as a second machine.It is made of plastic so I don't know how long it will last but at the price I paid for it I'm happy with it. You should clean the filter after each use because it will loose suction. And emptying the canister isn't the easiest if you have a bunch of dog hair in it. But that's no big deal. Also, it's very loud.I didn't buy this machine from Amazon because at the time it was cheaper on another web site. I see now that Amazon is offering it for the same price I paid for it. Too bad I didn't wait a little while longer because I prefer to purchase through Amazon.
