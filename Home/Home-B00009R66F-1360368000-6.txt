review/summary: This is an excellent machine for the pricereview/text: I bought this machine after borrowing an older Hoover carpet cleaner with all the bells and whistles. Although this machine does not have a separate tank for water and the soap, it didn't matter. If you want to use less soap, you have the control and just don't add the full amount! Common sense, really. This machine is heavy and the components feel solid and well made. It is very easy to change the tanks. The suction pulls up much of the water/soap combination. I use only Hoover brand soaps, as I believe you get what you pay for. I expect to get many years from this carpet cleaner.
