review/summary: I reccomend it for those who don't juice very oftenreview/text: It's hard to give this machine a poor review.. afterall it did serve me well for the past year. But this is the second time it completely broke down, and I need to upgrade now. The first time it completely broke down (the basket piece literally started smoking at the bottom and became welded to the plastic bottom), I called Hamilton Beach and was so satisfied at how easy it was to get a new one under warranty. All I had to do was take a picture of the unit with the chord cut off and email it to them and one week later I had a brand new juicer.Juicing has become a huge part of my lifestyle. I try to juice at least once a day, if not 2 or 3 times. I think this unit just became stressed with the amount of juicing I put it through. That's why I think that this is a better juicer for someone who only juices occasionally. I was happy with the juicer's clean up and the amount of juice I got from produce.. although it was usually moist. You do get what you pay for, this is a mid range juicer so you should expect mid range handling. I'm trading up for a Breville.
