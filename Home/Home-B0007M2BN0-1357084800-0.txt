review/summary: greatreview/text: I didn't know these things existed! They're great.I hate boiling water (takes too long) and then adding eggs to boil (takes, again, too long). I also hate having to clean the big pot from just boiling one egg.This item really speeds up the process and makes my life easy. I always eat my eggs hard-boiled ( I hate soft-boiled), and it takes about 8 min for 1 egg, and 13 min for 4 eggs. (2-3 eggs are in between this time frame).Makes my life soo easy. Yay protein!
