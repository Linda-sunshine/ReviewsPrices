review/summary: Just what I neededreview/text: I love it. Just the right size to sit on the counter. It did all the chopping for my Thanksgiving stuffing with minimum cleanup. Also great for little jobs, such as making fresh bread crumbs. I have a large food processor but found I would often do the job by hand rather than have to haul it out.
