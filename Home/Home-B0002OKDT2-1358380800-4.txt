review/summary: Quiet and powerfulreview/text: I was pleased that the machine was so quiet. It also does a great job with the fruits and veggies we feed it, even pomegranate seeds (hope those don't cause it trouble!). My wife has been using it almost every day since we got it and she really likes it too. It has relatively few parts that are simple to clean.I'm looking forward to using it to make noodles with its other attachment, but for now just juice.
