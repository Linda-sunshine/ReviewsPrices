review/summary: Works like a charmreview/text: This really comes in handy when I want to take a long soak in the tub as it allows me to fill the tub almost to the very top. I turn the drain hole slightly off center at about the two o'clock position as it prevents the tub from over flowing but allows the maximum amount of water the tub will hold. Love it.
