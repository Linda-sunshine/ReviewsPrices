review/summary: Bedtime is a Joy!review/text: My husband and I bought this topper for the guest bed at our son's home. Now that we have grandchildren, we seem to spend a lot of time out-of-state, visiting them. Before this mattress topper, we'd wake up in the mornings with stiff backs and sore hips after a night sleeping in their guest bedroom. I wasn't sure whether or not this would make a difference but let me tell you, if was like night and day. I LOVE this mattress topper. It is like sinking down into a cloud at night and then being hugged by your favorite big squishy teddy bear from childhood until you wake in the morning. Heavenly! I like it so much that I'm going to get one to go on our own guest bed back home. In fact, we have a Sleep Number bed that we sleep on at home and after our first night back home, I have to say that I found sleeping on the mattress topper more comfortable than the Sleep Number mattress.
