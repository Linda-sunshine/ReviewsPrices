review/summary: I love this kettle.review/text: I was so suprised to see the negative reviews here. I wonder if they changed the design or something, mine has never smelled. I've used it multiple times per days for the last seven months. It boils fast, the water tastes great, it's quiet, there's no smell. The water tastes delicious. I love mine. I also have three friends, one who is a professional chef and the others very meticulous about their food. They all have and love the Capresso as well.
