review/summary: works greatreview/text: I have only used this for zucchini and have only used one blade. I like to make the zucchini look like spaghetti. I have brought this dish to a raw vegan potluck and it was a big hit. I enjoy it for a change of pace. Easy to use and clean. I save the core for salads or eat it while preparing the zucchini spaghetti.
