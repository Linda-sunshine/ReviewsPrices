review/summary: effective little cleanerreview/text: I purchased this specifically for doing the stairs in my home...my regular vacuum was too heavy and the cord was not long enough. I am so glad I did! The long cord means one plug in and I was able to do the whole thing..no stopping and replugging. I can see how this would also be great for my car. It winds up nicely on the base so it is neat and easy to store, which I appreciate. Tons of power and the beater brush brought up the nap on the carpeted stair very well. The on board hose meant I was able to zip along that seam on the treads without missing a beat..convenient. I could not believe how much stuff was in the collection cup...which popped out easily to clean and popped right back in. The filter looks like flimsy paper and that might be my only concern: that over time that would be an issue.Overall, I feel like I got a great deal...very low price for a lot of muscle in a tiny package. This is great for stairs, your car, and anywhere else you need a fast but effective clean up.
