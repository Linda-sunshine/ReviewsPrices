review/summary: Popcorn is simplereview/text: We've actually used this for other cooking, but 2 TBS of Coconut Oil, 1 CUP of popcorn and medium heat and the best popcorn. The flat base keeps the oil hot, the shape redirects the unpopped kernels back to the heat, and clean up is a breeze. Cuisinart did a GREAT job on this product. Now.. if they only made exercise machines...
