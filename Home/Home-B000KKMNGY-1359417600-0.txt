review/summary: For light weight itemsreview/text: I planned to use this to store food sealer bags but they are a bit too heavy for this, I noticed it sags a little. Also, make sure you have weight on the top shelf over the rack's legs to keep this rack from tilting unevenly. It would probably be fine for aluminum foil (as pictured). Do not buy if you intend to use with anything heavy.
