review/summary: problematic, not as fun as I expected.review/text: This item suffers from feature bloat, making it difficult to use for the casual coffee drinker. We got it for our dental waiting room,..that was a mistake. Our customers give up trying to figure it out, and ask our front desk people to help. Then THEY can't figure it out, so they call the IT dept..the machine is cantankerous, shuts off for no reason; this is a case of too much is less. People want a quick cup of great coffee; they don't want to go online for technical support to figure out how to...what? program it? ..to wake up? Heck, we want coffee because WE need to wake up.It's like the multi-functional digital kitchen timer that no one uses. I had to call their tech support once, as no one in our office could get it to work,..they finally explained that you have to open and close the top to fool it into thinking there's coffee in it,..whatever.Pros: coffee supply lasts a LONG TIME, since no one uses it.Cons: coffee supply lasts a LONG TIME, since no one uses it.
