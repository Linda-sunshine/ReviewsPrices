review/summary: Enjoy It While It Lastsreview/text: I was completely fooled into thinking this was the best coffee maker I'd ever had. I admit that for a while, it was. "A while" being the key words. A coffee maker that costs over a hundred dollars should last a lot more than a year. But after a year, this thing started getting really unreliable. By a year a half, it was just dead. All just in time for the warranty to end, naturally. I don't think coffee makers should be considered disposable. I've had cheap coffee machines last a decade. It's not asking too much that a pricey one last at least half as long as my $10 one.So, in the short term, enjoy your quick, convenient one-cup brewing. But don't expect the honeymoon to last.
