review/summary: Quick Cup O Joereview/text: Been using this brewer for about a month and am satisfied with the purchase. The brewer makes a cup of coffee in just a few minutes. I prefer to brew my coffee one cup at a time and this pot works out well. The brewer takes up little counter space and has a permanent filter that is easy to dump and rinse. I like my coffee hot, so while it is brewing I pre-heat the cup with hot tap water.
