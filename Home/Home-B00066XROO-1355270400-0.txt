review/summary: Great griddle!review/text: It's been 3 years since purchasing the Presto Tilt 'n Drain Big Griddle. We love it. It heats up very well. We turn it on and give it 15 minutes or so to heat up. We do not use metal utensils to move food around on the griddle (I believe the utensils we use are nylon). Cleaning it has gotten easier since avoid making a huge mess while cooking...the only thing we have to do is wet a sponge and put some dish washing liquid on the sponge, then with the griddle sitting on its back end at a diagonal over the corner of the sink, wipe off the entire cooking surface. Then wrinse the soap out of the sponge, and wipe the surface of the griddle again to get any soap off. I have never had to clean out the drip tray at the front of the unit, because it's never been dirty. I would highly recommend this griddle to anyone who wants to cook pancakes, but we have also cooked eggs on it.
