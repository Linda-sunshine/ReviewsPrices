review/summary: A KITCHEN MUSTreview/text: We are only a family of two, but I would find it hard to live without this griddle. Even if we are cooking just 5-6 pancakes for our meal, it's a must. Not to mention they are ready at the same time too! Bacon is never an easy thing to cook, unless you put it in the oven, but this griddle does bacon to perfection and its way easier to clean up the griddle. We cook the entire package of bacon (it all fits...that way you can have left over for other meals in the coming week), let all the grease drain, and then toss on the pancakes or eggs if we are having eggs.You just cannot beat this griddle. The key is to let it heat up...there is a temperature dial on it for a reason peeps! For bacon or pancakes, let it heat ALL THE WAY up to 350 (less for eggs)...and the light has gone off...THEN place your food on it. You'll have better results, trust me. My husband got impatient one morning for his bacon to start cooking he tossed it on about oh...200-250 degrees and it didn't turn out right...he waits now...he loves his bacon, HA.We like grilled cheese sadwiches on sourdough bread...try fitting those in your average fry pan...they don't usually fit. But with this griddle, presto...they fit AND they are done at the same time, no more griling one at a time.
