review/summary: Our go to panreview/text: Since purchasing this skillet for my husband we have all but packed away all of our nonstick cook wear. This skillet is durable and versatile. Just about everything we make on the stove, gets made in this skillet. And you can make a mean giant chocolate chip cookie this way too.
