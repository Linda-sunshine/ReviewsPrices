review/summary: Works well.review/text: Originally bought these to make coffee ice cubes for my iced coffee in the summer. Worked well - although the coffee did temporary stain the trays.This winter we adopted a baby boy and these have been working well for making baby food. Nice size.Yes, your hands may get a bit sticky taking these out of the tray. But I like that the tray is so bendable so you can peel and bend the tray to get them out.We now have 4 trays and I would not hesitate to purchase more if I needed more.
