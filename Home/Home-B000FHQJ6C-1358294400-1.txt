review/summary: Juicingreview/text: We were very impressed with this machine. and like it a lot. We were a little surprised how quickly we dulled the blades. They were cheap enough to replace but just couldn't seem to stand up to everyday use. We have since quit juicing as we found no real benefit. It is an easy and sure way to get your nutrients, but our cooking practices already afford this necessity.
