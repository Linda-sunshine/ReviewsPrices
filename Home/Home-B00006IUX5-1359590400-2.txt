review/summary: Great Bargainreview/text: This is a great little grinder with super value for the price. I use it to grind my flaxseeds and most any other spices. Does the job, easy clean up and I love the self storage power cord. I would highly recommend this product if you use a grinder for little jobs (it does not have a large capacity).
