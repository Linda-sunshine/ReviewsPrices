review/summary: Good for lite usereview/text: Been using this for about a month. Have used it for blending soft stuff (fruits, rice) etc. Fairs pretty well. The detachable blade rod is good for easy cleaning. The jar that comes along is pretty useful as well. Will update the review if I find something interesting.
