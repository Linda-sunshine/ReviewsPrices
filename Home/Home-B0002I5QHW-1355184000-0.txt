review/summary: Danger - plastic shavings gin grindingsreview/text: Very disappointed with this gift, the blades were too dull to grind the meat, instead the meat came out looking like mush, it was not ground. Plastic shavings were found in the meat, the auger was grinding against the back end. I immediately stopped using the grinder, its in the garbage now, the meat is inedible.WARNING - Do not buy this product. Health hazard!
