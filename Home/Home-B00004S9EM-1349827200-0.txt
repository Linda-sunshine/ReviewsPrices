review/summary: What a time-saver!review/text: What a heavy, solidly-built machine! It's just the right size for keeping on my countertop for easy access. If you have a large family, you'll want to get the 11-cup size Cuisinart Food Processor. I wasn't quite sure which size to buy, but for a family of four this model is quite adequate. It's not loud like I thought it might be. I'm very pleased with the safe and excellent performance.Making chicken salad is a snap (or should I say a pulse.) :o) I've made bread crumbs for meatloaf, tomato puree for canning from my garden tomatoes, cole slaw, and sliced apples for pie. I'm looking forward to using the fine blade I purchased separately to make carrot/raisin salad like they sell at Chick-fil-A. Love that salad, and I was even fortunate to find their recipe online some time ago! Happy Processing!
