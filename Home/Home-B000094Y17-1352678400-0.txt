review/summary: I thought a name like Brita would know how to make a lidreview/text: Boy, was I sorely mistaken. I saw reviews on here about the lid, the fact if falls off when pouring. I thought, yeah sure. Well, I found out I spent $32 bucks on a leaky pitcher where the lid does not fit securely, falls off when pouring. DON'T waste your money on this poorly made piece of plastic. Sure, they are pretty colors, but c'mon - the thing is not made well.
