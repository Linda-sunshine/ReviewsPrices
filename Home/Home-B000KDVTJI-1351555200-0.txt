review/summary: automatic shut off broke with in a weekreview/text: amazon is replacing- still a hassle. I had been warned by the negative reviews yet ordered it - so I was was kind of expecting it to break. The new one better work if not I write another review - far less "positive". Product otherwise looks good and boil the water in a timely matter (reason for 2 stars).
