review/summary: Humidifies my housereview/text: This thing works well. With the two large water tanks I only have to fill it at most once a day (if it is really dry outside), and if it is more humid outside it can be two or more days before I have to refill it. This one unit is also enough that when centrally placed it can keep my whole house at a comfortable humidity level so I don't have to monitor several different units. It would be nicer if this had a digital display, but it's easy enough to set it where you want it with the two dials.My one complaint is that often there is a vibration of the two tanks against each other that makes this sound really loud. I ended up laying a tea towel between the tanks to absorb the vibration and with that it is so quiet you don't notice it at all, but I shouldn't have to improvise a solution for something that should have been accounted for in the design of the product. Plus, not that I bought this machine to be a beautiful centerpiece in my house, but it does look a little funny with the tea towel sticking out of it.
