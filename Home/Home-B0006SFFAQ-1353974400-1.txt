review/summary: Bought in 2004. In 2012, 8 years later, still works like a charm!review/text: This coffeemaker is phenomenal! A solid, solid, appliance. I bought it during my first year of law school in 2004 and have brewed gallons upon gallons upon gallons of coffee in it since then. Now, 8-years later, it still works like a charm and I've had no problems with it. Wish I could say the same for its matching coffee grinder, but I cannot. I only wish that this model came with that amazing, stainless steel, thermal carafe that accompanies some of the other Cuisinart models. Now, that carafe keeps coffee hot forever. Wouldn't recommend using the stainless steel carafe with this model, though, since this model has a hot plate base that might burn the other carafe.
