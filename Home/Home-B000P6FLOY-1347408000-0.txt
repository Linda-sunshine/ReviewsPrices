review/summary: Failed right out of the boxreview/text: This product is visually pleasing, but also exceedingly frustrating. Unfortunately, the first time that I went to use it (while I was getting ready to roast a turkey!), it failed to read temperature properly. This resulted in an emergency trip to the grocery store to purchase a traditional meat thermometer and a delayed dinner. Like other reviewers, I can attribute this to a faulty probe. I returned the thermometer and purchased another product instead.
