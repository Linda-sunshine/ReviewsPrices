review/summary: Its a great juicerreview/text: This is a great juicer. I have bought it after watching the movie fat sick and nearly dead. Almost a month now runs without any issues, every morning using this for juicing. I was little concerned about the reviews around juice quantity, But I have found it makes enough juice for 2 every morning. Also I did not see any wastage juice with the pulp, with a second juicing of the pulp we almost thoroughly juice everything without any wastage.
