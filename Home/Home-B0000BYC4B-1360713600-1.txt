review/summary: Not widely available in storesreview/text: I purchased these online because I haven't been able to find the wide mouth version in my local stores. I have used the regular mouth version for a couple of years. My only criticism is that they can leak unless you place the canner lid inside as a seal. Otherwise, they do the job I needed them for which is capping open jars of veggies or jellies for refrigeration.
