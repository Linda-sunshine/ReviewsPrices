review/summary: wonderful sheets!review/text: These sheets are durable and warm. And after several months of washing and sleeping on them, they have yet to pill. With each wash, they get softer and more comfortable. I was disappointed in my purchase of the Pinzon 160 gram sheets because I found them to be scratchy. They also pilled dreadfully, and each wash I keep finding my lint trap completely full. Eventually I'll find the 160 gram sheets disintegrated in the wash. Bottom line: Buy these BUT DO NOT BUY the 160 gram sheets.
