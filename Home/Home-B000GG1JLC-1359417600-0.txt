review/summary: Complete Junkreview/text: Biggest waste of money ever, good thing I only paid two dollars. Not even worth the hassle of returning it, it'd be more trouble than it's worth to try and return rather than just put it where it belongs which is in the trash. It is cheap plastic, doesn't look like the picture, and it came BROKEN!! Couldn't even use it. It's definitely true what they say &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;!
