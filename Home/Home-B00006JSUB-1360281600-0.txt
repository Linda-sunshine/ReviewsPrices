review/summary: Heavy like all cast ironreview/text: This thing is heavy. It's not that bad to clean, just buy some steal wool and some crisco to put on it after your done cleaning. You can let grease from bacon and other fatty meats just sit in it, and then cook with that grease next time around. I like that its made in america too. Seems like this is one of the only cast iron brands that you can buy, they've done it right!
