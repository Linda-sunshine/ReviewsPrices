review/summary: Hoover Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuumreview/text: I bought this Vacuum cleaner on the recommendation of Consumer Reports. What a disappointment! It is too heavy for my wife to push, and worse, it does not vacuum very well. It has trouble picking up little pieces such as paper or string. When I vacuum the wooden floor in my den, I have to go over the area twice in order for this vacuum cleaner to pick up all of the dust. The clamp that holds the bag is a bit tricky to click open and close. The setting for height for carpet/floors is very difficult to move between settings. it constantly gets stuck and it requirs a lot of force to move the setting. This product is also very noisy. After using this thing for about one year, we're going to buy another brand and put this clunker in a closet or give it away.
