review/summary: Not so goodreview/text: The unit is noisy no matter where you place it. The output that it is rated for (9 gallon) does not even approach that. The filter deteriorated within a month and was yearning for a new one and at $24.00 a filter this is really not very eccoomical. I t is hard pressed to raise the humidity above 35% and stays aound 25 % mostly.The filter does not absorb water from the well and have to flip filter a couple times a day to keep any moisture in it.Overall Honeywel (who used to sell great products) sold me a bummerTwo stars tops but probably should be one.
