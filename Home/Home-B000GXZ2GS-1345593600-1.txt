review/summary: Easy to clean. Easy to use. Fast and effective for 1 cup at a timereview/text: This makes a good cup of coffee (Really an Americano but if you don't know the difference who cares). As far as an Americano, I found it to be very smooth, not too sharp and not too flat but just right. It really brings out the flavors in the beans if made right. As a snob, I have my favorite methods of brewing, and this, I would have to say, is number 2 or 3 in my book. It is very simple, and the clean up is awesome, but it is meant for one cup, and repeating the process for multiple cups can be a pain. I tend to share my coffee, or want more than one cup, so I don't mind the extra clean up of a simple french press or vacuum siphon. I would say that if you want to become a snob, this would be a good starter, but get some good beans.
