review/summary: Works greatreview/text: This is a nice tamper for my Cuisinart espresso maker. I am really happy i found this. The trick is not to tamp it down to much so that it is like a rock but you want it tamped down enough. There's a fine line that you will learn! I recommend this product. Any questions please ask i am always looking for advice so i enjoy giving it when i can as well.
