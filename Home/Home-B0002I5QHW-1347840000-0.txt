review/summary: Product exceeds expectationsreview/text: As have many others I read many of the previous reviews (mostly good but a few with some concerns) before I "made the plunge". I have to agree with all of the positive reviews for these reasons specifically: 1) No problem assembling the grinder - the pictorial instructions were clear enough; 2) the grinder stayed rock solidly "attached" to my granite counter top as I ground over 3 pounds of brisket beef and short ribs; 3) clean up was really easy because of the way that the unit disassembled.Note: I used a pestle from a spice morter & pestle set to push the cubed meat into the grinder - this felt a lot safer than using my fingers. at the end of each "batch" I followed the grinder instructions and used the top of the key to push the remaining meat into the grinder.I've only used it the one time so far, but I would highly recommend this product.
