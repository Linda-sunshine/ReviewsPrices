review/summary: My morning was savedreview/text: It started out to be a bleak morning. I had only basket filters which I used to clumsily filter my sauce pan brewed coffee into a cup.Amazon next day shipping arrived at 10am. Hallelujah! Then I panicked... oh please let there be some cone filters in this box. Oh yeah!!! Thank you Cuisinart for the cone filter starter kit! You saved my morning.I am completely satisfied with this unit. The coffee stays hot and fresh in the 12 cup carafe. It brews quickly and makes a great cup of coffee. I'm not an easy 5 star. But "5" it is.
