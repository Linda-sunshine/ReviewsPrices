review/summary: Breathing better already!review/text: I got this for my room after my housemate got a pet. After turning it on, in about a day I could really feel a difference. Not to mention that even at the highest setting this machine isn't too loud or disruptive - in fact it's the perfect amount of white noise. The permanent filter is a huge plus!
