review/summary: watch for refurbs!!!review/text: While shopping on-line for a food processor my wife and I found something interesting about these food processors.The color determines who is selling the food processor.... And to me it appears that only the silver model is sold by amazon and is still being sold by Cuisinart. If your model number ends in anything other then "CHB" it appears no longer to be sold by Cuisinart but is sold by other discount places still, as refurbs... minus the 10 year warrenty but only with 90 days.So yes refurbs ARE being sold on Amazon but those are not fulfilled from Amazon. If you notice in the fulfilment section most says: "Ships from and sold by Abes of Maine Cameras and Electronics", but I don't know if all say that or not... LOOK BEFORE YOU BUY!!! And if sellers are selling refurbs without indicating and with much less warrenty then advertised it IS false advertising and fraud.Everything I have said is just my opinion... and of course this is for legal reasons completly.LOOK BEFORE YOU BUY!!! We have bought the 9 cup version but made sure about the model number and will look for a stamped in serial number indicating it is new from Cuisinart, and not a sticker indicating a refurb. On the whole I believe Cuisinart food processors to be still of as good or better quality then most food processors. But their bottom of the line models are just that, same as everyone else.
