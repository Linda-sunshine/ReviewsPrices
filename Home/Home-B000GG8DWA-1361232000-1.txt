review/summary: Great for the bathroomreview/text: Use this in the bathroom of our 1 bedroom apartment during showers. Never have to run central heat because we have units on 5/6 sides of us, but in the morning and during showers the heater is very welcoming during winter time. We usually only run it at 400W (top element only), but have used 800W (both elements) a few times and really heats up the little bathroom. Fits on top of the tank of the toilet OK
