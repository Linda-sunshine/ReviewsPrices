review/summary: Versatile potreview/text: I got this because it was recommended for making no-knead bread; although other kinds of pots reportedly work, too, mine have handles that wouldn't have stood the high temperatures required (425-500 degrees). All the recipes I've tried so far with this dutch oven have been delicious, but only the recipes using more than 6 cups of flour have really required this large size. Still, the dutch oven is so versatile I'm glad I got the 7-quart model so I can use it for roasts and stews, too.
