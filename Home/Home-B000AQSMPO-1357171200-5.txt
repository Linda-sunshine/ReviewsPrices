review/summary: Great brewer so farreview/text: I really like it. This was my first day using it and I drank two cups. I had 1 technical error though. The brewer wouldn't start. I found that I had to re-open the k-cup hatch and close it again. The second thing I would mention is the temperature changing. It is not something very useful as you only can change the temperature by 5 or 8 degrees. Though the coffee always comes quick and hot! which is a plus. 3rd thing is that the brewer is very quite. It does make some weird ticking and hissing noises but not that much. I also like how I can make 1 cup at a time. Though the cups are small and I need to use multiple k-cups. 4th thing I would also like to mention is the price of the k-cups. They aren't the cheapest things. Each k-cup cost around $0.75 each and I am using two of them. Though I guess it is a small trade for quick coffee in the morning. 5th The coffee is pretty good. I tried two of them which were Grove Square medium roast which interestingly was just instant coffee in a k-cup... And Green Mountain.I will definitely be looking to do business with keurig in the future.
