review/summary: Ideal for single coffee drinkers.review/text: I've owned this product for 8 months now and use it daily.Ideal for single coffee drinker - If you're single or if the spouse doesn't drink coffee, this is an ideal way to serve one cup, especially on the go, with little clean-up required. I have mine close to the sink so I can refill the reservoir from the spray hose and there couldn't be an easier way to get coffee.My complaints - There are 5 cup sizes but only one serving size of coffee. That means if you have a 16 oz. travel mug you bring to work every day (like me) that your coffee isn't going to be very strong. Rather than a small 2 oz. cup, which NOBODY drinks, they should make cups that range from 8 oz. to 20 oz. and increase the amount/strength of coffee in the serving container.Useful hint - I love Dunkin' Donuts coffee, but their K-cup product is expensive so to save a bit I bought theEkobrew Cup, Refillable Cup for Keurig K-cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Countand a big bag of loose Dunkin' Dunotus coffee at Costco.
