review/summary: SO MUCH POPCORN!review/text: We used to pop our popcorn in a brown paper bag in the microwave. After the microwave died, I decided we needed a proper corn popper. This thing is amazing! It pops MORE popcorn in LESS time. Sure, it's noisy, but it's a small price to pay for a delicious treat.
