review/summary: Great product - love that it is made in the USA!review/text: I was looking for an electric griddle made in the USA that was NOT non-stick. I could not find one and came upon this product during my search so I purchased it. It comes pre-seasoned, which saves time. You literally open the box, wash it in warm, non-soapy water, dry it completely and you are ready to go. I've used this product several times over the past month on both the griddle side and the grill side. The reason that I gave it four stars instead of five is because the center does not get as warm as the right and left sides which are directly over the burners. When I cooked pancakes, the ones in the center were not cooking as fast as the ones to either side. However, the advantage I found was that I actually like this middle section that is less hot when cooking. It is a built in food &#34;warmer.&#34; When the pancakes were finished, I moved them to the middle to keep warm until the entire batch was done. So for me, this was not a negative. I would highly recommend this product and company. I had a question before I used the product, I called the company and was immediately put through to a &#34;live&#34; person who was more than happy to answer my questions.
