review/summary: Fabulous tool that you didn't know you needed!review/text: I just used it for the first time today. It seems quite sturdy. I made zucchini noodles to use in soup. What a kick! I can see using it for lots of different types of vegetables. I would like to use cucumbers next, then jicama, which I hate to slice. Easy to use and clean. Very hygienic, hard plastic. No problems - FUN!
