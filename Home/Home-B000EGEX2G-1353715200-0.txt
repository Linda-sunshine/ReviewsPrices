review/summary: Good Quality for the Pricereview/text: My son is eight months old and not only did my mother used this Glider and Ottoman to rock him to sleep, I have nursed him in it. I am not a light person I am overweight (fat) and it kept sturdy as well as easy to clean. Great for a small apartment or nursery. I recommend it if you are on a budget.
