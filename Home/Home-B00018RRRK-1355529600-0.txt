review/summary: Good Grinder for the price pointreview/text: I Have had this grinder for about a year, and here is how I use it. First off, I primarily use my grinder on its finest setting as I use a Melitta cup top coffee hopper with #2 cone filters. Their cheap and make a good cup of coffee. Yes there is always dust that statically clings to the collection hopper due to the acrylic material. I simply fill my cone over the sink and wash the "dust" down the sink. Do I lose some coffee? sure I do. But it is a very small amount. Cleaning the chute is a breeze using a toothpick before I grind. I find that I have to do this about once a week. I just tilt the machine back slightly, clean the chute and slide the hopper back into place (while I still have it tilted back) to catch the residue and it makes no mess. I also find that no matter which setting I have it on, there is a certain amount of dust. On the occasions that I use it to make a pot of drip when we are having guests over; I set it on a medium grind and it does the trick perfectly. The coarser the grind, the lesser dust the machine makes. Again, you must consider the price point of this machine. I have yet to have any bogging problems that I have read about in some of the other reviews and I have never removed the bean hopper to clean it? All in all, I think this machine is hard to beat for the price point.
