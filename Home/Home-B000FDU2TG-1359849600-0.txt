review/summary: Great smoothies but disappointed it leaksreview/text: I saw other reviews saying the jar leaks, but one review said the leak issue was w/ the glass jar model, not the polycarbonate jar model...not true. We make a lot of kale smoothies and I was very pleased with how fine the kale was liquified. Ice and frozen fruit crushing ability was good too. But it seems when running on high speeds, the underside of the jar leaks. It doesn't leak excessively (yet), so I feel the blender is still usable. It just makes it a little messy to clean. Having known this beforehand, I probably would have tried the ninja.
