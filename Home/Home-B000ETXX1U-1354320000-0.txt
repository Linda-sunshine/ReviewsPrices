review/summary: Not worth it.review/text: The wife and I relocated to New Mexico and couldn't afford to bring our furniture with us. I saw great reviews on this air bed and ordered it. NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!! It loses air every night and we have to re-inflate it. It came with a pinprick hole in the right side and I used the two patches included...had to cover those with duct tape. Go to Wal-Mart or Target and try the one made by Coleman. This isn't worth it.
