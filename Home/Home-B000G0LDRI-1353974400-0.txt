review/summary: Poorly designedreview/text: In my opinion. This is a miserably designed product. (It burns me up to think somewhere some Honeywell executive is making more many in a year than I will in a lifetime for approving a product like this.)1. The plastic around the fan housing unit is very thin and cheap and rattles very very loudly. (If you gently press your hand on top of it you can get it to stop.)2. The fan output vents wrap all the way around the fan housing including just above the electrical plug. The buyer will logically place the unit with the electrical plug against the wall (who'd want this big thing sticking out perpendicular to the wall - with the electrical cord running alongside). So if you put this against the wall, as any logical person would do, half of the fan power is blowing straight into the wall instead of out into the room. The manual says that you should keep the unit 6 inches from the wall and turn off the unit if the wall or surroundings become damp. Very stupid!3. And this astounds me. Why can't a single humidifier manufacturer (I don't think there are many) design a water container that you can stand upside down while you fill it. What do they think we're supposed to do? It just seems so logical to me that if you have to fill the unit from the bottom, put a flat top on the thing so that you can stand it upright while filling it. Why can't anyone figure that out?Sorry Amazon. I always feel like such an idiot when I have to return a product, but this is coming back to you.
