review/summary: Could Be Sharperreview/text: These could be sharper, but for the price it's okay. These knives will still get the job done, personally I really like using the scissors. I use it a lot to cut up hot dogs since it's faster than using a knife for me.Also, in less than a month they are already starting to get rust spots on them from where they get wet. So try your hardest to keep them dry!
