review/summary: KitchenAid KP26M1XWH Professional 600 Series 6-Quart Stand Mixer..review/text: This is my 3rd Kitchen Aid. I started with a K4B. It wore out after 20 years of making bread and cookies for my family of 9. I purchased a K 5 quart and used it from 1972 until 2010. Next I went for the big one. It seems too big but works fine.
