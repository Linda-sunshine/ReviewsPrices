review/summary: Awesomereview/text: It doesn't take up the whole counter which is good cause I have a very small kitchen. It juices super quick and seems to be pretty efficeient about it, looking at the blades and the filter I wonder how well it will do a year from now with heavy use. For the 99 bucks I spent for it its a great deal. Easy to clean up and super fun. Can't wait to create more concoctions.
