review/summary: Not Recommendedreview/text: There is a major design flaw in that the vacuum exhausts extremely powerfully directly in front of the machine. The exhaust was strong enough to blow papers off a counter and blow down a calendar. It has terrific suction but this design flaw makes it unacceptable to me.
