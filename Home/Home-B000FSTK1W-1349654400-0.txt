review/summary: Doesn't work and I was injured installing itreview/text: I have a rental and thought this would be a great solution to the annoying task of nail filling if I ever move out of this property. I followed the directions to the letter and installed the caddy on the wall near the shower. The first time I put anything in it (a bottle of shampoo), the caddy hit the ground, taking the gloss wall paint with hit. I tried again, assuming I had not let the strips sit long enough. In order to do this I needed to remove the caddy from its mount. This was easier said than done. In trying to release the caddy from the plastic mounting brackets, the bracket clip slipped and took several layers of skin off of my thumb, which is still not healed over a week later. In spite of the pain from the rediculous injury, I continued the install, leaving the mounts on over two hours this time. I placed the rack and again inserted a bottle of shampoo. This time the caddy hit the ground taking the sheetrock with it! My effort to avoid a simple nail hole fill resulted in the even more involved job of sheetrock replacement that I now look forward to upon move-out. I ended up nailing the damn thing to the wall after all because the mount broke when it hit the floor and, frankly, I was so frustrated, the thought of going through the hassle of returning it or going out to buy something else was too much. The 3M products do not work on gloss paint in the southern climate.
