review/summary: don't buyreview/text: Juicer worked great for 5-6 months and then suddenly it started smoking in the middle of juicing carrots and apple. I took it apart and the center piece that holds the blade gadget just melted. It is irreplaceable and we had to go out and buy another juicer. It just doesn't hold up.
