review/summary: Four 1/2 starsreview/text: This air purifier is wonderful ... only slight negative is that it is quite noisy when on highest setting. Its a life saver with three cats and two dogs and household members that have allergies and asthma.Various members of our extended family are allergic to cats and usually suffer when they attend holidays at my house....however this year after purchasing two air purifier (one for upstairs bedrooms and the other for living room) - no one had any reactions to allergies!!!
