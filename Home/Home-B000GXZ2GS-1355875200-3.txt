review/summary: Didn't perform as expected.review/text: I bough this with the anticipation that it would make great single serve cups of coffee. Despite following all the troubleshooting suggestions, the water quickly drained (did not even need to apply pressure to the device) and left me with weak coffee. I tried doubling the filter, and even adding more grounds, but was not satisfied with the item. Perhaps I got a defective unit? I returned it, got a Keurig single server, and am pleasantly happy.
