review/summary: So great, I bought two!review/text: I got one set of these several months back and loved them so much that, when they showed up in the gold box again, I snagged another set right away. I love glass storage, because it doesn't retain odors or stains and won't leach chemicals into our food. I have put both dish and lids in the dishwasher and have had no issues with warping. These are excellent food storage containers.
