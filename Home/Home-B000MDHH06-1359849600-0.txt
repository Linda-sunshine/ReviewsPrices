review/summary: Best Juicer Ever!review/text: I've owned the original Jack LeLane juicer (the original and one of the new, low quality ones) and this Juicer performs above and beyond both of them. The central design to the filter is great! The juice extracts through the filter and the pulp gets thrown to the outside edges rather to one side. The juice is extracted very fast. This design provided pulp that was less wet than any juicer I've had. The dispenser is designed to insert into the cup and keeps the mess/splatter to zero. It's perfect.
