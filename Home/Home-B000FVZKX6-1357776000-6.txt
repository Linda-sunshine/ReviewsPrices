review/summary: I love themreview/text: I have to tell you I was pleasantly surprised. I guess I've had a few sets of flannal sheets over the years I've justbought at stores without thinking much about them. I read a few reviews online when I was shopping around a fewweeks back for a new set and came upon these and thought I'd give them a try. They were $25 or so more than whatI could have gotten in the stores but I feel, now that I have them, they are worth the difference in price. They feellike a good quality flannel and are nice and toasty warm. I really like them and would recommend them to a friend.I've washed them about 4 times already and they don't pill and come out of the dryer just as soft. Over time, thatmay change, but for now I am very pleased and feel I'm going to get my money's worth out of them for years to come.Give them a try.
