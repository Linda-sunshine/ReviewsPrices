review/summary: Scary sharp, super fast.review/text: I use this thing almost everyday for the past 6+ months. Think about how long it takes you to chop an onion 4" in diameter. 3 mins? Maybe 2? Now, how many tears? Buckets, right? And the slices or the pieces are never perfect either right? Now with this slicer, 4 seconds. Period. And no tears. Perfect slices every time. It took me awhile to get used to it because it is very, VERY sharp and I had never used a mandoline slicer. Be sure to ALWAYS use the holder or there will be a hospital visit in your future. Once you get the hang of it, you will use it every chance you get. Oh, and it's dish washer safe. I e-mailed the company to double check prior to purchase. It took 6 hrs for them to get back to me, but it took me 2 days to realize they responded. lol. Great buy.
