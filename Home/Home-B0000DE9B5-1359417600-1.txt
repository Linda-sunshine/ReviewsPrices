review/summary: Other reviews confusing - this is a great pitcher.review/text: When I purchased this I read the reviews. It was confusing to me if the lid sealed or not. The answer it - it does. The only issue is that people seem to not understand how to use it. It is very simple. There is an outside ring and and inside ring. You turn the inside ring to seal the outside ring. If you do this it works perfectly every time. So the lid is a non-issue.I got this pitcher because I wanted a glass pitcher that was stable enough to transport liquids in the car between my office and my house. This pitcher has a very stable base. It is basically as wide as it is tall. Very stable. No issues.I primarily use it for tea so I wanted glass and not plastic. It is glass.The handle is perfect for what it is intended to do.So this is the bottom line - this is perfect pitcher if the visual design works for you. It is short and squat and not tall and narrow. Once you understand that - then go for it !
