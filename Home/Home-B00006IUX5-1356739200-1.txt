review/summary: disappointingreview/text: I purchased this to blend my own cosmetics. The first time I used it, I felt like I kept having to put more and more ingredients in to get the color right. Finally I dumped everything out, only to realize that the majority of the powder had somehow gotten INSIDE the body of the grinder. When I shook it, powder came pouring out of the hole where the retractable cord enters the grinder. More than half of the product I used ended up inside the grinder rather than in the top where it should have stayed. I only used it once, and now it's completely useless because it's full of powder.I can't imagine that it would be quite as worthless for just grinding coffee or herbs, but my guess is that no matter what you put in it, a portion of it is going to end up inside the machine. This is by far the most disappointing purchase I've made on amazon.com so far.
