review/summary: Quick and easyreview/text: Amazing product ... we used to used Indian made prestige cooker but this one is actually well built and cooks faster that those cookers. Initially i have to agree i did not like it as it does not blow whistle every so often ( As an indian i am calibrated from childhood to hear that and rice was 3 whisles, Daal was 5 whistles etc..). We actually thought of returning this as it does not blow and i constantly hissing, we thought something was wrong. Anyways now we absolutely love this product and is less expensive than prestige cookers. My prestige cooker which i bought in india stainless steel, actualy melted out the bottom and aluminum in between the inner wall where we place the food inside the cooker and the outer steel plate whihc sits on the stove oozed out. When my wife realised its melting she took it and kept in the sink for it to cool down and the steel place is set now at an offset, making it useless.
