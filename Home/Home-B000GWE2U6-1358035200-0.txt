review/summary: Cute, but it leaks!review/text: Of course all the humidifiers in this line are adorable, and when they function properly, they are very effective. However what I've found with this elephant humidifier is that a small stream of water leaks out of the bottom of the nose and down the front of the unit, right into the dial, or onto my table. I tried sealing it and stuffing a tissue up into the nose, but nothing is working. Looks like my next fix is a new humidifier. This item is way too expensive for me to be waking up to a puddle of water on my table. It is absolutely not worth the hassle or the water stains.
