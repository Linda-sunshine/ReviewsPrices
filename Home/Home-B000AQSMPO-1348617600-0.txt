review/summary: Broke Quickly... and produced rancid drinksreview/text: The machine worked great for a few months, but then the unit starting smelling and any drink we made tasted rancid. I tried to descale it hoping that would work. I cleaned it from top to bottom, but our drinks still tasted awful. We didn't use the machine that much, maybe every few weeks, so it's a problem that it broke down so quickly--especially given the price. I'm hopeful that it was just our machine. I haven't read the other reviews to see if this is a common problem.
