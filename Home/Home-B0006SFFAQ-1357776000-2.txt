review/summary: The best coffee makerreview/text: This is the best coffee maker that I ever bought. I had an older model for years and it finally died. I had a old Mr. coffee in the store room and I thought never mind spending the extra money for a new one so I used that one for a few months. I could not stand the coffee that it made so I waited till cyber monday and I ordered my new Cuisinart. I made a pot as soon as it was delivered and the difference in what I had been drinking was amazing. It makes excellent coffe and first thing in the morning that matters! It is fast, the coffee is hot and smooth and smells wonderful.
