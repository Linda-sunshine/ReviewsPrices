review/summary: MY NEW BEST FRIEND.review/text: I just made spaghetti without guilt. THIS IS A MUST IF YOUR ON A DIET. I can wait to try other things with it. I boiled my zucchini for about 30 sec after I spiraled it, I like al dente. Im hooked. I ate two large zucchinis and I would never do that until now. IM IN LOVE. HEHEHEHE
