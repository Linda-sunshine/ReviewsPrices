review/summary: Bunn coffee brewerreview/text: I have purchsed this item several times before and very much like how it works. BUNN is a well known name in quality coffee makers - when I worked in hospital food service, BUNN was the only product we would use. The home version is fast - lasts 4-5 years before heating element goes out. Only concern is that it is quite LOUD when reheating/maintaining water temp.I'll buy the same product next time as well.
