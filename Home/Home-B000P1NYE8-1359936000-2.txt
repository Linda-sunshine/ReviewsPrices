review/summary: Good Small Scale, especially for the pricereview/text: This small scale (emphasis on small) was purchased to weigh pine wood derby cars and parts. I knew the dimensions of the unit before I bought it so I have no grounds to complain about it being too small to accomplish this. You can easily overcome this by zeroing out the scale with a small fixture to hold the cars in place (or any other object). I checked its repeatability with another scale and it tracked very well. The display is a nicely lit screen. It does not retain units being used in its memory and defaults to grams everytime it is tunred off and on. Again a minor inconvience for me. If you take into account the low price and the accuracy you get, this is a goof purchase.I would recommend this scale to someone needing a small scale for occaasional use.
