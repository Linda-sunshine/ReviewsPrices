review/summary: fast, easy to use, easy to cleanreview/text: I purchased this as I have begun juicing and using my blender and paint strainers (although better than cheesecloth) was time consuming and messy. I figured I would get some use of it, so I on a whim purchased it and can't be happier. I more or less bunch my ingredients in a bag the night before so I'm not hunting in the am, and all I need to is to core the apple and start putting spinach, celery, carrots, beets (cut the evening before), and other veggies in a bag. I wake up, put them in and out comes the juice. I let the machine run for a minute after to let the juice totally come out. I've taken the pulp and re-introduced it from to the machine, but it's pretty dry the first time around so I would say it's extremely efficient for the time I've saved. Now I just need to find a use for the pulp since it's rather dry (when it was wet b/c I couldn't strain it enough I would force eat but not the case now and I don't want to by a dehydrator to make crackers). Excellent machine, easy to clean with the spatula/brush combo and dishwasher safe. Eventually I would love to buy a double auger (sp?) juicer, but for now, this is perfect.
