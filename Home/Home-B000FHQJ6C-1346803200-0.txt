review/summary: Awesome!review/text: This juicer has been great. I bought it about a month ago and have used it almost everyday. The juice is great and it seems to get a lot of juice out of the fruit. For example two apples filled a large glass with juice. I am very pleased with this juicer.Others have said that the pulp is a little wet. I have never juiced before so I don't have anything to compare it to but the pulp is pretty dry. It is never oozing juice still. It may be a little damp but unless you want to spend $300 on a juicer that is not a centrifugal juicer then I believe you will not get the pulp any dryer than this.
