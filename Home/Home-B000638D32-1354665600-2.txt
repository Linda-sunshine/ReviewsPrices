review/summary: Great knifereview/text: Like this knife a lot. No major complaints. Doesn't slice through some harder-skin things (like older lemons) like I might have expected, but that could very well be my inexperience. I'm not a chef, just a hobbyist cook, and bought this on recommendation of Cook's Illustrated etc. Very pleased with it.
