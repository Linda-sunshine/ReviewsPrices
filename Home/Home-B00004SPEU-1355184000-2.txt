review/summary: Nice coffee grinderreview/text: I'm happy with my purchase so far. I've had it for a couple months now and have had no issues with it. It creates a nice fine grind if you keep it running. Just stop a little earlier to have a little more course grind. I clean it out with a brush and then wipe it down with a damp paper towel. I haven't used it for spices, just coffee.
