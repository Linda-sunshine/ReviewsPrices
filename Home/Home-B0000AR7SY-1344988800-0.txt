review/summary: Solid performer with consistent resultsreview/text: Easy to use and clean. Plug it in, select grind, pour beans, turn knob to appropriate grind amount, watch the grinder go to work. There are lots of settings and it does the job.Pros1) Good value for the price2) Consistent3) Feels heavy duty (referencing the stainless steel model)Cons1) The knob to engage the grinder is not the most exact. It has a little play which makes it more difficult to grind an exact amount. It is also plastic.2) The plastic for the bean holder and grind hopper is not the highest quality. The wrong drop and it'll crack. I'm pretty careful so this isn't a huge issue - but I did recently replace the bean holder because of a slip while cleaning.
