review/summary: Cheapens the Cuisinart Name (but is functional). "Chrome" is plastic!review/text: This product is functional so no complaints about it working, however, it is so cheap it doesn't line up with what I have come to know and expect from Cuisinart. The "brushed chrome" is plastic, as it the canister itself. I use it, but keep it hidden under the counter when not in use as it isn't worthy of being on display among its classy counterparts. Tsk, tsk, Cuisinart!
