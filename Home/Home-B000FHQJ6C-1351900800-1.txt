review/summary: Lasted just past the 30-day return windowreview/text: This model may have a powerful motor, but that motor is attached to a piece of plastic where the strainer spins. The metal-to-plastic connection at the point where all the force is meeting all the resistance is a fatal design flaw. Having to buy a second juicer in 45 days while my boyfriend is fighting cancer was a financial hardship and super irritating because the design flaw is so obvious. It's like they WANT it to break. Upgraded to a Breville, which has a metal-to-metal connection at the same point. Also, the pulp from the Breville is much drier and we get at least 30% more juice. So, I guess ultimately it is good it broke, as we are now getting 30% more from our produce spending. Yay, Breville! Booooo, Hamilton Beach.
