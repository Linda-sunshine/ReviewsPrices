review/summary: Just for a change in coffee makingreview/text: I've always used the drip coffee makers since Mr Coffee came out and decided to switch to the percolator when I began staying at mom's during holidays and her illness's. She would always have her coffee percking by the time she'd wake us up for school when we were kids. Now, she uses instant coffee, so I bought the percolator to use at her place and it took a few try's, but I caught on and I perk a great cup of coffee at her house. The spring threw me off but trial and error is what it takes to get things right!
