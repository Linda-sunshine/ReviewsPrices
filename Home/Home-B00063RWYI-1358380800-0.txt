review/summary: The BEST - USA MADE! Can use with Induction Cooktops!review/text: These Lodge items are made right here in Tennessee - great stuff. I particularly appreciated when they came out with these preseasoned varieties and have a lot of them. You really cannot get fried chicken to taste "right" unless it's cooked in Lodge cast iron! SO wonderful! This one, I have used to pieces, and have made everything from cobblers to sweet potatoes and well, fried chicken in it. It goes on my induction cooktop with great ease (use a paper towel, however, to prevent scratching), and inside the oven to bake whatever goodie you can imagine. If you've never used cast iron, just be sure you hand wash it after using, don't use tomatoes in it (makes it takes like metal because of the chemical reaction between the acid in the tomatoes and the iron itself), and dry it immediately. DO NOT let it sit with water in it and soak - the bottom will rust and and well, you'll have to get out a sander to buff it off. If you take good care of these pans, they'll last you more than a lifetime and you'll be passing them down to future generations.Season after cleaning and you'll be the best cook in town! Highly, highly recommend!
