review/summary: Makes a GREAT wedding present!review/text: I'm not going to repeat what's already been said 100x about cast iron. I love the cooking properties, I love know that I'll be able to give this pan to my kids some day, and I love that I can sear the ever-lovin' crap out of my food without worrying about its coating leavign weird carcinogens as it flakes off into my steak (or tofu, or zucchini, or pancakes, or hashbrowns, etc).This is a steal of a deal, considering how long it will last you. I often give these (after I've pre-seasoned them to perfection) as wedding gifts to my friends who don't own a pan yet.Things to note:1.) These are heavy! Not a light something that grandma is going to be slinging stir-fry in. These are thick and thus have some heft to them.2.) It's going to cook terribly at first- as you probably know from reading other reviews, you're going to need to give your cast iron some love before it cooks as great as we are saying. Not for the impatient.3.) This size is, in my opinion, the perfect size. I lamented for a while about which size to buy (I ultimately also bought the smaller size so I can cook two things at once), and if you are going to only buy one- this is it. Small enough to cook for one or two people, but large enough to do hashbrowns for an entire family.
