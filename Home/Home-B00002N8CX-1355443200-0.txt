review/summary: vacuum ratingreview/text: We had a Mighty Mite for thirty years. When it broke down I jumped to buy this product. It does work, but all aspects of this unit are inferior to the original Mighty Might. It was such a blessing in terms of quality. Also, I purchased it for $14.00 when TG&Y; was going out of business in the community we lived in.This product does work, Eureka had set a high standard.
