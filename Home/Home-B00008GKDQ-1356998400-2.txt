review/summary: Lodge Grill/Griddlereview/text: Love this griddle. It is very heavy, so have to be careful taking out of cubard. I use now for my swedish meatballs and it works out great on the griddle side and same with my swedish pancakes....I just wonder what took me so long to use this instead of fry pans!!! cooking goes much quicker on this!!! Love it!!! So easy to clean up!!!!
