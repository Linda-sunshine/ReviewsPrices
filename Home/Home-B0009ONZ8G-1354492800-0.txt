review/summary: Great Vacuumreview/text: I purchased this vacuum five years ago and it has been great-still going strong. I've used it on hardwood floors and carpet and it picks up everything. Although not advertised as a pet hair vacuum, it works well cleaning cat hair out of crevices and corners.
