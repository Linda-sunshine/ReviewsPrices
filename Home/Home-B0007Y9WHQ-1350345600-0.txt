review/summary: Best tool ever!review/text: I had a hand tool that made the noodle shapes with veggies but it took me 15 minutes to do 2 zucchini. I am vegan and I need to have convenience so I bought this tool hoping it would save me time and it did! I can make a full bowl of zucchini noodles in 2 minutes and they are perfect with very little waste. It's easy to clean and small enoght to store. I just bought another one for my brother for his birthday.
