review/summary: Amazingly soft and comfortable at the same timereview/text: This product is a no brainer if you are having trouble sleeping or, like me, purchased a cheap memory foam mattress that isn't quite up to par. I bought a california king memory mattress from amazon (cost about $260), because of the way my house is situated I can not get a regular cali king mattress into my room. Biggest I can get is a full size. The memory foam ones come in a box that one person can move, so it was a logical move.The mattress was ok, firmer than I thought but there were days my back was sore when I woke up. After a month or two my girlfriend says "My back has been hurting in the morning" so I immediately looked for a true memory foam toppper to compliment the mattress, and this is the one. I have never slept better than I have since I received this.I shuffle around less, and always feel better in the morning than I did before the topper was added. As other reviewers have said, especially with the Cali king size, it is like sleeping on a big cloud. BIG is accurate, as my girlfriend is basically in another zip code when it's time to "actually" go to sleep and not just laying in bed talking.We have both noticed an immense difference for the better, and though some on here said it gets too hot, neither of us have felt an issue with heat, and I especially since I don't even use blankets and prefer it to be cool at night. If I'm not overheating, than most people shouldn't have much of an issue.As with all these types of products, it did have a chemical smell for a day or two but no more than that. Great product, definitely pick this up if you want a better sleeping experience.
