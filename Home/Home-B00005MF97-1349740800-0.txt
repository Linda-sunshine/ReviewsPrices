review/summary: Worked for a Yearreview/text: I purchased this August 2011, for use grinding food for my father-in-law who has trouble swallowing. Worked perfectly, at first, but, after a year, the motor has stopped completely. I am highly disappointed, but I am giving Black&Decker another chance. I purchased their Ergo 3-cup chopper. I hope this one works better.
