review/summary: Great Pan!review/text: I have used this pan for 3 years now and love it. It gets used every day and gets better with use. It also does not have the teflon coating of nonstick pans which is not healthy to ingest. The classic cast iron is just as good as nonstick and will last forever. The only negative is that the pan is heavy, but that is to be expected.
