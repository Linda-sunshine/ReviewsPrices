review/summary: 190-Gram Flannel Sheetsreview/text: This is a good quality flannel sheet set at a fair price. I've washed and used them several times and I'm very pleased with their performance. They are comfortable and have not pilled. Flannel is the only type sheet I use so I'm pretty picky. I would recommend this set to anyone who wants good flannel but doesn't want to spend alot.Updated 2/4/13I've purchased two additional sets of these sheets, Smokey blue and graphite. All sets are as comfortable as ever and they still have not pilled. I plan to buy one more set. Love the rich colors.
