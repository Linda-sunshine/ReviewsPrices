review/summary: I may have return this item back to Amazon again.review/text: I currently have the second order from Amazon, due to the following:- There is no steam coming out, even without the portafilter in place, nothing but ~100C water drips down. it seems more drip coffee.- When portafilter is removed (after espresso has been made), beans are really muddy. I've owned other espresso machine before, but never seen anything messier.- The "OK" green lights ON time is very inconsistent.- It vibrates pretty bad, where I had to hold the cup the entire time when dripping.If anyone has any fixes for these issues, please leave me comment.
