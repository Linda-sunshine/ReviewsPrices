review/summary: Great Juicerreview/text: Couple weeks back , i saw this movie in Netflix . I must say this is one of the most inspiring movie i saw.This movie is about Joe Cross who is around 300lb and wants to regain his health , by drinking Juices and Light exercise.In this movie he travelled to US and met Phil who is 400lbs and Phil joins Joe , both continue their journey (Juice and Light weight exercises ) and in the end of the movie when you will see Phil - you will be shocked.Also after i got inspired from the movie i got my self Breville 800JEXL Juice Fountain Elite 1000-Watt Juice Extractor from Bed Bath and Beyond. I got a 20% discount coupon. Though the coupon might say the Breville items and excluded. But the store gave me 20% discount.i got it for 240$.I must say , i have used apple ,oranges , lime , ginger , kale ,beetroot, swiss collard , cucumber, pear ,watermelon , so far no problem the juice comes very good.Ofcourse my food bill has gone high. But i think it's a better investment. My son 2 and hal year old initially never liked juice . but gradually he now started liking it .
