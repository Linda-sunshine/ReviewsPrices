review/summary: THE BEST COFFEE MAKERreview/text: After trying many different brewing systems, this is the only one I use every day. It just makes a great cup without the bitter aftertaste, etc and allows an average grade of coffee taste like the best preminum brand. The only negatives are the limited ability to made more than two cups, and it does require a greater amount of coffee to make a cup- about double of a normal drip brew coffee maker.
