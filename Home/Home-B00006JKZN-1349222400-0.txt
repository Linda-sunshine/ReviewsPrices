review/summary: Poor quality control for Cuisinartreview/text: I cannot comment on how well this waffle maker might work because I never plugged it in. The temperature control slider was very loose. It might be a poor quality component or it might be that it is not properly fastened inside the unit. If it is a poor quality component it probably won't last long. If it isn't properly fastened there is an electric shock danger. Either way, I sent it back.
