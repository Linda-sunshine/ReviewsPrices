review/summary: Weak Blowerreview/text: As a vacuum this product is ok. I use it effectively on my car carpeting. I purchased it, however, to use the blower function, so I could "blow out" the water in my swimming pool lines. It's much to weak to accomplish this. I had previously used a similar sized Dirt Devil....that effectively did the job.
