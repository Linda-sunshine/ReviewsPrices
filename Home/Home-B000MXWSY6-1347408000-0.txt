review/summary: One of the best clock radios I've ever ownedreview/text: It's hard to find good clock radios, in my opinion, and this is one of the better ones. It has two alarms that can be set independently to wake you up with either the radio or a "buzzer". The buzzer is really more of a beeping noise, and I've found that it wakes me up without totally jolting me awake. The numbers are really big, so I can also see it across my room. The is a button for Daylight Savings Time (useful so you don't have to set the clock every time it changes) and you can even set the time zone you are in, if you happen to know the number.The only issue I've had with it is that the radio gives me a lot of static when I'm at school (in the city). When I go home to the suburbs, it works perfectly fine for me, so I'm fairly sure it isn't the clocks fault. Maybe there is too much interference.The speaker is decent, although definitely not the best that I've heard. For the price though, I think it is a very good clock radio.
