review/summary: I Love This Juicerreview/text: Best juicer i have ever owned. I love using my juice fountain elite.I make my juice and then clean up. All done in twenty minutes top. Using the bag to catch the pulp was a great tip. I don't normally eat a whole lot of fruits and vegetables. But i enjoy drinking them. This juicer will save me so much money. No more buying my juice in the street. My 4 year old is also enjoying this purchase. I got him drinking greens and carrots with apples. My last juicer sat on the shelf collecting dust. It was to slow. Hard to clean. It was a work out in its self to use. With my juice fountain i have great juice with ease. I plan to use this for a very long time. I don't mind the sound of the motor.Breville is quality.I just got the Breville die-cast hemisphere blender 800blxl/b christmas eve. Booth look great with my stainless steel appliances in the kitchen. I recommend this juicer for everyone. This was a great purchase.
