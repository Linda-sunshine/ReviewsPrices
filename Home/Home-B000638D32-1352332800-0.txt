review/summary: Best knife I ownreview/text: I bought this knife because I had a Swiss army knife by Victorinox that I bought 22 years ago. It has withstood all kinds of abuse and the blades are still wickedly sharp. Now that I am doing the cooking at home I decided to take a chance on their Chef's knife. I absolutely LOVE it! It is worth much more than what I paid for it and it has held up to everything I've put it to. This is a wonderful knife!
