review/summary: not happyreview/text: Bought this brand after previous kettle brand failed too quickly. In the past have used a kettle all day long, every day. Well, this Aroma kettle began leaking after about 3 months, too late to return. Eventually am finding corrosion marks all around the base. With a circle of water around the kettle after heating cycle, am not happy with the contact clean up. Not sure it is safe. Am expecting the element will wear out prematurely. Separately, with the narrow opening, it is hard to clean. Not a good choice for me.
