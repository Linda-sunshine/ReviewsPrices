review/summary: A terrific productreview/text: I didn't want to pay $100+ dollars for a Keurig coffee maker. This little coffee maker does a wonderful job and I don't have to pay for those expensive little coffee things. I just put a little coffee in the filter that comes with the coffee maker and push a button. It even turns itself off after it has made my coffee. The filter even goes in the dishwasher. It can't be beaten given that it cost less than $20.
