review/summary: Good Prodectreview/text: Got this as a Xmas gift, my daughter got this as a gift. The wine Oster Rechargeable and Cordless Wine Opener with Chiller was good invest, as my daughter would say. I built a liquor bar in the basement, AKA the &#8220;MAN CAVE.&#8221; When I bought my wine from whole foods, I opened the bottle with this and it works perfectly after 7 bottles opened.
