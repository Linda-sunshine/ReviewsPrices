review/summary: lots of bang for the buckreview/text: great old school skillet..heavy and even heat. After a few uses it seasons n cleans easily. Just gotta wipe dry and put a sm bit of oil on before storing or there will be rust spots. Wish I had a horse n saddle to hang it off for a long ride Duke style.
