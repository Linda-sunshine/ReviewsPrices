review/summary: Awesome lil' powerhousereview/text: This thing does an awesome job - much better than the upright Dirt Devil we'd had for the past few years. It's super powerful for its size and compact enough to be tucked away in a drawer. Sure, you have to be on your hands and knees to clean up an area rug and the like, but it's power and size are much greater benefits than its lack of an upright handle. Sweet vacuum.
