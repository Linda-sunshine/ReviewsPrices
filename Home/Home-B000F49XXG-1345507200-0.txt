review/summary: Lasted almost two yearsreview/text: I don't know what the average life span should be for $100 espresso makers, but I would have hoped for more than two years. However, it made pretty good espresso with the ESEs while it lasted. The thing is...if I buy a $300 model this time, will it last six years?
