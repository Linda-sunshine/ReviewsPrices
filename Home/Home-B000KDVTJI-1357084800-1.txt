review/summary: love this kettle!review/text: My husband was sure we wouldn't need one of these, but he's changed his tune and is thinking of getting one for his office! It boils water faster than a microwave, and looks good on the countertop. I grew up with electric kettles and missed having one around, especially in the winter. Plus during the power outages it's nice to have a cup of tea (if you have a generator) at home instead of waiting for a pot to boil on the bbq!
