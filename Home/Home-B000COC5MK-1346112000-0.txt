review/summary: Nice - but doesn't lastreview/text: I've bought two of these - both died after a few months of reasonable use (estimate 10 - 12 uses for each one). As far as ease and speed of use, I think the Oster is a big improvement over waiter and twist corkscrews but not any better overall than a good rabbit-style manual opener. If you already have a good rabbit-style manual opener, I don't think you're going to benefit much from buying one of these unless you like having electric devices cluttering your kitchen countertop (or wet bar).
