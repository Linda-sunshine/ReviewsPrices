review/summary: Works like expectedreview/text: I got two of these for my bathroom and bedroom. My bathroom has no ventilation and has started getting moldy and mildewy as a result. Now I just run one of these dehumidifiers and within an hour the air is dry, my towels are dry (HUGE bonus!) and so is the bath mat. I ended up giving the 2nd one to my neighbors for their unventilated bathroom. Since I keep this one on I haven't had an issue with my bedroom getting moist either so it's definitely worked for me. It collects quite a bit of water too.
