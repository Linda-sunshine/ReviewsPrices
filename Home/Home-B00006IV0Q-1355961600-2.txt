review/summary: Forget the dripreview/text: I got tired of pouring a cup of coffee from my drip coffee maker, adding the creamer and then having to stick the cup in the microwave to heat it back up because the creamer cooled it off too much. This Presto is great. The coffee comes out so much hotter than the drip maker that when I add creamer it's perfect. And the taste? You can't compare what this thing produces to a drip maker. It's REAL coffee. I was concerned about the amount of time it would take to brew a pot in this but it's very fast. I'm a happy camper and my old drip coffee maker fit perfectly in my trash can.
