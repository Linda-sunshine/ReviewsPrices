review/summary: Filters are actually NOT poor quality, although it might seem that way, quite the opposite!review/text: This water filtration system is great if you're on a budget -- it's very simple to put together, refill, easy to clean, and the water tastes just as advertised. I have found that I've saved a lot of money on buying water since owning one, and with a stainless steel water bottle, I am also avoiding ingesting many of the toxins found in plastic water bottles today. In fact, one of the main reasons I am writing this review is because I noticed a lot of people were concerned about the filter quality because trace amounts of charcoal were noted in the bottoms of containers after drinking.I was concerned about this myself, until I did some research into what function the particles actually serve... they're "activated charcoal/carbon" particles, which is different from regular charcoal. It's perfectly safe to digest, causes no known long/short term side effects, and is actually used for its "adsorbent" properties in medicine. Adsorbent being used (instead of absorbent) because harmful toxins found in the digestive tract can actually bind to the particles and be safely carried out. It can be used to treat diarrhea, food poisoning, nausea, vomiting, and a number of other problems. Brita gets their carbon from coconut shells, so essentially, this could be an overlook from the manufacturer... or an actual health benefit. I'm no doctor, but digesting trace amounts every day seems like it could lead to an overall healthier, better digestive tract.However, if you're uncomfortable seeing the charcoal bits, I have come to understand that this is because some people let the water level get below the actual filter (and it dries out.) Anytime you pour a glass, you should add more water to the reservoir so this does not happen.
