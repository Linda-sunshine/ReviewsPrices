review/summary: Best for the moneyreview/text: This waffle performs as it should. Nice evenly baked waffle. No fancy dials or switches. When it's plugged in it's on.You gage your dunish by the time left in. Suggestion use a small timer when you determine your liking and you're on your way to satisfaction.
