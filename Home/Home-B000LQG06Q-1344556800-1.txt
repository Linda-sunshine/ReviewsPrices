review/summary: Foam topperreview/text: I received this foam topper today. I ordered it for my daughter at college. I opened the packaging and it came to full size right away. It says it usually takes 24 hours, but not the case with the twin wize. And there is no smell. I'll be getting it to her at school this weekend and will get her review on how comfortable it is. But so far, so good.
