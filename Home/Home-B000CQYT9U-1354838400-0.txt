review/summary: Beautiful Giftreview/text: I bought this for our office manager. She does a lot of church work with kids and this just spoke to me. It's very well done and very well packaged and the picture does not quite do it justice.She works with kids because she feels sorry for them. She thinks they are going to have an unhappy life merely because they will not be able to afford to feed their dogs after paying all the money YOUR government spent on preventing Christmas.
