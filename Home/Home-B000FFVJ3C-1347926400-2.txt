review/summary: Very Pleasedreview/text: I decided to buy this dehydrator after reading the reviews for it and the Excalibur. I had planned on buying the Ecxalibur until I read about all the people who had had trouble with the fan. This one was much cheaper, and I figured I could deal with the inconvenience of no timer for a couple hundred dollars! I haven't missed the timer at all. I put in the food and take it out when it's done. If it goes a little longer it doesn't seem to matter. I've done apples, bananas, tomatoes, seeds and nuts and macaroons. I've used it almost non-stop for over a month now and I am very pleased with it.
