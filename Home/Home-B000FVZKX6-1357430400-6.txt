review/summary: Soft, warm, durablereview/text: When I first opened the sheet set, I was put off by the overwhelming smell of plastic (from the packing) and disappointed in the fit on my queen size bed. They seemed to be too big for my bed but after the first wash the fit was much tighter and the smell went away. These sheets are soft and will keep you warm all night! I can even turn the heat down when I go to bed because they keep me so warm during the night. Overall they are wonderful.
