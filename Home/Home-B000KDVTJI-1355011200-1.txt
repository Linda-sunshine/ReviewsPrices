review/summary: Attractive, Well Made & Slowreview/text: I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this kettle for my office. I've had a Utilitea at home for years which I love, but it's smallish and the plastic lid doesn't really open enough. I was afraid it wouldn't hold up to heavier, less careful use than I'm giving it at home. The Aroma is a perfect size for a large pot of tea, the lid opens fully, it's well made and has a nice high stainless steel polish. The only con is that it takes at least 6 minutes to boil two cups off cold water---something the Utilitea does in about half that time.
