review/summary: HAD GREAT POTENTIAL BUT DEFECTIVE!!review/text: I ordered this pan for my "cooking husband". We had seen it recommended by Cook's Illustrated; and, he had been wanting an oversized pan to use on top of the stove and in the oven, also. He didn't get past using it on top of the stove the first time.He put olive oil in the pan to fry some eggs and some eggplant, and the oil flowed completely to the edges of the inside of the pan. There was none left in the middle in which to fry anything. The pan was obviously defective with the "hump" others have described. I am such an optomist, I was sure the pan I would receive would be just perfect. Wrong!!! This is such a disappointment. The husband commented that it was a shame that a potentially great pan would have such a problem, as to render it useless.So back to Amazon it goes; and, I will begin looking for another great pan with a, hopefully, nice flat bottom.
