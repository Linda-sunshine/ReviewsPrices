review/summary: Waterbath info not completely correctreview/text: I have been canning for some time. Shame on me for not correctly reading the dimensions. And shame on the info provided by amazon and am can for being partially correct in there manual. I hoped to reduce the storage space in my home by purchasing this pressure cooker andgetting rid of the monster water bath pot. . I wanted to beable to do both...pressure and water bath process. This canner is NOT tall enough for water bath processing quart jars. You could do pints or smaller. I believe it is the 30 that can but don't hold me to it. I already forgot after realizing my mistake. I accepted my failure because I was too cheap to return the heavy thing. It seems to work fine though I am still getting accustomed to it. If I die from botulism, my bad.
