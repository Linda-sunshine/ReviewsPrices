review/summary: Best pan there is for the pricereview/text: Definitely the best cheap pan I've ever owned, period.We bought this about 4 years ago and it's still our favorite pan the non-stick finish seems just as good now as when we bought it. We never use metal utensils in it or put it in the dishwasher but we've done the same to our $200 calphalon pan but that one fell to pieces years ago.We've now started buying this pan to give as gifts (3 so far) because it's one item I know we can give away and not fall to pieces.The rubber handle gives it a cheap look and it's pretty light weight which gives it a cheap feel but I don't think you can do better anywhere for the price.Obviously, I'm not going to use this to sear a steak or hamburgers, I'd use cast iron to do that, but it is excellent for eggs, quesadillas, pancakes, or whatever is fried at a medium to low heat.It cleans very easily even if the food gets accidentally burnt onto it.
