review/summary: LOVE THIS COFFEE POT!review/text: I've been tempted to get a percolator for years, literally, and so after our Kitchenaid finally died (made the best coffee - SO sad!), I decided to give this guy a try. SO glad I did! If you've never had coffee made in anything other than plastic, buy one of these and see what your coffee is really supposed to taste like! It's super easy to use too - comes with filters and great directions. This takes no longer than a regular plastic coffee system, but brews it very hot, keeps it that way for as long as you'd like. Super easy to clean too, but not immersible. The cord is short to prohibit accidents and well, there's just nothing bad to say about this guy. SO,SO happy with this pot - my pumpkin spice coffee tastes so amazing in it that I can't wait to get up in the morning to brew a pot. Give this a try - believe me, you'll throw out that plastic coffee pot! HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend!
