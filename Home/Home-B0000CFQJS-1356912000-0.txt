review/summary: GUNK!review/text: I purchased 2 of these Mr. Coffee permanent filters as "stocking stuffers" to go with the same brand coffee makers for Christmas. I was tired of the paper filters occasionally collapsing, so I thought this might be a good alternative. I was wrong!When we started using these a few days ago, the coffee that brewed through them contained a thick sediment that collected at the bottom of the coffee decanters. This happened no matter which type of coffee that was brewed. The filters are not filtering this gunk out of the grounds and is instead depositing it in the coffee!
