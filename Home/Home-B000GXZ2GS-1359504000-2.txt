review/summary: It makes some tasty coffeereview/text: I'm not really a coffee drinker.. I enjoy coffee flavored drinks like the bottled Frappuccinos, but coffee was always too bitter and too acidic for me. I'd been purchasing a powdered ice coffee mix that was sugar free and fat free that was then discontinued and I was searching for a new way have iced coffee in the morning. I decided to get the AeroPress and with this I CAN make some tasty iced coffee. I tried a few different types and flavors of coffee because again, I'm a coffee novice. I discovered, which is probably not surprising, that I prefer the lightly roasted kinds. I'd make a good amount of the concentrated liquid on Sunday and keep it in the fridge to use throughout the week, which I'd mix with a full glass of milk and some truvia. Of course, you do go through a lot of coffee with this, and I wasn't a big fan of buying so much coffee. At some point I got too lazy to keep making it and I haven't used it in a while. I'd tried some coffee from a couple places, mixed with enough milk and truvia and I like the taste, but it always leaves me with an upset stomach!! The coffee from the AeroPress does NOT give me an upset stomach which is worth a lot of thanks from me! However, a friend of mine introduced me to Kava instant coffee, which is acid neutralized, and this also does not give me an upset stomach. It doesn't taste quite as good as the coffee I can make with my AeroPress, but it sits well and it's easy! I discovered that you can mix instant coffee in with cold milk. It dissolves well for the most part and is easy and tasty! But thinking about this... I might go out and buy some more coffee because it DID taste really good...
