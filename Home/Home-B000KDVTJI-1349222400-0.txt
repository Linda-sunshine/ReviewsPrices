review/summary: I own 2: 1 for work, 1 for home!review/text: I first got one of these as a christmas gift. I took it to work and it's been a part of our office kitchen nearly 2 years now. While it doesn't get heavy usage, we haven't had a single problem. No leaking and anything that other reviewers have mentioned. I liked it so much i bought one to have at home as well. It is super easy to use. Just fill it up, plug it in and turn it on. It only takes a couple minutes to heat up and it shuts off automatically when it's done.
