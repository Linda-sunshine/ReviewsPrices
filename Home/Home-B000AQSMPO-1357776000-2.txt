review/summary: It's not all it's cracked up to bereview/text: After 16 months of using the Keurig I feel I can speak out with all honesty .First it's another gadget that you think you can't live without ,it appears to be a miracle ,and it is well built .BUT !! after a year I'm starting to question why I bought it .First you fill the machine with water ,you press the button which heats the water ,then lift the lid put your k-cup in ,close the lid and press 4-6-8 cups thats all there is to it .It makes decent coffee but not outstanding .First you are limited to the companies that market their coffee in k-cup format at a stiff price .What happens next in a lot of cases is you start realizing the coffee is not cheap ,so you start looking for ways around buying k-cups ,and there are a few .Read my reviews about Ekobrew ,solocup etc and you get the picture .First ask yourself why did I buy the Keurig ,well you wanted convenience and no clean up.Well with convenience comes cost as stated ,so you buy some brew cups like Ekobrew and you pack in your favorite brew ,then comes the clean up of the cup ,a messy job unless you buy the solofil which you have to buy filters. So if you have a cup a day it will cost around $48 or more a year if you have a few more cups a lot more .Your choice, mostly lousy expensive coffee with convenience or great coffee for less money but more inconvenience .I come back to when I had a Cuisinart 4 cup coffee maker that all I had to was wash the carafe and filter holders BUT !! I had the best coffee available from any gourmet shop or country .I'm tired of the cleanup which is a little messy and am starting to miss my Cuisinart .It seems most buyers of Keurig are smitten with the technology but not the price of the Keurig and the coffee pods , so start looking for alternatives .That's not why you bought the Keurig .2/18/2013I've finally had it with this machine ,I will finish up the dozen or so k-cups I got left .This is a money making machine for someone, a lot like color printers, you buy them cheap and you pay through the nose for ink .The big difference is the Keurig is expensive and so is the coffee, at least 50c-85c and sometimes more per cup .It has become such a profit machine for Green Mountain that even Staples is carrying k-cups ,apparently there is some serious money to be made selling these k-cups .So if you read my reviews about people being so turned off by how much the coffee costs are buying work arounds such as Solo Cups ,Ekobrew etc.And as I have stated many times you give up convenience to save money on coffee but have the cleanup that you tried to avoid by buying the Keurig.Well today I went on Amazon after a lot of research and ordered the Hamilton Beach Scoop .I wish I had done more research before I got myself locked into this Keurig .The Hamilton Beach around $59 instead of $169 I paid for the Keurig allows me to scoop out my coffee in a scopp which is also the filter ,there is no carafe ,you just put your cup under the spout .It looks to me that clean up is just shaking out the grounds into the trash and rinsing .Well all those people who bought Keurig and are using the Ekobrew (like myself)paid 3 times as much for those features they don't use anymore in the Keurig,and there quite a few .My big beef is you really have to search online and pay postage to buy coffee you might like ,and I stress coffee that YOU MIGHT LIKE,most stores don't carry all the different coffees .I have found in my case the coffee I truly love doesn't come in a k-cup ,so I buy a bag of coffee that I like and use the Ekobrew .So why did I spend so much for a gadget that restricts my choice of coffee when I could have just bought a 4 cup coffee maker and did the clean up like I'm doing right now whith my Keurig .Cleanup with these workarounds are messy ,hard to fill and if you read some reviews, coffee pours out of the sides so people have been inserting rubber washers to eliminate spillage .Yes I have been taken in by a gadget that takes up quite a bit of counter space .My wife is already cheering that the Keurig is on it's way out ,and so am I.What a waste and for only so so coffee ,I guess I learned the hard way .I will see what I can get for it on Ebay ,not much if someone reads my review.Also now that Green Mountain has come up with a more expensive Keurig type coffee maker that won't accept these K-cups ,a whole new system that locks you into Green Mountain and their coffee ,a sleek machine but not much better than the Keurig .I urge everyone to think this out before you buy this machine ,it's just not worth it.Another thing ,after a while you will start looking to buy a k-cup holder ,that's a stand that holds about 16 k-cups .This will set you back around $26 ,and then you might buy one of these filters ,little plastic containers to put your own coffee into it and save paying for k-cups another $15.So you paid $149 + $9 tax so by the time you get through close to $200 and quite a bit of counter space .I bet in 6 months all these fell in love reviews will turn to what ever possessed me to buy this ?I can hear the echo already ,a marvel yes but who needs it ?
