review/summary: Best pizza pan. Period.review/text: Not much to add, but if you're serious about making pizza, this is the only pan you'll ever need, regardless of technique. You can slap the dough down on a cold pan, top, bake, and you'll have a great soft pizza with a crispy crust. On a hot stovetop, lightly grill both sides and you have fresh crusts that you can ziploc and freeze. Throw those topped pies on the pan and place under a broiler for a great charred-top fake brick oven pizza. Put it on your Weber Kettle or Weber Smokey Mountain for a smokey grilled pizza. About the only pie it doesn't do is deep dish, but that's what your Lodge Frying Pan is for, and if you don't have one of those, you really need to take a long hard look at yourself and figure out what went wrong with your life. And you can do pancakes and bacon and fajitas and tortillas and on and on. And unlike pizza stones, this will never ever shatter. Just do yourself a favor and buy the damn pan already.
