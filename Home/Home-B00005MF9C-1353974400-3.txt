review/summary: A little clumsy...review/text: To be fair, it makes a good cup of coffee. However, when I got into the &#34;fancier&#34; blends, the grains sort of over-flowed the cup/filter where I put them. None of the grains got into my coffee, though. It just made the little contraption more difficult to clean; I have to unplug it, and rinse the whole thing under water, all the time trying not to get water on the electrical parts.
