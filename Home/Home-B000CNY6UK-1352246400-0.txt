review/summary: Where have you been all these years?review/text: I first learned of this little gem while on a recent tour of Boston's Little Italy. After reading numerous reviews on Amazon I decided to purchase the 6 cup maker. Great decision. The coffee it makes, with Cafe Bustelo purchased locally, is fantastic. The device itself is simple, rugged, and simple to use. The six cup size is just right for my morning dose of coffee. Anything smaller would push me to make multiple pots (troublesome), drink less (no way!), while a larger pot would result in drinking too much caffeine (yes, there is such a thing).
