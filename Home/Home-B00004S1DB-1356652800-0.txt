review/summary: Perfect Cup Of Coffee For Two Peoplereview/text: This beats the Bodum & other glass models hands down. Taste is perfect & this one will last forever - the other french presses I've owned last a year or two and either crack during cleaning or get dropped - oops - and break. Plus it keeps that second cup of coffee nice & hot for much longer.
