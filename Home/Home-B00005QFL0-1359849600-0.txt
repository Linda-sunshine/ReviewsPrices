review/summary: Makes greart breadreview/text: Cons:- I wish it was faster, a standard loaf of bread takes 4:00 hrs, dough for roles 2:20. Our previous Toastmaster took 3:40 and 1:03 respectively.- At this price point it should had a gluten free (GF) program, I knew this omission when I bought it.Pros:- The kneading blade always stays in the pan.- The hole left in the loaf by the kneading blade is minimal.- It fits on our counter under our cabinets and can be pulled forward to use. I bought a different machine ($40) prior to this that had a GF program but I couldn't using it in this location and returned it because of that.- It is reasonably quiet.
