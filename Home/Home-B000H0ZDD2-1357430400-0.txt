review/summary: Very pleased!review/text: After reading some of the reviews of this item prior to purchasing it, I was somewhat hesitant, but it seemed to be exactly what I needed and was looking for, so I went ahead and purchased one. I am VERY PLEASED that I chose this product! It is nice and quiet, allowing for it to run both day and night. The size is very convenient! The cord is nice and long, so it goes a decent length along the wall and out of the way just as I had hoped for. The reservoir is easily viewable and see-through so that you can easily see how much moisture is sucked out of the air. It comes with a convenient automatic 'turn off' feature if the reservoir fills before you get it emptied. We haven't used that feature yet, as we often remember to empty it on our own, since as I mentioned, the reservoir tank is easily viewable, which is very handy! This is an overall great product that does a good job of removing moisture, operating quietly, and fitting in a small room.
