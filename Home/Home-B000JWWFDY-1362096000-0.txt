review/summary: Shrinkage!review/text: These shrink BAD! They barely fit the bed and after the first wash it was harder. Now, it takes the both of us reefing on a corner to get it to go over the edge. They seem to be pretty stain resistant which is good. Nice color and nice feel, they just don't fit :(
