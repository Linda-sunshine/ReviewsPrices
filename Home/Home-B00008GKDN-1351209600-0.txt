review/summary: Most used pan in my house!!review/text: I have had this griddle for about 2 months and use it daily! Use it for grilled cheese,eggs,bacon,hot dogs,garlic toast,pancakes,tortillas... the list goes on and on! I just keep it on my stove so its out whenever I need it and its so easy to clean up. I'm going to get one for each of my kids when they get their own places too! No house should be without this fantastic griddle! Nuff said
