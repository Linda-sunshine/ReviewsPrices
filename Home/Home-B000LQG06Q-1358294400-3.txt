review/summary: Good productreview/text: The only reason I didn't rate this 5 star is because they seem to run a little on the small side. I suggest you order a size larger that you really need. You may have to then trim in a little but I like mine to go all the way out to the edge of the mattress underneath it. It was easy to trim.
