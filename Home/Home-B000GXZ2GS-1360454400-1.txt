review/summary: Simple and effective; how long will it last?review/text: I am giving the Aeropress 5 stars because it has brought flavors out in coffee that we have not been able achieve with other methods for such a low price for brewing equipment; and we have been through *many, many* coffee making contraptions. It is simple, portable, and easy to clean.My only concern is that it is starting to wear out after just over 700 plunges. This is easy to track because the paper filters come in packs of 350. I will gladly buy another one, but would like to understand form Aerobie what the normal lifecycle is so that we can correct anything we are doing wrong.
