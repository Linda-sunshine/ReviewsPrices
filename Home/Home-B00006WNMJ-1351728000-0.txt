review/summary: Still like it, but........review/text: If I had written this review within a month or so after purchase, I would have given it 5 stars. One feature I particularly liked was that the knob that we pulled out to divert the water flow through the filter automatically returned to the "off" position when the water was turned off. However, within about a month, it stopped doing this. I took the filter apart and cleaned everything I could see to do, and it worked again for a couple days. Since then, we have just gotten accustomed to the fact that we have to push the little lever in (to the off position) when we're done drawing filtered water. A relatively small complaint, I suppose, but it would have been great if it had continued to work as designed. Changing filters is pretty easy so that's a plus.
