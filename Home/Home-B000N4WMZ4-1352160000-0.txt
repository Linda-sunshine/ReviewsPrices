review/summary: Can't say anything bad about this!review/text: This is heavy, it holds it's heat and it's beautiful! It works on the stove and in the oven up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit. We've used it to make some amazing pot roasts in the oven, low and slow and absolutely perfect! It washes up easily after just a bit of soaking with hot soapy water. No need to scrub! The ceramic glazing is holding up fantastically after over 6 months of use, something I've had trouble with with other brands of glazed cookware (They've cracked and chipped away...) Great purchase!
