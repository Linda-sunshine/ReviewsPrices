review/summary: Great Dehydratorreview/text: Purchased this item in November of 2011. Works like a champ! I make mostly beef jerky. Buy the cheapest (freshest) meat, marinate for 10-12 hours, and then load up the trays. Dehydrating time varies upon how thick the meat is cut. I like my jerky a little soft/chewy- not too dry. This dehydrator comes with 5 trays. I can get 3.5 to 4.5 pounds of meat in it at a time. Depends on how you slice the meat. During the dehydrating process, I will rotate the trays- top to bottom, bottom to top. This helps to evenly dehydrate the meat/fruit. Experiment with various recipes. Find the flavor you like. I've also made fruit leather, dried strawberries and other fruits. Perfect snacks for kids. I highly recommend this dehydrator. This Nesco FD-75PR Dehydrator is excellent. One of the best items I've ever purchased online!!
