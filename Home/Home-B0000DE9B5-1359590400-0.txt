review/summary: Functional and worth buying!review/text: I purchased this as part of my resolution to reduce the amount of plastic my food/beverages are stored within. Purchased 3 different glass pitchers for the fridge... functional benchmark would be volume of 2 liters and tight enough seal to shake juice concentrates. Of the three, this is the clear winner... it was the least expensive and most functional. I did not experience any of the problems with the lid that others have noticed... my only wish is that this was available in cobalt or another light inhibiting color/opaqueness. If you have children in the house, be aware that this is real glass and thick to boot... so fairly heavy.
