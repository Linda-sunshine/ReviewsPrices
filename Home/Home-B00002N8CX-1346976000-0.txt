review/summary: good vacuum, bad tubereview/text: It's a pretty powerful vacuum, as far as I can tell. Within maybe two weeks, the hose developed a tear and became unusable. Now I push it around like a hand vacuum, no attachments. It's still good, but obviously can't do corners, gets a little messy when it's off, and it's a little heavy. I'm having a hard time finding a replacement hose.
