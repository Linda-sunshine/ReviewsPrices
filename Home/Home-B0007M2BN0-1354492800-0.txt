review/summary: So much better than boilingreview/text: I got one for me and one for my adult son. We both think they're great. No more waiting 20 minutes for a hard boiled egg to boil, or hoping soft boiled will turn out right, or (in my case) going to do something else while the egg boils and forgetting about it until I smell burning egg. No more pan with hard water build up from boiling eggs. This little contraption is so simple and just wonderfully convenient.
