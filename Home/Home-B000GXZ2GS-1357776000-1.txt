review/summary: The Hype is for Realreview/text: I got this as a Christmas present for my wife. I went to very fancy coffee shop to get espresso and the guy asked if it I was brewing in an espresso machine. I sheepishly told him &#34;well, its more of a test tube&#34; to which he excitedly replied &#34;You got an AeroPress!!&#34;The AeroPress is perfect for someone who wants a cup of espresso or coffee and doesn't want to buy a large machine or brew a whole pot.The Good:- It is simple and sturdy- Easy to clean up- It allows you precisely determine how strong or weak you want your brew, something that a lot of tools don't allow for (both in quantity of water and coffee used as well as how long you stir it).- The PRICE!The Bad:-The Aeropress &#34;rests&#34; on top of your cup. The connection can be uneasy and cumbersome. I would almost prefer a locking in container at the bottom which I could then pour into my cup. (Knit picky, but wanted to let people know how it works.All in all if the above is what you are looking for this is the best. Not only that, but the coffee gurus use it and love it. I would buy it again in a heartbeat. Its also a really thoughtful affordable gift for a coffee lover.
