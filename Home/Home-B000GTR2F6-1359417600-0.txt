review/summary: Loved it but it's dying after less than two years....review/text: Mine has worked perfectly as far as brewing, no priming errors etc. Over the last couple of months it's been having power issues though. It will randomly shut off, the menu won't work etc. I called Keurig and they say nothing can be done and offered to sell me a new one discounted for 79.99. I'm conflicted since I love it so much(I'm the only person in my family that drinks coffee) and use just the hot water feature often to make tea. Thinking of trying the new Bunn but it does not have a reservoir or an off button. I just hate to give repeat business to Keurig for these makers that don't last very long for how expensive they are. My brewer is about 20 months old.
