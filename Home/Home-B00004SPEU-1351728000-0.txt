review/summary: Low Noise Mill- Great for baby cerealsreview/text: I ordered it considering the fact that it is handy and small. I use it to grind my baby cereals. It makes a thin powder without making a loud noise which I expected since I grinding a grain. I am totally impressed by this tiny mill. The only thing I didn't like is that the grinding pot cannot be detached. I wish I could take it out and wash it. But overall a great product.
