review/summary: great coffee, disposible machinereview/text: The machine makes great coffee and is the perfect concept. I did not buy my original machine from Amazon but I looked here to get a new machine. The one I have seems to have all the same problems addressed in the other reviews. It is very frustrating at 5:00 in the morning and I can't get a cup of coffee. It appears the keurig is a disposable coffeemaker. I think I will go back to my good old reliable Mr. Coffee. Too bad because Keurig is a great concept with terrible engineering.
