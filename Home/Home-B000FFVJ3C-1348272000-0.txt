review/summary: Oh Wow!review/text: I love everything about this dehydrator! My old one is a Ronco and about 20 years old, so it has been awesome. It still works but the trays are cracking from age, so it was more than time for a new one! I did a lot of research on the web before this purchase because I wanted to get one that would do what the old one did and hopefully last as long... I must say that so far I 've been very pleased with the new Nesco 700 watt dehydrator! The extra wattage and the fan make it work so much faster than the old one! Great jerky, pineapple, oranges, apples and veggies...even frozen bags of fruit & veggies dehydrate wonderfully! We're planning on making these our Christmas gifts to our grown children...Our grandchildren will love the jerky and fruit...and our children will love feeding their families food that is better for them and being able to keep a great deal more food in a much smaller space!
