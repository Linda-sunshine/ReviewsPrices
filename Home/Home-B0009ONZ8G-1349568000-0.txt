review/summary: A good vacuum for the pricereview/text: While the vacuum does a good job on carpet and bare floors, the coil part of the hose is very rigid. When using attachments, the connecting hose pieces invariably come off with the slightest movements up and down steps or reaching up. It's very frustrating. For that reason, I don't know that I would buy it again.
