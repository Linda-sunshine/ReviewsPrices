review/summary: Works wellreview/text: This does what it says it does. It filters your water. It is nice to have a large dispenser cold in the fridge already filtered. The only issue I have and it's not a big one is that when I shut the fridge door it hits the dispenser and pushes it back. So in order to fill your glass you need to pull it out to the edge of the shelf. Not a huge deal.
