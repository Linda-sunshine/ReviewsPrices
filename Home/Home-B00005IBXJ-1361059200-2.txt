review/summary: Beware of squeaky gearsreview/text: My sister had an older one that was great, so I ordered the newer one.It was not as good as I was hoping. Cooks food well, but the gears are a little noisy. Sometimes it squeaks loudly. I returned the first one because it sounded like a sewing machine and the replacement also had gear noise issues. Im thinking they all may be like that... Overall I was dissapointed after seeing how my sisters older model didn't have these issues.
