review/summary: I love it!!!review/text: I got my juicer and have been juicing almost everyday. I love the fact that I don't have to cut up the fruit before juicing. I get a lot of juice with this machine. Clean up is easy except I don't like the mesh basket as sometimes it is hard to get the pieces out of the mesh. Be careful with blow back. When adding more fruit/veggies to the juicer sometimes bits and pieces fly out of the mouth and onto the cabinets and countertop. Other than that I LOVE IT!!!
