review/summary: Avoid if dependable coffee-making is important to youreview/text: Another piece of crap made by the forced labor of 10 year old Chinese girls - and apparently from inferior electrical parts. Mine lasted all of 2 months before it totally quit on me. I hate this because - back in the day - Mr. Coffee used to be a simple, dependable product, You can forget that now. Ugh. Tried to "reset" by unplugging and then plugging back in - as well as using a different wall outlet. The green "on" indicator lights up but NOTHING HAPPENS. Worthless.
