review/summary: Very dangerous! NOT UL LISTEDreview/text: The blades are razor-sharp, which is good. What isn't good is the complete lack of finger-guard or other means of protection.I saw warnings on the package/product regarding the danger posed by the blades. Duly noted, I counseled my wife about the danger. We then went on about our business in the kitchen, life, etc.Days later, we used the product for the first time. It did perform the basic task of slicing vegetables in fun and amusing ways, and did so surprisingly well. With a full dinner prepared, it was time to clean.In the distractions of being social and working together, I had lost singular and exclusive focus on the safety issue posed by the blades... while grabbing and washing everything in sight.The next thing I knew, my finger had a deep and long gash in it, bleeding profusely. The gash required days to heal.In short, if you lose focus on this product for a second, it can hurt you - a lot.The product is not UL listed; I can't imagine Underwriter's Laboratories would have allowed this design to be approved.The design of the product, and the &#34;real-world&#34; usage expected of it in distracted, homey, relaxed, intentionally and fittingly NON-professional atmospheres, begs the need for a finger guard/cover, etc.I WILL NOT purchase a similar product; hope this review prevents injury to others.
