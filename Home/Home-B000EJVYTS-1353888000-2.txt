review/summary: Keeps the Odor Awayreview/text: I really enjoy this item. My regular trash you to smell bad. This one does not. I also love that it opens on its own. The only problem is when I am even near it and do not want it to open, it does anyway. Overall, I am very pleased and happy I bought this item. The company is also terrific and has excellent customer service. I was having trouble initially putting the battery in. I called them and they were so helpful. They even sent me a video!!
