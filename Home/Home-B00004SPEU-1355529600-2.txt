review/summary: Love them so much we have two!review/text: We only use for coffee grinding, but I imagine these things rock for spices as well. A coworker has a very expensive &#34;conical&#34; grinder and it leaves half beans and chunks in every batch. Not the Krups. We can make powder if we like!
