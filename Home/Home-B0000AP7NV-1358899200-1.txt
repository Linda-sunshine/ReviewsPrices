review/summary: If your fridge is packed, this is for you!review/text: My refrigerator is shared amongst 3 roommates who like to keep their fridge very well stocked. We have managed to use every cubic inch of it, but the most essential is clean drinking water. We invested in the Brita Slim Pitcher and, believe it or not, this well-designed product can fit anywhere. Its slim and tapering shape works well in all refrigerators (the deep 2 door ones & the conventional one door wide ones). The handle covers 80% of the side surface area and can be gripped and pulled out without getting your fingers locked up. The clear plastic does not scratch easily and lets you see that the filter works well and there are hardly any impurities. The best quality so far is its shape, which does not take up space, yet does not compromise on the amount of water. Its good looks made me buy it, but I appreciate it more for its function now!
