review/summary: Works Great, Sturdyreview/text: I bought this because my husband likes his coffee VERY strong and we're setting out on a 24 hour car ride. We figured this would not only save money on gas station coffee (will get hot water from the gas station coffee makers) but hubby will also get it made to his taste.I'm disappointed that the lid doesn't screw on to keep it secure, but the fact it doesn't really keep it warm means we'll have to transfer it to a thermos anyway. Still, it's better than a glass press which risks breakage by being bounced around in the car.I was glad it came with a lifetime warranty, but don't forded needing it.
