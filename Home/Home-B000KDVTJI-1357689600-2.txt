review/summary: Convenient, efficient, reliable...perfect!review/text: Not only did I love this kettle, I also bought one for my brother for Christmas. (When he opened it, turned out that my 2 nephews wanted one too.)Having the automatic shut-off is terrific of course, and this one creates a hard boil, and then keeps it warm for far longer than I would have expected. Yes, the outside gets hot, so simply don't touch it. Handle is always cool, flip top is secure.It would be nice if the water gauge was a little more easy to read, and perhaps for it to be more quiet as it boils, but those are minor things and hardly worth mentioning. It looks fabulous, works great, and I love being able to pick it up and not have a power cord follow along with me! Truly, one of the most helpful items I've purchased all year.
