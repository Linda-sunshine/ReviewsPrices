review/summary: Didn't lastreview/text: I bought this bed on August 11 of last year. Today, August 10, 2012, I came home and found a huge bulge in the middle.This is the great curse of air mattresses: the internal baffles detach from the surface, rendering the bed unuseable. I've been sleeping on air mattresses for 15-17 years now, and this has happened with every one. Why can't they figure out how make the baffles stay attached? We just landed a space vehicle on Mars, why can't we make an air mattress that lasts for more than a year or two? I'm giving this product two stars, because it was pretty comfortable, while it lasted. But I think a product like this should last at least four or five years.
