review/summary: Excellent Coffee Makerreview/text: We've had this coffee maker for almost a year and it's been a great coffeemaker, no complaints. It's done all I've asked of it as a daily coffee drinker and the occasional tea drinker.I had to contact Cuisinart because I had a hairline crack in my carafe that appeared about six months in (didn't leak or anything), and they sent a new one for free. Their customer service was superb (I even got an American on the line! -rare these days)
