review/summary: Great Flannel Sheetsreview/text: I live in a mountain home. Temperatures in winter are very cold. Frequently in the single digits or below 0 degrees. Flannel sheets are a real treat. I have purchased several sets of flannel sheets, but these are the best because of their softness. All the other Pinzon Flannels I've bought start out pretty soft, but pill after several times in the wash. These sheets are just so soft and nice. I'm hoping they will not pill in the future, but so far so good!
