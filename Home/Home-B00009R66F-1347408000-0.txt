review/summary: Going back to Bissellreview/text: I rely heavily on a steam cleaner with a dog door and 4 dogs going in and out constantly. I had a Bissell Proheat for several years before buying this Hoover. I read the reviews, the price was right, and I saw pristine carpet in my future... immediately out of the box, I could tell that this cleaner was made much more cheaply than my Bissell. The plastic felt weaker, which made the entire machine feel much less substantial. Still, I was optimistic because people spoke so highly of it.I've now had it 5 months and there is already a hole in the small hose that you plug in to use the attachment (which is another part of the machine that annoys me--on a Bissell, you just turn a switch to go from floor to attachment). It's wrapped with duct tape, which is not what I expected to have to do after a few months.One thing I do prefer in this Hoover model over the Bissell is how you add the cleaning solution. It's mixed in with the water and if I needed to find one "pro" to this machine, I guess that would be it.I know it cleans ok because I can see the dirty water but overall, I'm just not sure it was worth switching brands. I don't have any addditional, specific things that annoy me about it--just feels cheap and isn't as awesome as I had hoped.
