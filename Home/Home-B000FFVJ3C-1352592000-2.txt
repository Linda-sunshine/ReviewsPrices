review/summary: The dogs love it!review/text: Hi, I own a dog daycare and boarding business and bought this to make jerky and treats for the dogs. They love them and will do anything for them. I only give treats that are healthy and free of byproducts so this dehydrator saves me a lot of money. I will be buying more trays or more dehydrators to keep up with demand. It is amazing how large qty's dehydrate to nothing. I also dehydrate bannanas for me and love them.
