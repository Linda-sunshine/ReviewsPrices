review/summary: Sturdy and powerful.review/text: This beast does everything it promises to do, and it's one quality piece of machinery. However, I wish I had purchases a double auger extractor instead. (I don't know if it's true what they say about oxidation with centrifugal extractors, hence my desire for an auger extractor.) Back then I was single and I could afford one, so it might be too late for me now. My wife rather I spend the money on going out to restaurants. I'd rather have a nice tall glass of freshly squeezed green juice rather than anything else they serve at most restaurants.
