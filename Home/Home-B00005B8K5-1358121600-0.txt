review/summary: Just okreview/text: I received my set today and there is a flaw on the small square one. It has a dip on one side and the lid doesn't fit as snug as it should. Not going to bother sending back. Hard to believe that this could get through inspection though. I guess they don't check them all.Will update review after I use for a while. Don't think I will wash lids in dishwasher though because that is where I always have problems with lids losing there snug fit after many uses.Tired of stained Tupperware and bad seals so I thought I would go this route and see if I like these.
