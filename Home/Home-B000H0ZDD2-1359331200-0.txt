review/summary: Solved dampness problems in cold storage spacereview/text: We have a cold storage under our back stairs that I've insulated so well to the rest of the house, there's not much air flow. Unfortunately, access to the sump is in this space and the room would always get musty. It's small, about 10x10 with only about a 6 ft ceiling. I put a small conventional dehumidifier in there, but it heated up the space a lot, which is not great for a cold storage. The Eva Dry completely solved the dampness and musty smell in there without heating up the air. Because it's not in a living space, noise isn't a big issue (but it's nice that I can't hear it). It fills up about once every couple of weeks and has made a noticeable difference in the air quality down there. For the right application, this product works great!
