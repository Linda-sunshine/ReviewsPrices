review/summary: Somewhat dissatisifiedreview/text: When we first got this machine(less than one month ago) the loaves came out ok. A little funny looking but good bread. We tried making the pizza dough and when it was &#34;ready&#34; it came out watery. Would have been much easier and less sloppy to do it by hand. Now, the bread collapses and the paddle gets stuck in the bread. Seriously considering returning it if I don't get answers. (There was nowhere to contact seller after product was delivered) Also, I read that the replacement paddle is $30.00!
