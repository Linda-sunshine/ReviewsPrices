review/summary: Good For Pricereview/text: I got this on sale for $7 back in November 2011. It's perfect for 1-2 people who strictly drink water. Any more, and you might consider getting a bigger sized water filter so you don't have to refill it as often.The one thing I really like about this filter is that at least for the one I received, the top lid is sealed tight so you can pour water out of it right after filling it to the top for filtration.
