review/summary: Compact, resourceful, and dependable!review/text: This hand held vacuum comes in handy all the time! It's compact, portable, and powerful. If I spill coffee grinds or sugar on the kitchen counter, the hose makes quick work of it. When the bathroom carpet starts collecting pine needles from our Christmas tree, the brush roll helps work them off. It works on a variety of surfaces and helps ensure that our much larger vacuum stays in the closet. Light weight with a very healthy cord length. Would definitely recommend!
