review/summary: Good productreview/text: I love coffee and I'm always trying different ways to make coffee. The Bialetti Moka Espress is excellent if you want to make traditional latin/Cuban or Italian coffee. My only regret is that I should have ordered the 6 "cup" version. One 3 cup serving is only good for one person especially if your going to have cafe con leche or lattes in full cups or mugs. In my house my wife and I can't be limited to just 2-3 demitasse cups between us. That would just be a tease! Bring on the mugs! By the way Pilon Coffee is excellent with the Moka. Hope this review help.
