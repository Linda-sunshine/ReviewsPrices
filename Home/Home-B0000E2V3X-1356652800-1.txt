review/summary: It has taken a year...but finally I found what I needed to make awesome pizza!review/text: After trying many techniques for making the best pizza, I finally found the solution! A Cast Iron pizza pan is what you need for good crust! Here are the reasons:1) Its flat with no depth, so you can slide your pizza onto it and get it really close to your broiler (This is a must)2) You can't break this this like you can a pizza stone3) It retains heat for a very long time so once you pre-heat your pan, and you get your dough on it, it starts cooking immediatelyI love anything that's Lodge cast iron
