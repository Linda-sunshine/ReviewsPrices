review/summary: Black & Decker Personal Coffeemaker product reviewreview/text: Consider buying this product for the single coffee drinker in your family or simply to save on your coffee grounds.I have been using this model for about a month now and have had no issues.- Overflow issue is not a relevant problem as long as you don't put more water than your drinking container allows.- The filter was easy to clean and the mug it comes with is sturdy and durable.Definitely worth the price over the other overpriced ($100+ yikes) models.So if you like a simplistic, usable and affordable model, then this is the one to get.
