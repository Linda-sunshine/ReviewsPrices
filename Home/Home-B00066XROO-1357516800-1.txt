review/summary: Awesome Griddlereview/text: This griddle is big enough to cook a lot of pancakes, or eggs and bacon. Love the ease of clean up and how it tilts to drain off grease. I use this to fix crepes and feed a lot of people. Would recommend for anyone with large family or someone who uses a griddle often.
