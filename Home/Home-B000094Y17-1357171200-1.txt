review/summary: Water now tastes great!review/text: Purchased mainly so we'd have filtered water available for use in our Keurig, but have also found that water tastes so much better now. Also, we've not had any problems with the lid falling off - you just have to be careful to set it on correctly. Also, make sure your thumb doesn't come in contact with the lid when you pour the water...the lid then stays on with no problem. We even are able to pour directly into the Keurig water reservoir with no problems. It's just what we needed!
