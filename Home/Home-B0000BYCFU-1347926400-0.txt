review/summary: Presto Pressure Canner/Cookerreview/text: After many years of not canning, I purchased the 23 qt Presto Pressure Canner and Cooker through the Amazon Website. Received the product within four days and have had much success with corn. green beans, tomatoes, and vegetable soup. (so far)..The instruction booklet was well written. I would recommend this product and plan to do much canning this fall and for years to come.
