review/summary: Best Coffee Pot Everreview/text: Our coffee pot needing replacing. I tried a popular drip maker but the coffee had a strange taste, possibly from the plastic and wasn't hot enough. To get away from a maker with plastic parts, I ordered the Presto and LOVE it. It makes a hot cup of coffee without any funny taste. It's nice to once again have the wonderful smell of brewing coffee in my home. Perk time is QUICK, and it is NOT loud. Would recommend this coffee maker.
