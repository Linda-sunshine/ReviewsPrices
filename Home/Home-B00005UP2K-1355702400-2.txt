review/summary: Having Fun!review/text: I have wanted a stand mixer forever, this year I asked "Santa" and got one early! I have used it almost every day for a month now and have been having lots of fun. I was finally able to perfect my French Baguette recipe! There is no way you can knead dough that soft by hand, you MUST have a stand mixer (as well as a couple other things) in order to get perfect Baguettes at home. I have put the machine through its paces and it is coming on strong. I love it! I make a lot of bread have not had any issues thus far. I am also following the directions that came with the machine and only kneading on level two. Cakes take no time at all; whipped cream and meringues are also very fast. Love my mixer!
