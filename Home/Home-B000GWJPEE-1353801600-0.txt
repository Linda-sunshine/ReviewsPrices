review/summary: So cute!review/text: I love this cute little guy! He's not too big, not too small, easy to clean, and has a nice long cord so he doesn't have to be right next to an outlet. The only flaw is that the mist comes out from little slits behind his eyes, not out of his nostrils (which would make him perfect).
