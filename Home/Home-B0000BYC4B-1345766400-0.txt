review/summary: Great Buy....review/text: Our Mason jars have become much more useful as a result of these lids! The benefits far outweigh some of the complaints I've read here. As with anything, one has to be judicious in their use. We can now conveniently store such dry items as beans and nuts and also liquids in the refrigerator recognizing that the jar is not to be used as a shaker or blender. Great buy!
