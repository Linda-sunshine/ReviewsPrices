review/summary: It's OKreview/text: I bought this item because I had difficulty finding a single cup coffee maker that uses regular ground coffee instead of the Keurig cups. This percolator has a 2-4 cup capacity that I felt would fill my needs nicely. I bought this item to replace an all-plastic Bella drip-brew coffee maker that I bought from Kohl's for $25. I looked forward to the percolating process to provide a better tasting cup of coffee over the drip-brew method but I didn't find that to be the case. The Farberware FCP240 cost me close to $40 and in my opinion, the flavor of the coffee is no better than the coffee made with my cheapo plastic Bella which I have since returned to. I can't understand the negative reviews about the quality of the Farberware products that other reviewers have commented on because both externally and internally (I took the base off to inspect the wiring), I found the product to be very well made and I would expect it to last a long time. As I said, I have no issue with the quality of the product, just the so-so quality of the coffee it makes. One note on the negative side I might mention is that since it has no on/off switch and no automatic shut-off feature, you have to remember to unplug it or it will stay on forever.
