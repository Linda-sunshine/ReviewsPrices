review/summary: Easy to use; cleans wellreview/text: The SteamVac easy to use and cleans wells, even on heavily soiled areas with the Clean Surge feature. I also found the companion Hoover Pet Plus and Hoover Professional Strength Detergents to be must-haves and very effective. The removal/reattachment of the water container is a bit fiddly, but not a show stopper.
