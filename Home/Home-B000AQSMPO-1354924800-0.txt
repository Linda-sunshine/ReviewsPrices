review/summary: Don't buy if you plan on drinking coffee for over 51 weeksreview/text: I read all the reviews on Keurig and how the coffee maker would only last a year. I thought surely Keurig can't dump a product into the market that breaks in a year, and especially when they knew about it. Well, I bought it, gave it to my wife/myself for Christmas 2011, and sure enough 50 weeks later it broke, it just stopped working. So rather than get another one, I'm going old school and getting a regular coffee maker. Disappointing that it would break almost to the day it was purchased. Don't be a sucker and get this item if you want to have something reliable and worth the money. Buck &lt; Bang
