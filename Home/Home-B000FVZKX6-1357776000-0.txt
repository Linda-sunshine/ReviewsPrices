review/summary: Now I want to spend all my time in bedreview/text: These sheets are so comfortable and warm, I could be happy with them for the rest of my life. I've had sheets with 600 and 800 thread count, and none compare to these velvet flannel sheets. One of the nicest things about them is how they look. You put them on the bed and they don't wrinkle! No iron needed, and they look so smooth and perfect. They fit perfectly. They do not shrink in the wash, they hold up perfectly after repeated washings, and they feel so beautiful. I can't imagine a better sheet. I'm so lucky to have found these.
