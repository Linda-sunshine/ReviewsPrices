review/summary: Great cutterreview/text: This works well and spiral slices veggies as advertised. I just wonder about its long-term durability, as it is constructed of light/mid-weight plastic. I'm nervous that the handle that you push to propel the rotating handle forward will snap, especially when working with harder veggies like carrots. I've used mine about half a dozen times so far and so far it's all good, but if there were a sturdier version made of a stronger material, I would've been willing to pay more for it.
