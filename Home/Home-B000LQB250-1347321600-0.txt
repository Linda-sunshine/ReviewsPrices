review/summary: Perfectreview/text: We just got a new trailer and the mattress was in good shape, But a little to firm for my hubby and I. So we ordered this memory foam mattress topper in the queen size and it is perfect. Nice and comfortable. Also this came with no strong odor like others we have had in the past. we didn't need to air it out before we could sleep on it. I know we only have had this for 1 week But, we are happy with it.
