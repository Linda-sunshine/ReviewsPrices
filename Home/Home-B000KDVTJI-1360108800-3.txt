review/summary: Quick, convenient and SAFE!review/text: After having destroyed two kettles on the stove, having forgotten them on the electric stove, I felt the need to make anotherchoice. I searched many sorts of electric kettles and found + and - ratings. This model had some 1200+ ratings and 900+ were VERY positive. Folks told the truth... It is lightweight, even with water in it; does not have a cord attached to tangle up with anything; turns itself off; heats more quickly that the stove did. I just can't find anything to take away from its practicality and performance. I think I'm in love.........
