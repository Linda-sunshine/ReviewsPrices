review/summary: Price is deceivingreview/text: I bought this juicer for my wife this Christmas and I kept my fingers crossed that buying a rather inexpensive appliance wouldn't backfire on me. It has been more than I hoped for as we have experimented with it almost every day since it was delivered, and we've had no problems with it whatsoever. Assembly, break-down, usage and cleaning are all very simple and straightforward. I would highly recommend this product for anyone who is not looking to spend an arm and a leg on such an appliance.
