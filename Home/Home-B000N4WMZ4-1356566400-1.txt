review/summary: Perfect size.review/text: I love Lodge Color Dutch Ovens. I have several sizes, but this 3-quart size is perfect for so many dishes. I love that it is easy to clean and does a wonderful job cooking on the stove top as well as in my convection oven. My recipes come out perfect every time. Unfortunately, I could never find the 3-quart size in any store I shopped in. Most stores only carry the 6-quart size, at least in my town....
