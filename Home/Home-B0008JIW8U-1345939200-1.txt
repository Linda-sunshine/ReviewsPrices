review/summary: good coffee for 1-2 peoplereview/text: A good machine so far. 4 cups brews about 20oz of coffee which is perfect for me. I have not noticed the plastic taste as some have noted ( I did read the manual and washed the carafe and basket and then run a couple of brew cycles with just water).I also haven't noticed the clock problems some have noted(but I don't really use this as a clock).So far it delivers just the right amount of good tasting coffee to get me started and is super easy to clean(discard grounds, rinse carafe and basket).
