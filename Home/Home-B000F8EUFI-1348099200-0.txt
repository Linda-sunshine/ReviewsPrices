review/summary: I LOVE this vacuum.review/text: Man, my apartment was DIRTY. Who would have thought an apartment for three 20-something year old men could get so nasty? No worries, cause I ordered this red puppy, and man does it clean. It may not be as snazzy as a Dyson, nor as cool as a Roomba, but this Dirt Devil has got heart. Mad heart, and I respect that. If this is in your price range and you need help tidying up an apartment, this will become your new best friend.
