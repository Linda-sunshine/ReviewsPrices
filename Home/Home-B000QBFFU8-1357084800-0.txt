review/summary: Best Juicerreview/text: Got this for Christmas, and its a great juicer! I absolutely love it! Using it twice a day and its amazing what you can turn into juice, not to mention the health benefits in getting the daily fruit/veggie requirements. My daughter loved it so much she actually bought the model below this one, which is the 850 watt with two speeds. This model is 900 watts, but it has 5 speeds and is stainless steel. If you are in the market for a juicer, Breville is a quality product with terrific results!
