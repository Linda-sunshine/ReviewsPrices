review/summary: Great product for the moneyreview/text: This is a really good product for the money. I feel like it juices perfectly for what you pay for. Obviously, a more expensive juicer will get you the most out of your produce. On that note, I feel that the juicer wastes more product than I expected. It's not too terrible, but that little bit could make a little bit more juice. Other than that the juicer is perfect, it disassembles and cleans really easy. I would definitely recommend this product to any new juicer.This is my first juicing experience and it is definitely worth the money! Great for my first juicer.
