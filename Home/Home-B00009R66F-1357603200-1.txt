review/summary: Cost effective and convenientreview/text: My carpet looks brand new again for $150 !!! (machine and BISSEL PROFESSIONAL WITH SCOTCHGARD)Machine felt cheaply made at first but worked wonders. I had a diabetic dachshund who had accidents and now I have a puppy. I also have 2 children and friends who track through my house with shoes on my bright carpet that is one shade darker than white. I usually spend $350 every 6 months for the same result by a professional. I'd recommend this to anyone.
