review/summary: Soft yet sturdyreview/text: I was nervous about all of the negative reviews, but decided to buy anyway. The sheets have a very smooth and soft feel to them, but also seem very sturdy. I have had these for almost 2 months and they have held up well to multiple washings. I am a fan of soft sheets, but my boyfriend isn't. These were a nice compromise. They are soft enough for me, but not too much for him. I would recommend these.
