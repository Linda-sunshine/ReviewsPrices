review/summary: Bad batch productreview/text: I have been using these water filters for a year. The filters I ordered in the past worked fine. But the recent shipment I got appears to be some bad ones because the water just don't go from the top chamber to the bottom chamber even in a few days. At the beggining, I thought it was just one of the four, so I replaced the first one, opened a second, then same story. It still does not work. The water has been held on the top chamber for three days now.
