review/summary: happy so farreview/text: it's a good stick with a good price, easy to store. it does better job with soft foods, when dealing with harder stuff like apple, it takes a longer time and more effort. for heavier duty, you'll need a stronger one. this is good for families like us who don't blend a lot. now I'm just using for baby food and juice sometimes.
