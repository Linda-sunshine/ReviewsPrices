review/summary: Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Dutch Oven with Dual Handles, 5-Qt.review/text: The oven arrived on time and was securely packaged. There was no problem with rust or with seasoning flaking off. I knew it was heavy, but it is manageable for me. I've cooked with cast iron for a long time and like its even heat and heat-retaining qualities. The fact that I don't have to be concerned about anything flaking off it and getting into our food was one of the main reasons I bought it. I highly recommend it.
