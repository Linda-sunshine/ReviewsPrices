review/summary: Functional, but save your money for something nicer.review/text: The knives are of a decent weight, but the blades rust easily and dull easily. Be prepared to wash your knives right away after using them, because leaving them in water for longer than five minutes---no exaggeration---will leave rust spots on the knives.
