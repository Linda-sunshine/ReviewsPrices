review/summary: Nice and Adorable Humidiferreview/text: Have been using this humidifier for 3+ years and not a problem, have had own other humidifier and this is the best whatsoeverProHuge water storage that normally can last for few nightQuietNo expensive filtersCute penguin designConHandle of the water tank may break, don't trust it!May get mold in the water basin if you let it sit quiet for a while, all you need to do is clean up occasionally and let it dry when you're not in use
