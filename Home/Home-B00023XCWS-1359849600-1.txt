review/summary: "Manual" Electric Kettle with 7 Mins. or 4 Mins for Full Boil, 1 Literreview/text: This is a very basic, economy electric kettle with an on/off button you turn on then manually turn off when you water is boiling or hot enough.I say it is manual because slightly more expensive models automatically turn off when water reaches boiling temperature. This one does not. But it does have a safety feature that turns it off when all all the water has boiled off to prevent over-heating, etc.To boil 1 liter of water to full boil (gushing with bubbles), it takes:About 7-7.5 Minutes for COLD Tap WaterAbout 4-4.5 Minutes for HOT Tap WaterOf course if you want your water hot but not necessarily boiling, it will take less time.Overall, well worth it considering the price, a very good economical model with great value
