review/summary: Great buyreview/text: When looking to purchase an item I have one principle: I am too poor to buy cheap! I do not want to purchase the same item multiple times - buy it once and buy it good. So, needless to say I started looking for one of the most expensive kettles on Amazon. And then I had a revelation - what the heck am I using this for? To boil water for tea (btw, this oneDavidson's Tea Bulk, Herbal Cranberry Orange, 16-Ounce Bagand this oneDavidson's Tea Bulk, Organic Spring Fruit & Flowers, 16-Ounce Bagare delicious!) and for coffee in myGROSCHE MADRID Premium french Press Coffee and Tea maker, 1 liter 34 fl. oz capacity. So I don't need to spend $100 or more on a "perfect temperature" kettle (I am not a fan of green tea or black tea or other temperature sensitive tea).Enter the Aroma Kettle! I purchased it used from Amazon Warehouse Deals - the first one I received was repackaged in a generic box and it was scratched and dirty - so much for the "Used - Like New" condition! I sent it back and the second one was perfectly new, with absolutely no signs of ever being even plugged in!This is a very inexpensive kettle - I purchased it for 20 bucks! BUT, it does NOT seem or look cheap. The unit is very well constructed, the polished stainless exterior looks good, nothing is shoddy or loose. The stainless-lined interior is absolutely great - this was my main request when looking to purchase a kettle! It boils water very very quickly! I have used it for about 3 months now and it has never failed or malfunctioned (the switch turns off every single time, just in time). This is definitely a great buy! And if it breaks down I will get another one - I would be still a few away from reaching even half the price of other kettles, so I guess I have to revise my principle a bit :)
