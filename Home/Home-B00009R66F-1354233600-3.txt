review/summary: Badly designedreview/text: Over 2500 reviews for this product and it's junk. I realized after reading the reviews that it would take time to assemble and was prepared for it. Assembly took an hour - instructions are ridiculous. Took more than an hour to figure out how to use it. In the end I just could not figure it out and packed it to return. Never again! I'm a technical writer and have written numerous instruction manuals for really complicated things but this instruction manual is the worst I've ever come across.I don't know why Hoover would design something so complicated. Really disappointed. And yes, the quality is pretty bad - cheap plastic. I'd bought a Bissell few months ago - it was great. The only reason I returned it was it didn't come with a staircase tool. I'm going back to Bissell. It was well made, I could use it right away and it cleaned very well. The only reason I picked this Hoover was the over 2500 good reviews it got.Don't waste your time and money on this.
