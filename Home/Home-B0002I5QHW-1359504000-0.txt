review/summary: As a grinder it works perfectly, as a stuffer it fails hardreview/text: I've sent a fair number of pounds of meat through this thing and it works perfectly. It fails hard when you try using it to stuff sausage. It isn't able to build up enough back pressure to do it effectively. Expect to buy a separate sausage stuffer if that's your goal.
