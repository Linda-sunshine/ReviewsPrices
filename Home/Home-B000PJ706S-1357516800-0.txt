review/summary: Falls apartreview/text: The silver piece on the lid to the kettle fell off in a matter of 12 months- the plastic piece to the blue turn off light on the handle broke off in a matter of weeks, and the chrom on teh handle is pealing off in a matter of 12 months. I liked that it was glass so calcium was less likely to develope on the inside - however the product is not manufactured well.I would not buy this product again...it easily fell apart on me. It barely lasted 12 months and I hardly washed it.
