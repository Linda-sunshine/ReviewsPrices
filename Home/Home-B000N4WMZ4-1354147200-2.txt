review/summary: Great productreview/text: I've been shopping for a dutch oven for quite some time now but really couldn't see investing over $100 dollars in one and the cheaper ones where always way to small. I was really impressed with the size of this dutch oven, it is much bigger than I expected from looking at the pictures. I cooked my first roast in it last night and I love it, no more flimsy roasting pan, I've almost converted all of my cookware to cast iron and this is one of my favorite pieces. If you have been thinking about getting an enamel coated cast iron dutch oven then this should definitely be one to add to your collection. You cant get one at this price anywhere.
