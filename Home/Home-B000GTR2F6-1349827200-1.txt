review/summary: Do the math: really gets expensive!review/text: It's hard for me to give the Keurig a negative review, I have enjoyed it enough to buy a second one after my first one died (I'm lucky, mine lasted 2 years). Many other reviewers have talked about the short life span of these brewers, so I won't repeat what others have all ready said. My current one sounds like it's going to die soon (only got 1 1/2 years out of this one) and I'm not going to buy another one - here's why:What I'd like you to consider before purchasing this "brewing system" is just how much the coffee is going to cost you:Box of 16 K-cups ($tarbucks) = $12.98 (here @ amazon)Price per K-cup = $0.81Pound (16 oz) of Starbucks coffee = $11.99 (grocery store, $tarbucks store)2 TBSP coffee = 14g (recommended for 6 oz cup o' joe)28g = 1oz16oz * 28g/oz = 448g in 16oz coffee448g divided by 14g (one cup) = 32 cups can be made from one pound$11.99/32 = $0.38 per cup (vs. $0.81 per K-cup)In other words, THE K-CUPS COST TWICE AS MUCH FOR THE EXACT SAME COFFEE!!That's $23.98 a pound, if you were wondering."But I got one of those reusable filters for it," you reply. "So now I'm buying the regular coffee instead and saving money." Well, that's what I decided to do, too. Except now I'm basically making coffee exactly the same way I would with a regular drip coffee maker. Let's face it, the K-Cups are pretty much the whole point of this thing. If you're not going to use the K-Cups, there really isn't much of an advantage over a regular coffee pot. Yes, it brews coffee in 30 seconds or so, but it doesn't take THAT much longer make a small, 4-cup pot of coffee (with a $20-$30 coffee maker). Or 4 minutes for a French Press.Don't get me wrong, I really love kitchen gadgets. And I really love coffee. But this time it wasn't a good combination. What I decided to do was go back to using my French Press, but I now have two: a big one (for company) and a little one (for just me). The small French Press holds about 12 oz and is ready in 4 minutes. Takes up very little counter space, too. =)http://www.amazon.com/Bodum-Kenya-12-Ounce-Coffee-Press/dp/B000YYQCOU/
