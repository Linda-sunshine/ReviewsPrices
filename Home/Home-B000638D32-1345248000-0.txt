review/summary: Amazing Knife for the Price - Beats many other more expensive knivesreview/text: This knife is so sharp and holds its edge really well. I found it online recommended by a chef for everyday use over his fancy expensive knives. I love the grip on this thing! Nearly sliced my finger off because I was used to working with lesser and duller knives. Love love love this knife.
