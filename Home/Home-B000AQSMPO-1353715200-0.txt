review/summary: Great Coffee, Needs Maintenencereview/text: Makes great coffee, it's really nice to be able to have multiple types of coffee/tea/cocoa at one's finger tips.We have three B60 Special Keurig machines: home, work, in-laws, all have malfunctioned in some capacity. We've called the company and because we use well water we voided the warranty. The machine needs to be maintained often. Once a month I run 1/2 gallon of vinegar through it, clean all of the needs, the water syphon-- the works. If I don't the prime light comes on or the machine gets 'stuck' and will not draw the water/brew.
