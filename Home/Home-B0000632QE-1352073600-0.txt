review/summary: Good for softer veggies/fruitsreview/text: I've used my new mandoline a handful of times and it's been excellent for softer foods (white potatoes, beets) but it was impossible for the denser sweet potatoes (sadly, my favorite and the whole reason i wanted the slicer). Aside from my inability to use it to slice raw sweet potatoes, my only complaint is that it does not have an easy to hold handle to maintain control, which makes it harder to control the slicing. With softer foods, this is less of a concern as you're using less force when slicing. Overall, a handy product that is cleaned in the dishwasher and safely stored in it's own case. I suppose i'll just have to par-cook my sweets before slicing them.
