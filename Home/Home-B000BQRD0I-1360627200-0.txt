review/summary: Awesome until it stopped workingreview/text: It wasn't love at 1st slight (ugly design) but it was love at 1st try. It was just the right amount of steam for my work blouses. I still had to use an iron for thicker material but the steamer worked very well on everything else. I had it for about a year ( 10 months) when it suddenly stopped steaming. The hose would get very hot but for some strange reason the steam just wouldn't come out. i guess ill have to buy another but i'll definitely try another brand this time hopefully that wont suddenly stop working.
