review/summary: Awesome Coffee, Awesome Servicereview/text: So to start out i am currently drinking my first cup of coffee from this and wow! It really is espresso strength coffee, on top of that it taste amazing, and it is sooo simple. Clean-ups is super fast. If you love coffee this is a must have. In the past i have owned multiple french presses, espresso machines, kuregg coffee machines and multiple other coffee makers. Although, i just started with this, it is already my favorite. I thought initially it would be like french press but honestly its almsot exactly like espresso made.As for the company, I am deploying in a couple of days when i ordered this coffee maker. When amazon said the arrival date was past my deployment date, i contacted the company and explained the situation. They replied in a matter of hours and told me they were shipping that day and changed the shipping to 2 day for free. I give the product and the company 5 stars.The only thing i wish was different is the company is not an amazon prime company so i paid for shipping. Not a big deal because there were only a few companies that had this product in and of all those companies, they had the cheapest price. It was even cheaper after shipping.
