review/summary: Would not buy againreview/text: I bought this model in June 2012. Have used it 2 or 3 times a day since that time. Previous reviews have voiced my exact sentiments.PROS: It works, coffee is hot and tastes good.CONS: Water not the cleanest; "Prime" error enough to think about throwing it away (although disconnecting plug from outlet resolves the error but it shouldn't have to come down to this).As for it labeled as expensive? Come on. If it's too expensive for you then don't buy it.Final thoughts: I still have it and will continue to use it. But I will not buy another Keurig coffee maker again.
