review/summary: Water pitcher.review/text: This is such a great water pitcher. We have used brita for quite sometime, but got tired of having to refill it after 3 glasses of water. I seen this and thought why not! I am quite pleased with it, its large and we can go days without filling it. The filter last a alot longer (3 months compared to 1 month with brita) The water tastes a lot better.
