review/summary: Great little heater and QUIET!!review/text: I have been looking to replace the heater in my office at work. I didn't want one with a blower as they are usually too noisy. This is a great heater - it heats up quickly and is very quite. No sound at all. I have a lamp and this heater on one surge protector so I have a visual that the heater is on so I don't forget to turn off before leaving. It's that quiet.
