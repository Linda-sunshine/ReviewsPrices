review/summary: Great Expresso in a small package :)review/text: I have had this Expresso maker for just a few weeks, but have fallen in love. When I first got this product, I was worried about the time it would take to make my morning espresso, the space it would take up on the counter and if I would be able to make a quality coffee. I have since learned that it takes me about 7-10 minutes from start to finish (including warming it up) to make this and it is well worth this small amount of time. It is a small machine that takes up the space of a small coffee maker, it is actually a little smaller than my k-cup machine was and makes FAR better coffee! It took me a couple of days to get it right, but I am now making excellent espresso. I have used the pods and they are okay in a jam, but I grind my own coffee and it is so good! The steamed milk makes it even better and that also takes no time at all!
