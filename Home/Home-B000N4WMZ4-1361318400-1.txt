review/summary: Paint chips VERY easilyreview/text: I have had this pan for 3 months and have been very delicate with it. I use it often but I've only washed it by hand. However, we are starting to see several chips in the paint, particularly in the handles and we are not happy with it. It's a beautiful pan, but with the chipping it's looking less beautiful all the time!
