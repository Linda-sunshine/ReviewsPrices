review/summary: great little rice cookerreview/text: This thing is awesome. I love the size and how amazing rice tastes after using it. I've had a 10 cup Oster digital fuzzy logic rice cooker before after using some crappier ones in the past that always burned the bottom, but even that one was good but no where in the same league as this one. I know its a huge step down in size, which is what I really need since I am single with a roommate and only need to make enough for 3-4 people at most. I'm keeping the other in storage for when I have more people over. Anyway, I've used this thing a handful of times and every time I'm met with great looking, smelling, and tasting rice.
