review/summary: Former owner of this cleaner's predecessorreview/text: First off, this carpet cleaner does a good job cleaning carpets. In fact, I think it probably is a bit better than the Hoover SteamVac I had until recently.One potential negative is the abundance of flexible plastic used in its construction. The electrical foot switch and the handle release foot switch seem to be headed for premature failure, IMHO, due to the type of plastic used combined with the fact they are foot operated. The unit I used to have utilized a rigid reinforced plastic foot switch for the handle release. It was plenty strong for 5 years of regular use.Another drawback for me is the change from mixing the soap and water in the machine via a switch on the handle. One could just fill up the water tank with water and then wash and rinse small areas in a single run. Now the user has to wash first with premixed solution in the single tank then go clean out the tank, refill with clean water, and come back for the rinsing. This sucks if you are chasing down animal pee spots in a couple of different rooms.On the other hand, if the intended use is mostly to clean whole carpets then this would be not much of a problem.In full disclosure, the machine I used to have was scrapped because the mixing mechanism failed and repairs were too much to spend on a 5 year old machine. I would imagine the manufacturer had seen this as a maintenance/warranty issue and simplified the design. That old machine was also $100 more expensive than this one.I think convenience is my biggest gripe and that is because my most common use is an almost daily spot clean of 1 or 2 places in different rooms.
