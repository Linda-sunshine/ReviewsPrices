review/summary: Worthlessreview/text: The water doesn't taste any better than the tap water. The water doesn't taste very good at room temperature. It tastes OK if I put ice in it. It seems pretty worthless to me. Bottled water from the market tastes better than this. Maybe this filter would be more useful if your tap water is terrible. I'm disappointed. The water container is good though, so I could use that without the filter. My favorite waters are Perriere and Dasani, but I normally buy 2 gallon jugs of water.
