review/summary: I love this! Great purchase!review/text: As a college student, I wanted to save money when purchasing my bed, so I bought the most basic queen mattress the store offered. I figured I could invest the money I saved in cheaper alternatives to make my bed more comfortable. What a great decision! I purchased this mattress pad a week and a half ago and it is amazing. I honestly feel like I'm floating on a cloud. Although I haven't had it for that long so I'm not sure about the long-term durability of this product, I am very impressed thus far. My only tip is to know that it smells very strong of mint for the first few days. However, that was a good quality to me! I would suggest this to anyone looking to make their bed more comfortable without breaking the bank.
