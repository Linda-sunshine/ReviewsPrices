review/summary: Never going back to microwave popcornreview/text: Up until I was gifted this popper the only popcorn I had eaten at home was greasy, salty, often either a little burnt or largely unpopped bag popcorn. First time I went to use it I just wiped it down with a barely damp cloth and let it air dry, filled the butter/measuring cup level with kernels, dropped them in, put the cup back on the top and plugged it in. It is a little loud, but really no louder than a hairdryer. Within probably fifteen or twenty seconds the kernels started to pop and from there it was an avalanche of perfectly popped corn. All but a few eager kernels that hopped out early and those that weren't going to pop anyways popped just fine, just think of them like clams or mussels, some just aren't going to open because they can't and you don't eat those.With butter, without, it's all delicious and not a burnt kernel to be seen. And yes the plastic will be slightly soft after all of that, that's why they tell you not to remove the lid, not only is it hot, but removing it will make it lose it's shape. Just let it cool down while you're eating the popcorn and come back later to clean it up.One thing I do suggest is when you prepare the butter for the cup cut it into small cubes and let it sit out until it softens, it'll make the melting much easier, although you still may need to stir it a little. You could even just skip the cup all together and nuke the butter, does make clean up that much easier, but it's fun to watch it melt.One other suggestion is to take some of the naked popped corn and treat it like cereal, put in a bowl and pour milk over it with a bit of sugar, surprisingly tasty!
