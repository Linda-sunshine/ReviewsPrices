review/summary: Worst kettle I have ever ownedreview/text: This kettle gave me problems in less than 2 months and finally died. I had a very bad coil burnt smell in the water for nearly 2 months and now it stopped working completely. I dont understand why Hamilton Beach makes such useless consumer products.
