review/summary: Dribble Cupreview/text: Congratulations to Black and Decker. They have managed to design the perfect dribble cup.The coffee maker itself works fine and makes a nice one cup serving which certainly reduces the amount of coffee that I normally would end up throwing away. However, one cannot drink from the cup/lid without coffee dribbling down one's chin and/or ending up on the front of one's shirt. This is particularly frustrating, if not downright dangerous, when one is driving. Cannot recommend this product.
