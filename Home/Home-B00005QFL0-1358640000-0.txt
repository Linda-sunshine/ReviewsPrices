review/summary: Love, Love, Love the Bread Machinereview/text: I had my first one for years. I wore it out. I bought a second one to replace it. I would not consider any other model because the yeast dispenser is the best. You put the yeast in the top and you don't have to worry about keeping it seperate fron the other ingredients. It releases the yeast when needed. I just can't say enough about this bread machine. I would highly recommend it.
