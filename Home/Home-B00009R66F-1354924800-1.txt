review/summary: Adore itreview/text: I bought this machine because I was borrowing an old carpet cleaner from my family that I desperately needed to return. I have those types of pets that some days... you just want to pull your hair out.I &#34;tested&#34; a spot of white carpet (or it was white... years ago), and was amazed at the results. This did a much better job than the previous carpet cleaner I was using. I love the surge option which does work great. I have small hands so I always feel a bit odd pushing both buttons but it works and seemed to clean up some older set-in stains.The furniture attachment is slightly awkward to put together but I found this to be true of the older model I was using. There is this part in the dirty water tank that you have to slide out and down which makes you feel like you're about the snap it off and break it. Scared me the first time but nothing bad happened. It was simple enough to take a part and go back to using the carpet cleaner.I haven't had any issues with leaking... yet. The old carpet cleaner would leak out any solution you left in the tank if you left it sitting. This SteamVac has yet to do that which is a relief because if I end up with more solution than I needed, I can have time to prepare another room without worry that it will all leak out onto the floor.
