review/summary: Great Thermosreview/text: It keeps liquids cold or hot for hours. I went camping in ten degree weather and made tea before bed. When I woke in the a.m. it was still warm. 16OZ so it holds enough fluid to help hydrate. Make sure all the seals are dry before you close it up othrewise it can leak a little.
