review/summary: Great popper!review/text: Super easy to use, all of the popcorn ends up in the bowl with no real effort on my part, and it only leaves one or two unpopped kernels in the bottom. Love it! It is louder than I expected, but the fact that there isn't popcorn all over the place completely negates the noise factor! It's also very easy to clean, which I love.
