review/summary: I Like itreview/text: It does have some drawbacks like if you use a big cup like me and my wife then you are going to get a half cup and till I get the hang of it I do not seem to know when it is out of water I just stand there and we me and the machine stare at each outer till I check the water and sure enough it out but it is simple to refill.I like the fact that the coffee is fresh tasting fast to recover for another cup and I do not have to drink coffee that was made last night
