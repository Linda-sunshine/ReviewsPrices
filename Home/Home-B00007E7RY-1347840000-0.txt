review/summary: Absolutely huge and loud!review/text: These air purifiers are huge and even on low they are so loud they drown out the sound for the TV. What is worse, they do not seem to help eliminate cigarette smoke ... at least not on low. I would try high, but it is just too loud.Update: After several months I have decided these are absolute crap. They do not remove smells and they are way too loud. Do not buy.
