review/summary: worst coffee everreview/text: it is a cheap mako machine by amazon's description, listed under espresso mashines, that is about all i can say good about it. the only directions are on the side of the box.unlike other expresso machines you apparently dont pack the grounds, if you do, you get 4 tablespoons of coffee that is so strong that you cant drink it. plus it takes about 15 to 20 min to brew. i did not have any problem with the handle melting like others did and i have a gas stove. the second batch i made with reg coffee grounds instead of expresso and also used a more course grind. i did not pack at all. it produced 1.5 cups this time which was pretty much full. so not sure how it is a 6 cup espresso mashine. maybe thats in the directions they forgot to include. maybe it takes 3 brews before the grounds are used. anyways my measureing cup says 2 cups will just about overflow the unit on top. also maybe they are assuming a cup as in a tiny drinking cup that is only 1/3 cup of coffe or less.anyways the coffee it produced was bitter compaired to the same in a coffe pot. if you check it before it is done perculating it causes a mess. it takes about 10 min to get a full 1.5 cups. i bought it to make espresso but it doesnt fill that purpose. i tried coffee, it doesnt fill that role either. not sure why people are defending this unit but if you want regular USA coffee or espresso dont bother.
