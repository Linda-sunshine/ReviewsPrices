review/summary: Very good flavorreview/text: After seeing what was involved in making a cup of coffee with this device, I expected to put it away in the closet and keep it there. But after a day or so I got it back down, and I've used it for every cup since. The taste is worth a few extra steps, and I've developed a very fast cleaning method, which took a little experimentation.
