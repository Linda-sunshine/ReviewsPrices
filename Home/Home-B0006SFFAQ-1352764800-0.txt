review/summary: So far, so goodreview/text: We had borrowed a similar Cuisinart unit from our daughter after our last cofeemaker bit the dust. We liked hers so much we bought this one which is identical except for the glass carafe. It makes good coffee but I still have fond memories of my old Krups which I had for 4 years and made the best coffee ever. The newer Krups models are just not very good. So far the new Cuisinart is, from our experience, the best coffeemaker currently available.
