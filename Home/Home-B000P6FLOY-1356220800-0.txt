review/summary: A nice, cheap meat thermometer and timer.review/text: Sure, there are better options out there. And, frankly, if you're willing to spend a bit more then you're probably better off trying them. But if you're not eating a consistent diet of dangerous-if-undercooked foods, this little sucker will do you just fine.Strong and thick casing. Feels like you could drop it off a cliff and it'd survive. Nice sturdy buttons, too, though the on/off button is not only on the back for some reason, it's also smaller than a gnat's nose. That's my biggest gripe for this item.Tells the temperature just fine, though! That's what this is for, right? There's even a clip for the thermometer gauge so it can attach to pans and pots on stovetop. A nice little addition (though it's a bit flimsy and, honestly, I never need it).Long cord. Sturdy, too, like the rest of the unit. Gives you a nice, lengthy reach so you can attach the SUPER strong magnet to your oven door or your fridge or grandma's metal replacement hip or whatever. This is a real dealbreaker when it comes to other similar items, for me, since these thermometers usually slide all over the place. Not with THIS magnet, though!A very nice little thermometer/timer for the price. Solid. Sturdy. Sold!
