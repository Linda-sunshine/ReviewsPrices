review/summary: Easy, fast, delicious and healthyreview/text: The Breville 800JEXL is the best juicer I've tried, it's easy to use in every way and makes great, healthy juice fast! The way it was designed makes it so easy to use. The feed tube is large so you don't have to cut up most fruits or vegetables, just give everything a quick was and push it in whole. The assembly is super easy, it all fits together smoothly so taking it apart to wash and putting it back together again takes just a second. Washing everything except the mesh filter is super fast, in fact, right after making my juice I immediately just rinse everything out and it comes out perfectly clean, no stain, no mess. I usually use a soapy sponge to clean it well once a week but I'm not even sure I need to do that much (and I use the juicer every morning). The filter is another matter, however. The pulp from fruits and vegetables get pretty well coated onto the filter and you do need to use the included scrubber brush to thoroughly wash it. I take care to do this well every morning so that it will continue to filter with maximum juice extraction. It's not a big deal though, It takes about 1-2 minutes to get it totally clean. And, most importantly, the juicer gets the most from every fruit and vegetable you put in, yielding copious quantities of healthy, vitamin and mineral rich juice that your body can utilize right away. I am getting a much bigger variety of greens and fruits in my diet now! I save all the parts of veges I didn't use before, like beet greens or celery and carrot tops, to juice. I also now buy and juice lots of vegetables and fruits I rarely ate before but that are rich in nutrients. I was concerned after reading the reviews here that it would be hard to wash, not extract enough juice from the pulp, and possible be too loud. I am happy to say that, for me, none of those things is true!
