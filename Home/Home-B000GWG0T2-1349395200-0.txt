review/summary: Very happy!review/text: I am so glad to have found this pan. After it received such praise from America's Test Kitchen it was often out of stock. It heats well, cooks evenly and does an all around great job. It is well deserving of the praise. The only thing I question is the Thermo-Spot on my pan never really changes color. The pan gets plenty hot, but the spot stays about the same color. Doesn't seem to affect the pan in any way. I wish it came with a lid.
