review/summary: Great little Vacuumreview/text: I have nothing but great things to say about this vacuum. Once you understand that it is a small (handheld) room vacuum, more than it is a large handheld vacuum, you will have your expectations set appropriately. Great suction, lightweight, long cord, and easy to use and clean.
