review/summary: Good but more Bad.review/text: OK. So there are a few things that I find rather annoying with this machine.1: This thing vibrates like crazy. If you don't hold the cup, it will vibrate right off the machine when you are trying to make the espresso. ( This could be something wrong with the unit )2: The tamper ( the press you use on the coffee or espresso grinds ) is attached to the unit, it can't be removed from what I can see. This is just stupid and creates a huge mess if you try to use it because of its placement. It just makes it difficult to clean and get grinds everywhere if you use it. I have my old one from my last machine and am just using that.3: The steamer is very low to the counter. You would almost have to put this machine up on something to get a coffee cup under it. The arm is also very very short and it's difficult to really get a good froth out of it. I had to get a small tea cup to froth the milk and I pour that into my coffee cup and then the espresso I made. So it takes 3 cups to make one drink. Silly.4: I have had some issues with this leaking a little espresso. I made sure there was nothing blocking the rim, there grinds where not too high to get a good seal and it was in nice and tight.What I like:1: The water pitcher is inside the unit and pulls out easily with a handle. Easy refill! Great.2: This unit seems to heat up rather quickly.Thats all I got on the likes.____So Frustrated with this unit. Was really missing my espressos when my last unit broke.I'm thinking I will have to continue my hunt and end up spending a lot more money on a unit to get something better. I hoping this would be a good machine. I don't need a lot of bells and whistles. I just want a cup of espresso without a big production.
