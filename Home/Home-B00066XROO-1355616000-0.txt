review/summary: Bad Shippingreview/text: Box was damaged when it arrived. There was a large hole in the side of the box. It was also a Christmas gift but since it came only in the box that the griddle was in, my mom saw it before I could get to it. Since everything else from Amazon that I have bought comes in a plain box I thought this would be the same but I was wrong and now she knows what she is getting for Christmas.
