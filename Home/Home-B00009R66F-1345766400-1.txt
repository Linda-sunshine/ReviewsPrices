review/summary: Seems to be OKreview/text: I ordered this Hoover Steamvac after reading all the reviews and used it for the first time this week. I must say, I purchased it from Amazon because of THEIR customer service and NOT Hoover.Putting it together was a breeze but I do see where reviewers were concerned about quality. Some of the plastic parts seem extremely fragile and cheap. I will be sure to be very careful with stepping on the on/off and release buttons.Since I had never owned a carpet cleaner I cannot compare. This was really easy to use. We recently had some quests leave the house and I saw where their coffee dripped on the carpet going up the steps. This cleaner just wiped those stains clean. I thought I would do another room and I was horrified at what I saw in the dirty water tank (EEEEEEEEK). All in all, this did a really nice job, although some stains were left behind...but better. Cleaning the machine was easy enough, just a painful process. Spilling water on the floor to clean in bottom inside of the machine worked well.I am keeping my fingers crossed that this lasts. I did not experience any leaks when I cleaned the stairs using the attachment. The only problem I had was balancing the machine on the stairs because the hose was not long enough. It is just amazing at how fresh the rooms smell after using.
