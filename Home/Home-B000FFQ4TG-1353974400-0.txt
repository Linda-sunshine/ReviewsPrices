review/summary: Best coffee pot everreview/text: We bought this to replace a Mr. Coffee that didn't deliver and a Keurig that failed after 1 year.The design of this machine is great. The water poor area cover slides to the left or right to fill. This means we can put the machine under the cabinets with no problem. The machine brews a full pot in under 3 minutes. The plastic filter basket is hard and durable, there is no plastic smell while brewing. Both the carafe and filter basket are dishwasher safe. The machine does not get hot even though it keeps the water ready to brew. Great machine, we love it.
