review/summary: Great product, but not as expectedreview/text: I should said that the Mixer itself and the whole purchase, shipment, delivery, etc. process was great.The only negative point is that I browsed for a 240V Mixer, and that was what amazon.com search engine returned, but not what I received.I didn't returned because I don't live in the US and I didn't want to open the box while on travel. So, once back home in Buenos Aires, I realized that it was a regular US 120V/60A one. Nothing that we can't solve, but definitively not the item that we were expecting.
