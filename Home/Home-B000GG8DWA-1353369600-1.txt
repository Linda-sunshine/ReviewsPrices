review/summary: Perfect Heaterreview/text: I wanted a light weight radiant heater that could put out just the right amount of heat.It is ALL OF THAT! The only slight sitch is that I kinda wish the side control had the writing on the side of the dial so I didnt have to turn the unit to change the setting. But,so what.It works great!
