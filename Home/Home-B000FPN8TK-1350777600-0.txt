review/summary: Lovely loose-leaf teapot!review/text: This little teapot (16 oz) is perfect for a large morning cup or two small cups of tea. I love how easy it is to clean: just rinse and dump.I've noticed that the valve on the bottom is a bit smaller than some of my wide-mouthed teacups, but if I hold the teapot at an angle and press down on only part of the cup's lip I can still initiate release without making a mess. The only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is because the pot does not hold in heat well. After 3-4 minutes of steeping (depending on the tea), I feel my tea has cooled too much.
