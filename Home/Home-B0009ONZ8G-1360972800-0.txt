review/summary: Considerable disappointmentreview/text: The machine is far too unwieldy., The hose attachment is too rigid; its limited flexibility makes it all but impossible to keep it attached to the machine. A real nuisance and a significant obstacle to the machine's use.On the positive side, it seems to have a great deal of drawing power, too much, though, to make it safe for use on small area rugs.But a good buy for the price.
