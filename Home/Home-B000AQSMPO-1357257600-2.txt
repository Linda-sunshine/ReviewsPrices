review/summary: Save Your Moneyreview/text: I gave it 2 stars because when it DOES work it does a decent job of brewing a cup of coffee - again, when it works. Keurig coffee makers have big problems with an issue they call &#34;prime&#34;. It has to do with the draw of water off of the water tank to the heating tank itself. When &#34;prime&#34; begins to show up in the display you have to go through a process in order to hopefully clear the fault. It is such an issue Keurig actually has a video on how to &#34;solve&#34; the problem and then notes at the end to call Keurig if it does not remedy the situation.We are now on our third machine due to this. Seems once it occurs it begins to what I call &#34;snowball&#34; and begins to become more prevalent. And yes, we have 2 inline filters before the water even reaches the tap. The problem is not the water - the problem is a design flaw of which Keurig has stuck their foot into.Come on. It's a coffee maker...it's not rocket science. When a person pays this much money to brew a cup of coffee that borders on StarBucks pricing, I expect it to work the first time, every time. Two thumbs down.
