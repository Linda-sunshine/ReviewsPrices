review/summary: rusty knivesreview/text: I purchased these knives to go with my new renovated kitchen, thought they would look nice on my counter... well they look nice alright in the block!!! these knives RUSTED after having them for only a month.when i called the company they replaced the ones that were rusted within three weeks the new replacements has rust spots on them so back to calling the company I was told that these shouldnt be put in the dishwasher thats why they rust! so i explained that it does't say that in the warranty! Back to looking for a nice set of kitchen knife set. my opinion these are junk dont wast your money.
