review/summary: 2nd purchase , both happyreview/text: I have owned one of these for 4 years. Recently I bought one for my daughter and she too is happy with her cup in the morning. Neither of us have lots of counter space but we still prefer a custom cup of coffee in the AM. The steamer work great. Her machine is amazingly similiar to ours...why change a good thing. I gave it 4 stars only because I have nothing else to compare it to and I am not a 'coffee snob&#34;. It's a better cup then what I would buy on the street. I did have one of those mail in rebates...see how that goes????
