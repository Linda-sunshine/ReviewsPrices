review/summary: Comfyreview/text: I ordered this glider on the 10th recieved it on the 20th. Fast assemble work, of course the hubby assembled it. Kids loves it especially the ottoman. As i sat on it and rocked on it for a few times I started to hear a creaky noise. I was like...oh no it can't be...maybe this thing can't handle my heavy pregnacy weight. I guess we will have to see after baby is born. I like it, its comfy. Good choice for the price, probably will have to invest in some new, more thick cushions later on. But all in all i like!
