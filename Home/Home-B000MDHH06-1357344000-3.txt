review/summary: Brilliant!!review/text: I just recieved this juicer in the mail and....WOW. It's powerful, well made, easy to use and squeezes out just a tad bit more juice than the "Jack Lalanne." If you're looking for the best bang for you bucks, then this has to be it, so do yourself a favor and buy this one.
