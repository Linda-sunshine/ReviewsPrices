review/summary: Effective but LOUDreview/text: The Honeywell HCM-6009 QuietCare humidifier is a good humidifier, but far from quiet. We bought three of them to help with the dry Colorado winters. One ended up being fairly quiet, the other two rattle loudly. One is so loud that it is not useable at night in a bedroom. They do put out a lot of humidity, and FEEL good when you walk in the room. But I would not buy them again had I known how loud the fan rattles the plastic frames.Another thing to be aware of is how heavy the two chambers are when you fill them with water. They are big, and need to be filled in the bathtub, unless you have a very deep sink. An older, frail, or smaller person may struggle to manage the weight. As a strong young adult I often want to avoid the hassle of filling these giants.
