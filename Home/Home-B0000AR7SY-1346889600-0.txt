review/summary: broken, not like new. useless.review/text: I recently purchased a capresso infinity burr mill and was using it quite happily on the coarse settings but when i went to grind a finer espresso the machine would not turn on, after inspection i realized that the little piece of plastic that hold some mechanism down to let the machine know the bean hopper is in place, was broken off.
