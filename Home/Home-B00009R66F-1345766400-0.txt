review/summary: Awesome - exceeds expectations!review/text: After seeing the reviews and the price drop, I finally pulled the trigger. Having rented many rug doctors, etc... to do my house, I found this Hoover the beat them all. Easy to setup and use, I was doing my carpets in minutes after pulling it out of the box.PROs: Easy to use, lightweight, manueverable, good balance and movement. Easy to dump and add water.CONs: Not many but... Would have liked a longer cord. The water fill tank sometimes leaks from the valve that sticks - just tap the valve and it closes up.That's it. Buy it!!!
