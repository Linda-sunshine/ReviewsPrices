review/summary: Love the spiralizerreview/text: I love this product. It is great for making asian-style salads. I spiralize carrots, yellow and green zuchinis, add some red pepper julienne slices, some red onion, cherry tomatoes and add asian dressing!! Very tasty and very pretty and healthy, too! Also great for doing spiralized potatoes tossed in a little olive oil and baked in the oven.Easy clean up and well made.
