review/summary: a bit problematicreview/text: It seems that between every cup of coffee (if making more than one) the machine requires priming. Also, one never knows exactly which size up one will get although one of the three choices is pressed.Also purchased Ekobrew cups to make coffee with own coffee. No matter how full I fill it, the coffee is weak.
