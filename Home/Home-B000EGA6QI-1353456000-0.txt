review/summary: I can make pureed soups nowreview/text: I use this blender mostly to puree soups, so I can't comment on people's negative experiences with the unit breaking when working with harder ingredients. For my purpose it's wonderful. I used to do the whole thing of pouring soup into the blender and back into the stock pot, and I actually avoided making those types of soups because of the hassle. Now it's just a matter of cooking the soup, sticking the blender in it, and a finished product 30 seconds later. Love it! It would probably work well for smoothies and baby food as well, but for harder items, I'd go back to the regular blender or food processor.
