review/summary: Broke after 2 weeks!review/text: I received this item for my baby shower and I was so excited to use it. We came home with our son and my husband sat in the chair and the legs just busted and broke. My husband is not heavy what so ever so we were really surprised about this. Plus..the chair is really petite and short..not made for men but for smaller women like myself..I have not even had a chance to enjoy it yet...time to go return it.ProsEasy to AssembleFits Anywhere
