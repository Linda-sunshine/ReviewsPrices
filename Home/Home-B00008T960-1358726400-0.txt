review/summary: Yeah things don't stick but....review/text: It really is stick proof and easy to wash but I hate that the &#34;oily&#34; feeling is normal, feels like it's not clean. Also food smell gets stuck no matter how much you scrub. Will reserve this for extra sticky baking or chocolate dipped goods and just use wax or parchment paper instead. I would have expected for the price and brand something better.
