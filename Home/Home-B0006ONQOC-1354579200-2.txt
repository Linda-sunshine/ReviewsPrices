review/summary: Would recommend this to any ice-cream lover!review/text: Have been making recipes included in the book that was included by Cuisinart. They are not only easy, but delicious! The machine is simple to operate and you can plug it in, mix your ingredients, watch it churn and then put the mixture in a container for freezing -- in under an hour! YUM!
