review/summary: Almost 14 years old and still going strongreview/text: This slicer was one of my first amazon purchases. I bought it because it had good reviews and was inexpensive. It was supposed to be a temporary purchase until I could afford a better mandoline. I have yet to replace it. It works really well for anything that you need cut into thin even slices - much better than my food processor. Great value.
