review/summary: Amazingly slick, good weightreview/text: Super slick, heats evenly, nice weight, AMAZING price. The America's Test Kitchen review was right on.Some reviewers complained about pans being bowed up in the center. Because of this, when I got my pan and washed it before my first use, I briefly convinced myself it was bowed. It turns out that it can LOOK as if liquid (namely water) flows from the center out to the sides when there is a very small amount in the pan; this (in my case, anyway... maybe some people really did have misshapen pans) is just due to surface tension and the INCREDIBLY slick coating. If you don't believe me, perform two 'experiments': first, put as much water as you like in the pan, and then just dump it out (it'll be bone dry); second, put a little bit of water in the pan, and swirl it around or push/pull it around with your finger (it'll want to stay together in one bubble-like pool/puddle). Finally, before thinking it's bowed, make sure you put it on an actually flat surface (like your counter... stovetops can be less-than-flat, and pans don't necessarily sit flush on them). Then, add small amounts of water SLOWLY and from a LOW HEIGHT to various spots in the pan. If the water pools and stands where you poured it, you've got yourself a flat pan (and a case of negative review hypochondria, just like I had at first before doing these little 'tests').
