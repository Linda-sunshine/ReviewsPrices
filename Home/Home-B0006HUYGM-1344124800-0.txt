review/summary: Eureka Handheld Vacuumreview/text: Pros: It worked really well. It is very handy to be able to get my dog's hair off my couch and from my car. It has a very powerful suction and does a great job.Cons: The only con is it needs a better hardware like a smaller nose tube or something to get into the cracks and hard to reach area. I am not sure if there is an attachment you can purchase separately for this.
