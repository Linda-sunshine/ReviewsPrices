review/summary: Don't purchase, a fire hazard.review/text: This is our third one of these, and we have only been in our house for 3 years. My wife called me this morning to tell me that there was smoke coming out of the coffee maker, and then it died. The first one we bought at costco, the second was from amazon, and the third was from Kohl's so it isn't store related. A coffee maker should last more than a year, and certainly shouldn't start on fire. I won't purchase again.
