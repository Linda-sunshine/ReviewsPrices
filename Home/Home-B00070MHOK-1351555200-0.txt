review/summary: Disappointing!!!review/text: After reading all the reviews I thought for sure this would do the trick but this steamer fell short leaving me very disappointed with it's performance. I purchased this to take along on a family vacation, it's small size is perfect to put in a suitcase. Like other reviewers I found it frustrating not to have an on/off switch only because it is easy to walk away and forget to unplug it. I didn't think the on/off switch would be such a big deal but because the water evaporates so quickly it could be very dangerous leaving it plugged in for even a short amount of time. It took us HOURS to steam wrinkles out of just a few outfits and because the water reservoir is so small you have to stop to refill the steamer about every 5 minutes! I didn't think this steamer was going to work at all until I accidentally discovered that the only way to get a wrinkle out was to hold the steamer right up against the clothing which of course leaves a wet spot in most areas!! Sure, this little steamer was a great price but knowing what I know now I would have spent an extra $20 to get one of better quality that actually works!
