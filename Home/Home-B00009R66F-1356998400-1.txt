review/summary: Does a great job ,really leaves the carpet dry if you go over it several timesreview/text: I have used a premium model of this machine and I find this one does a better job of cleaning but you can't switch between cleaning and just rinsce. Often times to eliminate the build up of detergent residue I just use water with out any detergent and you can't switch back and forth as is an option on the deluxe model. The. Recovery tank is much easier to dump out and clean.
