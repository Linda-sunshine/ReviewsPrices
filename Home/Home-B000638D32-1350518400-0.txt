review/summary: Great blade, but I don't love the handlereview/text: Like the Victorinix santoku, this knife is SHARP and lightweight. Unfortunately, for me (tiny hands), it's not that comfortable, although the santoku is.I should say that my mom has this same knife, and hands the same size as mine, and she loves it, so your mileage may vary. For me, this handle is too big, and I feel like my wrist is an awkward angle. I don't know why it's different for her.All that said, I love this line of knives. they're thin, lightweight, super sharp, and super sturdy. They seem like a different theory in knives than thicker and heaving blades like Henckels, but, honestly, I prefer these, and I suspect they'll last just as long.Overall, highly recommended, especially given its competitive price point, but beware that the handle may not be ideal for small hands.
