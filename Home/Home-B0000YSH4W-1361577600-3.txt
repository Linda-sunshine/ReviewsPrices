review/summary: Great Book for Younger Readersreview/text: Jonah, aged 12, is selected to be a receptacle for a futuristic society's memories in this book for young readers. Lowry's portrayal of a "perfect" society, with assigned jobs, clothes, spouses, and children, is as frightening as it is interesting. Its frank discussion of sexuality, infanticide, and suicide are perhaps a little dark, but a reader mature enough to work through Lowry's language should be able to deal with these parts of The Giver.Lowry's concoction is honest and hard-hitting. It is definitely a dark look into a possible future. It's important for the new generation to embrace the idea of individuality for the betterment of a whole society.
