review/summary: Great apartment vacuum but a little too loudreview/text: This is a great vacuum for the price. The size is perfect for my townhouse apartment. It does a good job of sucking all the dust and junk out of the carpet but it is just too loud to be perfectly pleased with it. I can't tell if it is the motor or the belt that is squealing, but maybe it just needs a break-in period to go away. Even if the noise doesn't go away, it isn't a big deal. I can put up with it for the short period of time it takes to vacuum a room or two.It isn't the lightest of vacuums either, but it gets the job done effectively. Again, for the price it's a deal.
