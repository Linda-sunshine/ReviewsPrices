review/summary: Cheap lids are difficult to attach and gets too hot to touch when cooking in microwavereview/text: I wanted these as an alternative to microwaving in plastic containers (which is reported as being unsafe). Be aware that glass (of course) gets very hot in the microwave. There is no cool place to grab the container, so it becomes a bit of a chore wrestling it out. If you had a similar intent, then keep that in mind. I know pyrex sells an alternative with a handle, which you might want to consider, despite the price and storage size increase.Also the lids are very cheap and immediately get warped. They are still usable, but a constant pain.Decent product.
