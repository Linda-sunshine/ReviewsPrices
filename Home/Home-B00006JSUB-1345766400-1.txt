review/summary: The Busiest Pan in my Kitchenreview/text: I have purchased several Lodge Products. This skillet is by far the busiest pan in my kitchen. I use it daily.I love to cook, and this skillet is so versatile. I can sear steaks, make sauces, and wilt greens. I can simmer gravy, reduce pie filling, and fry eggs. All in this skillet.I have a smaller skillet for light jobs, but the 12 inch is perfect for everything. I am cooking for two, but this skillet will easily accommodate more. Plus, if you love to cook, but don't have a large family, I urge you to get this large skillet. You will use it, I promise.
