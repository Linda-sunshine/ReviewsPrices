review/summary: Broke in 6 monthsreview/text: I am almost at the point of hating cuisinart products. I've had about 4-5 products that broke within 1year of normal usage. And this one was the worst of all. Like those pretty colors and while it works, it just wore fine. But the connector seems flimsy and no time burn out and the things stops working. I've had another cuisinart hand blender, a dual blender cum food processor, two toasters, all broke. I wish Braun still made blenders, they were the best.
