review/summary: Good buyreview/text: grinds coffee perfectly for my aeropress. (set to upper notch of &#34;fine&#34; setting)This unit is is difficult to clean which may be typical of all burr grinders. The brush they include is a joke, you will eventually get a new one.After each usage, I grind a couple of scoops of rice at the extra fine settings then use some compressed air to get the rice dust out. I would love to be able to grind enough for a single cup just before each brew, but cleaning would take up too much time!
