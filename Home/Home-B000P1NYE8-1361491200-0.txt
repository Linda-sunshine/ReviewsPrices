review/summary: not accuratereview/text: when i first got this scale, it seemed cheaply made. it fits in your pocket, but is rather bulky to be a pocket size. it is also not accurate at all. If you're weighing anything less than 2 grams it wont even register it, and if you're weighing anything more, it will be off. i tried to calibrate it and it didn't help at all. i would definitely not recommend this product to anyone and would return it myself if it was worth the price. In any case, you get what you pay for.
