review/summary: christmas present for my wife (12&#34; skillet)review/text: My wife was intent on making her holiday cornbread with a new recipe that requires a cast iron skillet. I gave this to her before christmas for her holiday cooking. Well, let's just say that the cornbread was awesome and I was praised to all by a very appreciative wife. She loves it. Our other one from Cracker Barrell took legs and hasn't been seen in a few years. She said this one was just as good if not better because it was pre=seasoned. Thanks so much
