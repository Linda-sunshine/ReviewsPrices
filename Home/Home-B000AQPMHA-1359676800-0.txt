review/summary: Keurig B40 Bresing Systemreview/text: I love the product BUT I expected it to be complete. I received no filter kit or filters with it and a handful of coffees - most of which I didn't like. I didn't expect chai tea or all the other stuff that was included in a separate bag with the coffee maker. I had to order the filter replacement kit and filters which were a bit costly considering I thought it would be included with the purchase.
