review/summary: So far so good!review/text: We have had this pan for almost a month and use it every day. So far no warping, no issues with the liquids in the pan running to the edges.The only issue we've had is that when the center red circle shows that the pan is ready, a lot of times it's too hot and will burn what you put in the pan. We only turn the burner up halfway (glass top electric range) but if I wait for the indicator and then put in some butter, the butter will immediately burn. We need to fiddle with it some to really figure out when it's &#34;ready&#34; and when it's too hot.Cleans up like a dream!
