review/summary: 9 years and still working greatreview/text: I received this product as a wedding gift in May of 2003. I have used it regularly for over 9 years and it has never let me down. At least 4 times a week I use it for vegetables (to make my special spanish sofrito) and when I'm done I throw the blade, cup and lid in the dishwasher. Everything still works perfectly after 9 years of heavy use. Unfortunately when I moved across the country I somehow left it behind and had to order another one.
