review/summary: I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SMALLER (THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID, LOL)review/text: It was kinda too big but I'm going to keep and use it anyways. I currently bought the eight inch skillet from Lodge (first time owner) and waiting for the arrival. Seems to me I will buy more in the future just be sure you know the size you working with, you can't never have too much iron cast pans.
