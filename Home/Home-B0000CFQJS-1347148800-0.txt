review/summary: Mr. Coffee GTF2 Filter Basketreview/text: I bought this permanent filter to go with my new Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT. It is about 1/4 inch smaller than should be and the water filter that comes with the coffee maker barely fits. I had to take the handle off of it. Not worth sending back so I am keeping it. If you want a permanent filter, I suggest that you try and find one that is a little larger.Mr. Coffee GTF2-1 Basket-Style Gold Tone Permanent Filter
