review/summary: Oldie but Goodiereview/text: In October, 2008, I bought model D2030 Black & Decker iron from Amazon and paid almost $50 (including S&H) for it. I have used it as my only iron for all this time and it is still just as good as new. In my opinion, it is an excellent choice for ironing all types of fabric.
