review/summary: Well built and easy to clean juicerreview/text: Very happy with this purchase. We have used the juicer at least once a day for the last month without any issues. It tackled everything we have run through it with ease. (From fruit to hard vegetables like beets) if you are considering juicing this machine is well worth the money.
