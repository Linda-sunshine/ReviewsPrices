review/summary: Bad Brainreview/text: We received this grinder 2 1/2 years ago as a gift. It has been used daily ever since and has provided excellent service. It would be even more reliable if it had fewer features. Ours failed when the timer brains malfunctioned. An explanation of how the controls work is necessary here. You select how many cups worth of grounds you need with the slider switch and then push the start button. After a certain amount of time determined by the slider switch position, the machine stops automatically. Unfortunately, ours started automatically at 2:30 AM a few weeks ago, which was truly hair-raising, since the grinder is pretty loud. Our solution was to make do by moving the slider to "OFF" after grinding, which worked well for a while.However, one of us didn't move the slider to "OFF" after grinding a few days ago. We later noticed the bean hopper was empty and the grounds canister was very full, so we deduced that it had started itself again and ground all the beans that were there. Today we tried to grind some more and it failed to operate. I took it apart to investigate and discovered that the motor is fried. It must have run until it burned itself up.If the grinder had a simple on-off switch, this would not have happened. Cuisinart food processors are made this way. Why can't the coffee grinders be the same? Probably because the motor is not designed for continuous duty. We're now trying to decide whether to buy this model or something else.
