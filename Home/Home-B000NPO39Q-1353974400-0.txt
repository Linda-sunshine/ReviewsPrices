review/summary: Willow Tree Nativity Set(s)review/text: Simplicity gives an understated feel that recalls what is actually being portrayed; the reason we celebrate the Christmas holiday in the first place.Though they closely resemble hand carved wooden figures, and it is called "Willow Tree;" these figures are made of some kind of synthetic material in China. This set is keepsake quality.
