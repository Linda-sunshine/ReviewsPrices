review/summary: What warranty?review/text: My first coffee pot was made in America and lasted over 25 years. I could get replacement parts for it, too. Based on my past usage I bought another one in February 2011, it was made in China with one year warranty. Thermostat went bad August 2012. I guess I should be happy it lasted more than a year and I didn't have more damage than a poor pot of weak coffee. Farberware has ruined a good name and lost my business as I have gone through two pots in less than five years. Don't waste your money.
