review/summary: Buy Something Elsereview/text: Had high hopes for this but what a let down. Coffee is drinkable right after brewing. Not hot. The thermal pot holds &#34;warm&#34; coffee for about 2 hours. My old(15 years) Krups thermal pot's coffee was almost too hot to touch after 5-6 hours in the pot. Will start looking again for another replacement. It could be I got a bad one but still disappointed in the brand.
