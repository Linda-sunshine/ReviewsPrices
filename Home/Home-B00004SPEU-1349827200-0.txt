review/summary: Greatreview/text: This grinder works and goes beyond my expectation. It is my first grinder and even though I knew something must exist to grind stuff, I wasn't aware of the grinder until I got this one. I grind everything I can lay my hands on at home to see how well the grinder will grind. My family have enjoyed my cooking because I now grind spices better. It can grind dry fish from Africa, Egusi, Ogbono. How come I didn't know of this product before now is amazing to me. I would recommend the product to everyone.
