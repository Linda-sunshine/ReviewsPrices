review/summary: MMM MMM GOOD!review/text: If you're in the market for a new coffee maker that makes great tasting coffee the Cuisinart is the one for you. Let me explain.We had a Krups coffee maker that would allow the coffee to leak out of the carafe when pouring. The carafe with this coffeemaker won't leak. This is one major improvement from our old coffeemaker that is no longer in our house.I'm not reviewing all the different features of this coffeemaker because you probably understand all the features and know what you're looking for. This coffeemaker makes an excellent cup of coffee but you must replace the water filter when necessary and clean the coffee maker with its clean cycle.I'll most forgot, you can program this coffeemaker to brew coffee at a particular time. Waking up in the morning smelling fresh brewed coffee is great
