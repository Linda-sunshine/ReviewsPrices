review/summary: Lodge Dutch Ovenreview/text: This was 60% off so I bought it since I will be using it so rarely. Packaging was great but had paint chips falling out before I even opened it? One of the handle attach points appeared burned (darker than the rest of the metal) so the paint could not stay attached. There is a crack on the inside of the same handle attach point but for 60% off, it will work for me.
