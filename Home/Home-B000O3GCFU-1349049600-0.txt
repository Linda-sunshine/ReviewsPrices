review/summary: Husband Loved it...review/text: I heated up some chili and put it into the food jar for my husband to take to work one morning and he said he put it into the fridge at his work (forgetting that I had told him he didn't have to) and he said it was still warm when he opened it up. Also, easy to clean since it is such a basic design and my husband rinsed it out at work before taking home!
