review/summary: A Very High Quality Dutch Ovenreview/text: I am very pleased with my 6-Quart enameled dutch oven. The white enamel inside is slick and resists sticking very well and does not stain even when cooking paprika-laden Hungarian recipes. It holds and transfers heat just as one would expect from cast iron, so you can use a lower flame. I especially like the new metal knobs on the lids. Now I can use the whole think in a 450 degree oven for baking bread.
