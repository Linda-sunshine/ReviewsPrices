review/summary: Better shower caddy than my remodeler installed!review/text: I purchased this shower caddy in an effort to keep my shampoo, soap and razor from falling unto my shower floor and it works. My bathroom remodeler had installed a corner caddy which, while it looked nice, did nothing to prevent soap from slipping through and falling on the floor, let alone my razor. I'm a 3M fan (having just put the phone caddy which they also make to good use), so when I saw this I decided to give it a try and it definitely is worth the five stars I gave it.
