review/summary: Pinzon Hemstitch 400 thread count Egyptian cotton King Sheetsreview/text: OH MY gosh, I LOVE these sheets. iIwash them regulary ( weekly if not more) and they arre like new after months of use. The price was great. Down side would be that they wrinkle but, it is fine for it not going on a guest bed. If then if you immediantly take them out and get them on the bed almost all the wrinkles will come out. This is a must buy and I willl be buying more of these.
