review/summary: Great for Kidsreview/text: We moved to colder climates last year so sandwich and chips just wasn't enough for our kids on cold days.We wanted to get a thermos that looked nice, encourages the kids to bring it back home, and was functional at the same time. So we picked these up because we could get different colors for each of the kids.Now my husband will make them some hot soup at about 7:30 in the morning and by lunch time at 12:30 the kids have said everything is still hot. The other nice thing is they say all there friends comment them on their thermos.
