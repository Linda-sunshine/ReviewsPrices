review/summary: Impressivereview/text: I already made salad for two dinner parties and not only were the salads impressive but also delicious. I used raw carrots, beets, dikon, zucchini, and just simply dressed them with olive oil and lemon vinagrete. The plate was clean and I received so many compliments. Even the children eat it.I also have to say that it is really easy to use and to clean. I used warm water and a brush. I wish the material was better just because I'm afraid the plastic will stain in the long run or worse, break. I think I will get another one just in case they stop making it. There is a little bit of the vegetable left over after the spiral slice is done which is no big deal at all since I either snack on it while I finish cooking or save it for soups.I definitely recommend this for a creative and different but above all super healthy salad.
