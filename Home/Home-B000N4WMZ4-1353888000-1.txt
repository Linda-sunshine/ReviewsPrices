review/summary: EC6D43 Lodge Red Dutch Ovenreview/text: I've had Lodge Cast Iron Skillets for a number of years, but finally ran across a number of recipes that would be better served using a Dutch Oven. The price was reasonable, it shipped on time, performed well and is easy to clean. Would recommend it for any family kitchen.
