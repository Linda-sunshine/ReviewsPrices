review/summary: I Love This Knifereview/text: I bought this knife as recommended by America's Test Kitchen and love absolutely everything about it. The way it feels in my hand - the grip is easy and comfortable, the weight is substantial enough to make handling a breeze but not heavy at all, it's just right. While reading reviews for the 10" Chef Knife I came across one where a customer mentioned having a smaller kitchen so bought the 8" instead, that really resonated with me as my food prep area is very narrow - so I ended up buying the 8" and I am SO GLAD I did, because the 10" would have been unusable in my space. So please, take your available cutting area into account when decided what size.I also bought a sharpener at the same time, and have had to sharpen it only once in 6 months. It really holds an edge.I had no idea how awful my previous knife was until I bought a good one, a sharp one, a real one, it has really changed the way I cook for the better.
