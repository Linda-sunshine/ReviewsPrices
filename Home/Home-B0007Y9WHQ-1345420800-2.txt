review/summary: surprisingly wonderful!review/text: We made our first batch of zucchini pasta last night, turned out just right, easy, efficient and slick! The little machine while made of plastic is quite tightly engineered. The extra sharp blades fit in a little drawer underneath the unit. The price is very good for what you get.The new kind of pasta was tasty and almost as yummy as old style gluten pasta. My husband loved it!
