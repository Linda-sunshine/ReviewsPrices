review/summary: Love it !!!review/text: I bought this kettle as a gift for my 90yr old mother. Out of all the gifts I've given her in my life time, this one was the grand prize (her words). It is not too heavy for her to handle and looks great on the countertop. Since it is cordless, she is able to thaw her frozen birdbath on freezing mornings. It's so convenient to make her hummingbird sugar water as well as her morning tea and coffee. A huge plus is that it isn't made of plastic, like so many of the others on the market. I am ordering one for myself as well.
