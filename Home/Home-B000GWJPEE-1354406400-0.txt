review/summary: Not As Good As the Old Penguinreview/text: We bought a Crane Penguin humidifier 4 years ago and it has worked well. So we decided to buy another one for the extra dry winter days. The new penguin looked the same, but the electrical part (bottom half) of the unit was obviously different. The new penguin's vapor appeared weaker than the old one's, apparently there wasn't a fan to blow out the vapor as in the old one. The new penguin was slightly noisier than the old one, though it's still quiet. There was no comparison in the output: The new penguin took 33 hours to use up a gallon of water, while the old one can do it in 14 hours.
