review/summary: Love it!review/text: I would recommend this bread maker to everyone. I love every thing about it, other than a clunking noise during mixing. I can deal with the noise to have GREAT bread! Almost gave it a 4 star only because of the noise, and only because on the reviews I read, it stated numerous times on how quiet it is. Wonderful machine! If you like bread.....get it!
