review/summary: Only worked oncereview/text: I guess I made the wrong decision when I acquired the Dirt Devil Upright. I do have dog and cat hair in my house and it quickly picked up the majority for one room. I cleaned the container, but then when I tried to continue to use it again, it would not work as nothing moved to the container. So, I guess this was an expensive buy to clean just one room. Now, I need to either throw it out or return it, but before I do, I will see if there is some type of blockage somewhere, but seriously, should I have to do this after just one room?
