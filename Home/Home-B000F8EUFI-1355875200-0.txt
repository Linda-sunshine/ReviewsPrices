review/summary: Great Little Sweeperreview/text: I purchased this sweeper for a small apartment. I was surprised by how well it performs. I have a Dyson at my home and thought I'd be disappointed. It's perfect for my needs....small, lightweight, bagless & efficient! I do not know if I would recommend it for large homes or for excessive pet hair but who knows?
