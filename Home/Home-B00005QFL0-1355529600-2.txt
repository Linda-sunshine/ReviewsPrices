review/summary: So Far So Goodreview/text: I am giving it a four star rating because I have only used the machine twice. The results were very good and we love the smell of fresh baked bread without all the work of making it by hand. I still have to try making a loaf of wheat bread as my past experience with an old machine weren't always very good with wheat flour. I do like the feature that adds the yeast at the right time. With my old machine, it was sometimes difficult to get the bread pan snapped into place and then taking it out while it was hot could be a struggle. This bread pan sets in place and releases very easily.
