review/summary: Best iron I've ever used!review/text: This is a great iron, the best I've ever bought! I like that you can control the amount of steam that comes out by turning a dial. The cord rotates so it doesn't get tangled. The automatic shutoff is a great safety feature. All in all I give it 5 stars.
