review/summary: Great Blending Stickreview/text: I am very pleased with this blender stick. I use it everyday to make my shakes. I do soften the frozen fruit just a bit because it takes less time to pur&eacute;e it. I was amazed that the measuring cup held all I put in my shake eliminating having to use a larger glass. This has replaced taking out the blender and the cleanup afterwards. The stick is easily cleaned and very portable. It appears to be very reliable and would recommend it. Glad I decided to buy it at such a great price too!
