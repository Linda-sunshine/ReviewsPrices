review/summary: Works better than I expected.review/text: I honestly did not expect this thing to work very well, if at all. I don't know why, maybe because it seems too good to be true (I'm a HUGE fan of baths).I expected that this product would help keep some of the water from leaking out as quickly, but it does even better. None of the water leaks out at all! I am so pleased, I get tired of getting cold in the bath and having to fill the tub again (and talk about the waste of water!)I highly recommend this product.
