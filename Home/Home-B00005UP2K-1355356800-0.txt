review/summary: Not completely Satisfiedreview/text: I know everyone seems to love this mixer and I was very excited to get one as a wedding gift, but to be honest, I am not blown away by it. I have had this mixer for over a year now and I am definitely not in love with it. The design of the metal mixing bowl that it comes with actually prevents the beater from mixing in all the ingredients. I have to spend quite a bit of time trying to scrape the sides with a spatula and trying to scoop the middle out to the sides in order to have everything mix properly. The bread hook seems to work a little better than that. All in all, it is an ok mixer but my husband prefers our 20 year-old hand-me-down hand held mixer from his mother.
