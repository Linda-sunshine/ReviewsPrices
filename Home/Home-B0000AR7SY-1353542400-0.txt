review/summary: Solid grinder - solid valuereview/text: I have been using this device daily for 2 months and I love it !Thought I would never give up my trusty blade-style Braun grinder. Sorry, changed my mind and won't go back. I was looking for more uniform grind in the medium-fine range (for french press and for Keurig), and this definitely does that. And it does it at slow speed, which means that the coffee is not &#34;cooked&#34; by friction - so flavor is protected. It's quieter too.Some complain about static and &#34;stray&#34; coffee grounds all over the counter with burr grinders except those using glass vessels (this one has plastic) - I have seen nothing of the sort - but I do give it a bit of a jiggle every time just in case. It may also have to do with the fact that I grind small batches each time - but why not when it tastes better when freshly ground (how much coffee do you need for a pot-full)?I have the stainless steel model and am impressed by the weight and solid construction - I expect it will last for years.Definitely glad I made the switch - a good value for what I paid on Amazon.
