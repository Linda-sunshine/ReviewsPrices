review/summary: Beef Jerky mmmmmmmreview/text: I'v ben making Beef Jerky in mine & loving it. I'v added six trays to mine. In the past you had to rotate your trays but as advertised you don't haft to with the Nesko. I have nine tray on mine & have noticed no difference between the Jerky drying on top to the bottom. I usually dry about 10-lb's of hole meat pieces at a time witch usually takes about twelve hours. The unit is very quiet as well. I would recommend The Nesco to any one.
