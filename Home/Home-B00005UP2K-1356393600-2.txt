review/summary: A Necessity For Any Busy Kitchenreview/text: I never realized how difficult some of my recipes were until I purchased my KitchenAid Artisan Series 5-Quart Mixer. After going through at least two electric hand mixers a year, I am pleased to find that my KitchenAid Mixer has lasted through three Christmas baking seasons, at least a half dozen homemade marshmallow recipes, and more cupcakes and cookies than I would like to count. I have never had a problem with my KitchenAid Mixer, and would highly recommend this product to anyone who does a serious amount of cooking.
