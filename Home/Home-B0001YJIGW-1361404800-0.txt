review/summary: Works but doesn't fully suctionreview/text: Our bath is a garden tub, curved shape made out of engineered marble, the drain cover works but the suction cups don't suction all the way around. The top portion of the cover can't suction and maintain suction on the bottom as well. I have tried reshaping the product as described in the instructions but it doesn't solve the problem. That being said it still does its job.
