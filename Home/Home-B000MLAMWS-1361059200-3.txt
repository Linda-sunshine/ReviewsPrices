review/summary: great and/or trashreview/text: This is our 2nd 6 qt sized KitchenAid stand mixer. We have a love/hate relationship with KA mixers. You can knead bread with this bad boy, along with regular mixing, cheese grating, large assortment of attachments. But bread kneading, homemade bread, is so sublime, that we continue to get this mixer even though we knowthe nylon gears wear out. fast. 1-2 yrs light use, weekly at bestbut none of the other mixers can knead dough. so, KA has a great warranty and we replace as needed. Buying with our American Express card extends the warranty by a year as do some Visa & MasterCard accounts. KA is aware of the gear issue but they will not use brass or whatever material is more durable. We have killed 3 of the 4.5 qt size. This one is beginning to make noises indicating imminent failure. And so we will get a warranty replacement again. It is depressingly predictable but unless another company begins to market a mixer that works better for longer, we are stuck in this cycle.Buyer beware. Use a payment method with extended warranty protection. Enjoy it until it fails, repeat.
