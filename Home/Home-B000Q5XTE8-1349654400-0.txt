review/summary: Thrilled with the quality of this chairreview/text: We needed a new desk chair and had been to local stores and found that most in this price range were uncomfortable. The mesh back of this chair is contoured and breathable. The arms are adjustable in both height and width which really made the chair usable for a large framed person. Great value for the money.
