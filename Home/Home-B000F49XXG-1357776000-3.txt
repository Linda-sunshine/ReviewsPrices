review/summary: I love this machine! Quick and Easy!review/text: My darling husband purchased this machine for my birthday in November. He did a ton of research and this was the best machine for the price.I love this machine. I've been spending too much money in coffee shops for espresso and now, we use it every day. It is easy to use (especially with ESE pods), easy to clean and makes delicious.I would suggest buying a tamper (the delonghi plastic tamper is stuck onto the machine)Espresso Tamper 50 & 60 Mm Sizes Cast Alloy Hand Coffee. Also, I was able to find a small milk frothing pitcherStainless Steel 10oz. Steaming & Frothing Pitcheron Amazon which made a big difference for me with being able to froth milk etc. We also got a ESE pod samplerEspressotiamo Grand Sampler 72 ESE espresso podswhich allowed us to try 30 different espresso pods. Now we just order our favorites.I don't know if I'll ever become the sort of espresso drinker who has a $400 burr grinder and a $400 machine but I love having fresh, amazing espresso every morning. I am able to make a better espresso drink than 75% of the cafes out there, and I live in Portland, Oregon, the american home of good coffee.
