review/summary: We have 2 of these now.review/text: SO overall, this is a good product. My sister bought one of these about a year ago, and loves it. Matter of fact, she has been staying at my house, and using it to sleep on. She even has a 60lb lab that sleeps on it with her. She does use blankets, but it is on a cement floor and has not had any problems what so ever. She said she only has to fill it up with air about once a week. The one that I ordered, I have only had for about a month, and used it for 2 nights. I wasn't even the one sleeping on it. I got it for the kids because we had a lot of people here, and made the kids sleep on it. I laid on it the second day, and can say that for my liking, it was a little soft. I tried messing with it to get the firmness up, but it didn't seem to do anything. I guess, as long as I don't have to sleep on it all day every day, I am fine with it being a on the go mattress.
