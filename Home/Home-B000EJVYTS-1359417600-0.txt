review/summary: Wonderful productreview/text: I purchased this for our new house an have thoroughly enjoyed this product. My brother had one and I really enjoyed it when we were at his house cooking and you didn't want to have to lift the lid when your hands were full. Very great product and works great. The dog has figured out that he can walk up to it and it will open and has gotten things out of the garbage once or twice but I think he got bored with that now thank goodess. Very useful product and works great.
