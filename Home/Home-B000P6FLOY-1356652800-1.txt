review/summary: Still Going One Year Laterreview/text: Love this little guy. We use it regularly in the kitchen and on the grill. It's the most accurate digital meat thermometer I've used and the first one that hasn't failed on me. There are fancier models out there that are wireless, etc. But this one is excellent, has a loud beeper, a long cord, and is simple to use.
