review/summary: really inconvenient and weird smellingreview/text: These trays aren't rigid and it's really difficult to get the ice cubes out of the trays. Whereas with stiff trays the cubes just pop out, with these you have to push them out one at a time. Also, there is a weird smell. I don't know what it is -- vaguely silicon-y -- but it smells weird. And it makes the ice taste a little bit weird.Buying these just doesn't make any sense and I wish I'd gotten normal ones.
