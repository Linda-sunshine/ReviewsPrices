review/summary: Very effective for the $$$$review/text: This is a very cost-effective way to add significant moisture to a relatively large area. It seems to actually use 9 gal per day so it must be refilled daily, but at very little trouble. I'll probably buy another for another floor in my home. No itchy-scratchys this winter.
