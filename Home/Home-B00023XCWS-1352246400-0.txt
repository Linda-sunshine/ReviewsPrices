review/summary: 4 Years Old and Still Going Strong!review/text: This is one of the best purchases I've made on Amazon, in terms of value & quality.Bought back in January of 2008 for $11.99 and it has performed perfectly ever since then. It gets heavy use during the fall/winter and a good amount the rest of the year. Hasn't given me any problems at all.Excellent product and value!
