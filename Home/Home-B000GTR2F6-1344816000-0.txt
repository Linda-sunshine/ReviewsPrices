review/summary: Brokereview/text: I purchased this appliance a little over a year ago and when I woke up this morning to make a cup of coffee, I found it inoperable. It turns on, sounds as if it's about to brew a cup and then just freezes. I called customer service and after walking me through the trouble shooting process which included cleaning out the 3 spouts with a paper clip, the agent told me the machine is dead. He then told me my warranty was expired but then offered me the identical coffee maker for $79.99. Great deal? I think not after only a little more than a year of operation. Let me add that I am single and live alone so the coffee maker does not get heavy use and at an original cost of $179.00, I found this to be unacceptable. To be honest, I never loved the flavor of any of the k-cups I've tried anyhow, but used it more out of convenience. I won't be purchasing another Keurig but instead, looking at the single brewers that use the Senseo pods or similar. Not only are they much more inexpensive, but they're rated higher for taste, and they leave less of an eco footprint since there is no plastic but simply just a fibrous filter type pod. Keurig and K-cups have lost me as a customer.
