review/summary: Just what I was looking for - a compact, yet quality espresso machine.review/text: It was very helpful to read the reviews posted for this item. When the machine arrived, I was already prepared with an advice to read and follow the directions in the manual. It is very important to run it through to get the stale plastic smell out from the parts. I was also warned that it takes a little extra strength to position the handle correctly. I've been using it for a month now and see that it depends on how carefully I load the level of the coffee - it all adds to the possibility to make coffee exactly as you like it.
