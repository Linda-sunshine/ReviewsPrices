review/summary: Amazing!review/text: We were looking for an inexpensive, easy-to-use carpet cleaner, and stumbled across this one. We are so glad we ordered it! This SteamVac does an amazing job, especially considering the price. It's been a while since our carpets were professionally cleaned, and this thing has pulled up a huge (and disgusting) amount of dirt and assorted nastiness. Even though the onboard tanks are somewhat small, and need to be dumped/refilled often, I am still giving this cleaner 5 stars because it does such a great job!
