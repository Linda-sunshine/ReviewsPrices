review/summary: Cannot express how much I LOVE these products!!!review/text: I had wanted to make the switch to stainless steel or cast iron for the longest time since I absolutely abhor the health deteriorating detriment of &#34;non-stick&#34; cookware. Thank God I received this set for my birthday! I have had this set since May 2012 and these pans are excellent quality, simple to clean, and cook the best of anything I've ever used (and I used to cook in restaurants!). No, they are NOT non-stick, but if you know how to cook you won't have an issue with that anyway. I also received the wok and it is FABULOUS as well! Cooking is a joy to me again instead of a scary, Teflon-fake nightmare! I have an older electric stove with the stupid coil elements and they are not only a hassle to cook on because they tilt every which way, they normally heat very irregularly. That doesn't matter with these pans. They take the crappy heat my stove gives off and evenly cook whatever I desire! Making fudge and caramels for Christmas time was a disaster before since I couldn't keep an even temperature going (mandatory for candy making!). I don't have that problem anymore! Yay Cuisinart! So glad you offer this perfectly comparable set for loads cheaper than All Clad! :)
