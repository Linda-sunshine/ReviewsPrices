review/summary: Worth Every Pennyreview/text: I was looking for a coffee maker. I started researching and came across this product. With all of the 5 star reviews I thought it was worth a try. I'm glad I tried. This product is easy to use and makes a great cup of coffee. For the price you can't beat it with a stick!
