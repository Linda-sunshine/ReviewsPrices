review/summary: As advertisedreview/text: Just got my set in graphite. They are incredibly thick and soft, with a wonderful velvety feel. I put them through the wash and in to the dryer immediately, and as others have said, the lint is minimal. The 190 gram weight seems to keep the fibers together much better. I don't see any pilling at all after the first wash/dry cycle.Overall I am very happy with these sheets.
