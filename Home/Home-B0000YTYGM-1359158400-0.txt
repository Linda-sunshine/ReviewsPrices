review/summary: Larger than expectedreview/text: I thought my previous coffee maker was 12 cup, but it was not, only 10 cup.This works well making 10 cups of coffee. Good coffee and it keeps it hot.A slight defect is the marks for fill lines for water are very hard to see.I marked my usual fill line with tape.
