review/summary: minty and cozyreview/text: I got it a day early. I laid it on a spare bed and it took about 6 hours for it to decompress. Slept on it last night and it exceeded my expectations. The 2" padding is deep enough to offset my too hard mattress but not so thick that it is hard to turn over. (I tried a 6" memory foam once and it was like sinking into quicksand- made it impossible to turn over easily.) The mint smell is pretty strong- I woke up feeling like a peppermint pattie- but hopefully that will fade soon.
