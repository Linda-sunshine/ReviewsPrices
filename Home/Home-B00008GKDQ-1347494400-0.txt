review/summary: Love this productreview/text: I live in a small Manhattan apartment but love the taste of grilled foods so bought this. I absolutely love it, it fits perfectly over my burners (full size stove top) and heats pretty evenly. I always try to oil it down again after I use and wash it (without soap!!!) and it's proven to work wonders. Highly recommend this product!
