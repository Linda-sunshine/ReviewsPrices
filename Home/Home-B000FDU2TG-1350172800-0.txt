review/summary: No problems at allreview/text: I gave this blender as a gift to my daughter who has used it regularly for over two months. I don't know the make of her previous blender but she says her new KitchenAid works much better and is more quiet, especially when it comes to making smoothies which require crushing ice and blending frozen fruit.
