review/summary: GREAT COFFEE FASTreview/text: After eight years owning my first Bunn coffee maker, it finally started giving me trouble. It is still usable, but decided it was time to retire the old girl. I was happy with the first one, so it was a no brainer to purchase another one. This model is much more space-saving on my limited counter space, and looks great. The little bit of electricity it uses to keeping the water hot all the time is well worth it to be able to make a fresh, hot pot of coffee first thing in the morning without waiting. If anyone else is like me, the first thing in the morning isn't the time to try anything confusing. No muss, no fuss, just great coffee quick. Hopefully this one will last another eight years or more, but will not hesitate to buy another. All my family own this brand and also love it.
