review/summary: Great brewer, slight annoyance with with cleaning.review/text: I received this for Christmas and have used it just about every other day (maybe a little more) since then. My firs use was with a blood orange herbal which I thought had stained a section of the valve but it has since rinsed away. The tea brews well and exits the device surprisingly quickly. The design limits the chance of me spilling as I pour, which is very nice.The only annoyance is rinsing out all of the tea. Before receiving this I was using a single-serving french press for brewing tea and it rinsed out easily. The IngenuiTEA requires multiple rinses and a particular handling to ensure that the tea doesn't get hung up on the filter.
