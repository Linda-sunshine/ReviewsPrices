review/summary: Coolest kitchen gadget!review/text: I'm the only coffee drinker in our family and I didn't want another appliance cluttering up the kitchen. I did lots of research on single serve coffee brewers. It was a tough choice between a cone style and the Aeropress. I ended up choosing the aeropress with a reusable filter. I'm very happy with my choice. It's easy to use. Clean up is quick and painless. It's small enough to fit in the drawer next to the fridge.
