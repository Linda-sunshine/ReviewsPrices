review/summary: Simple, Easy to Use, Good for the Valuereview/text: My mom's old GE iron finally died after about 20 or so years and she asked me to purchase a new one for her. To be honest, I just looked up any available iron on Amazon that was sub-$50 and had a 4 star or better rating. This B&D; iron fit the bill.Pros:-Definitely easy to use. Gives a lot of different settings, but I doubt we'll use anything other than the warming iron for 99% of our use. It's always nice to have the luxury, though.-Price was definitely attractive. We didn't need a $100 iron when we only use it once or twice a month.-Operation (up till now) was smooth and consistent.Cons:-Not the most sturdiest looking iron (especially compared to all the old steel/metal ones). They do keep any plastic components away from the heat, which is definitely a must with any heated electronic/appliance. Given the price, you can't expect the construction to be like a tank. We weren't and we're fine with that.Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a decent iron you'll need only sparingly. Even if you iron more than once or twice a week, I'm sure this will be more than enough for you.
