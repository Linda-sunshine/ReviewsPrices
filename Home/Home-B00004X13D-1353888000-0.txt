review/summary: Awesome little Waffle maker!review/text: Yup! This is the Little Waffle Maker That Could! For the money it is what it is! It's a super simple waffle maker. Best thing is it works SO well! Nice and hot! Easy to clean too (with a little no-stick-spray)As long as you make yummy waffle batter, how can you go wrong!? Give this little waffler a go!
