review/summary: Great purchase!review/text: I am a college student and was looking for something cheap to use to make things like tea and hot chocolate for the cool weather or for when I am sick.This item looked to be the perfect size and was an amazing price and I am on a tight budget.Despite some bad reviews, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. I did not experience any strange taste or problems. This coming from someone who is just getting out on there own and is usually bound to mess something up. Set up was so simple and its quick whenever I need to use it.Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the cord is quite short, and plugs are limited in a cramped dorm.Other than that I am extremely happy to have this product!!! It's been working well for over a month now.
