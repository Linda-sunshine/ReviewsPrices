review/summary: Gel Fuelreview/text: I love this product. I usually burn two cans at a time and they warm the room just right. On chilly nights I can curl up with a good book and be warm and comfortable. I also enjoy hearing the crackling sound of the gel fuel. Sounds almost like a real fire in a fireplace.
