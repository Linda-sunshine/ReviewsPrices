review/summary: Oh Yeah. Hot Coffee Brewed Fast and Well.review/text: This percolator is a simple machine that does one thing really well: it makes a piping hot, evenly-brewed pot of coffee. No bones about it. This thing blows away my 100 dollar drip machine. It outperforms the single-cup brewers. It makes a high-quality brew comparable to the ones you get at coffee shops. The coffee is never burnt, even if you leave it in the pot too long. Coffee brews so hot and full of taste that I am always glad I purchased this. The drip machine never captured the taste of the coffee as well as this little guy. Some people get faulty machines, I see, but mine has performed well for many weeks now. Fingers crossed, coffee mugs full. :)
