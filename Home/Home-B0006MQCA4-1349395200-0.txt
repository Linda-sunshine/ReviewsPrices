review/summary: Better then brita pitcherreview/text: I've been using a brita pitcher for years but think i'll be throwing it in the trash after this product. Water tastes significantly better and pouring is a breeze. My only complaint is that due to its size it a hassle to refill but then again I like how I only need to do it once a week now.
