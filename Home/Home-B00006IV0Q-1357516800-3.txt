review/summary: Not reliable, disappointing productreview/text: I bought this percolator based on the enthusiastic reviews at this website and others. I will say this: when it works, it makes a great cup of coffee that is hot (better than drip makers) and tasty. The problem is the temperamental perc tube. The book advises that if the tube is not "perfectly" placed in the well, the unit will not start perc'ing. We had no problems the first month of daily use, but then we noted we'd have to reposition the stand-up perc tube a few times (no real rhyme or reason to the technique) to get it going. Finally it just wouldn't work (at just 2 mos after purchase.) We cleaned it, scrubbed it, etc, no use. We contacted Presto and they told us to mail it to a repair center, which we did. It came back with a note, "cleaned it inside and out, works great." We got 2 pots of coffee out of it before it started up the same way. Some mornings no problem, other mornings takes 4-5 tries. Believe me, we've standardized our technique, but no use!While this pot was at the repair place, I bought a Farberware 12-cup percolator. The coffee it brews is not quite as hot, but it's close, and it works every time. I note the Farberware pot has a tube well that's all one piece of metal (no seam), so that could be the difference.I say, just go with the Farberware model PK1200ss! Got it for $69.99 at Bed Bath & Beyond, also same price at Macy's.
