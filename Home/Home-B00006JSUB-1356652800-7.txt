review/summary: Great!review/text: Lodge is the best cast iron we have found. Do not buy the cheap chinese crap, the finish texture is horrible (affects cooking not just aesthetics) and may include poisonous metals in its production. While they say it is pre-seasoned, it needs to be properly seasoned prior to use or you WILL hate cast iron. Check out youtube for proper seasoning process.
