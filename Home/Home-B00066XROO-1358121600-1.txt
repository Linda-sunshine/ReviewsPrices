review/summary: The wife Loves it!!!review/text: Got this for the wife because she was tired of cooking 1-3 pancakes at a time in her large skillet. She popped this open right away and put it to use and was able to cook 9 pancakes at once. All the pancakes come out evenly cooked and in a fraction of the time. She also used this to cook bacon and the tilt n` drain feature worked perfectly.
