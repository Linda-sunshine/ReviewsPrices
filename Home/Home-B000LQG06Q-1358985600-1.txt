review/summary: All the difference in the world.review/text: I've seen a bunch of these that I didn't like at all, but this one made a vast improvement to my sleep. I really like it. It took about a week for the weird smell to go away. I can't say it stank, per se; I don't know how to describe it, but it does have a smell, and if you're used to freshly laundered bedding smelling like fabric softener or your nice soap you're used to, its enough to compete with that, if that makes any sense. But its not unpleasant, or enough to drop a star for...its just there. Its a good mattress topper, and I like having it, its very comfortable, and has really helped my back.
