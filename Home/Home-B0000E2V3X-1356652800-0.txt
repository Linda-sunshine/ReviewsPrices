review/summary: Lodge cast iron quality and performance make this pan well worth the price.review/text: Lodge has come out with yet another classic pan that will probably be cooking amazing food for at least a couple centuries. I have so many of their products now from trivets to enameled cast iron, and their classic pre-seasoned cast iron, and I love cooking and serving with all of them. This pan is perfect for baking pizza, and roasting veggies. Every time I make pizza with this pan it results in an evenly browned and perfectly crisp crust. And when I want to us it for roasting, I can fit quite a few more brussels sprouts on this than in my 12&#34; Lodge cast iron skillet. This pan is thinner than my skillet though, so I will probably continue to do most of my frying in the skillet. But of course this pan is mainly intended for baking pizza. And as far as that task is concerned, Lodge cast iron is the best surface I have ever cooked pizza on. It is just as effective if not more so than any stone I have used, and it is certainly more durable and versatile. I definitely recommend buying this product, cooking with it often, and passing it on from generation to generation.
