review/summary: Does a good job but leaks.review/text: We have had this just under a couple of years. We use it all the time! It does a great job but has a tendency to leak from both the frother nozzle and the coffee drip. Seems to have gotten worse over time. Might have to replace it soon. It's too biggest issues is leaking and maybe durability. So if you use it a lot and want it to last more than a couple of years, might want to keep looking. Otherwise it's great for the price.
