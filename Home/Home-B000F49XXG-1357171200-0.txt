review/summary: Delicious Foamy Goodnessreview/text: As everyone else has said - inexpensive espresso machine, small size, fantastic espresso. I can make any espresso drink and have it taste just as good as my favorite coffee shop. For those having trouble with the low frothing/steaming wand - just place it towards the end of your counter, and you can hold as large of a pitcher underneath as you need.
