review/summary: Great trash can!review/text: We've had this trashcan for years and still love it. I think that in five years, we've changed the batteries out a handful of times. It's great for my three year old because she can help throw things away, though it (thankfully) took her years to figure out. So nice when you've got messy hands and need to throw things away quickly. My only caveat is that you'll look silly when you go to throw something away at someone else's house and are waving your hand over a traditional trashcan!
