review/summary: Just got it put up - Great for Storage!!review/text: I modified it - took off the arms for the under shelf - mounted it to the top of my pantry and it is the greatest - I am buying more. I do a lot of baking, so I use Parchment Paper, waxed paper, saran wrap and foil - along with my baggies (multiple sizes)
