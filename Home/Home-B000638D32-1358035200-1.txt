review/summary: Work horse knife and affordablereview/text: Bought this on the recommendation of Cooks Illustrated magazine. The handle is texturized for grip. The entire knife is quite light and easy to manipulate and handle. It sharpens well with my Chefs Choice electric sharpener. I am a pretty regular cook so ive already used this knife to chop lots of vegetables, meats, and fruits. on the manufactures recommendation, i do Handwash instead of putting in the dishwasher. Very happy with this purchase. I will be buying more as housewarming gifts for friends!
