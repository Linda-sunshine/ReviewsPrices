review/summary: Does the jobreview/text: I've used two Misto Misters for a few months (one for garlic infused olive oil and one for white balsamic vinegar).They have never clogged and consistently mist.HOWEVER, I use each almost every day. Perhaps the reviewers who complained of clogging use their products less regularly or with thicker solutions?Suggested Uses: Spray olive oil/ and or vinegar over salad for flavor. The spray evenly distributes flavor without making greens soggy. Also, as it is nicely distributed, you can have the same flavor with less oil or vinegar.Fill with canola oil for an environmentally friendly non-stick spray.
