review/summary: Very difficult to use - steam burns your hand.review/text: Length:: 0:36 MinsI don't like to review anything right after I just purchased it. Now, almost after a year of using this kettle, I'd like to share my opinion. This kettle has a problem - after short period of time the top part of the handle got disconnected from the heat, and steam comes out of that crack. When you are pouring a boiling water from the kettle to the cup - steam burns your hand.
