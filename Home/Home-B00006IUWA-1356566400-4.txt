review/summary: This thing has a mind of it's ownreview/text: After seeing how many stars this product got and reading some positive reviews, I was surprised at how well it did NOT work. I've only used it 2 or 3 times and each time at least half of the kernels came flying out of the machine unpopped. Very hot unpopped kernels and popcorn go flying in all directions. I haven't tried tilting it back as one user suggested but will certainly do that next time. It seems like such a waste of popcorn to only pop half the kernels.
