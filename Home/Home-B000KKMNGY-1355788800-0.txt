review/summary: didn't work for what I originally wanted to use it for, but I found another way to use it.review/text: I bough this rack for my pantry, because it is too small. It turns out that it is too long, and didn't work. I am also a math teacher, and I now use the rack (attached to a table) to hold scratch paper for my students show theier work. Not really want I intended it for but hey it works great!
