review/summary: HAD IT FOR 5 YEARS AND STILL GOING STRONG!!review/text: I was shopping for other coffee bar products when I came across these reviews for the DBM-8 and I couldn't beleive how many people claim that they have had a negative experience with this product. I've used it almost every day for the past 5 years for drip coffee, french press, and espresso and have been happy with the grind consistency. 100% reliable...adjust the coarseness for the grind, push the grind button, and it goes to work. I have never busted out my magnifying glass to inspect the grind conistency on a micro-level but in the wire mesh filter for my coffee maker, glass for french press, or metal espresso filter after grinding at each respective coarseness settings on the grinder this little machine produces a consistent grind. Yes, making espresso the old fashion way like this is messy but don't blame the grinder. Absolutely recommend for this price.
