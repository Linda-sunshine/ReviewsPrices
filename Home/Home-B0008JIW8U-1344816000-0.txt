review/summary: Shocking...review/text: Worked well for about a week. After that, Armageddon. This coffee maker sent bolts of lightening out in all directions at anyone in the room. After many painful attempts to unplug it, we've decided just to build a new kitchen. We are beginning to think that the coffee maker is actually sentient. If you poke your head into the kitchen, it sends a small electrical bolt out as if daring you to come into the room.
