review/summary: Best iron I have usedreview/text: After reading other reviews for several irons, I chose this one. It is not a light weight. I feel as if I have good control. The settings are very easy to read and the stearm selections are widely varied. The shiney soleplate just glides along. All too soon I am done ironing. Great value!!!!!
