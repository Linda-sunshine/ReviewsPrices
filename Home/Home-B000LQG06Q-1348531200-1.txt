review/summary: Glorious Sleepreview/text: As a grad student moving to a new city, I decided on a cheap, basic mattress I and planned to get a nice mattress topper. The couple days I only had the mattress before I ordered the topper were not pleasant nights of sleep. When this mattress topper arrived, it magically turned my uncomfortable mattress into heaven. Its very soft and made my firm mattress infinitely more comfortable. But it provides enough support that I'm not being swallowed by it. I tend to like softer mattresses and almost went with the 3 inch topper, but 2 inches is perfect.The "green tea"/"mint chocolate chip ice cream" smell was strange but didn't bother me, and lasted only 3 days max. It plumped up very quickly and fits my bed right. Great price for a quality product.I can't say enough about how fantastic this topper is and what a great nights sleep I get with it.
