review/summary: Great grinder for a great pricereview/text: This grinder has everything that's appealing to a college student like myself. It's small, compact, easy to use and clean, and makes great grounds. I use this product for making espresso grounds and it works incredibly well. It also does not make a lot of noise - an added bonus. For the price, this exceeds the quality expected - an essential buy for anyone who doesn't want to spend a lot on a grinder!
