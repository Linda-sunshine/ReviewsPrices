review/summary: Works as advertisedreview/text: Needed an inexpensive vacuum cleaner so bought this one. It works get even though it doesn't have the quality you'd expect when buying a Hoover. Its light weight is good for when my 93 year old mother vacuums her house. It has the gadgets necessary for normal use. The price was right and I'd buy another at that price if needed.
