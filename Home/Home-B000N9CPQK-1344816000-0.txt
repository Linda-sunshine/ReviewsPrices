review/summary: Nice and quietreview/text: This unit is super quiet! I plugged it in and cranked it up as soon as it came so I could see whether we would be able to use it in our baby's nursery. I was looking for something compact, inexpensive and moderately quiet. I ran it for about 6 hours and immediately I can notice a difference in the air. I will continue to run it everyday until the baby arrives next month and will update my experience to see how much the filter has captured at that time ;)
