review/summary: It makes opening easyreview/text: I like having this opener handy and ready to use. The foil cutter is an added plus. The only problem I've had (very minor) is plastic corks sometimes do not come out when the screw is reversed. A knife or fork jabbed into the cork will hold it still and allow the screw to back out.
