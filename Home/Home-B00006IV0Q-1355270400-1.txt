review/summary: New Percolator convertreview/text: I've been a home drip coffee and French press drinker for over 25 years. I remember my Mom making percolator coffee when she'd have &#34;club&#34; or for parties, and that wonderful, rich smell would permeate the house. Having had two inferior drip makers in the past few years, I thought to give this a try.Absolutely pleased that I bought this percolator. First pot was excellent, second even better when I got my coffee portioning correct. That deep coffee taste is just completely lost with a drip maker.The box contains a starter pack of square filters that you put in the basket and fold over, then put on the basket lid. I also tried it with a standard basket filter, just cut a small hole in the center for the stem - worked just fine for me. Impossible to find these square filters, even in Chicago and suburbs. So, basket filters it is.I thought it would be a longer brewing time, but I had a full pot finished in 10 minutes flat. That I like.And that percolator sound is oddly comforting to me, reminding me of my childhood home and Mom. Awwww!
