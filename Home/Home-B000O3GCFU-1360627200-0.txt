review/summary: good but not perfectreview/text: it does do the job, keep at least 6 hours or maybe a little bit more, but the cap is really hard to clean. Because the gap is really narrow and deep, even I use the brush that I use for baby bottle tip, still can't clean it very well. so I suggest not use for soup, because it will get stinky on the cap. Because usually you get to wash them when you got home, so it will have smell, since it seal so well.
