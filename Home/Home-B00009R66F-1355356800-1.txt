review/summary: Great Carpet Cleaner...review/text: Cleans pretty good for the price. One thing I don't like is that the vac is very bulky and heavy. Becomes a problem when carrying it to the second floor. Sometimes I am afraid that I am not holding it right and it could break. It has a good variety of attachments but when not in use it becomes bulky. Once you add the solution into the tank it becomes even heavier. My wife can't move the thing around for more than 5 mins, I do get some soreness after cleaning 1 room. However is a good exercise for me. This vac does picks up a lot of the liquid it sprays out. Keeps the carpet fairly dry compared to a Bissell one of the same price range.The brush does a good job, but be careful with the setting. It is so powerful that if you have thick new carpet it can pull and wear out your carpet. Another cool thing is that the brush stop spinning when the tank is full, or am i wrong?The other thing I don't like about the unit, is that when installing the extension hose, the small cover/door thing is extremely hard to pull out because of this I barely use the extension.Overall satisfied with the unit.
