review/summary: One of the bestreview/text: Very good cooker for the money.Lid is tricky to put on at first ,but once you get aquinted with is fine.Only one thing that I don't like is the fact that the accessory spacer tray that you can lay inside at bottom is made of aluminum but we never use that anyways...
