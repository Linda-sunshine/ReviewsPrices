review/summary: Best can openerreview/text: We liked this can opener so much we were sad when we couldn't find it after a move. So, we ordered it again (maybe another seller the 2nd time). Then ordered it for the third time recently as a Christmas gift. I cannot locate the order history of all 3 purchases for this so I don't know where we went wrong but one of the times we ended up with a black handle version with a plastic knob. Both versions are good but I think the silver/black handle one is superior and that is the one we most recently received which we ordered from this listing.
