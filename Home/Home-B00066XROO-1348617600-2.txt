review/summary: Presto 07046 Grillreview/text: This was the largest grill I could find although my son bought a bigger one in 2005. Grill works great and,overall, I like it. The level/tilt feature is really nice. It does have some drawbacks though.First of all it has hot spots directly over the heating element. These can, however, be used to your advantagewhen cooking several things and you want them all done at the same time.Secondly, I'd like to see the griddle itself at least twice as thick as it is.Thirdly, the 1/4 inch lip around it should be at least 3/4 of an inch. If you go to slide food against it to getit up on the spatula, it just falls off the edge.Fourthly, I'd REALLY like to see them put a 3 inch backsplash on the back. I had to make one for it, which only reinforcedmy thought that the grill should come with one.Fifthly, the griddle itself sits about 1/4 inch over the drain slot creating a little channel under the lip that's hard to clean.Lastly, it has very hard plastic legs that slide on a formica counter top like it was on ice. That's OK if you are usingit on a surface that has a backsplash. The first time I used the grill was on a bar between the kitchen and dining room.The first time I tried to flip a pancake on it, it skated across the counter, fell on the other side, and dumpedbacon grease on the dining room carpet. I fixed this by attaching rubber crutch tips to the bottom of the legs.Overall, its a good grill. Probably better that its competition. I'd gladly pay a little more to get some the above thingstaken care of.
