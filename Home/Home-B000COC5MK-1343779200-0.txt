review/summary: Bad wine openerreview/text: Do not buy this wine opener. It works for a while and then the opener part will not take a charge, I have had 2 of these and the same thing. Both were gifts. I would never by this brand ever. Very badly made. Plus it will not open a plastic cork, so you still need another wine opener, Do not waste your money.If I could have I would have given it no stars!!
