review/summary: What's the fuss? They're great.review/text: I ordered the 68 oz pitchers and I can't imagine what the fuss that's been kicked up is about...They are FANTASTIC. The handles are fine. The lids are SIMPLE to use - hold down with one hand and twist the top handle on the lid. So easy, my child manages it. I came here to order more and found the item is under review by Amazon and unable to be ordered, currently. That's a crying shame. WONDERFUL product!!
