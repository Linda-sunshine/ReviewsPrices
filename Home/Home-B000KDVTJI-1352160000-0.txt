review/summary: aroma electric kettlereview/text: Had one for years and loved it. Came the time it wore out so I ordered another. Unfortunately it would not turn off automatically when it boiled. Amazon cheerfully replaced it with another, which, would not turn off automatically when it boiled. It's going back and it is time to look for a different brand. I guess they are having a problem with their quality control.
