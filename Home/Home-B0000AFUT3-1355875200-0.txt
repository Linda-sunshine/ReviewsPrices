review/summary: Cool mirrorreview/text: I bought this as a gift for my sister and she really likes it. She is an aspiring makeup artist so she uses it quite a bit. She said the only downside is that the light adjustment dial is pretty hard to slide back and fourth. Other than that it's a cool mirror, it even has a power outlet on the mirror for hair straighteners or whatever you feel like plugging into it.
