review/summary: Good Enoughreview/text: Wanted to try a French Press, but not at the prices for the glass ones. This one works well for me. I am the only coffee drinker in my house and it's just enough for the morning. It does NOT keep coffee as hot as I would like -- after the first cup, it's warm, not hot. I just microwave my cup, which I was doing anyway with my drip model.I like that it's unbreakable, buuuuut, I did manage to put a large dent in the outside wall. Banging it against the side of my trash can to empty grounds. My fault. Still works.Coffee tastes good and I only get a small residue in my cup, not grounds. I grind the coffee at the grocery store, using the course setting.I like this press and have been using it regularly.
