review/summary: Cream color deceiving.review/text: The sheets seem soft. Haven't washed them yet. I'm hoping there are no elastic issues like I read in another review. Just a warning, if your computer shows the cream color to be a very subtle hint of beige as compared to the white, you will be in for a shock. These sheets remind me of french vanilla ice cream (they should probably change the color name to that so ppl can get the picture since their own is very deceiving). Much darker than what's showed. Very yellow in tone. Very much not was I was wanting or expecting. These will be back-up sheets for sure. If the comfort surpasses my distaste for the color, I'll probably order another set in white and write another more glowing review. As for now, it's only 3 stars for me b/c I feel the picture is too deceptive. I understand that computers are different and you may not get the color you were expecting. But when you can obviously compare the cream picture to the white, I think the product received should be able to match much more closely to what's portrayed. BOOOO!
