review/summary: I am waiting for a second replacement KP26M1XGC5review/text: We first bought this mixer in November, 2011. It worked well for us until November, 2012. The gears broke or something. I called customer service and I lucked out because it was still under the one year warranty. Well, the new one started smoking after the first attempt to knead some dough (it was a small batch at a low speed). I tried it again today with a small batch of dough (7 cups). The machine was very noisy and sounded like something is broken. I called customer service again. It turned out I was to blame because I kneaded my dough at speed 4 instead of 2 during my second attempt. However, customer service was kind enough to replace it for me again. I was warned that this is as far as they are going to go with the warranty. So, I am on my own if my mixer breaks down in the future. Even though customer service is fantastic, the new product is poor in quality. When the new mixer breaks (I have no faith in KA anymore)down,instead of calling customer service again, I will try a different brand.The rating would have been a one star if it wasn't for the great customer service.Mine was red but the same model as this one:KitchenAid KP26M1PSL Professional 600 Series 6-Quart Stand Mixer, Silver
