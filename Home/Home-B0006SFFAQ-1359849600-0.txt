review/summary: Dangerous!review/text: This was our second unit and we had been very happy with them. Suddenly, our 6 month old unit suddenly started smoking very badly and the base caught on fire. Luckily, my wife and I were present when this happened and were able to unplug and remove it from the house. We always use the programmable feature so that the coffee is ready when we awake. Had this occurred while we were sleeping... who knows. While searching for a replacement, I found many other reviews describing the same problem with this item.
