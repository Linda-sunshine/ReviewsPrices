review/summary: Simple, Useful, Effective Water Kettlereview/text: I have used this product only a few times so far to heat water to make hot tea and it does so very quickly. I would say this product heats the water in a matter of minutes. I really like how it is stainless steel as well, which seems like a must for a water kettle.
