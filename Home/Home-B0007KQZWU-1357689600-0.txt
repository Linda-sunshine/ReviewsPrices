review/summary: Nice Cookwarereview/text: I love Amazon! I love that I can read the reviews and see the pros and cons. I read the reviews on this cookware and one in particular was very informative. It sold me and I ordered them. I love the cookware! It is so solid and after cooking with it a few times I am getting used to the fact that it heats much quicker and evenly than my non-stick that I have always cooked with. I have been coaching the husband that you do not have to turn the heat up as high as we did with the other pots :). I made stroganoff in it and the flour from the meat stuck to the bottom and browned and i thought it would be terrible trying to clean it up, but surprisingly (even after letting it sit on the counter for probably a couple hours) when i put soapy water in it and washed it with my brush, it came right off. Impressed :) I think these will last me forever and they are beautiful. Love them.
