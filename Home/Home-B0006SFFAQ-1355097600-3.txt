review/summary: Coffee brewer is a fire hazardreview/text: I have had the Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew Central for a little over a year. This morning, for no apparent reason, it started to smoke profusely and give off an acrid burning smell. I was lucky to be nearby at the time, otherwise I don't know if it could have burned and done damage in my kitchen. I am throwing it away. I suggest anyone thinking about purchasing this item first do a check on its safety. There is a page here on Amazon in which many people report the same problem.
