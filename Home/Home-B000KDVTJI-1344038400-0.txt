review/summary: Still beautiful and shiny inside out after 2+ yearsreview/text: I bought the Aroma AWK-115S Hot H20 X-Press 1-1/2-Liter Cordless Water Kettle about 2 years ago - today it's still going strong, which is more than can be said with many of today's appliances. My kettle sits on my Kitchen counter and I use it every day. It works just as well today as the first day I bought it - the water heats up very fast and the inside of the kettle looks as shiny and new as when I bought it. The outside is still pretty ok although I see a few spots that look like water spots on metal - it's like an antique look - like when a mirror gets old, you know?... But it's really not as bad as that - it's just showing slight signs of aging on the outside, but it really is out on my kitchen counter al day long and I use it every day - and I may have wiped it down just a few times only - anyway... I'd buy this machine 10 times over. I'll try to upload a photo so you can see that it's not as bad as I may have made it sound - Love this kettle!
