review/summary: Darwin award for dumbest designreview/text: I own several humidifiers from all different manufacturers, but this 9 gallon floor standing unit is the oddball of the lot.It uses a circular filter which sits inside the unit and a fan sits inside this filter when you place the cover on it.Water from the 2 reservoirs collect on the bottom of the unit and flow into the circular trench which the filter rests in.The filter is supposed to wick up the water, while at the same time, blowing air through it and into your room.What's wrong with this picture!!??If you have your fan blower speed on high, whatever moisture which has wicked up into the filter will be evaporated quickly and water will not be able to wick fast enough.So you will have to flip the whole filter over every few hours.The top half of the filter will always be bone dry!!!I have to take the filter out, run water on it from my bathtub, then run and put it back, dripping water all the way.Sometimes I lift the cover off, exposing the filter, and pore a few cups of water around the top rim of the filter.When the filter is saturated, this unit does indeed put a lot of water into the air.As long as you keep that stupid filter wet, the unit will maintain a high RH.I have owned the unit about a year and have changed the filter 3 times, at $15.00 a crack.They tend to wear out and actually fall apart, especially if it's allowed to dry out often.If you keep the blower on a lower speed, the filter won't dry out as fast.One good thing; it's very easy to clean, and it has roller wheels for easy placement.If you can invent a way to pour the reservoir water on the top of the filter, where it should be, this would be a fantastic, low maintenance humidifier.
