review/summary: Good Purchasereview/text: I wasn't sure about the red &#34;thermo spot&#34; in the center of the pan. It is supposed to change when it gets hot enough. Mine does not and it seems that it is a little warped because when I put oil in the pan, it all rushes to the sides. Maybe that is why the &#34;thermo spot&#34; doesn't work, it isn't touching the stove. Otherwise, good purchase. It was recommended by America's Test Kitchen, that's why I bought it.
