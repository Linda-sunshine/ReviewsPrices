review/summary: Just what I wantedreview/text: I like coffee a lot, but I am not a coffee snob. I was willing to buy a burr grinder and a few other appliances, but I mostly made my own coffee at home with standard drop coffee maker. When I am out, I always enjoyed fancier coffees, and I had messed around with steam-driven espresso makers over the years. I kept wanting to get a pump-driven espresso machine, but there are so many choices, and the costs are sometimes a bit overwhelming. Anyway, when this went on sale, I snapped one up. I have been using it for a few weeks now. It has been exactly what I was hoping for. The coffee, after some trial and error, tastes great. I am still developing my skills on the foamer side, but it works like a charm. This is the best entry level espresso maker that I have played with. I have used others at friend's and family's houses.All of that praise stated, you need a small and wide foam pitcher to work with the steamer. It is a little awkward, but that is my only criticism.If you are looking to spend around $100 to enter into the pump espresso maker market, I think this is a great choice.
