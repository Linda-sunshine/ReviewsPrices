review/summary: Sticks To Bottom of Panreview/text: I use this to even out the temperature of a Dark nonstick metal brownie pan. While it DOES help distribute the heating more evenly, it also tends to stick to the bottom of the pan. This makes it awkward when trying to check the bake on brownies because the darn thing comes off the rack with the pan, usually sticking to the back bottom and flopping about. Has a tendency to slide no matter how carefully a pan is placed upon it. I don't do bare baking straight on this product, so no opinions about that one. If you are looking, as I was, for something to improve even cooking in a standard sized modern toaster oven? It does the job, but annoyingly in the process. My oven has convection which does help when combined with this product. It has held up well and is easy to clean also.
