review/summary: Great coffee for a year until it self-immolatedreview/text: I got this coffeemaker March 2011, and it made fine coffee which is the reason it gets two stars instead of one. Until today my only complaint was that water drips down the back when the top is opened to clean it out.This morning during the brew cycle, it started to make popping sounds, stink of an electrical fire, and appeared to have shut off although it continued making noises. I unplugged it, dumped the coffee and got out the french press for my morning joe. Fortunately I was in the kitchen making breakfast when this happened. After returning from work I plugged it back in, and the clock displays and the light comes on when the switch flipped to On, but it no longer brews. Water just sits in the reservoir. I purchased it here on Amazon and read the reviews, but was skeptical about the complaints regarding this issue and bought it anyway. Now I've learned the hard way that there's really something to it.
