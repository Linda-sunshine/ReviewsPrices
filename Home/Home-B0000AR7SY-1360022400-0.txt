review/summary: Wish it was less messy!review/text: I have used my new grinder three times and, while I am happy with the performance, I do have two complaints. It creates a lot of static electricity so, when you pull out the ground coffee, a lot of it becomes airborne. Additionally, it blows ground coffee around and makes quite a mess. I have not found a solution to reducing the 'mess' factor. While it does the job well, I am sorry I didn't spend more and get a more trouble free model.
