review/summary: Rocket Juicerreview/text: Those reviews that mention how easy it is to clean this juicer are... WRONG! Literally, it would take me 15 or more minutes to clean all the pieces, with the juicing screen taking the most time. If I didn't have time to clean the juicer right after use, the time to clean would be more. Even after scrubbing and scrubbing, there is a considerable amount of produce residue left on the pieces. I would also like to mention that the screen is very delicate and bends very easily. With this in mind, other reviewers mention how expensive it is to replace the screen. The juicer is also bulky and not light (11 lbs).The pro of this juicer is that it definitely juices--in fact, it sounds like a rocket ship taking off when the juicer is turned on. There is a considerable amount of juice extracted from vegetables (including collard greens, kale, & spinach). I also liked that I didn't have to cut vegetables or fruits; the machine is most definitely powerful. Also, there is a great deal of grind (peel,seeds,skin, etc.) left in the machine after juicing and depending on your use this could be a positive or negative thing. The juicer also comes with a scrub brush for the screen and a customized pitcher w/ lid.Overall, I didn't like the juicer and decided to return it. Factors affecting my decision included price, difficulty cleaning, weight/bulkiness, and chunky waste. We decided to invest in an emulsifier blender to incorporate all of the parts of produce.
