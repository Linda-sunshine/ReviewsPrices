review/summary: Good product, but with a couple of issuesreview/text: It does the job well, and seems solidly-built. I like the seamless stainless-steel interior, so no plastic comes in contact with the boiling water. The double-wall does prevent the outside from getting very hot (they call it "cold-touch", which is not exactly right, but it certainly doesn't get hot enough to burn).The only serious flaw is that the spout does drip a lot. I mitigate that by holding a paper towel in one hand while I pour with the other, so I can wipe up drips and spills quickly.Another annoyance, but very minor, is that the kettle had a big, round sticker on it, touting the "cold-touch" feature. When I removed it prior to use, it left a round discoloration on the stainless-steel surface! Very annoying. Don't know how to get rid of the stain, short of bringing a highly toxic stainless-steel cleaning spray from home. Why did it even need the extra advertising, anyway? I had already bought the damn thing.It is maybe a little large for my uses, which are to make one or two cups of coffee, or a bowl of instant ramen. If they had a 4-cup version, I would probably have bought that. But, all things considered, it's a good item, well-built, and should last a long time. I hope it lasts longer than the circular discoloration on the side!
