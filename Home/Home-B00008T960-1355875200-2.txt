review/summary: SAFETY FIRST!review/text: OK, so its convenient and it works, but there is very little dialogue about it's safety, or reassurance from the companies selling it. For example, non-stick Teflon is highly toxic because it has FLUORIDE(F-) which constantly leaches into foods, and produces toxic F gases. Notice the Fs in Teflon compounds....PFOA and PFTE. But Teflon was a proprietary trade secret so nobody knew until there was an obvious health and environmental impact. Of course Dupont knew all along they were poisoning people and the environment but the profits far exceed the few million in law suits. Sound familiar? So PFOA and PFTE are finally being replaced with some new non-stick formulas (which may also have fluorochemicals(F's) added). Its called "greenwashing". Check the chemical structure of Teflon on Google-images. See the all the FFFFFFFFFFs?? Silicon (Si, the element) is not toxic, but Silicone (the compound) is formulated for many different applications. Since fluoride is a non-stick component of many products (cookware, carnuba wax, Scotch Guard, etc.), my guess is that fluoride is a component of this so-called SILICONE. I hope I'm wrong. But they are not going to disclose this information. Have these silicone bake mats been 3rd party safety tested ? What elements, if any, leach into the food? Fluoride and Silicon are often paired chemically. In fact, "Silicofluorides" are added to our municipal waters, and 90% of it comes from China (as industrial waste). An undisputed fact. Happy baking.
