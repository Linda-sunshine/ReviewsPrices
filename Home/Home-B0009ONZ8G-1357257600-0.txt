review/summary: Not Good for Pet Hair & Bag a Pain to Change/Checkreview/text: I purchased this vac after reading many consumer reports like websites mentioning this was the best "value" priced vac. However, as the owner of 3 cats (2 long hair) this vacuum does a terrible job handling the pet fur. The fur fills up the bag after 2 once a week vacuums. The fur sometimes clogs the tubing leading to the bag and clogs the hose easily.Changing the bag this frequently is awful. The bag always poofs large amounts of fur & dust out into the air removing it. The bag is a pain to reinsert and the cheap plastic cover is difficult to maneuver back onto the little pegged slots.
