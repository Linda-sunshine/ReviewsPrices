review/summary: Not happy at all with this.review/text: Bought this item because I needed a reliable non-stick pot and immediately had issue with it. I took a while to write this review because I made every effort to not complain because everyone regards cast iron pots highly. The rust started to show from the first use even though I followed the care instuctions carefully and watched several videos on the Lodge site and on you tube to make sure i've done the right thing. Seasoned this thing over and over which equates to wasted time because now the Dutch Oven is unusable. This makes me very angry and frustrated because I now have to look for a new one. I tried to get away from the unhealty non-stick pots and also tried to stick to American made healthier products but everytime i used this pot black stuff was all over my food. Love to give positive reviews but its impossible to give one here. This pot is so rusty now its light brown. Not happy at all.
