review/summary: UPDATE TO "GREAT WITHOUT THE COVER!"review/text: I wish I had read more reviews before purchasing the pillow. I struggled to put the cover on, only to spend a miserable night. Next day I read reviews about using it without the supplied cover. One reviewer said it was like sleeping on a concrete block with padding. I AGREE! After replacing the supplied cover with an ordinary pillowcase, I LOVE IT. Have only had it for a couple of weeks so don't know how it will hold up. Will keep you posted.UPDATE-Afer using this for several weeks, I find the beads are collapsing and portions of the pillow are getting too soft. I may have to put the original cover on.
