review/summary: great little coffee makerreview/text: i bought this single coffee maker a little over 2 years ago...and it finally just died on me...it has been such an awesome coffee maker. first, the price is amazing! less than $20! it's got a reusable filter, which saves you even more $$$ in the long run. i am so happy with how long it's been able to last...and i used it at least once every day. sometimes twice a day. i thought about replacing it with a more "better" and expensive one, but don't see the point of it. this little engine that could has provided me with delicious coffee every morning for the last 2 years. i will definitely be buying this one again!
