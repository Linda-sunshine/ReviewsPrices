review/summary: Good enough for office usereview/text: I've been using this for over a year and it works great. It brews a large coffee cup of water (or the mug provided) although sometimes you have to press the switch a second time to get it all. A size 2 cone filter is slightly too big for it but I fold them over. Once you figure out how much grinds to add your good to go. It gets the water plenty hot. Its a little on the loud side for the 30 seconds or so that it brews.
