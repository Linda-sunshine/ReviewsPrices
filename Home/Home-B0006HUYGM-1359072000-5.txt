review/summary: Great vacuum for the moneyreview/text: I gave it 5 stars for sucking power which is what I needed. However, on a couple of my carpets, I have to hold down the ends or the vacuum will suck up the carpet, but that's not the vacuum's fault as I have other throw rugs that I do not have to do this to. I would recommend this. I also bought the washable filter for this vacuum which should save money in buying filters.
