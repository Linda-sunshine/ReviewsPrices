review/summary: Cannot recommend this productreview/text: The first time I used this product out of the box, it started smelling like burning plastic or rubber almost immediately.It was a very strong, unpleasant, toxic smell. There may have been a little smoke as well, it was hard to tell.I'm returning mine for Amazon store credit.
