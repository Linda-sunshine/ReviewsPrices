review/summary: Love it!review/text: I purchased this after searching for a programmable coffeemaker for quite some time and reading many reviews. I just received this on 12/26 and have made multiple pots of coffee so far. The set up was super easy. The enclosed filter is great but I don't know if I will continue to use it because I always use filtered water anyway. The seller was great and shipped right away. I actually received it a day earlier than expected. I am very happy with this coffeemaker. If anything changes, I will update.
