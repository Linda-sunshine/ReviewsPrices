review/summary: Smooth as glass!review/text: The coffee, i.e., as well as the AeroPress.My first cup was easily the best coffee I have had, easily beating out the best cup of Intelligentsia.Of course, it helps to use awesome beans (Capulin hand-picked) and good water - I brewed a second cup at 90+ deg. Celsius, and it still tasted smooth, not a trace of sourness.
