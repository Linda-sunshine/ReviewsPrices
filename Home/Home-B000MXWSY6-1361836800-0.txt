review/summary: Can not see the time in the daylightreview/text: This clock is useless in the daylight. The display even at its highest brightness level is impossible to see unless you are within inches of it. Not at all suitable for anything other than a nightstand display where you don't want the brightness level to be high. I read many of the reviews and bought this clock in spite of others warning about the same problem. So, I have learned my lesson and add my warning to the others already given.
