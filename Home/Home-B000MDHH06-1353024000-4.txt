review/summary: Great Juicer but Clean-up is a PAIN IN THE ASSreview/text: So, the juicer is pretty powerful and does beets and carrots and everything, so I'm very happy about all the things I'm able to juice. However, the horrible thing about the juicing process is the clean up. There are so many different parts that I need to clean and they're not dishwasher safe. I think they'll melt if i put them in the dishwasher. So I have to wash each piece by hand and it just takes forever. I don't mind doing the dishes, it's whatever, but I'd much rather get a blender.
