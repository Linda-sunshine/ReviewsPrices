review/summary: Fantastic.review/text: For making square h2o ice cubes this product works just fine. However, we use this for freezing Sofrito's and Broths in our kitchen. We make Sofrito and chicken broth in very large quantities and then freeze them into perfect cubes so that we can quickly just pop one out when needed.We love the ease of use and the use that creates savings!
