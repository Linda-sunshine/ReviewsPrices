review/summary: Best pizza pan!review/text: This pizza pan has become my favorite for cooking homemade pizzas as well as for warming up frozen pizzas. I like a crisp crust, without burning the pizza. I have used a metal pan and a pizza stone as well as cooked frozen pizzas on the wire racks of the oven. This pan is the best by far for creating the kind of pizza I enjoy. Nothing cooks like heavy cast iron. Care is simple if it is dried thoroughly after cleaning and oiled when needed. Great pizza at last!
