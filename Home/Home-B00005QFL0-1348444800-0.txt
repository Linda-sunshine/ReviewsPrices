review/summary: Super Machine!review/text: When I got my delivery, I hurried and took the machine out of the box, washed the bread pan, and went to town on getting my first loaf baked. I followed a recipe which I found on allrecipe.com.........and this bread was so good, and the bread didn't even stick, popped right out when I turned the pan over to remove the bread! well worth the money. will continue to eat fresh baked bread.........not to mention how wonderful my home smells while it bakes.....yummmmm.
