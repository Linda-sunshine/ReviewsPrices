review/summary: Great dishes, great service from Amazonreview/text: I have another set of these which I couldn't be happier with for baking, when I ordered these as tupperware replacements I was admittedly over excited about them. I love to put my leftovers in glass and not plastic, and the cleanup is fantastically easy. I find myself hand washing them instead of using the dishwasher because they practically wipe clean.On a side note - When they arrived I found it was missing 2 lids and the package was dented badly, I went to return them on Amazon not excited about the probable hassle that would ensue. To my surprise I found the exchange option. They sent me a new box and said I had 30 days to return the old one once I received the new one. I got the new package, simply took the 2 lids I needed out and dropped the new set (minus the lids) back into the box, sealed it up and set it on the UPS line at my work with the return tag provided for free shipping back. Granted, if you don't have UPS pickup at your work you have to drop it at a UPS store, but wow what an easy process regardless. I'd rather put it in a box then wait for someone at a B&M; store to process the return and hassle with CC credits. Note that if you don't return it in 30 days they will charge your card for the second shipment, but because I have sent it back i'm all clear, I was never charged for a second set, and it was really as easy as it could practically be.Kudos to Pyrex on a great product, Kudos to Amazon on great service yet again.
