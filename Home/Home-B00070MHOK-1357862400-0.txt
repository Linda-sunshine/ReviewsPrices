review/summary: Glad I Bought it but...review/text: I like this product, however it is small, taking only a cup of water at a time. This means that after steaming 1-2 garments I have to unplug and fill again. I bought this because I didn't want to invest in a bigger one until I was sure I would use it. Steaming is certainly easier than ironing (though steaming will NOT get you the pressed look of ironing! If you're going somewhere formal, you should iron), and I am thrilled that the product is so lightweight and definitely have put this to use. But refilling the water in this product every 10 minutes is a time consuming hassle. If you're using this for your home instead of travel, I'd suggest investing in a bigger size.
