review/summary: Love itreview/text: So happy with our new Eureka 3670G. So very light to use and very good in collecting dust and pet's hair. Kind of little bit noisy but for what's it's good for is a big plus. It works on carpet too, but perfect for solid surfaces. I can carry it while vacuuming or pulling it as I go.
