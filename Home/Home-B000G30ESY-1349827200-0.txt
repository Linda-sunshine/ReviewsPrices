review/summary: Buy it now, don't wait 30 years.review/text: I just made my first batch of brown rice in zoro!. Why have I been so stupid? for so many years? The smell is incredible, I have an Aroma rice cooker for the last six months, I have really used it hard, and needed to replace it. The Aroma did a nice job, but never gave off a rice smell that makes the mouth water.I fill my slow cooker up with vegtable curry,have 'zoro" loaded with rice, set the timers on both and return 9 hrs later to a great dinner.The size is correct for one two people, easy to clean, light, I wish I had spent the money 30 years ago. I have had several rice cookers over the years,I wish I had bought this first. The flavor difference, and the steamed rice is amazing.Wild rice is amazing in zoro, the fluffy factor is great. I have made it alone with mushrooms, or mixed with brown rice. The brown rice combo came out a bit mushy, but my guest purred over it, so ok.I am using zoro a lot, i was worried it would be hard to clean the lid, but its not. The pan washes inthe sink and rinses perfectly. I will not put in the dishwasher.
