review/summary: Excellent Breadmakerreview/text: At 1st i did not like this machine, i was use to making bread,putting water in 1st flour last. After making my 4th loaf of bread in this machine i am sold on it. I have used several different bread macines over the last 20 years, this panasonic SD-YD250 is the best bread machine i ever used. It is so quite, you will not hear it. I paid $100 for this panasonic, what a great deal.I have been purchasing alot of things from Amazon,com including this Panasonic bread machine.
