review/summary: Great for Preemies or any baby with breathing issues.review/text: My son is a preemie. When we got home he would get stuffy very easily. Its fall time and I thought it would be great to keep the windows open. That way my son would get the humidity from outside. Unfortunately this made it worst. I purchase another Cool Humidifier which came with a filter. Totally not worth it because without the filter it does not work. So if you do not have an extra one laying around then you are out of luck until you can find one some where.This one does not have a filter. Therefore it will continue to work. I use a little Grapefruit Seed Extract to kill any bacteria in the air. Especially when anyone comes over.It has helped to also clear my sinuses.
