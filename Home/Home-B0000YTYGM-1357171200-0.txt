review/summary: Works great, keeps coffee hot for hours!review/text: I purchased this coffee maker because I wanted a stainless steel carafe that wouldn't break, but also had a 12-cup capacity because I work from home and enjoy my coffee all morning but don't want to constantly have to make more. This carafe keeps the coffee hot for 4+ hours without using electricity keeping the machine on. Although I have only been using it a few weeks, at this point I have not experienced anything negative and I would definitely recommend it.
