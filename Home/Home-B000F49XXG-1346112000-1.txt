review/summary: Great Espresso at a cheap pricereview/text: This is the least expensive unit that has a 15bar pump and 2 thermostats so that steam is at one temp and the espresso is extracted at a lower temperature in order to make great espresso! It is compact which is great although as such it only accepts a small pitcher under the steam wand and of course only espresso cups under the brewer. In short great espresso at an inexpensive price!
