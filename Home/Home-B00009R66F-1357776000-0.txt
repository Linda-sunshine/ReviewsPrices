review/summary: This is so much better than the Rug Doctor I rented from the grocery store.review/text: I like the rotating brushes that operate in a circular fashion, not like the beater brush on a vacuum. Theunit is a pleasant weight compared with the Rug Doctor. It was easy to assemble and easy to operate. I have not tried the upholstery attachment nor have I tried using it on a hard floor. Used the Steam Vac on a very heavy traffic area that had some heavily soiled strips. It was possible to apply the steam cleaner solution and then permit the SteamVac to stay in one place to scrub and scrub the trouble spot. It wasn't a quick fix, but the result was very good and the machine did not give me a back ache like the Rug Doctor. I would recommend this to a friend.
