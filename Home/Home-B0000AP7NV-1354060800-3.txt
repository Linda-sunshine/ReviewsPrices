review/summary: Great itemreview/text: This product filter my tap water and makes it taste great. Its a great slim size so it doesn't take a lot of room in my fridge. The replacement filter is reasonably priced to change out after a few months. If you are looking for a small pitcher that doesn't take alot of room and filters your water properly then go with this Brita 42629 Slim Pitcher.
