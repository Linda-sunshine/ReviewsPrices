review/summary: Brilliant at an amazing price!!review/text: I was looking for a small vacuum to clean floor rugs in my small NYC apartment. I was looking for a small rechargeable model to keep the price down, although I am somewhat skeptical of the suction power of rechargeable models. I came across this model on Amazon and decided to give it a try - I figured it was cheap enough to throw away if it was no good.What I didn't expect was how good this device actually is!! Not only does it make light work of keeping my rugs clean, it perfectly vacuums hardwood and tile floors in the rest of the apartment, quickly and without the usual drop in air quality from a broom (the broom has not left the closet since I bought this). It is also easy to clean and store.At this price, it is excellent value for money.I could not recommend this more highly for anyone looking for a compact device with excellent cleaning power.
