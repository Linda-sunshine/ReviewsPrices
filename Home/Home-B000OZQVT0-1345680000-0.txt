review/summary: met my needsreview/text: Have a crochety neighbor who complained about smoke in chimnea. Bought concrete log that holds gel cans. Crackles like and looks like a real fire. Alot less fuss than wood. Have noticed that I tried to cap it and relight, but they go out after you do that. It is better to light and let them burn out.
