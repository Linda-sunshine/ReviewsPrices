review/summary: Dangerous product - not recommended, likely a fire hazardreview/text: Owned it for about 17 months. Two main problems: very easy to crack the carafe (~$25 to replace). So easy that I have no idea how I did it. Twice. Second and more serious issue. As it was making coffee one day I heard a series of popping/crackling sounds, then smoke and electrical fire smell. Fortunately I happened to be right there and so pulled the plug. but what if it had happened on an auto-on cycle or when I wasn't home?! Never had a coffee machine do this before. In fact never even heard of one doing this, but a quick google search shows this is not an uncommon problem with the DCC series. Wish I'd known earlier, which is why I'm writing this review. If you buy this you are probably introducing a fire hazard into your home.On the plus side: it made good coffee prior to self-destructing.
