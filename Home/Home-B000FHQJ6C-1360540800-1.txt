review/summary: Works Better Than Expectedreview/text: I've resisted getting a juicer because I've heard they're hard to clean, but this one is so easy to use and very easy to clean. I watched the video on how to use it and someone suggested to immediately put the juicer blade in hot soapy water after use. It only takes about 30 seconds to clean when I do that. The rest of the pieces simple rinse off or could be put in the dishwasher if you don't want to hand wash them. I love this appliance and wouldn't hesitate to purchase it again.
