review/summary: Not for mereview/text: If you are looking for an alarm clock that will allow you to wake up to a natural sound, this is not the right product for you. The sounds are very nice and I'm sure, as a sound machine (its primary purpose) it's a great product. That said- I had a natural sounds alarm clock that needing replacing and purchased this assuming I could choose which sound I woke up to. Not the case. It was set up to default to the &#34;running stream&#34; sound when you choose &#34;sound&#34; as your alarm. So if your primary reason for making this purchase is an alarm clock that plays natural sounds- look elsewhere.My major disappointment with this product too is that this is not clear in the description. It promotes ten different sounds. I expected to have some choice.
