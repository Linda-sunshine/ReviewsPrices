review/summary: Above averagereview/text: Pros - quite, heats fast, style, small size, eaIsy to see controls, control lights on the top make it easy to see at night.Cons - temperature reading is way off, never shuts off cause it can not tell what the real temp is, have to reset temperature control down 5*F to get it to shut off, Low temp is either always on or you have to set the hour timer.I have been using this unit for about 3 months now, along with a larger Lasko unit in the family room, and my electric bill is down about $60 a month. The rooms that are not used are closed off so 2 area heaters are heating 1/2 of a 1400sq ft house, with no insulation. This is the south and our lows so far have only been low 40's so far.This is great for a small area. It is heating the hallway and the bathroom. At night I do not have to worry about tripping on it cause the control lights are on the top and easily visible as they flash. Heats up quickly.I hate you can not set the low 750W on the thermostat. You either have to leave it always on or use the hourly timer.Never seems to shut off. There is a thermostat right behind it and it says 72*F and the heater is set on 65*F and it is still running. There is at least a 7+ *F difference between the true temperature and what it is reading.I have another Lasko, larger unit in the family room, and it also is off by 5*F.After I bought this here I found it for the same price at a local discount house.
