review/summary: Very good machine...check the receipesreview/text: Came fast with Prime 2 day shipping....Solid feel out of the box, looks to have a heavy duty motor and has easy to use controls. This one makes large 24 oz loaf great for families that eat alot of bread. relatively quite and expect super reliability since its a Panasonic. Outside case stay cool even during baking process...a nice feature to keep kids from getting burned. Yeast dispenser help to add yeast at the right time. did have a few loaves not rise. wife sid they did not have the right yeast so check the recipes with online website before you hit the start button.
