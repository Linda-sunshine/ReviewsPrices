review/summary: Exactly what we neededreview/text: Working great so far. For about a week now and everyday I ask the kids, they always say their lunch is still hot/warm when they open up the thermos at school! With the winter weather coming in, I've tried other food containers that claim to keep the food warm but they never stay warm until lunch time.I'm glad I decided to keep this one a try, now I don't need to worry about the children's lunch getting cold and definitely don't need to spend extra money for them to buy hot lunches at school...which is usually things they end up not eating. I bought a blue one for my son too. The best part is, they feel great that they are "strong" enough to open it themselves. Love it!
