review/summary: Lovereview/text: In general, cast iron RULES. Properly seasoned and cared for, it will last for your lifetime and that of several generations after you. Specifically, you absolutely cannot go wrong with Lodge cast iron. It is preseasoned and ready to cook a great meal for you right out of the box. Cast iron does require different upkeep than other cookware. DO NOT put this in the dishwasher. It is easy to clean while it is still hot from the stove, so a little adjustment to your cooking routine is all that is really required.
