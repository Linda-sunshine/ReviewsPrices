review/summary: Not Durablereview/text: This is my first stick blender and I relied on the Cuisinart name and reputation. Used the blender twice for soup and fruit smoothies, washed in dishwasher the second time I used, and now the two parts will not assemble. Having read the other reviews about the cost of warranty replacement and the likelihood of getting another low quality blender I'll be purchasing another brand next time.
