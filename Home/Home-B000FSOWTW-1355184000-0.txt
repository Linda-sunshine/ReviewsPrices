review/summary: Don't get this as a gift!review/text: I bought this as a birthday present but I was super disappointed with the packaging that it came in. It came in a brown packaging box and that's it. There's no box for the wine chiller with details about the product so it's extremely hard to give this as a gift! Overall, it's a nice electric wine opener and it does the job so I gave it 4 stars.
