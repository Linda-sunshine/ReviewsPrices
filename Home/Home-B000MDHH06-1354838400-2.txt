review/summary: Juicyreview/text: This is my first juicer but I like many others was turned on to the idea by Joe Cross. I think it does a pretty good job ... but juicing is not for someone on a tight budget. If you want to get into juicing then you may have to look at other areas of your life to cut costs ... such as cable. You're not going to have as much time to watch TV because this is a high maintenance lifestyle change ... but it's worth it.
