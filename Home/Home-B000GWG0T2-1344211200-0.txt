review/summary: Good Skilletreview/text: This is a fairly shallow 10.25" skillet that has nice even heating. The non-stick is fairly tough as stated. I purposely used a regular thin metal spatula on it a few times and it does not look to be scratched or harmed. I admit I did not purposely try to "Dig" the spatula in, but with non-stick that is not really needed in the first place. All in all, Good skillet! I will be buying the larger version of this soon.
