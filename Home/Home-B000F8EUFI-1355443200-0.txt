review/summary: "Here comes the Devil" said the floorreview/text: We own a HUGE Panasonic vacuum cleaner for years which never lost any suction, or so we thought until we get this Dirt Devil Dynamite. Since we moved from an all carpet floor apartment to our own all hardwood floor house, I was tired of carrying the bulky vacuum cleaner just to clean the rugs. So, I bought this Devil since it it the best reviewed cheapest compact vacuum cleaner I could find. This compact creature is small & light but beats the crap out of my previous cleaners by its power too. the description says to use it on carpet and bare floors, but I was not planning to use it on our hardwood floor, which we very much care for. However, this thing works like a charm and with out any streak on our hardwood floor. Now, this is all we are using for the entire floor in our house, a lot of use for a very reasonable cost!
