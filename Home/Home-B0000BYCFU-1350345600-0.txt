review/summary: So far so good, but I have a question:review/text: I received this as a birthday gift last year. After reading part way through the manual, which is very easy to follow, I put it down and didn't look at my canner again until this Spring. I guess the thought that if I didn't pay attention or if I missed a step in the process, that I'd end up blowing something up, kind of made me wary. I've used this as a water bath canner so far. I've canned strawberry and cherry jams in pints and half-pints as well as cherry pie filling and squash relish. All jars sealed properly the first time with no trouble at all.Today I'm ready to try starting some apple butter but, mainly, I'd like to can apple pie filling. According to the manual, the canner can handle 7 quart jars at a time, but only when used as a pressure canner, not a water bath canner. Most of the recipes I've come across tell you to use the water bath method. Some of the recipes with pictures show canners the same size as mine filled almost completely with the quart jars and water. I guess the argument against using the pressure can method for this is that the apples get too mushy. I'm just wondering if there's a solution to this or maybe an alternate recipe for the filling, or if anyone has canned the filling using the pressure method.This product received four out of five since I haven't used it as a pressure canner yet, but I will update.
