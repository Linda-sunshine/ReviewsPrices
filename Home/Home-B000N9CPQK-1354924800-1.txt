review/summary: Very happy with this onereview/text: I love that this air filter works really well yet you don't have to worry about replacement filters. You can vacuum the carbon filter if it gets dusty and keep using. It works well in a small room. I use this for the small room we smoke in and it will clear the smell overnight
