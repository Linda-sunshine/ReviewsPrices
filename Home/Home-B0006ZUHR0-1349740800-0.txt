review/summary: smoothreview/text: This is an excellent iron. It is smooth, the steam is great and the auto off is really a nice addition. The reservoir can seem a bit small, but because I use high steam with my clothes, maybe it just uses up the water quicker. My previous B&D lasted 20 years! Trust me, I USE MY IRON for ironing tees, denim, work uniforms, school uniforms, denim, and canvas. When my previous B&D iron finally gave out, I decided to purchase a SHARK and was really disappointed. The plate became dirty really quickly and would stick to the clothes. I only tolerated the Shark iron for a month, and decided to use consumer reports to research irons. When the B&D D2030 came up, I immediately searched Amazon to buy it...the rest is history. I will stay with B&D!
