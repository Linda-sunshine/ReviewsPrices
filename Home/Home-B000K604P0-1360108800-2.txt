review/summary: Hottest Coffee EVER!review/text: I LOVE my Nissan Thermos. It keeps coffee hot for an incredibly long amount of time! I love that I can fill my thermos when I leave for work in the morning and sip coffee slowly all morning long...sometimes I'll still be burning my tongue at lunch!Once I filled it at 9am, and left it in the car in the dead of winter in Buffalo, NY for FOUR HOURS (10-2) and came out of the mall to HOT coffee waiting in my frozen car.Seriously this thing is amazing.
