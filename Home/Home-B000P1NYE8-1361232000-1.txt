review/summary: I give it 5 starsreview/text: This little scale is handy for measuring fertilizers for my aquarium. It is much smaller than I expected but I can still work with it. When they pocket scale, they really mean it. It is about the size of a pack of smokes, just thinner. If you need to weigh larger items you might be disappointed with this one.
