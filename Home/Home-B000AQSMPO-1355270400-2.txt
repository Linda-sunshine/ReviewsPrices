review/summary: Worst buy ever!review/text: I have used the Keurig one time and it took forever for it to brew. After a week or two of being in disgust of the product, I tried again. Now the horrible product won't prime. I have watched several trouble shooting videos and tried to do the fixes they suggested and no result. I just threw it in the trash because it is a piece of junk.
