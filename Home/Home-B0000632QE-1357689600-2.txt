review/summary: Forget using this for sweet potato friesreview/text: I bought this device so I could make sweet potato fries. My husband, who is very strong, was struggling with all his might to cut the sweet potatoes up. A couple of times he lost his grip and almost created a few "finger fries." Wouldn't recommend this for anything hard like sweet potatoes or carrots. It's just too risky! I was told by seller that nobody has ever returned this. I know why....they charge a 35% restocking fee because it's used and I would have to pay return shipping (the shipping I expected).
