review/summary: Awesomereview/text: I wasn't sure how this was going to work but I figured for the price I'd give it a try. We got some new pans and I really didn't want to ruin them with non-stick cooking spray. Put some olive oil in this and it works great. Can't ask for more. Sometimes for a few brief seconds I'll get more of a stream then a mist but not very often or for very long.
