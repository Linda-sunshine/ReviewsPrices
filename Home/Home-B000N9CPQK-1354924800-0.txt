review/summary: In 2 days I can breath!!review/text: I bought an rv, the dust/lint was killing me, I couldn't breath, Everytime I dusted I would turn around and there was tons more to dust, The Ionizer really helps so much by making the negative Ion particles so the dust clumps and sticks together so when you dust it's not flying all around and doing no good. I've had mine on high for about 4 days and I can't believe how well it works to be so small. I'm sure it will need cleaned monthly but that's no big deal in comparison that I won't have to buy any filters or spend extra $$ on it.I would like a bigger one but, for the money it was what I could afford at the time.
