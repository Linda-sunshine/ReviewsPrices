review/summary: great little heaterreview/text: Have had 3 of these for over 3 yrs.Low cost to run, safe and work very well.I use 3 of them to heat 1,000 sq ft even when it's below freezing they do the job.Because controls are hard to read, I just put a marker using red nail polish on the low setting, which is mostly what I use and it's easy to see, even in darker light.Highly recommend this efficient, long lasting heater.
