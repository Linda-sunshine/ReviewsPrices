review/summary: LOVE this item!review/text: Man, I hate chopping fruits and veggies, especially onions! I've used mandolin-type slicers, a special onion chopper, and food processors, but found them difficult to clean and I worried about cutting off my fingers. And the food processors are sometimes hard to open and take up precious room on my counter.This design is so simple and perfect that you ask yourself why no one thought of it before. The motor is in the top, and disengages from the slicing blade when you open it. This saves you from having to constantly unplug it when you want to get the food out of the cup. It opens and closes easily, and the cup is dishwasher safe. There's even a lid so that you can store the food you've chopped in the cup! Buy it; you won't be sorry!
