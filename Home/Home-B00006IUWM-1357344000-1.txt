review/summary: How sharp do you want it?review/text: I'm impressed. I ran my Wusthof chef knife, that was I had stopped using, through this guy twice on side A and then twice on side B and there was already a huge difference in the sharp slicing ability of my knife... it was back! Now I must embark on sharpening all of my knives that have dulled overtime... my collection of sharp knives is now going to be enormous! Knife donations will be a plenty! I'm going to start up a knife sharpening business in my condo building this thing is so great!
