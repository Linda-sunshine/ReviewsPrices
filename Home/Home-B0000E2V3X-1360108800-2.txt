review/summary: So far so good- but may require testing multiple techniquesreview/text: As has been mentioned by many reviewers, I like that this cast iron pizza pan is not breakable like the stones and it can serve more purposes than just a pizza pan. I have tried it out once- I heated it on the stove top and I used parchment paper under the pizzas because I was making 3 of them and wanted to be able to easily slide one off and slide the next one on. The oven does need to be on for a long time to get this to ideal temp. The crusts on my pizzas got crisper and crisper, ie., the third crust was the best, the first was the softest. I just used TJ pre-made dough - followed the instructions but turned my broiler on high at the end to bubble up the cheese. I think that I had the best results that are possible with pre-made TJ dough. Next time, I'm going to try making my own dough and not using parchment paper... overall, I am quite happy with this pan, it just will require a little practice to find the perfect method.
