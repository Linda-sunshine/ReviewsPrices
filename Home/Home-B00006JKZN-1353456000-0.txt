review/summary: Makes Good Waffles But Machine Is Poorly Madereview/text: When I saw that this waffle maker was by Cuisinart, I was thrilled---an affordable waffle maker by a respected manufacturer...Hmmm, I was disappointed in the machine itself. The construction is not what I expected.The machine makes good and crispy waffles (had to go to 1/3 cup of batter instead of 1/2 to keep it from oozing out in some places; sprayed plates with Pam spray after every other waffle and had no problem with sticking) and the red/green lights are accurate. However, the little slide to choose doneness is made of flimsy plastic and the top wiggles and jiggles...With the name Cuisinart, I expected a more sturdy product. Also, the steam comes out through the front handle so I needed to use a pot holder to keep from getting burned.I don't want to say for buyers to not get this waffle maker because it really does make good waffles, but I also want them to be aware that the maker is of somewhat poor quality and I wonder just how long it will last. Is it $40 well spent or $40 wasted?
