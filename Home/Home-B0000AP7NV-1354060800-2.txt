review/summary: A must for college dorm lifereview/text: I love my Brita slim pitcher! As a college student, space is limited. Other pitchers are quite bulky and I only own a mini fridge. It fits perfectly on the door and doesn't take up much room. The pitcher saves me so much money on buying water bottles and the water becomes quite tasty. I refill the pitcher about 3-4 times a week depending on how much my roommate and I use it. This might seem like a lot but it really doesn't bother me. As far as different aspects of life, I wouldn't recommend this sized pitcher for a family. For 1-2 people with limited fridge space, it is a really great pitcher.
