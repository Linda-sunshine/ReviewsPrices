review/summary: Works well and costs littlereview/text: You get what you pay for with this... in a good way. This is a simple but useful coffee maker. Yes it is small, yes it only has basic features, but it makes coffee and keeps it warm, and it's inexpensive. No complaints. Exactly what I expected.
