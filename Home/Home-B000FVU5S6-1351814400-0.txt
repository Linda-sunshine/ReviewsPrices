review/summary: Very Scratchy Sheetsreview/text: Washed them before initial use. They were very scratchy and uncomfortable. I read another review saying to soak them for 2 hours and then again with fabric softener. Needless to say, it did not work. The sheets are still scratchy and have that "hotel room sheets" feel. Hopefully it will soften up from my body oils.
