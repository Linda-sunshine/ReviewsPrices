review/summary: The cheapest way to make a good cup of joereview/text: My espresso machine broke. I am researching as much as I can about espresso machines iin order to buy the best for the least money. But espresso machines, a decent one, is expensive no matter what. In the mean time, I want my coffee black and strong, and this is a cheap way to make something close to an espresso but by far less money. I tried my coffee this morning wondering if I need my expensive espresso machine, it is that good. I will get the espresso machine anyway, but for a while my new moka will give me plenty of good near to espresso shots.Some reviewers are complaining about receiving a knock-off inferior product. I bought this one directly from Amazon and they sent me an original Bialetti, no complains here.
