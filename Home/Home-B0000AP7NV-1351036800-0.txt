review/summary: Poorly designedreview/text: Holds enough water and the shape is nice as it might even fit on refrigerator door, but it turned out to be another piece of junk from amazon. In the last year or two nearly everything I order from Amazon fails to meet my diminishing expectations.The problem is that the mechanism which houses the filter doesn't fit snugly enough into the pitcher, and if you don't use two hands to pour, the whole thing will plop out, knocking over your glass and spilling water all over the place. However if you try pressing the mechanism down into the pitcher, you're going to have a terrible time extricating it. DON'T BUY THIS PITCHER.
