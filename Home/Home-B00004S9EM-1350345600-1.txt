review/summary: Downsizing without losing quality.review/text: So I am the proverbial empty nester, and my husband and I simply don't need a large food processor most days. After using a large one for over thirty years, I was reluctant to consider leaviNg the brand. I am happy to say that this size delivers all the power and the precision of a larger model. Sometimes when making a smaller item, the function gets too intense for the quantity, however this does not occur her. This is a recommend.
