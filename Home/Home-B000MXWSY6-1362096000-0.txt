review/summary: Not quite loud enoughreview/text: Lots of functionality (dual alarms, option for buzzer or radio) but the alarm sound is just not loud enough. Setting the alarm isn't very intuitive, either. A basic alarm clock should be relatively simple -- you really do have to read the instructions to figure out how to set the alarm on this thing. I do like the battery backup, and have had good success with Sony products in the past. I bought this alarm to replace a Sony alarm clock that I've had since about 1983! I wanted to have one ready for when it finally died... but it's still going strong, so I'm using this one in the guest room.
