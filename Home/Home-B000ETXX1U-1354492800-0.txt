review/summary: Slept greatreview/text: I purchased this item because my job affords me several days off for holidays and what not. During the long stints off work I go back hone and stay with friends and family as I visit. I'm a big guy and it was no longer comfortable sleeping on a couch. I bought this product on a whim never been too impressed with air mattresses. They usually have less air in them then when you've went to sleep.However this air mattress inflated easily with the built in pump, major plus. It deflated just as easily. The mattress slept comfortably with no lose of air. I loved it. Had a week off for Thanksgiving, my buddy let me use his apartment affording me his livingroom to blow up my mattress. I was plesantly surprised by how well I slept on it.My only complaint was I found a mysterious hole in my mattress one night. Have mo idea how it got there. Used it tge night before, deflated the mattress, folded it up and stored it in the corner. Later that night when I blew it up, the mattress was leaking air bad through this mystery hole. I went to Target the next day and bought a Schwinn inner tube repair kit. There are these small circular patches that adhere to the hole, looks like something you put on the bottom of furniture legs so as no to scratch you wood floor. Patch worked great, slept on the mattress two more nights no problem.One other thing, it might seem insignificant but tge storage bag that comes with the mattress is large enough to store the mattress in. My Grandma has an air mattress and it is a pain in the butt putting the mattress back in the bag. It's the little things that make the difference.
