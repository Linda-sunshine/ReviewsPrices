review/summary: Very easy way to open winereview/text: Wine openers can be problematic if you don't get the corkscrew lined up correctly. I got this for my wife and we both love how easy it is to use. It just fits over the top of the bottle. You don't have to line it up at all. It is also great that it has a recharging stand so we won't have to worry about batteries.
