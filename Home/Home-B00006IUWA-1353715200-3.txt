review/summary: It does its jobreview/text: I bought this popper because I'm supposed to be on a low fat, low salt diet. The popper does the job of popping the kernels - surprisingly, all except the final two or three. However, I've found that I dislike popcorn without butter and salt and I haven't found adequate substitutes for the taste I like. So, while this popper does a good job popping popcorn, just as it's advertised, it sits in my cupboard most of the time.
