review/summary: Awesome popper!!review/text: This popper is great! The kernels pop perfectly and huge! I purchased this to replace a really awful fire sale popper from Target - Sunbeam or Sunlight or something, I don't remember the name - it was junk! So I got this and I can use half the kernels that I needed to use in the old one, because they ALL POP in this machine. I had an Orville Redenbacher years ago that was misplaced during a move and I miss dearly! This popper is the one I've been waiting for; it works just as well as the Orville and it's half the price!
