review/summary: Product leaks for liquid foodreview/text: I don't think this jar is intended for food that contains liquid (e.g. food with juice, chicken soup etc.)I've tried it with instant oatmeal, soup, leftover rice etc. The conclusion is it works well with anything that is not watery, e.g. pasta, salad, rice and even porridge, but with chicken soup or watery oatmeal, the liquid will seep through the lid.It didn't dirty my bag like a coffee spill, but it's quite annoying finding streaks of water on my belongings.
