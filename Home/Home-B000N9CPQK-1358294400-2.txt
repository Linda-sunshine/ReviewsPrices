review/summary: So Far, So GREAT!review/text: I love this product. I chose it for the washable filter...the air is only as clean as the filter. So, I wanted to be able to keep it clean. It has 3 speeds and an Ionizer mode that can be turned on or off. I run it on low and no ionizer and turn it up and on as I feel it is needed. It is a bit noisy if that is something that will be a problem for you. Even on low you can hear the fan. High is pretty noisy. Keep this in mind if a quiet purifier is important.
