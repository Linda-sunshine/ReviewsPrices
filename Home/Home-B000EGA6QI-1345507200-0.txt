review/summary: You won't believe how much you end up using this.review/text: Really handy little blender, actually use it more than my regular blender now on account that it's just so easy to pull out and use right away. Even whip my scrambled eggs with it and have noticed they come out much fluffier. Really easy way to mix my protein shakes after my workouts too. Plus it's not too expensive either and it's of a much higher quality than some of the other units I've tried in the store.
