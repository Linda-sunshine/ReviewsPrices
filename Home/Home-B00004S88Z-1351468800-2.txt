review/summary: Great pressure cannerreview/text: My wife had always been apprehensive about pressure canning. That was until I bought her this All American canner. Since then she has been canning up a storm, and our pantry is full of all sorts of goodness to last us all winter and beyond! This thing is build like a tank!!
