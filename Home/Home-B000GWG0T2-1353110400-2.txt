review/summary: Fantastic...and really big.review/text: When I took out my new pan, my heart sank. It is SO big, especially because I cook for two mostly. I didn't realize, but 12.5" measured across the top is really, really big. I considered sending it back (after all, it doesn't have a lid (which, of course, I already knew) and I couldn't find a suitable one online)...but decided to keep it. And now I love it. I found a nice "universal" skillet lid at Walmart for about $10. It said "up to 12"," but sits perfectly on this skillet. I don't need lids to seal, just to keep splatter at bay, and hold heat in.I have found this skillet to be absolutely a joy to use. I do a lot of cooking, and tend to replace my "nonstick" frying pans at the first sign of wear, so now I know what kind to get the next time one of my smaller ones is replaced.
