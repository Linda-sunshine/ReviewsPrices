review/summary: Great bread machine for the price!!review/text: For almost 40 years, my family has always liked and preferred the Panasonic Brand, and this bread machine is no exception.A friend, who has one and recommended this model to me stated very simply "MAKE SURE you add the ingredients in the proper order AND use the exact amount specified for each ingredient, or you will get a MESS." I promised him I would not stray from his advice.This machine does what it promises to do-- make bread -- NOTHING is more enjoyable than bread-- The Staff of Life. The Panasonic SD-YD250 Automatic Bread Maker has enough "Bread Programs" and "Baking Options", Size and Crust Selections, and PLENTY of interesting bread recipes, to keep a bread lover busy. And happy.I like this machine -- Panasonic Quality on a budget. I also plan to try out my friend's Red White And Blue Bread recipe.
