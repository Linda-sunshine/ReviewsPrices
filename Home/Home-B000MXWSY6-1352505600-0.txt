review/summary: Perfect for the Pricereview/text: The Sony ICF-C318 Clock Radio with Dual Alarm is just that. Compact and easy to use. Really like the dimmer capability of the display. Lost electricity for 6 days due to Hurricane Sandy and not only did clock keep working as promised BUT it even knew about daylight savings time. What's not to like? The price was right too!
