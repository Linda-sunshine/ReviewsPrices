review/summary: Great glider for the price.review/text: Bought this glider because of the price. I'm very happy with it so far (3 months). As others have mentioned, seat cushion is thin and not very comfortable but everything else is great. Took about 20 minutes to put together. Of note, the glider is light when compared to some of the other more expensive ones, so it is better suited for carpet flooring. Oh my hardwood floors, it does slide around a little bit... not too annoying, just enough to mention it.
