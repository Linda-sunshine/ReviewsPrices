review/summary: Great vac!review/text: We needed a small vacuum on our boat that could handle the daily cleanup of a kid and dog. This vac fit the job perfect. It picks up dog hair, spilled dog food, crayon pieces, and more. So far it has vacuumed up everything we have used it on without any issues. The long power cord makes it easy to plug-in in one spot and use the vac all around the boat. We love this vac and it performs much better than a battery operated handheld. We recommend it!
