review/summary: A Fantastic Small Kitchen Appliance...read thisreview/text: I cannot believe how wonderful this Salad Shooter is. I have used cheap and expensive food processors and they simply do not compare to this fantastic small kitchen appliance. It is the best and fastest way to grate cheese AND it also can grate, slice, and julienne vegetables for salad and vegetable dipping platters. Presto has been around for a long time and have many small kitchen appliances. They even have other cones you can purchase. Do not think this is a gimmick appliance, it really does the best job. And the clean-up is quick and easy too!We were so impressed with presto we purchased the pizzaz oven and the 12 cup coffee pot. These are the top three items in our kitchen. Thank you Presto and Amazon!!!
