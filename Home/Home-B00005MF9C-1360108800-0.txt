review/summary: Bought it for my husband who enjoys coffeereview/text: The device is very simple to use and clean especially on a day that you are in a hurry. You can also use it to make tea with tea bags. Just pop the tea bag in the coffee container and voila! hot tea instead of coffee! Will not recommend it though if you are a coffee connoisseur. If you are looking for something not expensive and easy to clean, this is your coffee maker! My husband uses French coffee from Starbucks in this and we have been asked a few times on how we made the coffee.
