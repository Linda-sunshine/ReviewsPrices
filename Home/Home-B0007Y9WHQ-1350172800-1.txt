review/summary: My favorite kitchen toolreview/text: After reading Wheat Belly by Dr Davis I gave up all grains a year ago. Surprisingly I haven't missed pasta, but was looking for a different way to eat veggies and found this. Omg I am in love! So far I've only made zoodles (zucchini noodles) but it is by far my favorite meal/snack. I make the noodles, put them in a strainer with salt, let them sit for 20 mins, rinse, and saute for 4 mins with garlic and olive oil, and volia perfection!The machine has suction cups on the bottom, so it is really easy to use. It's a bit cheap looking, but it gets the job done. Clean up is a breeze, I just wash by hand.
