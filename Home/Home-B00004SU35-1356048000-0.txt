review/summary: Nice idea, but poor qualityreview/text: We have used and purchased these as gifts. Under only moderate use, the plastic gears wear out and the entire popcorn popper rendered useless. Needs to have quality gears and I'd give it 5 stars. Disappointed enough that I will not buy another one.
