review/summary: Good Small/Medium Heaterreview/text: The fan blowing the heat around the room helps you feel warmer quicker, even if it may not technically heat the room up as much as some other way more expensive heaters. It was a pretty good value. I'm not sure I can tell that the power output is very different between High & Low though...can't tell any difference actually.
