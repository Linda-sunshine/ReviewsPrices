review/summary: Friend Said It Took Noticeably Longer to Bake Cookies On Thisreview/text: I gave a friend one, and she bakes cookies for the volunteers at the local animal shelter where I volunteer. And she said it took a lot longer to bake chocolate chip cookies than it did with a regular metal pan. Oh, did I mention to please adopt a pet if you are considering one? :) Today we had a mega adoption even where several agencies had adoptable pets and 325 pets were adopted today, and there's still tomorrow. :)
