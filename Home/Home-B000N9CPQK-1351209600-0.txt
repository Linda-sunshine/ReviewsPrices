review/summary: Exaclty as listed, but be careful if you have asthmareview/text: This product was delivered in a timely fashion and worked exactly as it was described. It is relatively quiet on low and I am happy enough with it. However, be careful if you have asthma like me. The ionization option is an asthma trigger. It is listed in the instruction manual, but a lot of these purifiers work with ionizers, so watch out. You can turn it off, but what you are left with is a glorified vacuum filter with a tiny fan. I was disappointed, but again, not with the product itself so much as the fact that I was not warned about that up front.
