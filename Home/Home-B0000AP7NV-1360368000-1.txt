review/summary: One of the best investments yet.review/text: I am someone who usually buy cases after cases of water bottles, but after reading some articles (Not sure if true or not, but it did play role) that said that some water bottle companies probably have less maintenance and puts in less effort cleaning the water that they are selling than tap water itself, it made me want to go back to drinking tap water, but I can't seem to down some of the chemicals in it. So I had to give this Brita Slim Water Filter Pitcher a try, and as far as I can tell, every sip tastes like heaven.It is much cheaper than going out and buying those 24 case of water bottles, that's for sure, and the water taste the same if not better. I'm not someone who looks deeply into the chemicals of the water by taking out a droplet and testing it under a microscope or something, but I definitely feel safer drinking from this filtered water. - Much cheaper too!
