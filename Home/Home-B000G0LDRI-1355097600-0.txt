review/summary: I believe this is a good room air hudmidifierreview/text: We previously had a honeywell cold air humidifier we liked, but the fan wore out. When I looked at the reviews for another one just like it, they all had issues with the fan. So, I started looking for another one. If you put the fan on high on this one it is rather noisy. So for the night time, I just turn it down to low. It really puts the moisture in the air. I am happy with it.
