review/summary: good value - you do get what you pay forreview/text: i bought this set b/c the kitchen knives i used the most were loosening/breaking and i needed a set of steak knives for a dinner. This seemed a versatile set and fit the bill. I use the chef's knife the most. It is a good knife, sharp, and study. The paring and utility knives also get a lot of use. The steak knives are okay. The Santoku knife's blade is too thin for me to use routinely - there is quite a bit of flex to it. I do not use the boning knife, lost the shears soon after receiving, so can't comment on them. I've managed to cut the pad of my index finger twice by using the slicing knife - not from the honed edge of the blade, but from the top part by putting pressure on it, so be careful. I now hold that knife differently to avoid this. The knives themselves are have maintained their sharpness. The storage block is nice. have not had problems with rust. The bakelite handles do dull if you do not wash them promptly or put them thru the dishwasher.Overall, this a a good basic set. Only complaint is the santoku which is too bendy. watch out when using the slicing knife if you hold your knife by pressing down of the blade from above. These are not top of the line knives, but then if you're paying thirty bucks, they are better than average.
