review/summary: Horrible sheetsreview/text: First let me say that I followed others instructions (soak in fabric softener, etc.), however, these sheets are scratchy as can be. They are literally worse than the $20 sheets I bought a few years ago from Target. Huge waste of money. If you are on the fence about these, go with another product. I'm going to have to go buy another set of sheets because these are like sandpaper. Very disappointed.
