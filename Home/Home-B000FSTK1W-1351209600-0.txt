review/summary: Really Uglyreview/text: I purchased this item to use in a fiberglass shower unit, based on the attachement method which we have used on other items such as coat and picture hooks.This thing was so ugly we never even tried it, just threw it out. I only give it a star because I would guess that it does work, but the aesthetics are just plain bad!
