review/summary: great to do canningreview/text: This is my first pressure canner, and I have already used it twice. As recommended, I took the lid and gauge to the local Extension Service for testing, and it worked perfectly. The instructions booklet that accompanies the canner is pretty easy to understand, though I wish the graphics were a little larger. I thought pressure canning was something akin to rocket science, but it was really very much easier to do. And now I'm continuing a tradition that has been going on in my family for generations.
