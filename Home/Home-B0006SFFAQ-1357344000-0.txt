review/summary: Perfect coffee makerreview/text: Simply put, this unit makes fantastic coffee. The coffee is brewed piping hot, then is kept that way with the warming pad. Having used another coffee maker for years that brewed essentially lukewarm coffee, this one is a major step up. All the functions work as designed. I like the feature to brew only 1-4 cups, which double-heats the water to compensate for the lack in volume -- a nice touch. The reservoir is easy to fill, and the carafe pours in a crisp, steady stream with no dripping. Another nice touch -- you can adjust the temperature of the warming pad. Medium seems to keep the coffee at the same temp as brewed, which is perfect. Highly recommended.
