review/summary: Adequate only if you make several adjustmentsreview/text: I give it 2 stars only because I haven't found another small, cheap coffee maker that's as good. (If you know about one, I'd be grateful if you would inform me in the comments sections.)Big complaints:The 4 cup model holds only two and a half 8 oz. cups.The coffee will not be hot, only warm (165 degrees). I mention this chiefly because coffee is weak when brewed below 175+ degrees. I have, however, a separate water boiler for making tea from which I take water to fill the canister. Alternatively, one could heat the water in a microwave. That's a major adjustment.Little complaints:After half a year of daily use, I usually see a few coffee grinds in the pitcher. Making only 12 oz. causes even fewer grinds to fall into the patcher.Unless one fills the canister carefully, it's easy to spill a little.Others' complaints that I don't experience:My machine didn't cause the coffee to stink of or taste of plastic; I followed the instructions, and ran water through the machine without coffee before using it.No parts leak.The pitcher didn't crack or chip, and is easy enough to clean.The clock didn't lose time.Miscellaneous:I can't seldom find the smaller size filters on the shelf even in very big stores, so I must order them on-line from Amazon.Conclusion:I wouldn't buy this Mr. Coffee again if I didn't have hot water from another source ready.
