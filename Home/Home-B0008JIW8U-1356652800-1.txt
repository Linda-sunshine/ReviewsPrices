review/summary: Inexpensive, compact, attractive, basic coffee maker.review/text: This is just what we were looking for, an easy to use coffee maker for two, without all the bells and whistles.It sits neatly on the counter next to the grinder, you just add water and coffee and press on. To me it was well worth the price.
