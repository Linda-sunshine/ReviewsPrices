review/summary: Not a fan of permanent filterreview/text: I got this a few days ago and have made about 5 cups of coffee. The coffee comes out a lot hotter than my previous coffee maker. I am the only coffee drinker in the house so since it makes about 14 oz of coffee it is perfect for me. I had always used a coffee maker with a disposable filter. I thought it was great that this one has a permanent filter so I wouldn't run out of them. Well, I guess I am not a fan of the permanent filter. It is a mess to dump out the coffee in the trash and then the remaining coffee grounds need to be washed out. It was much easier to throw away the entire disposable filter, but otherwise it is, so far, a great coffee maker.
