review/summary: Don't buy!review/text: I bought this juicer about a month ago and the attachments that hold the blade and the motor together are plastic and ended up melting. Needless to say I bought a juicer that I can no longer use and can't return because it's 5 days past the return policy on it. Another side note. At first it didn't have hardly any pulp but after using it a few times it started to create more and more. If your going to juice I'd recommend spending more money on another and not wasting it on this one.
