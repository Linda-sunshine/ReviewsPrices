review/summary: Good choicereview/text: I had to replace my bread machine and decided that I wanted a horizontal loaf instead of the vertical loaf I had previously. I do enjoy that but was a little surprised that it was still a little odd shaped espescially when making large loaves.I do not like the recipe book that came with it. I actually still use most of the recipes from my old machine's book. The recipes in the Panasonic book recommend weighing your ingredients for measurement so the recipes are listed that way. I don't weigh ingredients as I don't have a scale and don't really want to buy one. And I didn't like how the couple of recipes I made from the book turned out. My old recipes work great though!The other draw back from my previous machine (GoldStar) is that the cycles are all just a bit longer with the Panasonic. I have gotten used to that but still a bit disappointing.Overall a quality machine though.
