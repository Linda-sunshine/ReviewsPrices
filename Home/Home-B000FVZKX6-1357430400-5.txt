review/summary: The Quilt Got Kicked Off First Thing!!review/text: We sleep in a very cool room (around 50 degrees) and use a sheet, a fleece blanket and a medium weight quilt -- until now. After we put these wonderful, luscious sheets on the bed, we removed the quilt before either of us actually were able to sleep. These sheets could be described as velvet but we think they feel like fine suede. They fit all the way around a very deep mattress without sheet belts to secure them. I am ordering a second set right after I complete this review. The only down side is that the top sheet could be a few inches longer but our opinion may change if we no longer feel the need to cover up nearly to the top of our heads! LOL.
