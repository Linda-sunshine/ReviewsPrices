review/summary: No automatic shut-off is safety flaw, but good for first timers who are willing to upgrade after a year or so.review/text: I purchased the SF-407 after a friend brought one to help get wrinkles out of stage curtains at the elementary school. I could see uses for it, but wasn't willing to commit a bunch of money as I could see that it would also be a space hog in my small, utility closet. It worked well for about a year and then became less and less effective. One serious drawback to this model is that there is not an automatic shut off. The red switch to shut it off is difficult to see and sometimes I forgot to turn it off (once the steam stops, it's easy to forget that it's still on. This likely reduced the life of mine as I'm sure that leaving it on for 30 minutes when it's dry is not a good idea. It is difficult to drain and almost impossible to clean properly. I only ever used distilled water and it nevertheless had a lot of scale and rust that eventually (I suspect) killed the heating element. I would also say that the plastic head worked fine on very sheer and/or delicate fabrics, but was not as effective for heavier fabrics like wool blazers or coats. I'm upgrading now to the J-2000 model with a metal head and hope that it lasts longer than a year. I estimate I use this about once a month and it has also proved to help disinfect dry-clean only items that I would otherwise have had to send to the cleaners. It does work well for spot cleaning items and that's been a bonus. Overall, if you've never had one and don't know how much you'll use it, this one is a great starter steamer as if it's not for your lifestyle, it's only $50. Mine did not leak, but with light use, it has now passed on.
