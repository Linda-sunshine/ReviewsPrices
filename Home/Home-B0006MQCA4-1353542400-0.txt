review/summary: The best!review/text: I chose this one on a friend's recommendation. I was looking to stop buying cases of bottled water, and wanted to see if our nasty city water would be palatable, for once. And, it is! Love the slimline design, low maintenance (change a filter every 3 months), and our water is delicious! We drink even more than before.
