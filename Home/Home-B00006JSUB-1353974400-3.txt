review/summary: Had no ideareview/text: I had no idea how much I would love this skillet. I bought this as the same time that I bought a set of cooking pans. I use this skillet so much. Had I known, I probably could have bought this one and just a couple of individual pans, instead of a whole set. I can use it for so many things and I just love the cornbread it makes. I am not going to comment on the seasoning as so many others have already. Just know what to expect and the only suprise will be how much you will use it. I don't think it gives an &#34;off taste&#34; to my food at all. Mmmm, now what to make in it tonight?
