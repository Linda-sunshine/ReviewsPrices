review/summary: Bad A$$ Deal!!!review/text: I borrowed my brother's $200 fancy-pants juicer for a bit and then decided to get one of my own. Not in the market to spend $200 dollars on an appliance, I found this one here on amazon for $60-ish.It's a bad ass little machine! It's just as powerful as the expensive ones. It's easy to clean and the wide mouth spout takes whole apples. The upright design takes up much less space (and just looks better) than those horizontal designed ones--and it actually hasn't clogged once. The fancy one I had to stop and clean out after celery strings would clog it up.Highly recommended!
