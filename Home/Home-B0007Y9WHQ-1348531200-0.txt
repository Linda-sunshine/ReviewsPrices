review/summary: Spiral slicer is one of the best on-line purchases ever!!review/text: After watching multiple videos on you-tube of recipes for making raw pasta and reading all of the positive reviews on amazon I decided to purchase this spiral vegetable slicer. I have to say for the price this is an AMAZING product! It was shipped very fast and I was sent multiple emails of the status. Even though it is plastic, all (3) blade options are metal and sharp which works great for slicing. It is small enough to leave on my counter all the time, and since it is white it looks clean. It arrived last week and I have already used it numerous times. I made raw spaghetti with a zucchini and made a raw tomato sauce with some garlic and mushrooms and it was just like eating regular pasta. The strands came out super long and dry!! Make sure to use a fresh zucchini as most of the reviews state so your raw pasta strands don't come out mushy. It is super easy to use and the crank handle glides very smooth. I can't wait to use it to make curly sweet potato fries yum!!!
