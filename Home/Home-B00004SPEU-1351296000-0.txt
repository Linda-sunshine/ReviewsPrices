review/summary: Great buy!review/text: This is a great little grinder! It is pretty quiet and does a great job grinding coffee beans. I do need to brush it out as some of the coffee sticks to the sides. I would definitely purchase this item again. I wish the color red had been an option when I purchased this a few months ago!
