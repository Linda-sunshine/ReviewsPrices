review/summary: Broke completely in 5 months and Black & Decker would not honor warrantyreview/text: The iron broke completely in 5 months and Black & Decker would not honor the product warranty to fix it. We received the iron in July 2012 and used it for less than 6 months before it stopped heating. My husband is trained as an electrician and we are tech savvy - this is not "user error." The digital display works fine but the heating element quit completely. When I contacted Black & Decker warranty, I was told that because I am out of the country, they would not honor the warranty. I work at the U.S. Embassy in Haiti and have a U.S. DPO address, which is where the iron was shipped. The iron has only been used in one house in U.S. Embassy housing, built to U.S. electrical code standards. I am out of luck with a broken iron. I do not recommend this model of iron to anyone as it lasted only 5 months before breaking, and I do not recommend Black & Decker because of their poor customer service and warranty coverage.
