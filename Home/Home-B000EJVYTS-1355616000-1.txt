review/summary: A MAGNIFICENT KITCHEN TRASH CONTAINERreview/text: This kitchen trash container is convenient and beautiful. It works exactly as advertised, opens quickly and automatically to receive kitchen trash with a mere wave of hand or anything in your hand. The charcoal deodorizer is a nice plus. This is my second touchless product and I purchased the first one from Costco; the price was about the same but shipping was free. I thought it was going to be free this time as well, but Amazon charged me $13.58 for shipping. I tried unsuccessfully to have that refunded. The one I purchased from Costco broke, quite understandably when I tried cleaning inside the lid with running water; The electronic parts quit.
