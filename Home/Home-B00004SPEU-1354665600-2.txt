review/summary: Uneven For Fine Grindingreview/text: In fairness to the product I bought this to grind eggshells into powder (calcium source for my dog's homemade diet). I also wanted to grind dried beet pulp (same reason). Unfortunately the motor starts to get hot after just a few seconds, so I can only grind for a moment. Then stop. Then grind again, etc. If I grind even for 5 seconds I will start to smell the motor and that burning smell gets transferred to whatever I am grinding. Also, no matter how long I grind (in spurts) the end result is very uneven with about half of it powdery and the other half in granular bits.
