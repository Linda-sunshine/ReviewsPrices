review/summary: Efficient cure for winter itchreview/text: This unit consumes 0.55 kwh in 24 hours with the rate adjusted to about halfway. And that rate is enough to keep my 12x14 bedroom at around 60 percent humidity. The less expensive warm mist vaporizer unit I tried first from a local brick and mortar store took more than 10 times the electricity as this one. At $0.11 per kwh, this Crane unit costs just a nickle per day to operate.I have run this unit 24/7 for a few weeks, and have not had reliability problems. It's December of 2012. I will come back at the end of the season and report on the reliability. I had tried the smaller Hunter unit (Hunter 31004 Ultrasonic Small Room Humidifier), but it did not work when I took it out of the box, and actually had not only a bad switch, but also a bad fan. This Crane unit is slightly louder, but it's a soothing white noise. Both units sound output is occasionally punctuated by a distinct gurgle when more water drops into the base from the water vessel. The larger capacity is worth quite a bit to me since at the setting I use, the Crane can go 36 hours without a refill. The smaller Hunter could barely make it 24 hours.As to the goofy look of the thing, well, nobody is going to see it anyway. The instructions include a whole bunch of model numbers, which I assume are all the different animals (EE-865, EE-3186, EE-3189, EE-3190, EE-3191,EE-4139,EE-4140,EE-5058,EE-6369,EE-7270,EE-8189,EE-8190,EE-8243)January 24, 2013: Unit has been running 24/7 (with daily and weekly maintenance, of course) and still going strong. Just saw Jeff Dunham tonight...he had two puffingtons on the stage!
