review/summary: Absolutely love itreview/text: I've had my Aerobie press for over four years, and have enjoyed every single experience. I was a french press user for many years prior to getting the Aeropress, and had a typical drip Bunn-o-matic before the french press. I must say that nothing compares to the Aeropress. I prefer it to the point that I actually dread drinking other coffee! Thankfully it is small and portable, so it travels easily. You will not be disappointed in this product.
