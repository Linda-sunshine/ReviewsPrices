review/summary: Planned obsolescencereview/text: I bought the unit in May of this year. All was well until the wand portion rolled onto the floor. Although there is no visible sign of damage, the unit no longer turns. I contacted Cusinart, told them what happened with the hopes they might offer me the opportunity to purchase a new wand section. Had I lied and told them it just stopped working, they might have covered it under warranty. In telling the truth and in finding that I can not purchase the replacement wand, I find I have spent $29.95 for nothing. A manufacture that doesn't offer the opportunity to purchase replacement parts has taken planned obsolescence a little too far in my opinion.
