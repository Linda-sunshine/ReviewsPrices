review/summary: Nice cubesreview/text: Soft silicone makes this a nice option from some of the harder ice trays, I recommend the Tovolo KING sized trays as well. Only drawback is my thumbs get cold pushing out the cubes from the mold. Easily remedied with gloves or a nice strong cocktail (I prefer the latter)!
