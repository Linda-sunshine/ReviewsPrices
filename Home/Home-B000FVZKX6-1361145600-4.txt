review/summary: Must buy these sheets!review/text: I was a little worried about buying flannel sheets but my friend told me that they would be the best sheets ever and she was right. The are incredibly soft, warm, and breathable. I was worried that they might retain to much body heat but they breath quite well! They keep me warm enough that I haven't had to use my comforter at night.(I live in the south so it doesn't get cold here often!)
