review/summary: Efficient Little Thingreview/text: At first, I was a little skeptical as to how well this little machine will work. I placed the Eva humidifier in my dressing room, it started working quietly and within the hour has already collected water in its reservoir. Once the reservoir reached its maximum capacity, the Eva humidifier stopped automatically. As soon as you empty the reservoir (very easy), this little machine started working again. I love it!!
