review/summary: Great juicer at a good pricereview/text: I watched many online videos of juicer machines before I purchased this, and this machine works exactly as shown in the videos. It's a great choice for a first juicer - it's simple to use, simple to clean and works extremely well. You can't juice very tough items like the green rind on watermelon or the tough skin of a pineapple, but I juice sweet potatoes with no problem, and they are pretty hard. I have used it on carrots, leafy greens, cucumbers, apples, oranges, celery, and lots of other things with no problem. It just powers through them. I am very happy with my purchase. For a first juicer, this gets a perfect 10 from me.
