review/summary: Faulty electrical elementreview/text: Experienced a defective heating element that caused an electrical smell that necessitated us spending $60.00 for an electrician to verify this and arrange for the return of the item to BUNN for exchange which is being delayed due to a back order and our not being able to fix coffee until the replacement is received from BUNN. And we're out the $60.00 expense for the electrician.
