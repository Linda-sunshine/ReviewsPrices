review/summary: Awesome and easy to use/cleanreview/text: We just received this yesterday and have already used it several times. We are first time juicers, however we were able to unpackage it, clean it, assemble, and use it very easily. I think that we get a lot of juice out of it. We have put several whole apples in this juicer and had no problems yet. Clean up is super easy...the scraper tool that comes with it is perfect! I am so excited to continue juicing and get healthier. For the price, I think we got a great machine.
