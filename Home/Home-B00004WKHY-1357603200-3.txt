review/summary: Waited 11 days - Doesn't turn onreview/text: I ordered this on line so I wouldn't have to waste time shopping. I waited 11 days for this item to arrive. Made sure cup was in the locked position, lid on and locked. Turned it on. Nothing but the red light worked. It was full of 5 different foods. Now I couldn't see the blade so I cut my finger on the S-Blade trying to get frozen food out of it. I had to clean up a major food mess and repackage the item for UPS pickup. Wasted food. Wasted more time than if I had just gone to shop for it. I will never order a kitchen appliance on line again.
