review/summary: Support appreciatedreview/text: While serving in Afghanistan my college wrote to Keurig and asked for a support package. They shipped us a good quantity of coffee. We of course provided the machine. My college had a small one that didn't last the troop traffic of the office. I invested in this one and used it for not only hot drinks but meals as well (Ramen Noodles). I left it in office to provide for the incoming unit and bought this replacement when I got home. I just really want to say thanks and let people know this is a good quality product if you maintain it.
