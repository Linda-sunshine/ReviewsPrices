review/summary: Too bad I waited so long to buy a knife sharpener--handy device!review/text: I had a collection of knifes that were too dull to be used for much beyond very light duty. However, I didn't want to throw them out (they were nice knives--once, or they were gifts, or I couldn't find a way to safely dispose of them). I'd check around, and people I'd asked (this was before wide Internet availability) said that the only way to sharpen knives was with sharpening stones, doing it manually, or to pay someone to do it. On occasion after that, I would check with friends or relatives, but the response was always the same. I asked about electric knife sharpeners, and the unanimous response was "they are a waste of money".I'd given up for quite some time and had a forgotten stash of dull knives. Then I thought I'd check online--perhaps technology has improved. I saw positive reviews for this price, saw it was fairly cheap, and figured I'd give it a go.Now I regret not having purchased an electric sharpener sooner. The sharpener is very easy to use, and has revived all the knives I've run through it. They may not be as good as new, but they are definitely usable again and fairly sharp. Some of the knives that were previously collecting dust are now some of the favored knives to use when chopping vegetables.I recommend anyone in the same boat I was in give the sharpener a go. Just be careful afterwards to not cut your finger on a knife that used to be dull.
