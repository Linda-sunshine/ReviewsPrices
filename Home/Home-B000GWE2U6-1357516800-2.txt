review/summary: Nice productreview/text: It works well, we use it in our one-bedroom apartment. We placed it in the bedroom and only have it running at night, it does the job well, I particularly like being able to rotate the head and change the settings...The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I do have to fill it everyday after it runs during the night. So not a very large tank.
