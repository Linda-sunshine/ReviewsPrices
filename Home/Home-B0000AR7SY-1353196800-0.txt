review/summary: Perfect!review/text: This is our third burr type coffee grinder and not even the most expensive one we've purchased, but it certainly puts our previous models (Maestro, Cuisinart) to shame. We prefer an extremely fine grind of coffee and use a French Roast bean which is quite oily, but this machine handles the task perfectly, delivering the finest grind we've seen from any of our grinders. Were very surprised and pleased to see this machine also produces almost no static electricity in the grinding process which was definitely a problem with our two previous models. Have been using it a week and it hasn't clogged up yet which has been a problem with the previous models. Really pleased with this purchase and highly recommend it.
