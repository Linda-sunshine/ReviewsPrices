review/summary: These keep breaking on me but I just can't seem to do without themreview/text: I have three kids ages 3 and under and I feel like a sound machine is essential for us. We have bought three or four of these. Our problem is that we keep dropping them, or a child steps on them, and after this happens once or twice, they are definitely done for. If you treat it more carefully you probably won't have our problem.
