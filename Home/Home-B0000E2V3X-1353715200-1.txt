review/summary: Love it!!review/text: I am a fan of cast iron so this product did not dissappoint. I use it for pizza and biscuits and it retains the heat so the bread stays warm without burning. It is heavy so that may be a consideration for some. I keep it stored in oven when not in use. Lodge products are made in USA too!
