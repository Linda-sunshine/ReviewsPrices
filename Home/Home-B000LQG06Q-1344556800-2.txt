review/summary: Good for 3 months... onlyreview/text: I loved this foam topper at first. Now, I have had it for 6 months and hate it. I have rotated it several times, however the foam is so soft now that we just sink into it. This did not last nearly as long as other foam toppers I have had in the past. I would not recommend.
