review/summary: One and done.review/text: I've owned this machine for about 2 years, using it 2-4 times per week. Like the other reviewers indicated, the symptoms of my machine's demise included slow-drip espresso, followed by no-drip espresso. While the machine can run water through without hesitation, it looks like it no longer carries enough pressure to push the water through when grind is added to the mix.The machine did work well in its prime, and would have received 2 stars if I could have it repaired...but it looks as though De'Longhi is designing for obsolescence rather than designing a machine who's parts can be replaced as they fail. On to another manufacture willing to build machines with replaceable parts...
