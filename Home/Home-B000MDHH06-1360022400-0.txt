review/summary: Quite a difference from the Juicers of the pastreview/text: I bought this a few weeks ago to start juicing (after catching on to the general trend).My memories from Juicing when I was a kid was a very cumbersome machinery not easy to clean. NOT the case with the Breville. Extremely easy to clean and use. The included pitcher skims of any foam easily (if you, like me, prefer to just pour the juice rather than the froth you get when using in to your glass). The centrifugal system really extracts the liquid very well from whatever you throw at its shredders through the chute. Sound reminds me of a Dyson vacuum cleaner - jet-engine speeds. I am very satisfied with my purchase and will continue to use daily for fruit juicing and veggie juicing. Favorite recommended green recipe: Kale, Carrot, Spinach, Apple (apple added makes it a delight to drink). Also recommend adding a thumb-size piece of ginger to any orange/apple/fruit-mixes.
