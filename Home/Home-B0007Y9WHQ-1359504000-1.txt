review/summary: Great Product!!review/text: Per Amazon standard procedures, I got this a day early. I always like that. This product does EXACTLY what I bought it for -- and more. There are three different blade attachments; everything's attached to the unit and super easy in and out. Easy to clean. Has suction cups on the bottom (with an automatic release) to hold the unit steady while using. At first I was daunted because the instructions were a bit sketchy; but I just took half a cucumber and tried all three blades for myself. Easy-Peasy! I bought it specifically to spiral cut zucchini for our pasta meals. Does that like a champ. Also cuts decorative swirls for salads, potatoes, onions, etc., etc. This is a hit in my house for sure.Oh, for those who complained about a core? I have absolutely no problems with the 1/4&#34; core left when one's through. Either pop 'em in your mouth or put 'em in the salad or put 'em in the compost bin.Great product!!!
