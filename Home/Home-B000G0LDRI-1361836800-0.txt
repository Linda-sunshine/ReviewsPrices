review/summary: Fantastic humidifierreview/text: It's solid, easy to use, and doing exactly what I want it to... Humidifying the house. I've owned mine for a few months and it's worked flawlessly (despite some attempts to the contrary by my 16 month old daughter). The fan is quiet for a device that humidifies this much air, but may be louder than desired for someone with sensitive ears. I had been considering the purchase of an installed whole-house humidifier, but this is doing the job perfectly well.My word of caution to those considering this device, and it's not the device's fault, is that its fan can be heard. For anything moving this much air it should be expected, but it's worth a reminder. It has a few settings, and the low and medium settings are much more pleasant, but those settings won't blow as much humid air. It's a good hum and not a racket, but it can be heard.For the amount of humidifying for the price, and not having to cut in to my ducts, it's a great product.
