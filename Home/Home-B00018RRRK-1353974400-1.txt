review/summary: good little grinderreview/text: We have had are grinder for 6 years you folks are not using it right. first ask for coffee to be ready in the morning. When its not throw it on the floor. Then the other half will tape it back together (that was 5 years ago) Still works perfect tape and all. We are getting a new one,the tape is starting to look discolored. If the new ones quality is not there we still have the old one.
