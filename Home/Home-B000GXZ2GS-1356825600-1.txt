review/summary: Great coffee at work, plastic-free version would be great.review/text: I use this coffee press when I need a cup (or more) at work. I am a big fan of strong coffee, drip coffee usually just doesn't cut it. For a while I was using a Keurig machine at work, however the coffee just isn't that good, the selection and quality are poor, it's weak, I think the plastic cups leave a plasticy taste, and the coffee is expensive at $0.50 or more per cup.With the Aeropress you can make coffee quickly (the hot water tap from the water cooler is hot enough), cheaply, and use any coffee you want. I think the coffee tastes quite good, the result is similar in flavor to a french press with strength that is starting to approach espresso. I think that calling this device an espresso maker is a bit of a stretch, it uses pressure like a true espresso machine but steam is not involved The paper filer smooths the flavor a bit, you can buy an attachment if you want a filter-free more french press-like experience. Overall, however, this produces a great cup of strong coffee very quickly. Cleanup is quite easy which adds to its portability and usefulness at work.My one complaint about this device is that it is made of plastic. I am happy that Aerobie has decided to switch to a bpa-free plastic, originally they claimed that only a trivial amount of BPA was released from the Aeropress during the initial uses however I'm happy that they have since swtiched to a bpa-free polypropylene. Since eve polypropylene will leach chemicals into water, especially higher temperatrues, I would prefer to have an aeropress with more glass/ceramic/metal and less (or ideally no) plastic. Aerobie dismisses such ideas but I would certainly be willing to pay more for a plastic-free option.
