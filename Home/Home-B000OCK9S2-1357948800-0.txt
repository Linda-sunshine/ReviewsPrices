review/summary: Not for people with insomnia.review/text: First let me say that I own 3 of these, one in each of my kids bedrooms. It has alot of sounds which is nice, and its sufficient for background noise for kids or for people who do not have trouble sleeping. However if you do actually have difficulty sleeping I would not buy this product. The sound guality is kind of poor and you can hear the loop, I end up grinding my teeth to the rythm of the "waterfalls". I have heard other sound machines that blend the sound seemlessly, but this one costs significantly less, so it has worked out well for the kids. I have owned them for over 3 years and have had no problems with them not working.
