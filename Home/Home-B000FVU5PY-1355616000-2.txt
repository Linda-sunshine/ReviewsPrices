review/summary: Pinzon 400 Thread Count Sateen Sheet Setreview/text: This sheet set was much more than I expected for the price. The stitching is nice and tight without any pulls or puckering on the sheets or pillow cases. The fitted sheet has deep pockets and stays on the mattress, even through a restless night. The sheets have a beautiful sheen (only seen on the finer sets), the color is deep, uniform, and hasn't faded in the wash. They come out of the dryer bright, crisp, and wrinkle free.I would recommend these sheets to anyone looking for value and quality. I expect to order more sets in other colors soon.
