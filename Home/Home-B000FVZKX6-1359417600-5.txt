review/summary: Let the truth be toldreview/text: So I've been on the hunt for the perfect set of flannel sheets. I purchased two sets (other brands) at our local department store which is known for its quality merchandise. After only 1 night of rest, both sets of sheets started pilling like crazy. Today, they look horrible. So I was on the hunt again for something better. I came across Pinzon and thought that 900 positive reviews was incredible, so I immediately ordered a set for myself. Later though, I began to have doubts that the reviews were fake. I mean, why would there be 900 reviews on bed sheets?? Well, after my first night with these sheets, I can tell you that they are the real deal. They are very thick, trimmed fairly short (to prevent pilling), and quite soft. The word velvet is a perfect way to describe them. They are somewhat different than your typipcal flannel. Maybe not as soft, but definitely MUCH better quality and a tighter weave. I am confident they will hold up well. So, if you're wondering if you should get them, then the answer is YES, without a doubt! This is what you call quality flannel. Superb!
