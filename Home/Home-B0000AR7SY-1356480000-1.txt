review/summary: First burr grinderreview/text: We've used this now every day for over a year and it's performed like a champ. The only problem is that the grind indicator marks that are painted on the surface will fade away over time. The plastic pieces are a bit fragile, too. The second day we had it, I dropped the top and it immediately cracked. It was still usable, though. A few months ago, I dropped the grind basket and broke one of the guide teeth. Again, it still works. I know that the next time I won't be so lucky. We've used it mainly for coffee, but occasionally we'll grind up some peppercorns.
