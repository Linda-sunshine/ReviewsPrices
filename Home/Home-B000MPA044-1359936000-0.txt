review/summary: really convenient.review/text: much easier to use than a conventional pressure cooker. just set the timer and it automatically turns off. it makes no noise which is great when you have sleeping kids. it also frees up the stovetop if you want to cook other things simultaneously. the only thing is that it does take a lot longer to brown than using a saucepan on the stovetop.
