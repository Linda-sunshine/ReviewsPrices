review/summary: Thought-provoking and amazingreview/text: When I got an email that Lois Lowry had written a fourth novel for "the Giver" series, I decided to re-read from the beginning. I read "The Giver" first in my early 20s and enjoyed it. This time, I was enthralled and amazed. Lowry draws the reader into the story with characters you like and relate to, and she describes a world that seems comfortable and relaxing and wonderful - enough so that you (like her characters) settle in and accept the oddities of this utopian world.We are drawn right along with the protagonist as he begins to learn about what he has never known - how things used to be, both the good and the bad. Our emotions intensify along with Jonas'. In the end, we are left with questions not just about the story (what happens ultimately is far from clear) but also about what the "right" thing to do would be. I have been thinking about this book since I finished it a couple of weeks ago, which incidentally had me sitting in Panera litterally crying into my latte.The writing is skillful and beautiful, the themes are big and important, and the whole thing is easy enough to read that I'll hand it to my 9-year-old next. No wonder this got the Newbury medal. One of the "best" children's books I have ever read.
