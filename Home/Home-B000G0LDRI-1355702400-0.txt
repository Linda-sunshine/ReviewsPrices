review/summary: Good humidifier but has a few caveats...review/text: This is a good humidifier in my opinion with the exception of two things:1. I bought this product on November, 20, 2012 for $86.80 and today it is $140.24 an increase of $53.44.2. Product has a vibrating sound that can be resolved by "kicking" or moving the top cover. It seems to dissipate on the second setting (compared to 1st) but is noticeable. I'm not sure if its the unit I have but it frequently wakes me up and I find myself shifting the top cover in all kinds of directions.
