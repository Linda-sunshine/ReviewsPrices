review/summary: Great cheap cooker with limited longevityreview/text: I have owned this cooker for 5 years now and love how hassle-free it makes cooking hard boiled eggs. Something I only did on Easter has now become a treat once every month or two! In my microwave (1200 watt), 2 jumbo eggs take about 9 minutes to get fully hard boiled (I leave them 2 additional minutes sitting in the microwave after cooking). I've tried less time than this, and the egg yolks come out a little more gooey than truly hard boiled.After 5 years of light use (using 6-8x a year), my cooker has developed some serious corrosion on the metal under the lid and a slight bit of corrosion on the metal egg holder. I uploaded a photo to this listing to show this. I do clean it in the dishwasher, top rack, as the instructions say is safe - so I'm not sure what happened. The item does have a 5-year warranty from Nordic Ware, but I'm sure that the hassle and any shipping costs make using the warranty a poor option for such an inexpensive item.That said, since I have found this product highly convenient, I accepted 5 years of use as a relatively good mileage and just purchased a replacement. :)
