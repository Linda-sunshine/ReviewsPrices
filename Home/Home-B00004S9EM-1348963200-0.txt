review/summary: Easy to Use and Holding Up Wellreview/text: I love this machine. It makes chopping, slicing, making nut butter, making whipped cream, etc such a breeze. I am very happy with this machine and the time it saves is well worth the money. It does heat up considerably sometimes, but it seems to be holding up very well and it has always succeeded at whatever new task I decide to throw at it. I am also glad I went with the 7-cup. It is a good size.
