review/summary: Keeps tea hot for hours, but I can't brew tea in it.review/text: I like this mug/tumbler. Keeps my tea hot for hours. I was carrying it around while shopping with my wife. It stayed hot the whole time. Really impressed with the mug.The infuser screen is too course for the tea that I brew, so I have to use another infuser to make tea. Having the infuser work properly would be great. I could let the tea steep while driving to work, then have a hot mug of tea when I get there.I would have given it a 3 for the infuser problem, but the mug works so well that I bumped it up to 4.
