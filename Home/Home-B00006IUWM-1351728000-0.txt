review/summary: sharpenerreview/text: as a retired profesional meat cutter, i am fussy about my knives. this sharpener is fine for everyday use, and will keep normal household knives sharp. i would be careful about using it for my high quality knives, although it does an adequate job. a bit finer finishing wheel would be an improvement, as the current one leaves some rough edges.
