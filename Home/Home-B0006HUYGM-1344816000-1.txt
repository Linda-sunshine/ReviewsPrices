review/summary: Suction power!review/text: This is a great little handvac. It is powerful and sucks up dirt etc. very easily. I mainly purchased it for cleaning out my car. The power cord is pretty long so based on where your car vs. your outlet is on whether you will need an extra extension cord or not. I like to use the hose to get into the cracks of the seat in my car and the suction still works just as well. I also used it to suck the ashes out of my oven after running it through a cleaning cycle and it was great at that as well!! For me this handheld vacuum is perfect and perfectly powerful.
