review/summary: Excellent valuereview/text: After collecting several cooking thermometers that are now littering my kitchen drawer, I decided to go with this digital beauty. It seems to be very accurate;meats on the grill have been spot on, and doesn't take forever to give you a reading.Greatly reduced the number of overcooked meats in our household.
