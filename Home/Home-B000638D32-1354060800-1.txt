review/summary: Terrific knife!review/text: This knife is great. It is replacing our cheap chef's knife that we have owned for 10 years. I didn't realize how dull our old knife was until I tested them out on a lime. This Victorinox knife cut through the lime like butter and let me cut slices of lime so thin they were like shavings. Our old knife couldn't even break the lime skin without a lot of force. America's Test Kitchen thinks this knife is a great bargain, and I agree.
