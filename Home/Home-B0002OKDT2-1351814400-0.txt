review/summary: WOWZA!!review/text: I just got it so maybe am a little over zelous. BUT I have had 4 previous juicers and feel like a snob about them. The most recent one I returned was as Kuvings one that looked similar to this. The yield SUCKED! So this one I just made juices and it made at least double! I did a bag of random greens with apples, cucumber, ginger and celery and BOOM it overfilled my glass. So far this maybe the one. I really hope so!!
