review/summary: Worth buying another onereview/text: THis is an excellent product. Have been using for 4 years. It is low maintenance, when needed is easily cleaned. Depending on the weather heating etc. each tank needs to be filled at least once a day. Running the humidifier makes a big difference inside during the winter months. I bought another one as a gift to a family member.
