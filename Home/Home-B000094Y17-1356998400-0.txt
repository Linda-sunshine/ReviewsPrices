review/summary: Disappointmentreview/text: We received this as a wedding gift and loved it at first. As the time to replace the filter drew nearer, the water began to taste really, really unpleasant. It is nice to have the indicator to show when the filter needs replaced but it is difficult to reset after replacing the filter.As many reviewers have stated, the lid is not the best. It doesn't fit on very well, in fact it seems to just rest on top of the pitcher instead of clipping on. Also, the spout often needs to be held open as opposed to coming opened when pouring as it should. When the spout sticks, it makes a giant mess and is unpleasant especially when pouring water in the dark at 1am.We are currently looking into replacing this pitcher with something else. Although the complaints I have sound like minor, trivial things they are actually quite frustrating as the product is not functioning as it should.
