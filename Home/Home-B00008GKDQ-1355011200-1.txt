review/summary: Love My New Griddlereview/text: I received my new griddle 3 days ago. So far, I have cooked pancakes, pork chops, frozen mixed vegetables, eggs (scrambled and over easy) homemade pork fried rice, hash browns, and fried apples. Nothing stuck to the griddle. Everything cooked beautifully. As additional cooking aids I used a squirt bottle with canola oil, squirt bottle with water, and a cast iron meat press to adjust the cooking to my liking.Clean up has never been easier. The only time I washed the griddle was before I used it the first time. Then after each use, while the griddle is still piping hot, I used my squirt bottle with oil, put some oil on the griddle, used my long spatula to scrape off debris, wiped the griddle off with a cloth, squirt a little more oil on the griddle and rub it around to season the griddle again.
