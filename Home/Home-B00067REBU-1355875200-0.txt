review/summary: Use it constantlyreview/text: I guess I didn't really want to commit to a bread maker. I liked the idea but it had been years since I had used one and I couldn't remember if it was a complete pain in the ass or not. So i bought cheap machine to try for a bit, fully expecting to have to replace it. Oh no, not only has it been really easy to use this machine, it is proving to be a real work horse. Use it all the time and it makes great bread. As others have suggested, dump the recipes that come with it, they're ok, but the below is just much better. I've actually only made a few different types as it's just easier to stick to the ones you know and like, but for the whole section at the beginning that explains bread making technique the price of the book is totally worth it:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/155832156X/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_121
