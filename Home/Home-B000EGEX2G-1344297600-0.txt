review/summary: Great value!review/text: This is a great rocker. I bought it for my daughter, who is expecting a little one soon. She can't believe how comfy it is! The arms are padded nicely and it glides smoothly. You cant beat the price, especially since it comes with a matching stool! It has big pockets on the outside of the arms, which is so handy.
