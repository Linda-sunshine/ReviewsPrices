review/summary: Preserve your home grown goodsreview/text: Easy to use. Nothing like the joy of having your own home grown or picked goods. Whether it is green beans, jelly or venison, etc.. We just finished up canning homemade spicy mustard. Pressure canning is better than water bath, which we had been doing for the past couple of years. We both grew up using pressure cookers. Using a pressure cooker, doesnt heat up the kitchen like water bath does. Nor produce alot of steam.
