review/summary: great knife for not a lotreview/text: Just as everyone always says, Forschner/Victorinox knives are a great buy. This knife has held up well and I use it as often as my much more expensive Wusthof santuko. The only issue I have is that it doesn't fit into my block. I just cut a small piece of paperboard to use as a sleeve and keep it in the drawer. If you don't want to spend a lot, are getting started or whatever, you can't go wrong with Forschner. I initially thought I'd find the fibrox to be cheap and just plain off-putting, but I like it, especially when my hands are slippery.
