review/summary: Great alarmreview/text: Nice display easy to spot but not annoying at night, great &#34;no battery&#34; feature - the unit has an internal battery and knows what time it is even if not plugged so it doesn't ever need to be reset! Simple to use - had no need ot go over the few pages of instruction manual. Good alarm and radio feature. Decent radio quality. Amazingly cheap for the quality of the build and features - wondering how Sony makes profit on this, but that is not my problem!
