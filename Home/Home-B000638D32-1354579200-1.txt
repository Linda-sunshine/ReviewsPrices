review/summary: A great knife for the pricereview/text: I bought this on the recommendation of thewirecutter.com (a great site). For the price is it an excellent knife. The handle is a good size for my hand. And i like the textured material of the handle. You can spend 10 times as much if you want to be a fancy-pants, but this knife (and a pairing knife and bread knife) is pretty much all you need.
