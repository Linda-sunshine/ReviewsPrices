review/summary: Complete Crapreview/text: I am a regular buyer from Amazon. Generally I don't write the reviews, but I rely a lot on the amazon product reviews before making my decision to buy or not. This time I strongly feel to write the reviews about this item, regarding the delivery from the seller and overall quality of the product. In a single word it is complete crap. I ordered this product to start following special diet from the new year 01/01/2013. I ordered the item 10 days back and the item arrived to the FedEx facility in time after 2 days (Thanks to Amazon Prime Membership). Since the shipment came during Christmas holiday season, the local FedEx facility never bothered to deliver the package. The on-line tracking showed that delivery attempted. It happened for 2 days. Then finally I had to call FedEx to hold the delivery and I will come and collect personally. Which I did later.I was happy and eagerly waiting for the new year to start my juicing. I bought all sort of leafy, green vegetables and fruits. I even watched all the videos in YouTube and got ready. When I open the box, I saw there were big crack in the body on both side and it had significant damage. The actual material used for the body is cheap plastic, which is nickel coated. During the shipping and delivery attempt it got severely. Considering the price I paid for this product and the quality I got, it is a big big disappointment for me. The review in the amazon deceived me. I finally felt it is always better to see in the store physically before buying. Buyers be aware, make wise investment.
