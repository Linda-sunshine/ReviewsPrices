review/summary: not a comfortable chairreview/text: This chair is easy to put together - I spent about 25 minutes to do it. However, when I started adjusting the back tilt tension and the seating tilt, I realized that the back support tension was very weak, almost none. No good back support when there is not good amount of tilt tension. It doesn't worth the money and it's not a good product.
