review/summary: Better than I expectedreview/text: This clock is amazing! It knows what you want to do. Even though you have to fast forward/backward it goes slow, faster, stops at the half hour, etc. It's hard to explain. It's a great 'analog' clock. I haven't tried the radio yet but I don't get great reception where I live so I didn't buy it for that.
