review/summary: Works pretty well for regular sized mugsreview/text: The hot plate part is not big enough to fit the Starbucks &#34;city&#34; mugs, so note that. But a smaller mug (a.k.a. regular sized or one that doesn't have a wide base) will fit fine. I agree with other reviewers who said that it keeps drinks warm when full and hotter when less full. I think the product description should specify the size mug that fits. i will keep it because it works well.
