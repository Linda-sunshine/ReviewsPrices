review/summary: Cut my finger...review/text: 12 stitches later, my finger lives to tell the tale of it almost being chopped off. Be careful with this product. It's wonderful for the work it does but you cannot be preoccupies or absent minded for one second. I was and I nearly lost my finger. I'm typing with my middlge finger as I almost lost my index.I inadvertently manager to press the start button while cleaning out a stuck baby carrot from the bottom of the blender. My finger got sucked up in the blender and as you can imagine, ripped it to shreds. I'm not saying I wasn't foolish for trying to do what I did, but the start button is very easy to press so make sure you unplug it always when it's not submerged in food....always!!I'm too scared to use it again. Hopefully my fear will dissipate.
