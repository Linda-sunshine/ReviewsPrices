review/summary: Why the change in style?review/text: Why the change in style? Why is it so big and fat? I was replacing my 30-year-old model because the paint has worn off. The new one is almost twice the size of the old style. What's the point of a giant 1 cup measuring cup? If I needed something bigger than 1 cup I would use my 2 cup size. I do like the pour spout, unlike my ancor hocking version. I will be keeping this item as I do need to replace my old one and after all it did last 30 years. Just so you know Pyrex, bigger is not always better.
