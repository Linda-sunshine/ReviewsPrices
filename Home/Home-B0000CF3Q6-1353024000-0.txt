review/summary: This little guy is fabulousreview/text: I just made my first latte with the 3 cup Bialetti expresso maker. It is better than Starbucks and a lot cheaper. I was amazed how easy it is to use. Just put in water, 3 spoons of freshly ground coffee (any kind), and when done, add heated milk. I am so impressed that I am going to buy the 12 cup maker so company can enjoy this great coffee
