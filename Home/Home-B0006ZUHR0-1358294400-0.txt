review/summary: One of the best!review/text: I have had three irons in my 50 years of ironing. I do not iron very much (so take this for what it is worth) but this is the best iron I have had. The weight is good that means you can let the iron do the pressing and it won't fall over when you set it up. It steams great and in all temps. The little container is too small to fill the iron but it is easy to fill with a water bottle but a little hard to see through to the reservoir. I'm sure it is just 'til I get adjusted to filling. I hope to have this for many years so if it holds up it will be 5stars.
