review/summary: So easy and makes perfect teareview/text: My sister gave me this for Christmas. I love it and use it daily at home. It makes wonderful tea and is very easy to clean with just a rinse. The only drawback is that I was planning to bring it to work, but I have found that you do need to rinse the tea leaves out. Just dumping them only gets some of them out. Therefore, you need to be able to rinse them into a sink with a disposal. I don't want to clog the sink in our lunch room at work! Other than that, it is just perfect!
