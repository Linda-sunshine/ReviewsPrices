review/summary: Works Great, But Too Soft!review/text: I thought I wanted a very soft bed. In fact, I told my husband that I wanted a bed made of marshmallow. I've always HATED a hard/firm mattress and am very, very picky about needing a pillow-top. Stupidly, I bought a pillow-top mattress from Ikea and have regretted it ever since. It's terribly firm. I ordered this, thinking that it would provide me with a super soft bed, and boy, did it ever. Much to my own surprise, this was so soft that I couldn't roll over. It's too soft. Also, this pad isn't sized properly. It was a good 3 to 4 inches smaller than my king mattress. Last, the peppermint stench of this pad isn't nice.
