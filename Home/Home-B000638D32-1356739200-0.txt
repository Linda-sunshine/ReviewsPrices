review/summary: Great starter chef's knifereview/text: I bought this for my parents who have the dullest kitchen knives known to man, and so far they love it. This is a good inexpensive option for people that need a knife upgrade or are just starting to cook. This knife served me well until I was able to upgrade to a more expensive Wustof full tang chef's knife.
