review/summary: Slim and Attractivereview/text: We keep this on the kitchen counter and it gets a lot of use. Our new Keurig coffee maker suggests using filtered water in it, so we fill and use our PUR water filter several timee a day. The dispensing spout doesn't leak or drip. We are very happy with our purchase.
