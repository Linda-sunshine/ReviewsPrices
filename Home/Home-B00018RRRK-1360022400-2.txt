review/summary: Horrendous qualityreview/text: I have had 3 of these machines. The first lasted a few months and stopped working suddenly. I replaced with a new unit and it died within a month of its first use. Because it does a reasonable job for a good price and thinking that I may have had a dud unit, I recently bought a third machine at Costco and figured I would give it another try. The unit died within 2 weeks. The unit was used once a week to grind enough coffee for about 14 cups, so it was used very lightly. I cannot understand how Cuisinart which makes some good products can continue selling these POS.Do not waste your money
