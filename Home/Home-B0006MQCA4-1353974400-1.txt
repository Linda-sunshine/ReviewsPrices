review/summary: Does the jobreview/text: I've had the dispenser for about a month and I'm very happy how it works. It fits most spaces due to it's slim design and I haven't noted any leaking or black particles from the filter as some other reviews mention. It does take a few minutes for the water to filter, but that is expected so I refill it before it gets completely empty.
