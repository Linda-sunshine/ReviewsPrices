review/summary: Awesome.review/text: I have been using this for a few months now and I love it! It saves me alot of money. Put salads in the jars for the week and vacuum seal it with this and they will be good all week. Grab your salad and go! I actually use this for everything. I put my brown sugar in it, rice, nuts, etc etc. I also make sauce and chicken broth, vacuum seal it and then freeze it. I can't say enough good things about this. buy it, u will save so much money with it
