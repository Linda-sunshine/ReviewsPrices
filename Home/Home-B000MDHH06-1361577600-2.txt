review/summary: Does what it says-Good for beginners!review/text: I've never used a juicer before, so I didn't know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised! Easy to use, parts are simple to put on and take off, and it is a breeze to clean up.After much research, my only hesitation was the fact it did not have a low speed option. I didn't understand what the advantage would be until I used it. Leafy greens tend to bypass the filter too quick and end up in the pulp before all the &#34;juice&#34; is extracted. I am sure the low speed option (found on more expensive models) would product more juice from certain items that aren't as heavy. Another plus, it is not extremely loud. It has a quiet smooth power to it, unlike the heavy loud vibration of a blender.That being said, this is a great option for those who want to experiment and don't have the money for a more high end machine. This is absolutely worth the price. Another update to come once I use it more!
