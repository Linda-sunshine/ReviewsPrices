review/summary: not great ,too badreview/text: a little big for being able to toast only 2 slices at a time. as toaster is ok. as oven not really good i would not consider it a toaster oven. is more like a warming chamber with a tendency to burn. good for warming pizza. i wanted a toaster and this allows me to keep the toast warm so it works for me. UPDATE:it started to burn everything! Not even a month. I'm returning!
