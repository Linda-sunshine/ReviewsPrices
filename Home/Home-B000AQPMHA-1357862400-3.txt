review/summary: Good while it lastedreview/text: The Keurig concept is great, and I am a total addict. You get a good cup of coffee, brewed quickly, whenever you want. You can choose, cup by cup, what you want to drink, and the possibilities are extensive. Coffee, tea, cocoa, whatever.The problem I encountered is reliability. I have had four Keurig brewers fail in about six years. The first three were the fancier "Platinum" models, and the last was the simpler "Elite". Customer support is good, and Keurig replaced one unit that was out of warranty (wow!) and another that was in warranty. I like the brewers, I like the coffee, and like Keurig customer support; I don't like the reliability.So what now? I got a Mr. Coffee unit that brews Keurig K-cups. Let's see how long it lasts ...
