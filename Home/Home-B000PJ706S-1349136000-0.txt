review/summary: No smell, some annoying differences from the base model.review/text: I've owned the original Capresso aka base model, which served me well until I accidentally broke it while moving. I can say that neither of them had any kind of odor. I use the product primarily for tea day in, day out. This model allows for you to set your water to different temperatures. It boils, and also heats to the following degrees 195 (Oolong) 175 (White) 160 (Green) 100 (warm) per the chintzy pull out card on its side. This looks nicer than the base model, but I preferred that one much more because it didn't require you to line up the pot with the base. I also don't like the lid as it seems smaller, and it is certainly more cumbersome and harder to operate. I know complaining about the opening and closing of a lid...Anyway, it works, but I personally would rather have the base model with a bigger opening, which makes it easier to clean, and the stress free placement of the kettle. It just feels like a pain in the butt to have to line it up every time. What it all boils down to is that the base model should suffice, unless you are very picky with your water, and if you are I doubt your are going to notice any difference other than cosmetics for $20.
