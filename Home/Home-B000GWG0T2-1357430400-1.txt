review/summary: Christmas Giftreview/text: Bought this for my brother for his Secret Santa gift. He is VERY picky with cookware and gave me a list of requirements to pass along to his Secret Santa (he did not know it was actually me). This is the only skillet that met the list of requirements AND was priced within our $25 limit. Cooks Illustrated is one of his favorite magazines and it was rated #1 in their reviews. He called me to tell me that he made omelets on Christmas Day and loves his new skillet. Thumbs up!
