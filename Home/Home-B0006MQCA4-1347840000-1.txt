review/summary: I love this Pitcherreview/text: I replaced by french door fridge with a one door fridge and a bottom freezer. Although I have an ice maker that comes with the fridge, I know longer have a water dispenser. I love my new fridge, but I needed a pitcher for water. The PUR pitcher is designed perfectly to fit nicely in my refrigerator and the spicket works great without worries about dripping.
