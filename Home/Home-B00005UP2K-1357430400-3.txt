review/summary: How to move it easilyreview/text: I'm sorry I waited decades to buy the KitchenAid Artisan. It's wonderful & worth the cost.(I did Internet research for the best buy.) To move the heavy stand mixer around on the counter, I placed 3 Magic Sliders under it & now it slides VERY easily. These sliders are available in a small package in hardware stores or the hardware department of other stores & are usually used to slide furniture & appliances. I love the tangerine color of mine.
