review/summary: Excellent Jugreview/text: This is a very sturdy and solid glass jug. Since it is square shaped it takes less room in the refrigerator. The top seals quite well and is easy to use once you understand the need to hold the outer ring while twisting to close it. I use it to contain my home made coconut milk so I have to shake the contents before pouring it and this works just fine with no leakage. The handle is strong and the jug is easy to clean although the size prevents me from being able insert my hand to clean all the way so I have to use a brush.
