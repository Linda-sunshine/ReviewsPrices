review/summary: So Easy To Usereview/text: I rated this 5 stars mainly because of how user friendly and effective this hand blender is. It pureed my soup flawlessly and quickly (1 gallon of soup in less than 40 seconds). I personally make soups a lot and for years I had to use my food processor to blend, then go through the joy of taking it apart and cleaning 4 or 5 pieces.With this you clean one piece and save SO much time NOT processing soup in batches. The manual also comes with close to 15 recipes that I look forward to tryingIt has one speed, I believe other blenders have different speeds but personally I don't care. I'm a simple girl who likes good basic tools.
