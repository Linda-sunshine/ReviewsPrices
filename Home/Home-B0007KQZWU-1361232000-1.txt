review/summary: Excellentreview/text: We have been using our MCP-12 PRO since Christmas 2012. Who needs no stick Teflon pots and pans. The Pro MultiClad stainless steel clean up easily with soap and water. There has been no discoloration inside or out with this cook set. Excellent contact on our new ceramic stove top. You have to remember you have to dial past 6 or 7 to cook with these pans.Touchdown.
