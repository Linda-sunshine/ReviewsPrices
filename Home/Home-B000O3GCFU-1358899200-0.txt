review/summary: bought this for my son looks great.review/text: Looks to be built right,I wish they made this in a twelve oz.as it is just a little small to rehydrate food in.So I have to use my old plastic one.But that's ok couse this one is a little heavy.They should take notice of all these ultra lite guys and build us one
