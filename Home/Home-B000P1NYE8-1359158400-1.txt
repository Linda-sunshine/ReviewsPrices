review/summary: Third one I boughtreview/text: This is the third one I have purchased, the first one for myself and two more for friends. I bought mine in 2010 and have been using it daily since then. I have dropped it, over-loaded it, and practically drowned the poor thing and it keeps working wonderfully. I had no hesitation getting these for friends, and the shipping was very quick each time.The only downside is that these burn through rechargeable batteries in a week or so, but standard batteries last for many months.
