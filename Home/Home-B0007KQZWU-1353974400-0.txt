review/summary: Love this!review/text: I have to say, I did ALOT of research before purchasing this set. In the past, I have always settled for cheap pots and pans from Walmart/Target. But when my latest set of nonstick pans started to flake teflon, I decided it was time to invest in a better quality set that would last longer.When I opened the box, the pieces were shiny and heavy, very good quality. I cooked my first meal on it today and the food turned out great and did NOT stick. I did make sure to pre-heat the pans on med-low heat first, before adding any oil or butter or food. I cooked the entire time on med-low heat and never needed to cook on higher heat. The food cooked perfectly and evenly. All I did for clean up was rinse with hot water in the sink and they wiped perfectly clean.For those of you who are switching (or considering switching) from teflon pans to stainless steel, this is a great set. You do have to care and cook a little differently with SS though. Make sure you preheat the pans, and keep the heat on low to med-low while cooking. Even med heat is enough to make water boil in one of these pots. I have an induction stove top and these worked fine on it. I highly reccomend this set.
