review/summary: Great little guyreview/text: Over a year later, this thing is still rocking as it was when it was brand new. So easy to clean, it takes me 30 seconds to detach the blade and run it under water.Not strong enough for ice, but I use this for mashed potatoes and smoothies and it gets the job done so easily. Highly recommended.
