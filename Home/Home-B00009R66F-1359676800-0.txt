review/summary: So far, so good!review/text: I must admit, after a few hours of research, it seems as though there just isn't a &#34;great&#34; steam cleaner. I chose this model for the scrubbing brushes and seperate tanks which are easy to remove and empty and/or fill. I've got a pet with lose bowels right now and I've used it weekly, so far it's held up well. I've held on to the original packaging since many reviews (for many different models) say that no machine lasts for long. We shall see. Follow the directions for care and assembly and it works well. I may never use the hand wand, which seemed to be the biggest problem in other reveiws, so I can't comment on the reliability of it. I'm happy with this purchase thus far.
