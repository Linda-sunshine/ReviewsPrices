review/summary: What's up with the cancer warning?!?review/text: WARNING: THE CORDS, WIRES, AND/OR CABLES SUPPLIED WITH THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS CHEMICALS, INCLUDING LEAD OR LEAD COMPOUNDS, KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE CANCER AND BIRTH DEFECTS OR OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HARM. -Owners manual (p. 2.)Well, it's a good thing Amazon warned me in advance that I was buying a lead-based, carcinogenic vacuum cleaner! What manufacturer in 2012 creates new products that are known to contain lead and other unnamed carcinogens?? Seriously, is this necessary?I contemplated returning it. But because a) I am a grad student with neither time nor $$ to deal with returns, b) I've was practically raised on carcinogens, and c), the warning says I should "WASH HANDS AFTER EACH USE" (it's a good thing handwashing washes the cancer away?) I'll keep it for now.Buying this product is like buying a handle of cheap liquor. You DO get drunk for less, but you're gonna have to pay for it somehow--through damage your body, manifested as an excruciating hangover.This vacuum is cheap, hardcore and POWERFUL, and it will get the job DONE. For this, I would give it more stars. But at what cost? Am I (and/or my cats) going to die of cancer from having this in our home?I guess I'll post an update if any of us get cancer from this vaccuum cleaner.....! Thanks, Dirt Devil!
