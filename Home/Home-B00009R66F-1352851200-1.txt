review/summary: Works Like A Charm!review/text: Instructions for assembly get a C+... Not very clear, but enough to figure it out. The machine itself works better than I excepted (for the price). Some deep or older stains you have to work with - but that's going to be with any carpet cleaner. Overall, I'm very pleased and would purchase again.
