review/summary: Good Night's Sleepreview/text: We are an older couple who needed somewhere to sleep while waiting for furniture to arrive in our new home. I was apprehensive about sleeping on an air mattress, but this one was comfortable. We did seem to gravitate toward the middle, since it was lower than the sides. We left for a few days and it needed very little air to resume the firmness that we preferred. For the money, I think it was a good purchase.
