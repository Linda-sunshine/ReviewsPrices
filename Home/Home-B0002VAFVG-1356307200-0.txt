review/summary: The Bestreview/text: My husband and I started juicing fruits and vegetables after watching &#34;Fat sick and nearly dead&#34; the 1st Breville we bought extracts the pulp into a basin around the base of the juicer and I would have to stop and empty it all the time.THIS ONE IS AWESOME! Because the pulp is shot out the back into a large container we can brezze through the veggies and fruits without stopping. CLEAN UP IS A BREEZE! this model is SO easy to clean. I can juice for 2 people and be cleaned up in less than 30 minutes. This used to take me 1 1/2 hours! This includes washing the veggies and fruits, peeling the cucumber, trimming the carrot ends etc. Amazing sturdy machine!I highly recommend the Breville 800JEXL Juice Fountain Elite!
