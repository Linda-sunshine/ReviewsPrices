review/summary: Huge disappointmentreview/text: This machine worked great for approx 30 shots of espresso (10 consecutive days). I had high hopes because the machine produced a very generous amount of crema then one day it stopped making crema. I had the machine for less than 2 weeks. I cleaned it thinking maybe that might helped. I was still concerned, however, that it stopped working properly in such a short amount of time. The cleaning only lasted for one decent cup of espresso then it was back to not producing any crema at all. I returned the machine after having it for only 11 days. Amazon was exceptional as always with their customer service and refund. I was very disappointed and thought I had come across great espresso machine at a very reasonable price. The machine is cheaply made (pretty much all plastic) and it vibrates and moves a lot. I would not recommend this machine at all. Better to invest your money in a higher end (and most likely more expensive) espresso machine. If you do get this machine, I would highly recommend you start using it immediately and at least everyday so that if anything goes wrong you are within the timeframe to return the product.
