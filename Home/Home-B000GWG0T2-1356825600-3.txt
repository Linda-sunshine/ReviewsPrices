review/summary: Should have listened to other reviewersreview/text: As other reviewers have written, this pan seems to bludge upward in the middle when heated, making it difficult to make an omelet or spread oil or butter across the entire bottom of the pan because it doesn't lay flat. The non stick surface does work great and I do use this pan a lot, just wish it woul lay flat.
