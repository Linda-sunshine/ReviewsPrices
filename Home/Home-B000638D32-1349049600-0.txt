review/summary: nice knifereview/text: First off, I am no expert on knives. I've never owned really expensive offerings from the prestige brands so I can't compare this Victorinox to any of them. I can say it compares favorably to the medium-priced knives I've used. The knife feels comfortable in my hand - the handle doesn't slip, and it is nice and light. The blade cuts very well - it feels firm and slices through meats, veggies and fruits with no problem whatsoever. The blade also seems a bit thin but that doesn't bother me since it cuts so well, and the thinness keeps it light. For the price I think this is a very fine knife. It works great for me!
