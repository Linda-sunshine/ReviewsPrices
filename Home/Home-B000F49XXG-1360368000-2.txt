review/summary: Great little machinereview/text: I was not sure what to expect for the price I paid, but I have been very happy with this machine. I have had it for just over a month now, and it produces great shots. My 4 - 5 times per week trips to the local coffee shop for my cappuccino is no longer happening - I love my own so much better. It froths wonderfully - I do wish it had better clearance from the counter - I just bought a 16 oz. pitcher and it works great. I would highly recommend this machine, especially for the money! The only issue I really find is sometimes it is hard to seal the main wand part, and when I start to run the shot, it leaks. I think I was just putting too many grounds in. I think I have corrected that issue. Enjoy!!
