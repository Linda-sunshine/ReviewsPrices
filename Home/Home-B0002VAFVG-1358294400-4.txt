review/summary: Best in Classreview/text: There are 856 reviews on this product at Amazon. Why so many? Because this is the best centrifugal juicer on the market. The motor is the most powerful for this type of juicer. It's got high grade stainless steel all over making it nice to look at. It does its job of juicing very well and extremely fast. My first time using this I filled the catch container with juice so fast it started to overflow. I'm coming from a Jack La Lane juicer and it was stop and go with this juicer which will now be a backup. Assembly easy. Cleanup easy. Quality outstanding. This is for everyday juicing. It's meant to be a workhorse. It's one of the most expensive centrifugal juicers on the market for consumer use. I'm very pleased with Breville on how they went about making this juicer. There is controversy about the warranty. Its for 1 year. At this price point at least the motor base of the machine should come with 3-5 years. The next juicer I looked at in this category was the Omega. It comes with a 10 year warranty. I chose this because even my cheap Jack La lane juicer has lasted for 5 years with no problems. It came with 6 months warranty. Also I feel that if this thing is going to have problems it would come early on in the lifespan of this product. Also most with the Omega juicer and warranty have nightmares getting warranty parts and quality customer service. So what good is a ten year warranty. I would still recommend getting a second masticating juicer like the Omega 350 HD or better as well. Its juices a bit more thoroughly and does not oxidize or aerate the juice as much. So at some point I'll purchase one of this type. I did hours of research on this product and my conclusion is--- Best in Class. Enough said. Out.
