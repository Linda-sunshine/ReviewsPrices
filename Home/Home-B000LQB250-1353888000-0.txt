review/summary: Really helps our hard bedreview/text: From the recipient:We have a really firm bed that I just can't sleep on anymore. This foam topper probably isn't a comparison to those super-comfort beds like temperpedic, but it really helped me get rid of the back and neck aches that I have from my bed. We just ordered another one today (for our other room) and I can't wait! The one we purchased last year is still going strong, and I'm definitely happy with how it helped me get a better night's sleep.
