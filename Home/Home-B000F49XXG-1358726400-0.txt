review/summary: Recommended by [...]review/text: I'm new to espresso making and I was looking for decently priced for a starter espresso maker. I consulted google and ended up on [...], they recommended this espresso maker for beginners. I loved it. The price is right and it makes good espresso. I'm still learning, but so far, I'm enjoying using this machine. Though, I want to mention that the built-in frother doesn't froth the milk too well. Or maybe I wasn't just frothing the right way. Other than that, machine works and it's pump driven, basing from what I read, that is a good thing.
