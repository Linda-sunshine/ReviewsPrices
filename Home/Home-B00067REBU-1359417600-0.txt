review/summary: Love the Sunbeam 5891 2-Pound Programmable Breadmakerreview/text: I recommend this product to any one who never wants to buy bread again. I also recommend it to any one who loves to bake and loves a challenge--that is becoming an expert at baking bread.I have used four times so far.When making honey whole wheat, I recommend using allrecipes.com, you must modify servings to 15 (1.5 lb loaf), read about bread tips on King Arthur website, and make sure to use 1/2 tsp salt per cup flour and 1/2 tsp quick rise yeast per cup flour.I have had most luck doing this but slightly reducing total salt, and total yeast, and when adding water, add warmer water, because water temp will change dramatically when added to a cool bread pan.Rinsing bread pan with hot water prior to adding ingredients helps as well, because any heat/humidity helps rising process.
