review/summary: Sturdy and reliable for the pricereview/text: I bought one of these for our office copy room 14 months ago so I could have hot water for tea. It has withstood daily use by my idiotic co-workers who constantly ignore the directions I left on the unit about not leaving it plugged in with no water in the chamber. The water comes to a boil quickly and efficiently, so the Hot Shot is a real bargain at the price.
