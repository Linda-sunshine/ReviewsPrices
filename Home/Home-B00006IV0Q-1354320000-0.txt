review/summary: Makes Very Weak Coffeereview/text: Quite simply, this machine makes very weak coffee, to the point that it resembles tea and tastes diluted. Very frustrated, I have returned this item, but not after a few weeks of experimenting - poring over the instructions, diligently cleaning each time, ensuring perc. was seated correctly, trying with or without filter, different kinds and amounts of coffee. All for naught, it always came out the same, and even if it ever did succeed, why should anyone have to finesse the machine this much to get a normal cup of joe.To be honest, I'm replacing one of those cheap, $19 plastic 4-cup drip models. Sad to say, it put this machine to shame. I'm not asking for a lot, and this machine fails to deliver.It looks nice, reasonably quick and hot, never had any other issues (although it can get messy trying to scoop into such a small basket), but the prime requisite I have for a coffee machine is to make reasonably tasty coffee. Everything else is for naught as this machine fails to deliver. I'm quite frustrated that I wasted my time trying to get this thing to work.Based on my experience, I could not recommend this to anyone, am frustrated in wasting my time trying to get it to work, and ultimately that it made vastly inferior coffee to a cheapo plastic drip model. Look elsewhere.
