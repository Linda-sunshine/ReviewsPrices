review/summary: As advertisedreview/text: I am very happy with the Mighty Mite..it performs as advertised. Purchased it for use in a summer camp. Particularly like the looong hose and handle...perfect for removing cobwebs and cleaning rafters and getting under furniture and beds. It is not quiet, but does have a lot of suction.
