review/summary: One of my favorite things!review/text: I resisted buying a juicer for a long time because I remembered clean up being a JOB with the last one I owned. This is not the case with the Breville Juice Fountain. I cannot believe that for such a reasonable price, I was able to get such a FANTASTIC juicer. I was actually going to get the more expensive one first, but at the last minute thought I would give this a try. I am not disappointed. It is SO powerful. And SO easy to clean. (2 minutes) I've started juicing every day. The juices that I am able to make are just as great, if not better than the ones I was buying every day at the juice bars! It has changed my life. I feel great. This juicer quickly and easily juices vegetables, fruit, etc. It has become part of my daily routine!
