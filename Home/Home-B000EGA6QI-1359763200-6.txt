review/summary: Didn't last, poor designreview/text: This was a great immersion blender while it lasted. The drive shaft is connected with a plastic piece that stripped after less than a year of light use. I had to throw the whole thing away. I used this immersion blender maybe once a week to make soups and occasionally to make mayo. I am now looking to replace it with a different model.
