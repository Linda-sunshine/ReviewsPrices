review/summary: Cuisinart Dcc-1200MR Coffeemakerreview/text: Overall the coffee maker was what we expected. The color was very nice. And accents our kitchen quite nicely. We did discover two issues which could have improvements: The top hinge seems to detach on the right side sometimes and adding the water can be problematic even with the filter assembly removed.
