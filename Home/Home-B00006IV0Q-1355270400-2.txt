review/summary: Best coffee ever.review/text: Ahhhh. There is nothing that quite compares to the smell of fresh coffee perking in the early morning. I have had this pot a few months now, and so far ... so good. The coffee, as told by other reviewers is very hot!! I prefer perked coffee to drip and this pot really does an excellent job. I am assuming that because everything is stainless steel,(yes, even the basket) it will last a long time. I certainly hope so, because we are enjoying it. I should mention we grind our beans, and we purchase ground coffee. Both seem to come out flavorful and hot.Worth every penny we paid for it!!
