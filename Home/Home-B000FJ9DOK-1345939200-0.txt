review/summary: Bought this 2 years ago and I'm not looking for a replacement anytime soon!review/text: Two years ago I was tired of throwing away good water in plastic bottles left in my hot car. That water would be so hot, I just don't trust it. So I was in search for a thermos. It needed to be sleek, easy to open, easy to carry, and something I can carry in my purse and imagine myself using everyday. I bought this thermos in a store without reading reviews and took a blind leap of faith. My first test was the hot car/ice test. I filled the container with ice cubes and the remaining space with water. Then I let it sit in my car all afternoon in 120 degrees interior. The following day, 12 hours later I opened it and there was still bits of ice cubes inside! Next was the hot tea test. 12 hours later, it was still warm! Not hot, but warm enough to savor the tea.I love the design and ease of functionality. I can keep a free hand while opening this. No need to use two hands to screw and unscrew for a sip. Shaving off 5 seconds while maintaining a free hand is priceless!
