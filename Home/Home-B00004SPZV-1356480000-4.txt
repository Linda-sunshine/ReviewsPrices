review/summary: Olive Oil Sprayerreview/text: This is a great invention. My daughter told me about it, as she has one. She told me you save alot of oil by using this because it just spritz a little at a time, and you don't usually need much in a pan. I like it very much, and it is attractive enough that it can stay out on the counter top and look better than a bottle of oil..
