review/summary: Great little purifierreview/text: This is a great little Air Purifier. Some of the previous reviewers commented on how loud it was, but if you like white noise it is PERFECT. I bought this for our baby's nursery (no matter how much I cleaned it, I often smelled dust). Not only have I not smelled dust in her room since plugging it in, but it's great while she is sleeping because of the white noise. My only complaint is that it blows out cool to cold air, which does not help in an already drafty room. That will be great in the summer, but is a little annoying in the winter.
