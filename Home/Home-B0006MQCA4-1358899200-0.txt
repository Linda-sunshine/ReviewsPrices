review/summary: LOVE AT FIRST CUP!review/text: This product is just great! I never was an enthusiast of drinking water out of the tap but once I purchased this product that completely changed. I love having this filter in my life. The water tastes like clean fresh water. It is very easy to put together. I can enjoy water for almost four days with the way I fill it. At night I fill up the blue tank, and it doesn't take very long for it to filter. Once that is filtered, I go back and put more water in the blue tank. So whenever I drank whatever is in the bottom part I still have more filling up after I drink it. I make sure I leave the dispenser in the fridge over night on my fill up day so that it can all be cold. It is so easy to pour with the pull down handle. There are grips on the front and back of it so it can easily be moved back and forth. According to where you place it, it may need to be pulled forward a bit each time to pour your water but that's not much of a hassle at all. The replacement filters aren't really expensive and they last for a few months. I believe that it is a smart purchase if you are getting tired of wasting your money on packages and packages of water bottle. I would recommend this to anyone!
