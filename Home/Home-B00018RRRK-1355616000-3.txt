review/summary: Happy with this one!review/text: I'm thrilled with this grinder. Again, another well made product from Cuisinart. I couldn't ask for better for the price. My beans get ground uniformly and I can grind pretty close to the exact amount I need each day. I have a small complaint that was mentioned by another reviewer; that there are two tight crevices where some grounds get caught and the brush it comes with doesn't remove them easily. But this is trivial along with the way too short cord which forced me to add an extension on the wall. As I mentioned in my review of the Cuisinart DCC-450PK 4 Cup Cofeemaker: if this was perfect, the cost would be well out of my preferred price range like the other burr grinders that I considered.
