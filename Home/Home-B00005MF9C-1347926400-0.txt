review/summary: Very Dangerous !!review/text: I purchased this a few months ago and had a terrible experience with it. The shelf the cup sits on is way too small and it makes the cup unstable when in place. I reached for the cup and it tipped over and I had horrible burns on my tummy where the hot coffee hit that took over a month to heal and now I have a nice scar from it. It was the worse burn I have ever had and although I know accidents happen, I am not a careless person at all and I didn't bump the cup hard enough that it would have tumped over.. Also the cup is top heavy because the bottom is so slender which contributed to the accident. It is just a terrible design on this item that makes it very unsafe.
