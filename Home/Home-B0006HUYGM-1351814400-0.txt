review/summary: Get this one - great vac.review/text: I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Excellent little hand held vac that REALLY works. I have an American Eskimo dog, a Pekingese, and a white cat - with all these fur babies in my house, I needed help with fur on the stairs and furniture and this vac came to my rescue! It has power unlike other handheld vacs I've tried and is lightweight for the stairs. I absolutely love it. I can't wait to use it in my car. GREAT value. Get this one!
