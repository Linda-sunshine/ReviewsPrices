review/summary: Should be ZERO starsreview/text: I have had two of these coffee makers and each one has stopped working before even having it for six months. Even while the machine was working, coffee was never very hot and I always had coffee grounds at the bottom of my cup. Both times I had the "remove scale" sensor activate and that was it. I tried countless things I found online to try and remove the scale but, nothing worked. I have never had a coffee maker as consistently bad as this one in my life. If there is one thing this machine is good at, it is making such a simple thing so incredibly impossible...
