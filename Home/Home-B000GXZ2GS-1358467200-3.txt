review/summary: Bold, smooth, and rich brewreview/text: I've really enjoy making coffee with this thing. It's a great little system. It's easy to use, really easy to clean, and it makes an amazing cup! I think it makes one of the best cups I've had. It's NEVER bitter, always smooth. It brings out a lot of great favors too. So I highly recommend this! It's worth it!Be warned however, that it is not an espresso maker. This should be obvious, but it's worth saying. It makes a great cup, and a great &#34;concentrate&#34; of coffee.Still- totally worth it. Probably my favorite coffee maker I've own :)
