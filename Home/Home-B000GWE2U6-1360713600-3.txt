review/summary: Worked for six weeksreview/text: The Crane was very quiet for about two weeks. It then started to make gurgling noises for the next four weeks. We woke up one morning and there was water all over and the Crane was hot with no mist coming out. The fan had stopped working. It is now a pretty piece of junk.
