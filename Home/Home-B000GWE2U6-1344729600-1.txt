review/summary: Leaked after two monthsreview/text: I was happy in the beginning. Then i had to clean it thoroughly, the odor appears from the residue on the bottom, it worked for a bit and started leaking very badly. It damaged the dresser it was on. I don't like to bother with online returns, so i threw it away, still sorry for the money i spent.Don't know what to get next.
