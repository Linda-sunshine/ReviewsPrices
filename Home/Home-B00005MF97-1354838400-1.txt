review/summary: Handy little gadget!!!review/text: I give this five stars all the way! After buying for myself and loving it/using it almost constantly, I ordered three more to send as early X-mas gifts to my children. My dau-in-law recently told me she loves her's so much she actually finds herslf planning meals that require her to use it, lol! Really, it's small enough to fit in my kitchen cabinet where is easy to grab whenever needed; is super easy to clean - just remove blade from bowl, rinse, and wipe top off; does not require any complex screwing or fitting of peices together; and I was able to get free shipping using Amazon Prime. I totally recommend buying one of these if you need something handy to chop/dice quickly. For this price you can't go wrong!
