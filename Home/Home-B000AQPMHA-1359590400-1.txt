review/summary: Love our Keurigreview/text: This is our first Keurig. We were advised by friends to buy one that is sort of in the middle, not the top and not the bottom. This one is in the middle and we like it, it's &#34;just right&#34;. It offers what we needed and wanted and it makes coffee that's nice and hot. The machine looks nice and cleans well and holds a lot of water for a lot of cups of coffee before you need to refill it. We are pleased with our choice.
