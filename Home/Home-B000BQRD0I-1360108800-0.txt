review/summary: Great Productreview/text: I've brought 3 steamers in the past 6 months and this one finally lived up to it's claims. Very fast start-up, easy to assemble and break down for storage. Plenty of steam for clothing. Last 2 steamers have been Conair and they never worked very good before falling apart. One of these Conair's was double the price of the SteamFast.
