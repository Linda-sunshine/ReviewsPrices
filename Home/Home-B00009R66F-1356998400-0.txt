review/summary: SteamVac saves the dayreview/text: My father's dog visited with him and left &#34;deposits&#34; all over my living room rug. Since this dog is fed waaaaaaay more treats than dog food, you can imagine my problem. I borrowed an older SteamVac from a friend and had immediate rescue. I was so pleased, that I bought my own unit. The one I chose has a power brush. For me, this is not only good for upholstery, it has been fine cleaning the tiny grooves in linoleum floors in the bathroom. When I was young, I just used a bucket and scrub brush and got down on my knees. But I haven't managed to stay young. smile. This product lets me keep my house as clean as I want.
