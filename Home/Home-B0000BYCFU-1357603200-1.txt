review/summary: Excellent, but you need 1 other item for perfectionreview/text: First off, this pressure cooker is awesome! I just started canning and decided to get this pressure cooker to start off right. Here are some things I've noticed and wanted to share:-If you're unfamiliar how this works, start small by putting 1 cup of water in the cooker to test it out.-Because the lid gasket is oiled, wash it thoroughly.-If you are considering buying this, it is a MUST that you also buy this item,Presto Pressure Canner Pressure Regulator. This allows you to adjust the pressure inside in increments of 5 pounds of pressure, 10 pounds of pressure, and 15 pounds of pressure. The one that comes with this model is a 15 pounds of pressure regulator. You cannot adjust the pressure if you only use the one that came with this model.-Not recommended on glass top stoves. Here's why: Most newer glass top stoves have a sensor that stops the heating element from staying on, so the glass won't crack. Just because it's not recommended doesn't mean you can't use it, just understand that you may not get an even temperature inside.-Be careful not to pick up the lid by the gauge. I've read reviews of customers' unit not functioning properly because of a faulty gauge. Again, test it out with a little bit of water first.-Presto says the lid gasket will last for a few years. We'll see on that one.I was brand new at canning, and decided to buy this and use this over the hot water bath method of canning. I took my time, read the directions, and used common sense. Overall, I would highly recommend this unit, along with the pressure regulator mentioned above.
