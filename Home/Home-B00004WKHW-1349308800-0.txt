review/summary: If you have a blender and a knife, you don't need this.review/text: We received this 3 years ago as a wedding gift. It never worked that great, and now it is completely broken.I registered for this appliance because it seemed like a great idea! Who wouldn't want a time saver? It has been occasionally useful for making sauces and pur&eacute;es. However, I have found that a blender or immersion blender works better and most people have one of those already. No need to double up. It's smaller and cuter than a blender, but that's about it.As for chopping things, I have found that in the time it takes to pull out the processor, set it up, fill and operate it, empty it, disassemble, and clean it....I could have just chopped the item myself with a cutting board and knife. And I do not like the irregular size and consistency of veggies chopped in this machine.My main problem with this appliance is the durability. The little plastic clips on the lid are very flimsy and broke, one at a time. Now they are both broken, so that the container wants to spin around with the blade when the unit is operating. As it stands, if I want to use this appliance, I have to hold the unit together and in place. Of course the warranty is passed. I really wanted to like it and am sad it didn't work out. I expected better from Cuisinart and am disappointed with the quality of this item.
