review/summary: Wow... Just Wow!review/text: I always wanted a Le Creuset dutch oven, but couldn't justify the price. I compared the Lodge against it at a local cookware store, and couldn't see any major differences between them - the weight, look of the enamel, and fitting of parts were great on both of them.It's possible that over a lifetime, the Le Creuset might out-perform this Lodge, but I'm only using this once a week or so. It's done a great job with soups, stews, braising, and even baking bread! If something ever happens to this, I won't hesitate to replace it with another - I just can't imagine the Le Creuset being worth the extra money.
