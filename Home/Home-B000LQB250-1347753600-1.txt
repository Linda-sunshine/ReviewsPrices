review/summary: Wow!review/text: I could not say anything better about this mattress topper. It is awesome. I am a male, 19 years old, ~150 lbs.Before I got this mattress I had a very stiff mattress that really hurt my back and I would constantly wake up stiff and achey.After I moved up to college I had no idea what kind of mattress they were going to give me. So I decided to get this memory foam topper and it made a world of difference!I have never slept better in my life. No homesickness for me. This is way better than home!Sometimes the bed does get slightly warm but, take the covers off and you will feel better. This topper tends to retain hear quite well.
