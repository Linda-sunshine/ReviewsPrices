review/summary: great bedreview/text: My wife and I used this on our trip to visit her family. We shipped it directly to their house, it was inflated a few days before we arrived to allow any stretching to happen. Added a little air the first & second day to firm it up (and see how it worked), used it the next ten without any issue! Deflation was amazing, the pumps sucked all the air out! This is a great bed, barely noticed when my wife would get up. Only a little slant in the bed due to the weight difference.
