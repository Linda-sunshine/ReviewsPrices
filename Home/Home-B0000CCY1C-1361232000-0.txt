review/summary: You'll never make cookies without this!review/text: My fianc&eacute; and I have a huge cookie addiction, so we make cookies pretty frequently in our kitchen. I have been dying to purchase one of these for a while, and my fianc&eacute; was convinced that this was a useless tool that just wasn't essential. I love all OXO products; the quality is unbeatable for the price. When it arrived, we both instantly loved it! It makes perfect, uniform cookies that have perfect crisp edges and soft middles. I highly recommend this product, and I'll never make cookies without it again!
