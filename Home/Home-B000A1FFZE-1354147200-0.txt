review/summary: How clever!!!!review/text: I love this combo toaster/mini oven. It doesn't take up any more space than a toaster, but you have the added convenience of a mini oven. Toaster function for you bagels, toast, poptarts...whatever. I find it cooks even, prefer mine set at the higher setting. Then pop it into the mini oven with a slice of cheese on each on 400 for a couple of minutes, you have a tasty grilled cheese. Love the mini oven for fish sticks, chicken nuggets, corny dogs, pizza bites! Beats heating up the big oven just for a smaller portion. Great for making a quick lunch for the kiddies. It a fantastic buy, and easy to clean. Just pull out the tray, and pop it into the dishwasher. I put non stick foil on mine for the fish sticks and such. Easy breezy! Have had mine for a few months now. It gets used on a daily basis. Loved it so much, bought one for my daughter for her birthday.
