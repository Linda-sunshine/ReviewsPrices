review/summary: A great grinder!review/text: After many years of buying my coffee and having it ground, I was given 3 lbs of different coffees for Christmas. As beans...... So I broke down and bought this - and I love it! Yeah, it makes a bit of noise, but it isn't horrible. And it is tough to grind exactly the same amount every time (you turn a dial, but it is against resistance, not &#34;to a click&#34;), but you can grind to any fineness you like - chunks to dust - to suit your coffee style. So maybe I should give it 4 stars, but after turning my old coffee grinder, that I had to clean out every time, into a spice grinder, I think this deserves 5.
