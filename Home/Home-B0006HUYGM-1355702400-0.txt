review/summary: Works as advertised!review/text: This year around, I decided to finally buy a vacuum and at the time, this one fit the budget.Its pro and cons:Pros----------------------------------1. Small and portable2. Has two modes, one using the hose and the other for stairs / floors3. Fairly strong for its size (was actually expecting lower quality :p but that did not happen)Cons----------------------------------1. The hose for the vacuum is quite short (though when I bought it, it was really just used to clean my room and minor spots around the house.2. No replaceable filters given in the package, the only one you will receive is the one that is already installed in the vacuum. If you would like any new ones you are going to have to purchase them.Rating: 8/10I took out 2 points for each con really =/Other than that, it works wonderfully! Killing dust bunnies left and right :D
