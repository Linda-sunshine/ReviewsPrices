review/summary: LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!review/text: I love my Breville!!! It is perfect for me! I am the only one in the house who will drink the juice, so it is perfect for the solo juicer or the first time juicer. This juicer is small enough to store away in a cabinet very easily. The price is really affordable, especially for such a reputable brand. I have had large juicers (Juice Man) in the past and they were such a headache. I would always make a huge mess on the counter, and the clean up of the juicer itself was a nightmare. This one is SO easy to clean. The juice all goes into the cup and the waste gathers up inside the juicer, making clean up a breeze. It comes with a little scrubber brush that is perfect for scooping out the waste and cleaning the inside of the juicer. I feel GREAT every time I drink the juice. I highly recommend this product!
