review/summary: Breville BJE200XL Compact Juice Fountain 700-Watt Juice Extractorreview/text: Love it cannot say enough. This is my first juicer so there is nothing else to compare it to, however, it DOES THE JOB. I am seriously trying to juice many of my meals throughout the week and I find it easy to operate and also easy to clean. Read some negative reviews about cleaning the product before I purchased and I was shocked at how I found it extremely easy to clean.
