review/summary: Great first juicer!review/text: I am new to juicing but went full bore with a 10-day juice cleanse about a week ago. While rather intimidated to use my machine, was so easy! Flip it on, have your fruits and veggies prepared (cut to fit) and down the chute they go. The juice is not pulpy; the machine works FAST and rather easy to clean. I also love the safety feature. It must have the metal arm in place to turn on. Although I do unplug while I clean it just to be safe. Literally, it's all of 20 minutes to juice, rinse off (I only &#34;wash&#34; the parts every after the 5th or 6th juicing), dry , re-assemble and get my next juicing recipe ready. Or, just let everything air dry. Goes together easily. My one know-better-for-next time is to get a variable speed. Some of your lighter fruits (cranberries, strawberries, blueberries, watermelon seeds from my watermelon!) can come flying back out of the food chute at you if you're not faster than they are with your food pusher. Truly, a fantastic little work horse for the price and I'm very, very pleased I was referred to this model by my food coach.
