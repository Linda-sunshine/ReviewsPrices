review/summary: Overratedreview/text: We used this system daily for over six months. To be sure, it is an inexpensive device and, furthermore, the filters are reusable. It makes decent coffee and it is reasonably easy to clean after each use, although no easier than most other methods.However, the first negative sign is that one has to use a lot more coffee than with other systems; and that is very expensive. As for ease of use, one has to wait till he grounds have cooled and then fumble with the parts twice each time, first to clean the unit and then to reassemble it. Thirdly, the device is made of cheap plastic which does not appear to be designed to withstand hot temperatures (lukewarm coffee, anyone?): fairly early on, the inside of the plastic tube began to show signs of "cracking", i.e., dozens of tiny channels were forming which made the unit harder and harder to clean.If filtered coffee is your thing, the cone system works on a very similar principle and is just as cheap and as easy to clean. We chose to go back to the French press: no, it doesn't make coffee that's finely filtered but yes, the full, complex flavour of the coffee is preserved without having to increase the amount of coffee to make up for the loss of flavour.
