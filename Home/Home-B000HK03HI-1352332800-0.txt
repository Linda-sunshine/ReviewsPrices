review/summary: love it... mostlyreview/text: excellent most of the time but if you don't have it just right on the can it will not latch and sometimes finding the sweet spot takes a moment. Aside from that it's been a great can opener and I would absolutely buy it again. BTW I've owned this for a year or so now.
