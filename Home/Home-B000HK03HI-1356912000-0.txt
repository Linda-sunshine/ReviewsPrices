review/summary: SUPER OPENERreview/text: I used this for the first time yesterday and am VERY impressed with the design. The opener locks onto the can and you don't have to grip hard while turning the crank. It opens the can just right, then you push the button to release it from the can. I have arthritis in my hands and found this design much easier to use than others I have had. Highly recommended product!
