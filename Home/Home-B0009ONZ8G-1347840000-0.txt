review/summary: Unreliable, poor qualityreview/text: I bought this vacuum machine in April 2012 and it stopped working after only five months. It's unreliable, designed badly and of poor quality. The one year parts/labor warranty does not cover the agitator belt. Once it breaks down, you will have to get it fixed on your own. So much for the one year part/labor warranty. it hardly deserves a star
