review/summary: not as good as I thoughtreview/text: Sorry to say I purchased this about a year ago and can not say I am happy with it. The problem is between the lid and the body... Cheese and such things get between there when you shred for pizza and other stuff and the whole lid jumps up, big peaces wedge in between and make a mess. I had a$ 20.00 B&D; before that actually worked better for 15 years. This one looks great if you have stainless but that is about it! Might go back to B&D; and retire this one.
