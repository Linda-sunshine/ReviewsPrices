review/summary: Yummy Homemade Ice Cream!review/text: Just finished batch #2 (batch #1 was a complete failure). I made basic vanilla, but not the recipe in the manual, that seems like too much sugar, and my batch was a smaller volume. My first batch failed because I didn't let the bowl freeze long enough (6 hours). Once I froze the bowl overnight, success! I give it 4 stars because it's a bit runny (think really thick milkshake) and it's quite noisy. Also, be aware that the top is open, which I think is odd. One might want to cover it if you think something is apt to fall in. I didn't go with the built-in compressor because I wasn't sure how often I'd make ice cream. However, if you already know you'll use it often, I'd go with a machine that contains a compressor.
