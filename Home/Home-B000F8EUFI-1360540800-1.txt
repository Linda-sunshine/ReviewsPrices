review/summary: Initially impressed, now disappointed!review/text: I have had this vacuum for about a year and 3 months. I was initially impressed; however after approximately a year of use, the vacuum is not doing its job! I have given it proper care (as recommended in my manual), but it has stopped &#34;picking&#34; stuff up off my carpet. My carpet looks the same after every use. If you are considering this product, my recommendation would be to spend a little more money, to get better quality. In my opinion, a vacuum is an investment!
