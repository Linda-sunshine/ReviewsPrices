review/summary: As good as advertisedreview/text: I purchased this after hearing great recommendations from friends. Very easy to use and makes a great cafe americano, though you probably want to watch a few tutorial videos and practice on your own to get the hang of it. I've begun using the &#34;inverted method&#34;. Getting the water levels right has been the hardest part. Following their guide numbers doesn't always produce 2oz espresso shots.
