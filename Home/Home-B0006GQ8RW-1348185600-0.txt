review/summary: Brita Replacement Filters - Highly Recommendedreview/text: These replacement filters are used in ourBrita 42629 Slim Pitcher. We sent the pitcher to our daughter for use in her dorm-room since the city she is in has awful manciple drinking water. This four pack will filter 160 gallons or will last for 8 months, which will last her the entire school year.It is important to follow the directions and soak the new filter for 15 minutes in cold water and then run two or three full pitchers of water through and discard the water (use for plants perhaps).If you have a Brita Pitcher, you need these filters.Highly Recommended!CFH
