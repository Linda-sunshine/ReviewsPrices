review/summary: Perfect for what I needed!review/text: I was in search of an ice cube tray that would make fewer ice cubes because normal trays that made 12 were too big to fit in my freezer section of my small fridge that I have at college. When I came across this and saw that it had dimensions that would fit and it also made even more than those that did not usually fit I was really happy. The material is very good and it seems like it is going to last a very long time. As well it comes with two trays so the deal was completely worth it. The ice cubes come out just fine and I have had no trouble.
