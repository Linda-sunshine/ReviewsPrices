review/summary: I gave it awayreview/text: It kept getting this &#34;Prime&#34; notice EVERY time I turned it on. I cleaned it like nobody's business, tried everything, and the notice would go away for a week or two but then come back. I only ever used drinking water from a jug we bought at the supermarket. I gave it to my brother in law, as we ended up getting the bigger model as a wedding gift. So far, so good on that one. I had this Keurig for about a year when it started saying &#34;prime.&#34;
