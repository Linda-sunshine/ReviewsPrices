review/summary: Effective but noisyreview/text: I've had the Honeywell 50250 for about 5 months, still working effectively. Everyone noticed the reduction in smell coming from the cat area adjoining our living room. You get used to the noise, even at low setting, maybe turning off the air cleaner if I'm planning to watch a TV show where the characters talk within hushed voices. To describe the noise, at low setting, it's roughly the sound a bathroom fan would make. However, I had to buy a new air cleaner for another room because we have to close the cat area off for the winter, so we're moving the litter box to that other room. I saw a special for a refurbished Winix 5300 and picked it up. It was so quiet on low setting, I wasn't sure it could work as effectively as the Honeywell. Maybe it can't. But the quiet does make a difference, enough so that I'm buying a second Winix to replace the Honeywell. I'll probably move the Honeywell to take care of the basement, and if the Winix's prove ineffective, the Honeywell may eventually return upstairs.So 4 stars, the Honeywell delivered on all it's promises, but I have to take a star off for the noise.
