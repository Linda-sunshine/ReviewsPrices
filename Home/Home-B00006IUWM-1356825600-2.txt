review/summary: great for the moneyreview/text: It does work great for the price. Did a nice job on my filet knife which is really what I wanted. I have a set of Henkle 4-stars (which to be honest im not happy with) and the edges were chipped and wouldnt cut a tomatoe if I tried. The sharpen totally restored the edge in 4-5 passes on the coarse wheel and a couple on the fine. Was a little wierded out trying to figure out exactly what angle to put the knife in, but settled on dead parallel to the table.
