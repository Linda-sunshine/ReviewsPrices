review/summary: Really nice quality, but could be widerreview/text: I bought these sheets for my 16 year old son's queen sized bed in January, so I don't know how they will wear long term, but they are the thickest, softest flannel sheets I've ever seen and he absolutely loves them! Expensive but worth it IMO. I wish they were a little wider because they cannot be tucked in on the sides, but my son doesn't care. I would give them 4 1/2 stars if I could. Would buy again for $54.00.
