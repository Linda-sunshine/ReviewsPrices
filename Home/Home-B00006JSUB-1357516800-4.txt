review/summary: A must have for the kitchen.review/text: Cast iron skillets are a must for any cook in the kitchen. Here are a couple of hints to great cooking with cast iron:- Do Not cook with the burner set on 10, you want to set the burner to around 6 or 7. Adjust based on your particular stove.- Make sure to get this pan HOT before you start cooking with it.- If you need to use oil, use something with a high smoke point: grapeseed, peanut, refined corn oil, safflower- Avoid using butter or olive oil at high temps.- This will smoke when cooking, but avoiding oils will lessen the smoking.- Don't use soap when washing and avoid scouring pads. If you need to scour the pan, try adding a bunch of salt and scrubbing with an old washcloth (this will forever stain the cloth).Some great things to cook in your new skillet:- Bacon- Hamburgers- Steaks- Pork chops- Pancakes- Bacon- Eggs (be very careful...pre-heat to full temp, sprinkle a layer of salt and pray it doesn't stick to much)- Cornbread- more Bacon.
