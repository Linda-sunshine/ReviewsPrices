review/summary: Broke within 3 monthsreview/text: Although the brushed aluminum body is very stylish, the product parts are incredibly cheap. The sprayer works by creating air pressure in an internal canister as you pump the cover, which allows you to spray oil as a mist. Unfortunately, the plastic tube, which is supposed to force air into the nozzle, is so flimsy that this product broke almost immediately. It is no longer able to force air into the spray nozzle, so it cannot spray a mist.I would recommend trying a different brand. It may cost a little more, but you get what you pay for.
