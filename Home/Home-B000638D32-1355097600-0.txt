review/summary: Great knifereview/text: My best friend was a sous chef turned butcher and uses this knife (with an wooden handle) in his home kitchen. I figured if it worked for him, it would work for me. I cook every night and I use this knife on everything. It's light, sharpens with ease, and has a great feel. The German blades are too thick and heavy for my taste and the Japanese blades too thin. This knife provides the best of both with a fraction of the cost. I have a Henckels 8 chef's knife and it just isn't as good as this knife.
