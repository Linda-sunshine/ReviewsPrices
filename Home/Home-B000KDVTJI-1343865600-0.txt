review/summary: Dead after 6 monthsreview/text: It has been a perfect electric kettle for 6 months (water boils quickly, nice design, suitable volume, visible level of water, automatic shut off), but this is over - it stopped working! Normally an electric kettle serves for 2-3 years. It is frustrating - this is 2nd kettle from Amazon in 1 year!
