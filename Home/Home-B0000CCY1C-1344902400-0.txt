review/summary: I NEVER write reviews..review/text: Seriously. I have never written an Amazon review.. but once I used this sweet little cookie scoop today, I knew I had to write one. This thing is incredible! Where has it been my whole life? I had been using a plastic Wilton cookie scoop, which completely broke on me last week during a batch of peanut butter cookies, and I am glad that it did! It lead me to this awesome cookie scoop. This thing is so efficient. I dropped an entire tray of cookies in under 2 minutes. Maybe even less. If you're an occasional cookie maker or a frequent one, I would highly recommend this tool!
