review/summary: Love it Love itreview/text: This machine is powerful, fast and easy to use. I use it everyday. I love how quickly it produces juice. It is easy to clean. I'm glad the juicer came with a brush. It is very helpful with cleaning the screen. I think the juicer is easy to clean. It takes no time at all to clean. I don't put it in the dishwasher, although it states it is dishwasher safe.Remember to have the juicer turned on before you place the vegetables or fruit in the chute. Read the manual before you use it and you should not have any problems at all. I am glad I brought this model juicer. I read a lot of reviews and this juicer is well worth the money. I really think it is a great deal.
