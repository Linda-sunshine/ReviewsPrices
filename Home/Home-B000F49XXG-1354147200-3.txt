review/summary: for left-handed baristasreview/text: It makes very good coffee. It's a simple machine & not much will go wrong, I should think. I drink up to 20 cups of espresso daily (yes, I do), so this is no small thing. My last Saeco ended up making crummy coffee with wonderful beans.But this machine does not fit right on my counter, in my limited space, which all other espresso makers have done. The steamer is on the left, the basket fits from the left, rather than the center. I usually heat milk in the microwave, so I don't actually need to use that space or remove the steam wand for cleaning. But, it is hard to place on the counter & hard to place my grinder on the counter, too: it is in the way, on either side, or behind.This is also as light as a toy & skips toward me when expressing coffee. I must keep pushing the cup back under the spigot. The booklet shows little cups warming on the top & I shudder to think how many would end in shards.I do not expect it to last a long time. I'm betting on a year at the outside. But it's easy to use & makes nice coffee. The problem is all in the design.
