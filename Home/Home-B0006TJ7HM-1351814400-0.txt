review/summary: Feels flimsyreview/text: For the price these knives are ok. But if you do heavy at home cooking like I do then I'd save my money and get better knives. They don't seem to retain their sharpness for too long and feel really really flimsy. The knives are flexible like a ruler. I just wouldn't be too cheap with knives because they are pretty much one of the most important things in a kitchen.
