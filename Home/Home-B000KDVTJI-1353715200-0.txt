review/summary: priced too highreview/text: It was okay, and I was using it fine. But after a visit at Walmart or Costco, I found that a competitive kettle was sold with $10 less than this one. If I knew this before, I will not make the order. Also, the cord has to be swirled manually being &#34;cordless&#34;. The label &#34;cordless&#34; was a bit misleading to me. Customers may wish for an automatic winding cord instead.
