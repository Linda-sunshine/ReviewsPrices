review/summary: Makes the Water Taste Goodreview/text: I have no idea how the do it, but these same filters (I think) for the past 15 years always make the water taste good, which I guess means that it takes the bad stuff out. Just be sure to check the prices - you would think that they get cheaper as you go from one to ten filter pack, but the 3 pack was actually cheaper per filter than the 4,5,6, and 10 pack
