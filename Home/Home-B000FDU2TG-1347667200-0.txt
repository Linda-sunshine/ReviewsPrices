review/summary: DO NOT BUYreview/text: I bought this blender 14 months ago and it started leaking today, 2 months after the warranty expired. I use it only about once a week to make smoothies, using frozen fruit that are in small pieces. It is not worth the price. My previous blender lasted longer and was much cheaper.
