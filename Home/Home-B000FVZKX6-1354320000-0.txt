review/summary: Life-changing sheetsreview/text: You would think these sheets are cashmere, they are that soft and warm. They are thick, durable, and do not pill after being washed. My lint catcher on the dyer is almost empty after washing these sheets, which is impressive considering the fact that the cheaper flannel sheets i've had in the past would cause it to fill completely. We ordered these sheets in the creme color and grey, and they are both very nice. We loved this flannel so much that we went ahead and ordered the pinzon duvet set as well. These would make a wonderful gift as well. Go ahead and order these sheets, you will be so glad you did!
