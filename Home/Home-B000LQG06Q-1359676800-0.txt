review/summary: Best on a firm mattressreview/text: I previously had a 3&#34; memory foam cover I got from Costco that was much more dense than this one. While I liked it, I think I prefer this one because I live in such a hot and humid climate, so the thinner and less dense foam retains less heat and allows me to be more comfortable year round. In addition, my mattress is extra firm, so I get the support I need without tons of pressure thanks to this topper.
