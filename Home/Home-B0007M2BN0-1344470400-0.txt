review/summary: Great Convenient Productreview/text: We love this. So easy now to have some boiled eggs on hand all the time. We have 9 hens and love eggs, but to put a pot of water on and boil eggs is just another chore to heat up the kitchen. Now I just pop them in the microwave for 8 minutes and have great hard boiled eggs - so easy!
