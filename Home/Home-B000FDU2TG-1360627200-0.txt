review/summary: Sturdy, pretty blender that is easy to cleanreview/text: I've made smoothies daily since 2004 and have been through my share of blenders. None seem to last more than three months to a year. December of 2012 I bought this pretty orange KitchenAid blender because I had faith in the KitchenAid brand. So far, after eight weeks of daily smoothies made of banana, peanut butter, milk, ice and chia seeds, the blender has held up beautifully. It's easy to clean (inside and out).My previous blenders had pitchers that were difficult to clean, motors that couldn't handle ice cubes, and seals on the bottom that would come loose and then the whole thing would start to leak. This KitchenAid blender has handled the ice well when there's enough liquid in the pitcher. if I don't have enough liquid in it, the blender can't handle it and almost locks up. So I make sure there's enough liquid, add the other ingredients, then a few ice cubes at a time, and the smoothies turn out well.I'm happy to finally have a blender that works well and is easy to clean.
