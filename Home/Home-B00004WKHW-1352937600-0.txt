review/summary: Excellent mini food processorreview/text: This mini food processor is great if you don't have a lot of room in your kitchen. Ours has been going strong for 3 years and we use it constantly to grind hard cheese. It is easy to clean, it works great, although sometimes it requires that you press the chop or grind button to get at a piece that doesn't get cut.
