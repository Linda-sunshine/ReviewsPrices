review/summary: Great, versatile potreview/text: Wish we had gotten the 5 quart as the 7.5 is very heavy, even without the lid.Inside enamel is dificult to keep looking clean. Stains very easily.Great for cooking one dish meals in the oven, have to adjust your time as food cooks faster in this pot.No so easy for a cook top stove as food sticks to bottom even on low.
