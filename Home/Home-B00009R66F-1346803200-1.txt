review/summary: Defective for surereview/text: I cannot in good conscience give this anymore than. 1 star rating. I ignored the reviews that stated it leaks, but it does. As opposed to the first review who says there is some sort of pre use procedure to do, there is NONE. At first it was great, then after a while it started to leak through the little holes on the bottom and nothing would stop it...no advice at all from these reviews, nothing.Luckily Amazon was awesome and did a return with no hassles as usual. I love amazon but only "wanted" to like this machine. Thumbs down.
