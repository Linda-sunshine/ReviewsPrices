review/summary: ReneeCreview/text: I was so excited to get my new sharpner. I couldn't wait to get home to use it so I sharpend all the knives in the office kitchen, then did my kitchen and my husband's hunting knives and then took it next door to sharpen all of my Mom's knives. I love this thing!! It is a bit noisy but I don't mind.
