review/summary: Repeated Pump Failuresreview/text: After having 5 of these machines in the last 2 years I can say without question that Keurig does not make a quality product in the B70, B60, B40. Keurig's customer service did replace two of the brewers free of charge, but every time they fail in the same manner, the pump stops drawing in water and therefore doesn't make a cup of coffee.Please vote with your dollars and purchase another version of the single cup machine. I also have an old (+ 3 years) keurig desktop brewers in which you have to fill the stainless reservoir before each cup and it works great to this day.
