review/summary: Great buyreview/text: We decided to upgrade our plastic drip coffee maker for something better. We've had this coffee maker for about a week and we're very happy with it. It is solidly built and the coffee tastes much better! Keeps it nice and hot, too. My only complaint is that it doesn't have an on/off switch or automatic shutoff. If it did, I would gladly give it 5 stars.
