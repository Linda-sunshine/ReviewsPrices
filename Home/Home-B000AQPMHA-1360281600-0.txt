review/summary: Great so farreview/text: Got it on 2-4-13 and worked great right out of the box. Ordered a B40, but got a B45 upgrade instead. As far as I can see the only difference is the B45 has one more cup seting for a total of three instead of two cup setting for the B40. So far so good. Bought this after using the B40 at work. Believe me at work the machine gets some usage. I estimated at least 20-30 cups a day or more and is still going strong for 6 months now. Wife loves it! Heats quickly. Aprox 60-90 sec and not very noisy as other reviews have mentioned. I advise running a few dry runs to get it primed. Once I did that I got a full 9.5 oz cup or a little more. So far a great purchase. The best part is that I get the Amazon free return policy if all goes wrong. Recommended it to my friends.
