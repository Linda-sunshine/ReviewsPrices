review/summary: Great buyreview/text: This was my first pressure canner/cooker and first experience with such things. It is simple to use and so far has been fool proof. I have successfully canned tomato sauce and chicken stock. The construction is very solid and the maintenance needed to keep it in good condition is minimal (essentially: clean it when done).
