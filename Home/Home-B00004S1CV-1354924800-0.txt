review/summary: High Quality, amazing insulationreview/text: Really fantastic tumbler, keeps things hot for HOURS. Can be a little annoying that things are so hot because you can't start drinking the team immediately, but really fantastic to sip on for hours. The top is perfectly sealed, I have filled the tumbler and then thrown it in a bag and had no leak problems. Great product.
