review/summary: This air mattress kicks some serious ass.review/text: I'm tired of the flimsy, leaky, 1-year lifetime mattresses. I was looking for something that felt like it would last me a lifetime -- the way durable goods should last. With his Insta-bed, I really feel I've found it. Will update if anything goes wrong after a year, but I seriously doubt it. It inflates faster than anything I have seen before, and it does not leak. You will wake up just as you went to bed. In my case, I have to say that I've had to "re-inflate" after 2 or 3 nights in a row but its will probably be rare that I use this more than 2 or 3 nights in a row in the future. The material feels like it would be the mattress that the US army would have picked for its soldiers. Its durable and strong, yet the top is nice and soft. If I could change anything I would make it slightly less tall so it would not be gigantic. but it is nice to sleep on the taller mattress and not feel like you are on the floor. Overall, I've never been happier with an air bed.
