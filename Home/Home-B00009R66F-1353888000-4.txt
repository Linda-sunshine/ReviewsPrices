review/summary: Easy to use - Cleans better than a rentalreview/text: I had been using rental steam cleaners since my old tank Bissel steam cleaner died. The rental cleaners always did a better job than my Bissel so I wasn't planning on purchasing a replacement. Recently, with so many holiday get togethers planned, I figured I'd better bite the bullet to have something that was easy to use to quickly clean up spills and clean up the entry way where everyone always drags in dirt onto my light colored carpet. I bought this Hoover thinking that the reviews made it sound easy to use, which was the main thing I was looking for. It met that requirement and does a much better job cleaning than the rental units. I think part of it is the soap that you purchase to use with it. I found that the Hoover deep cleaning soap that came with the unit did a great job with stains. I cleaned part of the carpet with that detergent and part with my left over Rug Doctor detergent - the Hoover detergent was much more efficient and got the stains out where the Rug Doctor did not even after cleaning the spots over and over again. I think this is a great purchase - well worth the price and even though their detergent costs a bit more, I honestly think I'll use less of it than other detergents.
