review/summary: Good grill panreview/text: We have a Jenn-Air stove with a removable grill, but the grill is so difficulty to clean, we never use it. Instead, we use this grill pan which fits over two burners perfectly and heats quite evenly. I use only the grill side and not the flat side, so cannot give it a complete rating.
