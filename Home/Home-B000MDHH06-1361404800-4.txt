review/summary: Amazing Juicer and worth every dimereview/text: I have been looking at ways to be sure I am getting enough fresh fruits and vegetables. I heard much about juicing and dove head first and bought this juicer based on reviews. It has been so easy to use, so easy to clean, and does an amazing job of separating the juice and pulp. It is so fast and prep time is easy too. It stores well and I have been happy from the first time I used it. I use the pulp for baking and also put some in my dogs food, he loves it! Besides the soups I make with tons of veggies this is any easy and fast and delicious way to get tons of fresh vitamins. I am not a juice drinker, meaning the preservative filled sugar filled ones you can buy at the market, but this I really really enjoy!
