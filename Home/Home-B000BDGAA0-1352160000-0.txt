review/summary: May help neck problemsreview/text: I have a neck problem that has caused years of painful headaches, so when I saw this pillow and reviews that people with neck problems were now headache free I wanted to try it. It IS very dense (hard) to lay on, but does keep my neck cradled in one spot. I have not used the included pillow cover; I have another pillow cover that zips together that is a little larger that I put the pillow in. I have not found that any of the micro beads have leaked out. I tried sleeping on both sides; the solid side and the side with the ridges and ended up sleeping on the side with the ridges because it holds my head in one spot better.I have slept on this pillow for over a month now and I have seemed to have less headaches than usual and that's a good thing. I'm not saying it's a cure-all for neck problems or headaches, but it might help and that's a good enough reason to give it a try.
