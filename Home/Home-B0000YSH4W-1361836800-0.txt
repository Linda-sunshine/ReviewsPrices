review/summary: One of Lois Lowry's bestreview/text: I read this book with my niece probably 8-9 years ago for English class. We had many interesting conversations while we read it together along with much speculation about Jonas at the end. Really cool story about a society much different than our own. Both of us are rereading it before we read SON.
