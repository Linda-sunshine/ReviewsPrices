review/summary: Great bang for the buck!review/text: Simply can't be beat at this price! This scale is well built and easily competes with models 3-5x the cost. Feels a little cheap (lightweight plastic) but works just fine. I really like the bright, easy to read display (thinking about picking up a few for my local dispensary). Only thing I wish it had was two decimal places but when you're talking grams, that's really splitting hairs (pun not intended). I would recommend this as a smart starter scale for your average MMJ user. I am happy with mine.
