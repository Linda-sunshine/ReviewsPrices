review/summary: Amazing Thermosreview/text: Would you expect anything less from Thermos brand? It is such high quality. If you've read about it leaking, it is because people are trying to fill it too full. I usually make my morning coffee and put the extras in this Thermos to keep it hot so my coffee doesn't burn sitting on my coffee pot's warming plate. It stays hot ALL day long, and is even warm the next morning (not hot, just warm). I have purchased this for several of my family and friends as it is a great gift item for just about anyone. Highly recommend, you won't regret it.
