review/summary: Coffee maker for the chemistreview/text: Since acquiring my AeroPress Coffee maker, I've used it about two dozen times. It can make a great cup of coffee, but it is a pain to use and clean. The multiple pieces of the unit do not easily stack together on the kitchen counter top.It certainly enables you to tailor your coffee brewing to your taste if all you want to make is one 12 oz. mug of coffee. However, I found that when pouring water into the tube with the ground coffee, the mixture foams up and preclude one from placing enough fluid in the tube to make what they call "four cups," or two mugs.If you brew it as they say, i.e. you brew coffee and then dilute it with an equal amount of hot water, you will need multiple 12 oz mugs; one cup to catch the brew and a second to contain the half your pour off before adding additional water.bottom line ... I suspect it would make for good entertainment at a dinner party, but for making a cup of coffee in the morning when I'm groggy and in need of a quick caffeine fix, its far too complex to use.
