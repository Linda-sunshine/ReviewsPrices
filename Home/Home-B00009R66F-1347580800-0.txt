review/summary: No complaints, but the hose is hard to set upreview/text: This thing cleans like a champ, is really easy to use on the floor, but I still have a really hard time getting the hose set up, and once you do you can't move the unit around easily. But I also have a small Spot-Bot (pets...you need a few carpet cleaners...) and it's hose is perfectly fine so I just use it. But this is the third home steam cleaner I've owned and it is MUCH better than the others were. They both had issues with plastic pieces breaking off, but not this one.
