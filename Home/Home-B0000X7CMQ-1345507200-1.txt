review/summary: Zojirushi subparreview/text: I have had the Zojirushi coffee maker for over 6 months now. If I had it to do over again, I'd purchase a different brand of coffee maker. Here's why: The lid on the carafe is too difficult to open and once open the coffee pours out too slowly. The coffee holder must be placed a certain way or you'll wake up to counters and floors full of spilled coffee. If even a little bit of coffee overflows the filter it is certain to clog the carafe and once again, counters and floors are running over with coffee. My opinion is that the Zojirushi is overpriced, under-engineered, and not a great choice.
