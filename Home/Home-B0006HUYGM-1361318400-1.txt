review/summary: Awesome little vacuumreview/text: Great price, and works great! The chord is a good length and the side hose with the attachment are handy! The spinning brush in front makes this awesome for furniture, you can turn the brush of though too for flat surfaces. Easy to empty out the canister. Not too heavy or awkward. I like it. I have a small eureka vacuum that's held up really well even though it was maybe 40 bucks, so I'm hoping for the same durability from this vacuum as well.
