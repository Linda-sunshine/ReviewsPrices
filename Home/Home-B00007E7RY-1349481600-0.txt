review/summary: A workhorsereview/text: We bought ours at Home Depot...only after checking Amazon reviews. It has been quite awhile now (a couple years? I don't know) and it is still sitting right where I put it, doing it's job 24/7/365. I haven't even replaced the pre-filter yet (although I am about to, which is why I'm on Amazon looking at this stuff). I just take a vacuum cleaner to the pre-filter every time the little orange light comes on, stick it back and...good to go.About a year ago I got a new flashlight. Naturally I found myself walking around the house at night to 'test' (play with) the light. I noticed more particles (dust/etc) floating around in the air in other rooms than in the bedroom. It didn't take me long to realize I wasn't crazy, there WAS a difference...and the room with this filter in it was the room with noticeably less 'stuff' floating in the air.I am now hooked.Edit: After reflecting upon this review, and playing with the filter, I should add that, as others have mentioned, it is pretty loud. Ours is in the bedroom and it has to be kept on low. Sometimes we'll turn it up to medium, but that is pushing it for volume...and we like (actually have to have) white noise. It's quite loud on high. That is the only drawback.
