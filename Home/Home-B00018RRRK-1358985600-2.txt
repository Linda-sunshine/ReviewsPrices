review/summary: Cuisnart Burr Millreview/text: Worst thing about the grinder is how difficult it is to get the box in after you have ground the coffee. It can take 10- 20 trys to get it over the button on the bottom. Also, disappointed that the setting is for a mimium of 4 cups which is more than I make for myself or even sometimes myself and my husband. I find that the 4 cups is too strong but I could work with that if it had a 2 or 3 cup option.
