review/summary: Great for Commutesreview/text: The thermoses I've used in the past didn't keep my drinks hot, leaked, and the tops were impossible to keep clean.This keeps my coffee piping hot, in fact, I usually keep the top open for at least a few minutes before I start closing it after every sip. The top doesn't have any sliding pieces that potentially trap gross milk residue. It fit easily in my car's cup holders and didn't spill when I accidentally put it sideways in my bag.The only thing I needed was to buy a bottle brush since my hand doesn't fit inside the bottle and I accidentally left coffee over the weekend in it. Other than that it's perfect for what I need.
