review/summary: not the same quality as previously owned Hoover Steamvacs, good suction.review/text: Having owned several other Hoover Steamvacs over the years, this one is definitely NOT the same quality I had expected. I don't like the front attachment to attach the hose- previous models this was not an issue. I do not like the way the dirty water tank mounts and very frustrated with the metal pice not staying attached- the old style was simply lift and reset, no fumbling around requiring 2 hands to set the tank properly, all the while hoping the small metal bracket didnt move or the water hoses get crimped. BAD DESIGN FLAW that would have been super easy to design properly.On a positive note, the hose had good suction so it was very helpful when steam cleaning the carpets and seats in our SUVs.Basically, the designers need to use the equipment then they would more likely see their design flaws. I deducted 1 star for lack of the expected quality and I deducted a star for the two hand dirty water tank replacement- anyone with a hand or arm issue is going to struggle with this so this is less useful in our household.
