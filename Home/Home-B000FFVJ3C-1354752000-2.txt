review/summary: Great dehydrator that is easy to usereview/text: I got this dehydrator last week and have made two batches of chicken jerky for my dog. She loves her treats and I'm happy I can make healthy and safe jerky treats for her now. I bought this mainly to make her treats but I'll be making some jerky for myself also. So easy to use and easy to clean. I'm going to buy extra trays!
