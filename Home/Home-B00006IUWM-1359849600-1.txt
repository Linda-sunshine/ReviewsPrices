review/summary: Terrible productreview/text: Maybe I wasn't using it right, but I don't know how I could have been wrong. I read the instructions and all of the other material that was sent. This product ruined my knife. It was absolutely ruined. I then used a sharpening stone to get some kind of an edge on the knife, then decided to try it one more time. The knife is totally unusable. After reading all the positive reviews I just can't figure out what went wrong.
