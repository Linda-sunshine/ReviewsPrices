review/summary: Black and Decker Brew and Goreview/text: Before I purchased this product I read several reviews about the product. In spite of all the negative reviews I was determined to buy a single brew coffee make that didn't cost an arm and a leg as most of them do. I have used the Brew& Go for about two weeks now and have no complaints. As far as the complaints about the cup running over all over the counter, pour the water directly into the cup ( I pour about 3/4 full) and then pour that into the brewer, If you pour the water directly into the compartment up to the line, you are using too much water (about 1-1/2 cup) this would account for the excess running onto the counter, well DUH.. Pour the water into the cup first, that way you are using the right amount of water. Just remember these are the same people driving their cars on the roadways of America at the same time you are(WATCH OUT). I find the Brew and Go a very good way for brewing an individule cup of coffee with out having to buy those expensive individule plastic cups as used in most other brewers for individule cups of coffee. If I wanted to pay $2.00 a cup I would just go to Starbucks! Anyway, if you want a good inexpensive way to brew one cup of coffee at a time, buy a Brew and Go, and save money!
