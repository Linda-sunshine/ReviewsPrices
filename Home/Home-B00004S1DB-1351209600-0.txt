review/summary: Great value.review/text: The size of this press is perfect for the two of us. Holds the temp well up to about 2 hrs. The unit is durable(no more broken glass) and the price is right. Very portable. Only criticism I have is that if you try to depress the screen press too fast grounds get into the coffee.
