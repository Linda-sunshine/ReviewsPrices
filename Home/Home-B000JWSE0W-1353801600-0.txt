review/summary: Queen Fitted Sheet Too Tightreview/text: Bottom (fitted) sheet is very difficult to put on. Sheet is barely large enough to fit on mattress, and elastic far too tight to stretch over four corners. I have been using them for several months, thinking the elastic would stretch - it has NOT.Unfortunately I purchased two sets and both have the same issue.
