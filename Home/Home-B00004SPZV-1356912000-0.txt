review/summary: I like at $10 with free shippingreview/text: I'm accustomed to paying $10 for these, and I like them at that price. Not so sure about them at $16+. However, I see that a 2-pack is currently available on Amazon at $18.96, and that's what I would recommend. You can fill the second one with canola oil or peanut oil or some other kind of oil that is better suited for high-temp frying. Or possibly with vinegar for salad-spraying (which I haven't tried myself, but others claim that it works well).Even at the higher price, though, I would prefer a Misto to disposable sprays . . . but with one caveat when using with olive oils. If your kitchen temp is cold enough (as cold as mine was when I was living in Alaska), olive oil WILL solidify, and while in that state (as you might guess) it does not spray very well. :-)
