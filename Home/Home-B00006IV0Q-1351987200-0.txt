review/summary: I heart my Presto electric percolatorreview/text: I bought this Presto electric percolator after a 6 month search for the perfect cup of coffee. I tried a french press which produced a tiny amount of ok coffee, a drip pot which produced dull eh coffee and a stove top percolator which made great coffee but had to be babysat. Finally I came across this percolator and have enjoyed the best coffee every morning since. I did buy the stove top version as well (Hurricaine Irene scarred me). Highly recommend it!
