review/summary: LOVE this Espresso Machine!!!review/text: I use my De'Longhi Espresso machine every day and love how I can make my Cafe Mocha's at home. It works perfectly and I highly recommend it. For less than $100, you can't beat this machine. The only things I don't like are 1. The frother arm is too short. 2. The machine rumbles when espresso is being dispensed, so I have to hold the espresso cups in place, which is kind of silly, but it doesn't take long to make the espresso, so it's not that big of a deal. Oh, and you have to buy espresso cups and frothing pitcher, they are not included.
