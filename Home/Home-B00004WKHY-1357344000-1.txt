review/summary: Where have you been all my life?review/text: I had purchased a few of the smaller, cheaper food processors/choppers in my life. Always was left unhappy in how they had no power whatsoever. I finally broke down and paid more for a quality food processor. This processor is EXTREMELY powerful. I use it to chop up all my veggies and what I was most impressed with is the fact that I can also prepare smaller batches of dough in it! For instance, biscuit dough. I also grate my cheese in it. So much easier than standing there for several minutes with a grater! And when I am done, I just throw everything in the dishwasher. Easy clean up! The one negative I do have with it though (as I read on some other reviews) the plastic parts do feel a little cheap, like they could easily be broken. I have used mine now for about 6 months or so, and nothing has broken, but I am extra careful with it. I have been scared of something breaking a few times when the food basket was on especially tight and I had to pull on it to disengage it, I felt as if I could just break the handle right off. Hasn't happened yet though, so I am still very pleased!
