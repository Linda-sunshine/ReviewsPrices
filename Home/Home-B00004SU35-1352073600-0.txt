review/summary: Good product but not necessary for good popcornreview/text: I like this product, I really do, but essentially it's just a kettle with steam vents and something to keep the corn moving. I think a lot of people are in the dark when it comes to how easy and obviously less expensive it is just to use your own heavy kettle with a slightly ajar lid and some shaking motion. The ajar lid allows steam to escape just like the vents on the whirley pop, and the shaking motion every few seconds makes sure the kernels are all coated and get even heat distribution. Just like the stirring mechanism on the whirley pop. I've tried popcorn using both a regular good quality heavy kettle and this, and the results are delicious but no different. If you've got the money to spend on this and don't care about being able to achieve the same results using a good kettle + lid, by all means this is a quality product, but I can't justify spending 20 dollars or more when my old trusty kettle does it just as good.
