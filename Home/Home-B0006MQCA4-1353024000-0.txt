review/summary: Good productreview/text: I really like the size and the ease of use. It refills at a good pace and holds a good deal of water.Both my husband and I Do think it tastes the same as the tap water. I suppose I was expecting better tasting watersince it is filtered. The only other thing that bothered me was that the handle that you push down has deep ridges on the side you push on. But that is more personal preference. I like the blue color and it is good quality.
