review/summary: good filter but VERY loudreview/text: We have shipped this item back due to the noise volume it produces. In &#34;turbo&#34; mode you can hear it in every room of the house with the bedroom door closed!! When the fan is set on low the filter is louder then a standard box fan on high, this is too noisy for the application we bought it for.
