review/summary: Works greatreview/text: I've made about 12 batches of food in this pressure cooker in the last couple weeks, and it works great. Mostly I've used it to make beans that I've pre-soaked for at least 4 hours. Use the cooking times in the included cookbook, because this thing cooks so fast, you can overcook your food if you use other recipe guides!
