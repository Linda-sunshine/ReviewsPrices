review/summary: Not appropriate for French Pressreview/text: Overall, this is a good machine. However, I purchased it specifically for grinding coffee for a French Press, and this grinder's coarsest setting is a medium grind, which is too fine. The over-extraction that results makes a bitter cup of coffee. Although the machine does produce a relatively good and consistent grind, it is more suitable for making coffee in a drip machine than with a French Press. For my purposes, there is little to no difference between the quality of the coffee produced with the Capresso than with a cheap blade grinder.
