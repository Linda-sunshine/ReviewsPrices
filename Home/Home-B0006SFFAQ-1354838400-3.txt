review/summary: Poorly designed necessitating frequent cleaningreview/text: I have had this coffeemaker for about a year. While the coffeemaker makes good coffee, the design is significantly flawed. The coffee basket and the water tank are adjacent to each other with no separation. As water drips into the coffee basket, it splatters sending coffee grounds into the water. After a few weeks, the water tank has a coating coffee grounds as is the charcoal water filter. As a result every couple of weeks, I hold it upside down over the sink spraying it to rinse out the water tank. I use a bottle brush, too. This gets most of the mess, but not all.Another problem with the design is that LCD display is not lit, making it difficult to read.
