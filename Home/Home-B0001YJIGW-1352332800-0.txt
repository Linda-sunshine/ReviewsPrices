review/summary: It's amazing how much difference a couple of inches of water can make!!!review/text: I was very skeptical that it would create the barrier needed to keep the water in. But it works amazingly well. Warming it in the running water to make it more pliable as I fill the tub works very well now that it's 2 years old and not as supple. It's changed my bath from a tub sit to a spa soak.I bought mine from a big box store and was a bit uncomfortable with the price. It's been well worth every cent, and is just as sturdy as the day I bought it.
