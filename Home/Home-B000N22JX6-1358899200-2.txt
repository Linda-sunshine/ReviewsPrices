review/summary: Loved it so much I bought 2 morereview/text: My husband bought one to keep me warm when I get out of the shower. I liked it so much that I gave one to my mother-in-law. Her living room can be a bit drafty at times, this unit made it toasty warm. I bought the third one for my living room to help cut down the gas bill. We only need to run while we're watching TV. I would recommend it to anyone!
