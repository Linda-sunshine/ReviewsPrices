review/summary: Defectivereview/text: I researched this product on Consumer Search before purchase. I shop Amazon frequently, so I'm happy getting things through their service.This product was very similar to one I picked up at my local grocery store in the BBQ and outdoor supply (next to the charcoal), similar design and price. That thermometer actually lasted me about 3 years before I had to replace it due to fraying of the probe wire where it joined the probe.This product lasted two uses, then died with the same problem. Used once for my Thanksgiving turkey, again for a roast, then dead. I suppose I'm thankful it got me through the holidaysAmazon does sell a replacement probe and wire, but I'm not sure I even want to go through the trouble. Just the fact they do implies this is a frequent problem.Also, during use, if you turn it off, the alarm temp resets to 123 degrees, so you have to reset the alarm every time you turn it back on. Rather frustrating if you are just taking spot temps vs leaving the probe in the oven.
