review/summary: NOT FOR BREADreview/text: I have had this mixer for 3 years and had to have it replaced once, because the motor was making a funny noise. It has now started slipping gears; it cannot handle kneading a simple single white bread recipe. It gets hot and the gears slip. It is great for cake, icing, etc. If you have heavier work to do-go with another brand.
