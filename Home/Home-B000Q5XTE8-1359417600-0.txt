review/summary: Good chair, but a little delicatereview/text: I got this chair a few months ago, and it is very comfortable for regular use. I work at home quite a bit and can spend most of the day sitting in it without issue.However, it does seem a little flimsy. The padding on the left armrest somehow managed to tear off, and it teeters on its base more than I would like. I fixed the former with some superglue, but the latter has been a bit more of a persistent problem. I assembled it according to the instructions, which were relatively clear, but it has an unsteady feel to it.
