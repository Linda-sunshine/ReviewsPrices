review/summary: GREAT little PURPLE tool!review/text: This makes so many things so much simpler - chopping small amounts of seasonings, spices, smoothing out gravies, stirring things up but good (like nutri-shakes, etc.) I am very pleased with it, its price is very fair, and best of all: IT IS PURPLE!I had some concerns it might be underpowered or not have enough &#34;speeds&#34;, but this has not been the case at all (at least not for what I do with it!)
