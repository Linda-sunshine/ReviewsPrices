review/summary: Horrible vacuum!review/text: This vacuum was trouble from the second I get it. It broke twice and to have it repaired almost two weeks after getting it, and my house is 95% hardwood floor! It is lightweight, which is about the only good thing I can say for it. Don't waste money on this, spend a little more and get a quality product!
