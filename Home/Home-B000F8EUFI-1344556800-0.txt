review/summary: Great vacuum for the price.review/text: Good vacuum for the price. It is amazing how much dirt/dust this vacuum picks up. For those people whose vacuum has lost suction simply replace the belt. For someone who lives in a small apartment this is the vacuum for you. My only complaint is that the original belt this vacuum came with melted within a two month period. I have replaced the belt and hopefully this belt will last longer. Overall, an excellent product.
