review/summary: cheap plastic gearsreview/text: We love this style of popper and it is the only style popper we use, but this particular model is somewhat cheaply made. The plastic gears do not keep cranking as the popper gets full, and the lid does not stay on tight, so that when you dump popcorn, you frequently lose the lid and your yet unpopped kernels land in the bowl as well. The price was right but this feels a bit like &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;. Next time we will purchase a more expensive model with metal gears and heavier metal.
