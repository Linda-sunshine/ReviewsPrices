review/summary: As good as the more expensive modelreview/text: We had an opportunity to use the Hamilton Beach juicer side-by-side with the more expensive Breville while juicing our Muscadine grape harvest. I think I actually preferred the Hamilton Beach. The larger pulp reservoir meant fewer breaks for emptying. And the fact that it is clear meant that I could tell when it was full and needed dumping. The Breville has an opaque collector so I had to guess when it was full. A large canning funnel fits inside the Big Mouth to make it easier to dump those luscious grapes in. Neither machine overheated and we produced 8 gallons of juice in no time.
