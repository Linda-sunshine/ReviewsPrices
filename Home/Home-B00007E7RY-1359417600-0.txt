review/summary: World of difference!review/text: My boyfriend is asthmatic and allergic to many common things. He has become attached to my indoor cat. She is confined to the informal living room and the sun porch. His office is on the sun porch. We set the Honeywell air purifier up out there to help him. This filter has made all the difference in the world!! It does make some noise but it is not unbearable and after a while it just becomes background noise you do not notice.I highly recommend this product to anyone especially those that suffer from allergies!
