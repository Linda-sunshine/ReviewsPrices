review/summary: Great reasonably priced food chopperreview/text: This food chopper is great! I bought it when I couldn't afford a food processor and have been very impressed with its power. I've used it to make pesto, chop nuts, grind up dates; there hasn't been anything it can't do! It has worked great for me for almost 3 years.My only complaint is that it is very hard to clean the top since it is open to the food being chopped, but also contains the machinery so you have to be careful about getting it wet. Although I'm very careful when cleaning it, there are still some food remnants in the middle of the top where it rotates the piece with the blade. However, I just tried putting a piece of plastic wrap with a hole in it between the top and bottom components (cannot believe I did not think about doing this earlier) and this made clean up much easier, although did not completely eliminate the problem. I have a food processor now, but still pull this out when I'm only making a small quantity because it's so much easier to clean and works great!
