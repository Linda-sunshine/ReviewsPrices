review/summary: Completely shockedreview/text: I asked a friend of mine, a professional chef, what I should request for cookware on my wedding registry. She suggested this, which, I was pleased with because I had already been eyeing it as my #1 choice.Got the pans about 3 months ago, got married a month ago. So, after 3 months of use there hasn't been a single thing cooked that hasn't stuck. I know I know. Lube up the pan. But let me tell you, I just tried to cook an egg alongside my dad's hashbrowns and despite there being a whole quarter of an inch of grease in the pan all 3 eggs stuck like glue. I've tried butter. I've tried Pam. I've tried vegetable oil. I've tried everything, and nothing works in the slightest.So, my food comes out looking horrible, that's not the worst part. The worst part is these pans are impossible to clean after everything sticks to them. After each pan's first use they all look like they are 30 years old. They take three times as long to clean as the teflon pans I threw away after getting these.Needless to say I am more than a little upset. They look nice. But looks can't cook.
