review/summary: Pinzon Hemstitch 400 ct. Cotton Sateen Sheetsreview/text: These are a very good buy. I washed them once before using, and the material is strong yet soft. The mint color is beautiful and has a nice finish. The fitted sheet fits rather snugly on my Queen mattress that has an extra layer on top, but I am satisfied with this purchase.
