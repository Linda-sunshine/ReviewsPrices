review/summary: Mists well if used properlyreview/text: It's pretty simple:1) Keep the thing about half full2) Before using pump it a lot (if it doesn't mist, pump some more)3) When done, slightly unscrew the top to release the pressure and then screw it backSo far, the misto is working perfectly despite almost daily use over the last two months. That said, this sprayer (like all such pump sprayers) has the following disadvantages compared to a &#34;standard&#34; can of olive oil spray:1) You have to pump it a lot (and possibly re-pump if you're spraying a larger area) -- no spray and go2) It wastes a bit more olive oil since the mist clouds a bit more and thus not as much reaches the target areaPersonally, I think these issues are quite minor and do not impede my goals of cooking more healthily and saving a bit of money ... but your mileage may vary.Final thought -- my previous olive oil sprayer was from pampered chef. It worked pretty well (till I dropped it) but never did mist quite as well as this misto one.
