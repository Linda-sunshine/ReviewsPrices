review/summary: It's quietreview/text: It doesn't do the job as well as I thought it would. My bathroom is very small and the condensation (from showering) just seems to lay in the air. Of course, it's really running down the walls. I have never emptied more that an inch of water from this tank. I expected (and wished) it did a better job. Obviously, it is doing something and it's quiet so that's why I continue to use it.
