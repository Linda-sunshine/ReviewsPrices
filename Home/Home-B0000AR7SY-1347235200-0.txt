review/summary: I love it!review/text: This is fantastic! I just got it yesterday. So I'm still experimenting. I use this in conjunction with a Keurig 145 office pro, and the EKObrew filter. For pennies I get coffee that is so superior to any K-cup out there. It's quiet it grinds well. What's not to like.
