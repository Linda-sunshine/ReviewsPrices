review/summary: Jar leaked after 15 monthsreview/text: I used an Oster for 12 years and decided to get a bigger blender after it's broken. Since I have a wonderful KitchenAid refrigerator, I went with this blender. Unfortunately, it has a serious design flaw - the plastic jar is not strong enough for the operations. After using it for three times a week for 15 months, the bottom of the jar started to crack and eventually leaked while blending. A replacement jar is costly and there's no guarantee it won't leak again based on feedback from other reviewers. I do NOT recommend this blender and will go with a different brand next time.
