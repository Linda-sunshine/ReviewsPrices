review/summary: Too much work to cleanreview/text: I ordered this after reading many positive reviews. I used the item once and when I discovered that there were 6 pieces that needed to be cleaned, I decided to return it. The amount of work to clean it will make me want to use it less frequently. In addition, the item is quite bulky and takes up a lot of counter space. Also, as pointed out by another reviewer, when you place the food items in the chute, you need to cover it quickly or else food pieces will spatter everywhere. It is very powerful and does a nice job juicing, but the bulkiness and amount of work needed to clean it make it less attractive. I'm going to purchase instead the ninja bullet since it is small, efficient, and easy to clean. Not a juicer, but achieves the same results.
