review/summary: Functions, but not wellreview/text: We're still using this coffee maker, I bought it for my wife to use, as she's the only coffee drinker in our household. The lid on the coffee pot broke within a week or two. The unit itself seems to leak water outside of the pot sometimes, even when aligned properly. In any case, it does make coffee, and has a basic timer that normally works right. So.. it's OK.
