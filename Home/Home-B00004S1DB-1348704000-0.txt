review/summary: Works perfectly for me!review/text: I have had glass french presses - hate having to be careful cleaning it and broke 2 before I switched to plastic. Loved my plastic Bonjour one for years - but it did develop cracks and eventually fell apart by pieces after 5 years. I just got the Nissan french press last week and I love it. No grounds (never knew you could have french press coffee without grounds), keeps the coffee hot enough for me (but I like it much less than "hot!") for a couple hours, pours nicely unlike my old Bonjour one, sturdy,easy to clean and looks good on the kitchen counter. I hope it lasts me many years - like others who have reviewed this item.If you like hot coffee, this is not for you, because the coffee is cooler after 1 hour and much cooler after 2 hours - but still warm.
