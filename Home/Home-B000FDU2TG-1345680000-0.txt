review/summary: IN 2012...IT'S STILL ONE BIG LEAKY MESS!!!!review/text: After spending hours researching blenders, I kept coming back to this KitchenAid, as it seemed to best meet all of my requirements. Amazon was showing it as a 4 Star product with over 700 reviews. The earlier posts from 2007 said it had a leaking problem, but subsequent posts agreed this problem had been corrected. WRONG! I received this product on July 26, 2012; have used it once a day, every day, since, to make a smoothie, and it started leaking yesterday (8/22/12). Four stars on this product are very misleading, clearly this is a chronic problem, 5 years after the first leaky post. It seems to take multiple uses for the problem to present itself...I'm just glad I used it every day, and it failed within the Amazon return window...you might not be so lucky!!!
