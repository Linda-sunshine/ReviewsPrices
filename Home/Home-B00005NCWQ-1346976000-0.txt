review/summary: Great product at a super price!review/text: Ordered this perculator style coffee pot for use on my cookstove while camping. I wanted to replace my older aluminum perculator with one that's completely stainless steel. I shopped many sites to find a pot that makes atleast 8 cups, comes with a "stay cool" handle, and is made completely of stainless steel (i.e. not stainless exterior with aluminum interior parts). This coffee pot fits the bill! And, the best part...the price is right!!! I'm thrilled because I got an all stainless pot for the same price most sites want for a cheapy aluminum one. It's not only made well, it is very sturdy and has a nice weight to it. The finish is shiny and bright and because it's stainless it will clean up well. Can't wait to use it on our upcoming camping trip!
