review/summary: I really like it but expected morereview/text: Having read that Cook's Illustrated rated this the best knife for the money, I thought it would be a perfect knife.It's not. Don't get me wrong, it's a perfectly decent knife, hence the four stars.But it needs sharpening often. More often than I expected.
