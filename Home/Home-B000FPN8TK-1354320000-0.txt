review/summary: Almost perfectreview/text: I have this obsession with loose leaf tea. So glad I got this. The mesh is fine enough that none of the leaves end up in my cup. I just wish that there was a way to remove the filter. There is no good way to clean between the mesh and the plastic disc on the bottom. :(
