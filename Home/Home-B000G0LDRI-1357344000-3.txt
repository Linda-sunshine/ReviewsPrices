review/summary: Great for a house with small children!review/text: We bought this unit to replace our Vornado ultra. This unit is much better. It is much larger than most of the units I have looked at. It is very quiet and the build quality is excellent.I must agree with some of the other reviewers, though, the tops of the tanks being round makes them somewhat of a pain to fill up. other than that we love this humidifier.One major added bonus is that the knobs pull off the unit so that small children cannot adjust the settings. Also the unit does not have flashing lights and beeping buttons to attract attention.
