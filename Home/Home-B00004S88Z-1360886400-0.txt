review/summary: All American Pressure cookerreview/text: Because of size, I save 1/2 on energy and cuts my processing time in 1/2 because of doing 2 batches at once over my old canner. It's easy to operate and the lid is easy to get on and off. I love not having a gasket to twist or wear out! I would recomend this canner to beginner or experianced .
