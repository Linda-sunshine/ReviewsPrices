review/summary: Arrived Brokenreview/text: This arrived with the fan hitting the housing and was unusable. Long story short, sent it back and got a replacement.That said, the replacement is working fine and has run for about three weeks without issue. Does a very good job of cleaning the air in our bedroom and made a noticeable difference for my wife&#8217;s&#8217; allergies. Runs relatively quiet and I&#8217;m enjoying the white noise when on low. Seems a bit flimsy in construction with thin plastic, I guess we&#8217;ll see how long it lasts. An &#8216;okay&#8217; air purifier if you get one that actually works, but if this one needs replacement I&#8217;ll be trying a different manufacturer.If it were not for the poor quality control I would have given this 4 stars.
