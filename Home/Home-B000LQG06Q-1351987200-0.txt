review/summary: I now love my college dorm bed!!review/text: This thing is definitely worth it if you have a college dorm mattress. It's soft and comfortable, doesn't have a long lasting packaged smell like most of the other toppers you get from the mail. It's been 3 months of blissful sleep so far. However, I have noticed that some parts of the mattress topper become less "foamy" after being in the same spot all the time. I just switch it to another direction after a while and problem solved!
