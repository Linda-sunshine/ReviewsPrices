review/summary: I love this canner!review/text: I wanted a larger canner, but I was hesitant to buy this because I have a Whirlpool glass-top stove. I looked at my manual and it stated that the canner should be flat-bottomed and should not extend 1/2" beyond the burner. It is a flat-bottomed canner and after measuring I thought it would work out. My largest burner is 12" and it pretty much takes up that much room. I've used it several times and I expect it will continue to work for me.I haven't had any problems with the metal-to-metal seal. I just followed the instructions carefully and used olive oil to lubricate it.I like the size, it is heavy, and seems like it's going to last me for years.I like to purchase USA products when I can so I was very happy to find this and I am very pleased with my purchase.
