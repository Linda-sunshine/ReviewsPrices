review/summary: the plastic cracked after 2nd use.review/text: My goal was to grind up a small amount of &#34;Green Coffee Beans&#34; in this grinder. The first time that I used it-it worked great. My second time using this grinder resulted in cracked and broken plastic around the base of the top cup of the grinder. The Green Coffee Bean is a hard bean and rotated around the grinder similar to metal ball berring being thrown around. The result is that the plastic is too flimsy to deal with very hard beans. I wasted my money with this grinder still sitting in my closet.
