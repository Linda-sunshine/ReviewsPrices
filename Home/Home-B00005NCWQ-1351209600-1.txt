review/summary: Finally a quality product at a reasonable pricereview/text: I love this percolator. I bought it for camping and it worked great on my Coleman 2 burner propane stove. The handle doesn't get hot, it has a good capacity, and nice polished stainless steel finish. I don't know why people are complaining about the plastic dome, I have used this pot dozens of times now without any problems. Maybe one day it will fail, I will wait for that day before buying a new glass one. The lid stays in place securely and everything (i.e. basket, stem...) seem very robust like they will last for a very long time. There is a hole where the pour spigot is for pouring so it is difficult to get the last little bit of coffee out but that stuff usually has some grinds in it anyway. I definitely recommend this percolator, at this price it can't be beat!
