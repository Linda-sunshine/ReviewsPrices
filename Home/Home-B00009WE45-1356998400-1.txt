review/summary: Great buy if you work in a kitchenreview/text: When working as a line cook in a busy kitchen the right tools are essential. After a chef knife and a good pair of tongues a probe is undoubtedly the most important tool a cook can have. I have dropped this probe very many times and it still works great. The down side to this thermometer is it does not shut off on its own, this my led to it dying more often then it should.
