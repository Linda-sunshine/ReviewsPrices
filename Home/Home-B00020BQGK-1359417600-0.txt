review/summary: Lasted about Three Monthsreview/text: I bought this vacuum in November. At first it seemed to work really well, then yesterday, suddenly, the sound of the motor became quieter, and it no longer would suck up anything!I thought I must have been too rough on it, then I read here that others have had a similar problem!The machine had gotten very hot to the touch, although I had only used it for 3 or 4 minutes.Very disappointing! I won't buy this again.I'm surprised-I thought Hoover was a good brand.
