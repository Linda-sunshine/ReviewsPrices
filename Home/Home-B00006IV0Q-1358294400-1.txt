review/summary: Great coffeepot!review/text: I have never had a percolator before, and I am so impressed! The coffee is hot, smooth, and has a great flavor. I use regular basket coffee filters, which work fine except for maximum capacity (had some grounds at the bottom). It looks nice on the counter and takes up less space than a drip coffeemaker. I highly recommend it!
