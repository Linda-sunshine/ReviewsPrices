review/summary: not sure yet maybe okreview/text: I made two unsuccessful cups so far, packed them down like it says, with dark roast ground folgers. It was weak but hot, then ground same coffee in coffee grinder, looked good, but tasted weak. Today I am trying loose pack and using both pads. I'll add more later. site says to use expresso or turkish grind and to pack it down inside the pod. So I have coffee beans and will try that next.Easy to clean, just tap out the coffee and rinse off, don't use soap, it's not needed, air dry and use.
