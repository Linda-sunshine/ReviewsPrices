review/summary: Good electric kettlereview/text: When my old ceramic electric kettle finally stopped working I bought this as a replacement as I drink a lot of hot tea. I am very happy with it because it does exactly what it promises to do. It quickly boils water and then shuts itself off to prevent damage to the kettle. It is a strait-forward machine, but highly useful. My only complaint is that the power cord for it is short, but that is easily fixed.
