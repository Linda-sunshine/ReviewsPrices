review/summary: Still needs improvementreview/text: I bought this on an Amazon special and thought that I would just try it out because I have never used one before and it sounds like a good idea. I bought it and the first thing I notice is that it is pretty compact and lightweight. After two minutes of assembly, I pour distilled water (MAKE SURE YOU USE DISTILLED WATER) and after ten minutes, it was ready to use. I get a shirt and start to pass it over and over and over and over and.... well, you get the picture. As I keep passing it, I see that this thing is not really working and that the color is starting to fade off my shirt. I immediately stop it and put my hand over the shirt. When I put my hand over it, my hand turns the blue color of the shirt. Seriously, it was heavily disappointing and thank God the shirt I used was nothing out of this world. However, off to storage it goes because for the price I paid, it's just not worth getting a refund. However, maybe I will try an old pair of pants next time... SORRY! DOES NOT GET A HIGH RATING IN MY BOOK! :(
