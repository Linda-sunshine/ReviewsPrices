review/summary: Simple and easy to usereview/text: Just add eggs, fill water to the water line, and put in the microwave. Since your Microwave wattage doesn't change, you get the same egg consistency every time. You just have to test a few times until you time it perfectly to the wanted consistency and you're set. I thought there would be an odor or something when done in the microwave, but gladly, it comes out impeccably clean and odorless.
