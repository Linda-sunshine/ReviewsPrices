review/summary: Will last a long timereview/text: I have 2 of these large shower caddy's in each bathroon. One I can put up high to keep my kids out of so they will quit wasting my shampoo and one lower for them. We moved and they were easy to remove and take to our new house. Another great thing, if it gets a lot of soap build up you can remove it from the hooks and is safe for the top shelf of the dishwasher. They have lasted me years, think I've had mine for at least 6 years and they have never fallen, not one of them, and I put our family size shampoo and conditioner bottles on them, one on each side. They have survived my children so I think they are great.
