review/summary: An Act of Charityreview/text: I make a lot of soups which I often puree and using a conventional blender for that is messy and time-consuming. This takes up less space, is quieter and easier to use. One does need to pay attention to the cord, but that's hardly a complaint. It works so well I've donated my old blender to charity.
