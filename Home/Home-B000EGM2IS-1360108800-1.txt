review/summary: LOVE THIS MACHINE!review/text: I drink instant coffee and was in the market for a new tea pot. I went on Amazon looking for an electric tea pot and that's when I saw this dispenser. It really peaked my curiosity and for $20, I had to try it!!I'm so glad I did! I have boiling hot water in under 2 minutes!! And it doesn't take up much space on my countertop!I've had this dispenser for a month now and I still love it! I highly recommend this to anyone who uses boiling water for coffee, tea, hot chocolate, oatmeal... it's perfect!
