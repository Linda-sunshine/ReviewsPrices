review/summary: Does not fit standard top cabinets - MEASURE YOUR CABINET FIRSTreview/text: This came, seems sturdy, but it is too deep for my top cabinets. I asked and was told my cabinets are stadard size, but this rack is deeper than the cabinets. Disappointed since I really wanted this to organize my foil and plastics. If you have deeper cabinets this would be nice to use.
