review/summary: Not made in the USAreview/text: Real pleased with how it grinds meat and makes pasta. Make sure you cut meat in strips - 3 to 4 inches long work well with no more than 1 inch wide. That makes it easier for it to go thru the grinder. Suction works very well too to keep it stabilized while grinding.Not happy that it said it was made in the USA but only the company exists in the USA. Clearly stated all over - MADE IN CHINA. Bought this specifically to avoid Chinese made plastic and metal.
