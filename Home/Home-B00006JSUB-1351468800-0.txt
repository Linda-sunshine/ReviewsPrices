review/summary: Very pleased with this Lodge panreview/text: I was unsure of the size I needed and after ordering the 9 inch I thought I should have ordered the 10&1/4 inch. Nope. This one is perfect for me. It makes six large slices of cornbread two inches thick. I received the order quickly and today I had the opportunity to try out the pan. I made four different cornbread recipes. The pan's seasoning is perfect. All recipes released without any sticking. I just wiped the pan with a hot, wet paper towel between recipes. My favorite recipe so far is Alton Brown's creamed corn cornbread recipe. [...]The sweet cornbread recipe found on Hillbilly Housewife is a great alternative to the "Jiffy" mix. I like this pan & highly recommend it.Edit. 10/30/2012Here's a cheesy, jalapeno cornbread I just made up:Preheat pan with two tbsp vegetable oil to 450. In one bowl mix 2 eggs, 2 tbsp veggie oil, 1/2 cup H2O, 1 cup buttermilk(or milk. In 2nd bowl mix 2 cups white cornmeal, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt, 2 tbsp sugar. Pour dry into wet and stir well. Mince 1/4 jalapeno & toss into mix. Shred 1 cup cheddar(mild,medium, or sharp)& toss into batter. Stir these in the mix. Pour into hot pan & bake 25-30 minutes until top is golden brown.
