review/summary: Presto 01362 Stainlessreview/text: A proven design since about the year 1921. If you want to put in the ingredients and then ignor until completed, then the newer all electronic units would be a better choice. Using this unit while setting a timer and making sure that the correct amount of water is used before sealing the lid and having the heat adjusted to the correct setting works excellent for a medium to large size family.This is an excellent product.
