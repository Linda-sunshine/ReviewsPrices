review/summary: Good idea poor executionreview/text: Purchased about 2 years ago. On the upside, the vacuum generates an impressive amount of suction. It picks up pet hair and is great on stairs.On the downside 1) the "filter" is not terribly efficient. When you empty the dirt cup make sure to power the unit back on outside - it emits a very substantial cloud of dust when you first turn it on. Better still buy three or four extra filters and wash them between uses. 2) The dirt cup is quite small and requires frequent emptying. This then leads to the problem noted in 1). 3) The slide switch that selects the operating mode and releases the dirt cup jammed. The only way to operate it was to force the switch with a screw driver. Then the switch broke, rendering the vacuum useless. I really miss my dirt devil.
