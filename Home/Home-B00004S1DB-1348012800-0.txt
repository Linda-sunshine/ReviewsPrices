review/summary: Great for Campingreview/text: Got this for camping. Not a huge fan of instant coffee, and didn't want to get the Coleman coffee maker that you put over your camp stove because of the glass pot. No doubt I would break it. And I suck at making perk coffee. Always full of grounds and taste terrible. So this seemed like a great alternative. It has been. No complaints. Does what it is supposed to and does it well.
