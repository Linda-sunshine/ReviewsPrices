review/summary: Still working greatreview/text: I bought these to see if they would work in baking jelly rolls. I bake several when I am doing them and I go through so much waxed paper. To my surprise these work great! They peel off just as easy as the waxed paper and no waste. I have used them for many other baked items....even biscuits. The only two things I don't like are.... the high price and the corners are cut on a 45 degree angle instead of rounded. Neither of these issues have stopped me from really appreciating these mats.
