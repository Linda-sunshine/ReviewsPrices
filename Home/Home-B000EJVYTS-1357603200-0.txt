Call the customer service.2. Receive Warranty service request form in email.3. Send a copy of the receipt to the warranty department by email.4. The warranty department will reply within two business days.5. Once get the reply, send the product back within 30 days.6. I sent the lid by USPS, around $16.7. Include a $9.95 check to cover the return shipping and handling.
