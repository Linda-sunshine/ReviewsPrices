review/summary: My vote is "yes"review/text: Juice is fast and easy. Cleanup is acceptable. All parts except motor can go in dishwasher. You need to rinse all plastic to remove particulate and physically scrub the stainless steel grater with the provided brush. To be compact, it is quite large. There are a few chunks in the pulp (not in the juice). There is always a tradeoff for speed and convenience. Not pushing down so hard reduces this issue and gets you more juice. The product literature says this type juicer is not the best for leafy veggies. I already add those to smoothies with my emersion blender so not a deal breaker for me. I don't buy the hype about the juice losing nutrients with this type blender due to heat and oxidation. I can't see how it generates enough heat for any amount of time. We drink the juice almost immediately so oxidation is not an issue for me and the froth on the juice doesn't bother me. No matter what type juicer you buy, at least the juice isn't pasturized.
