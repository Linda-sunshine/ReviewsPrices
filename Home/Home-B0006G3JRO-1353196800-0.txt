review/summary: Plastic shaft snapped after 6 monthsreview/text: I see that I'm not the only one who had this happen to them. I used the hand blender maybe a total of 8 times before the plastic shaft that drives the attachment snapped and rendered the appliance completely useless. Stay away from it. It looks nice with the stainless steel and all, but the motor parts are cheap, obviously.
