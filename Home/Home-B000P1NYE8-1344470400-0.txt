review/summary: Wowreview/text: When they say Pocket Scale they really mean that this thing is going to fit in your pocket. I love how small and discrete it is. The image is a little different from the scale...actually as I'm reading the description and looking at the box, the company has sent me an MS-600 not the MS-500. I guess that's a better model seen as how the 600 is 600x0.1g. Now I can't compare. But I paid nothing for this thing so I can't complain. It'll still be great for on the go weighing.
