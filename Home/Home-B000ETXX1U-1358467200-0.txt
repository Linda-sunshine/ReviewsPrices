review/summary: Really good in the beginning, but wearing out quicklyreview/text: This was the best air mattress I'd ever seen, by far. It's the size of a normal bed with a box spring, and was quite comfortable. I used it during a move for a couple of weeks, and have had guests sleep on it.But after about 30 nights of use, it's noticeably sagging in the middle, and doesn't stay fully inflated throughout the night.Even so, it's still the best air mattress I've seen...
