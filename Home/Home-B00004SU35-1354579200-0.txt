review/summary: Poor designreview/text: This brand new device out of the box did not work. The gears did not align. The gears being made out of plastic should have been metal. Next the stirring base scrapes against the bottom of the pan. The sound was bad enough, but noticing how the product was made in China and how China is well known for using substandard metals I was concerned about these metals being an additive to my popcorn. I have some recommendations to improve this product. 1. Quality control should make sure the product works before putting it into a box. 2. Gears should be made of metal not plastic. 3. The metal cover should be thicker. The material is too thin and probably will not last long especially due to the impact of high velocity popcorn kernels. 4. The metal stirring mechanism should not scrape against the base of the pan. Addition of ball bearings and/or raising the height of the stirring mechanism might be more advantageous. It might also be helpful if the company's website was more customer friendly. We cannot recommend this product to our friends and family. We are awaiting to hear what company representatives have to say to our e-mail sent a short while ago.
