review/summary: Please, Pyrex, don't discontinue this!!review/text: I heard today on "Cooks Illustrated" that Pyrex is discontinuing the glass measuring cup and replacing it with a measuring cup that has a large red band in the middle. Pyrex, what are you thinking?This little gem has been in my kitchen for years. I don't use any measuring cups that are not Pyrex because I know that they are accurate, sanitary, and easy to read. I saw the "new, improved" measuring cup with the red band in the middle, and I can tell you it will be hard to read 1 cup measurements.I advise buying this one now before it is too late. You won't regret it.
