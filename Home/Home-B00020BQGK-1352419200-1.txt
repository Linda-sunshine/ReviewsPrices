review/summary: Hoover Vacuumreview/text: I thought this was going to be a great vacuum reading all the reviews. It didn't work right from the beginning. Nothing would suction into the canister. I bought it just to vacuum up dog hair in my bedroom. I have wood floors. When I used it all the dog hair stayed at the bottom where the rollers are. I would have to peel the hair off. After a few weeks I had my husband take it apart and he found a little piece of plastic broken off. I didn't return it because they will only give you half off and I would have to pay the postage which wouldn't be cheap.I feel like I was very ripped off. I would really like a refund!!!
