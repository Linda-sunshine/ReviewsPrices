review/summary: for the price great productreview/text: I ordered this to clean our carpets (duh) after about 2 years of wear and tear/spills/etc. i have to say i'm very happy with this product it works well. i like the two separate tanks it makes life a lot easier filling/emptying. it's kinda loud but for what it does it has to be. it's easy to tell when the catch tank is full cause the sound changes when the shutoff float hits the top. would recommend would buy again.
