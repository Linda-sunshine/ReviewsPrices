review/summary: Love this popcorn popper!review/text: This is so easy to use and makes great popcorn. I used to buy the microwave poporn, but it is not healthy so I thought I'd try this and it's great. Also, what I do is use spray butter and spray a bit as it comes out of the popper. Just enough to have a little butter. The top container works okay on butter or marjarine or whatever you use, but the spray butter makes it easier to distribute the butter w/o too much in one area.
