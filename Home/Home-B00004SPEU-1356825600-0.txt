review/summary: I purchased a new item...I didnt get it.review/text: I purchased a new coffee grinder. I received a used, dirty, beat up, damaged one. Packaging was good. No damage anywhere but on the inside. Even smelled disgusting. Was wet, had coffee grind remnants. Absolutely disgusting. I guess no one is perfect, purchase enough from Amazon eventually you get a flub. Returned a half hour after I received it.
