review/summary: Does what it saysreview/text: I am a single person and I didnt want to try to heat the whole house if I am in just one room. I have had the unit for a few days and it works great. Like others say you have to be pretty close to feel the direct heat but I use it in my bedroom at night and it keeps most of the room a few degrees warmer then the rest of the house. I checked my electric usage and I have already used 30 less killowats in one day of use. It does feel a little cheap, so we will see how long it last.
