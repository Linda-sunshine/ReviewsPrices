review/summary: Waste of money piece of junkreview/text: Do not waste your time with this one as it is not worth the money! I only gave it one star since I had to give a rating, but it is not even worth that! I am so sorry I ever bought this! Because of a health condition it is really important I get the 5 fruits and vegetables a day so thought this would be a great way to accomplish that! So thought it important to spend a little more money on a good machine; however, this machine is a piece of junk! It gives you very little juice out of the fruit, and is a mess, gets clogged very easy and ends up being more time than anything to get maybe 2 or 3 servings out of what would be considered 5 servings. I have only had this for 4 months and am already having problems with it. I am obviously going to have to buy a new one so this will just be written off as a bad investment!
