review/summary: Hardworking little machine!review/text: Have used it everyday for over a year to make 2 smoothies using frozen fruit, as well as soups for dinner. Recently it's started making a high pitched screeching noise when it's over worked but it's not a huge deal. I don't regret this purchase, best one I've made recently. I'm going to be getting a blender for bigger jobs but this will still be my go to for soups and smoothies. I've also used the measuring cup for lots of other recipes when my other one was dirty, great products!
