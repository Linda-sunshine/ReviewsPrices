review/summary: I'm thrilledreview/text: I put a lot of thought into this purchase, and I couldn't be happier with the result. Operation is simple, the parts are sturdy, and importantly it has a good strong motor. It is also quite flexible in terms of options. My first time out, I made salsa from cilantro, tomatoes, onion and jalapenos... and it was all over in a few minutes for 3 pints. Wow, I'm impressed.I was a little disappointed that the feed tube was played up to be larger than it actually is, but it's plenty big enough. They say you can put a whole pineapple through it, and a half is more like it. But that's okay, because this thing will chop, slice or shred so fast that it doesn't take much time to fill up its 7-cup capacity.Nicely done, Cuisinart, and as always, it was a pleasant shopping experience at Amazon.
