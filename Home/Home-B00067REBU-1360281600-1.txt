review/summary: Great Bread, Dough, Etcreview/text: I have this sitting on my counter. It takes up just as much room as my stand up mixer. I typically use the dough setting and then take the dough and use a regular bread pan and bake it in the oven. All the other bread makers make this big boxy square loaf and I like my bread to look more like, well, bread.If you do make your bread in this machine the mixing paddle will be baked into your bread. That is the only draw back. But I got this on sale, and so far it definitely has been worth the money.
