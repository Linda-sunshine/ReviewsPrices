review/summary: Works greatreview/text: I owned an older version of this steam cleaner for 25 years. I couldn't live without it - I have 3 dogs and they track in the entire yard. When it died recently, I decided to try the same Hoover steam cleaner. It still a life-saver but with a few new features. It has brush action and the clean surge, which lets me clean one spot without having to go over it several times. I used it immediately and I'm very happy with how well it cleans. The only con is that the tanks are smaller than my old one, so I have to refill and empty more often, but I can live with that.
