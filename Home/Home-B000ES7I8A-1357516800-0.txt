review/summary: Not for kitchen usereview/text: The kettle works fine but the lid is sunk below the edge of the kettle. The lid also flips to below the kettle edge line. This means that if anything is spilled on top of the kettle, when you try to clean the top, the crumbs fall into the kettle. The lid is not removable and the opening is not big enough (especially with the filter) to clean the inside. While I only used water in the kettle, our water is hard and I like to occasionally wash the inside of my kettle. It is not possible with this kettle. The description does not state that the lid can't be removed, nor that it can not be hand cleaned. This is not the kettle to use in a kitchen.
