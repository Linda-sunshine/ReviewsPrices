review/summary: Presto 02811 12-Cup Stainless Steel Coffee Makerreview/text: Love the coffee pot! Now let's see how long it lasts. It sure makes great coffee. So much better than the K-cup. Have one of those but coffee always tastes bitter. Anyway, we love the Presto coffee maker.Since I am submitting - I have a question. Is there a make of stainless steel K-cup coffee maker - one that has a stainless steel water reservoire and a stainless steel expulsion unit?
