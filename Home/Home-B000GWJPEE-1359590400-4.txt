review/summary: 3rd onereview/text: We are on our 3rd one, and these do not last. I am done with this product. They will lst for about a year, and then the fan starts making noise. I even opened the bottom up, and wiped all the minerals off the fan blade, lubricated the motor, and to now avail. Spend a littl ebit more, and get one that will last more than a season.
