review/summary: Good for everything except onionsreview/text: This processor works very well for almost everything, chopping vegetables grating cheese etc. Makes food prep so much easier for a large party or family dinner. The only thing it didn't do well was onions. It turned them into a liquidy mush! Just use a knife. Other than that I am happy with this purchase.
