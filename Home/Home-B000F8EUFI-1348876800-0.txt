review/summary: great little vacuumreview/text: I'm very pleased with my new Dirt Devil vacuum. It's powerful and the canister is easy to remove and place back in position. The first day I received it, I vacuumed an area rug that I had just cleaned with my old vacuum. You would not beleve the amount of dirt that my old machine had missed. What makes it even better, I bought it at a bargain price from Amazon.
