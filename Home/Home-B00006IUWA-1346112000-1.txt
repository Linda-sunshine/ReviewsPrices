review/summary: A wonderful, SAFE popper!review/text: This 80s-style popcorn popper is pretty awesome. For starters, it does not catch fire and you don't smell burnt plastic when you turn it on (unlike my last one.) Second, it actually works and pops the kernels, all without spitting them out every which way. Finally, it churns out a great, healthy bowl of popcorn in a quick and easy manner!
