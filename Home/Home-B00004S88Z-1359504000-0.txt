review/summary: Very easy to use and does a great job.review/text: This was my first time using a pressure cooker and I was worried about it exploding (that happened when I was a child) but I found the manual directions very clear and complete. I canned olives and they sealed well. The whole process was very easy.I've only thought of pressure cookers for canning but I'll try some of the cooking suggestions.
