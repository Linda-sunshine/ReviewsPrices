review/summary: fabulous ironreview/text: I LOVE evrything about this iron! My old Rowenta finally died and I was glad. This iron, however, is fabulous. It has a nice weight to it, not too heavy but I don't have to exert all my energy pressing down on it either. The cord is a good length also.The steam holes are not just at the top but placed around the sole plate for better steam ironing. PLUS, there is a control knob to adjust the amount of steam you want, PLUS, you can also give it a spritz of steam if needed. Adding water is also easy and has a nice little cover over the fill spout. It holds a lot of water.The digital readout is nice. Just push the button until you get the correct temp for what you are ironing. Ironing different types of fabric, the temp has been perfect for each one. It is supposed to tell me when I need to use the self clean feature and I can't wait. Everything else has been so great.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has to buy an iron. You can't beat the price.
