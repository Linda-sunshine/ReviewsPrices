review/summary: Great supportreview/text: The Sleep Joy 2&#34; memory foam mattress topper has exceeded my expectations! It provides great support by conforming to your body position. I am using it on top of an air mattress. It is not too soft or too hard. 2&#34; seems like the perfect thickness. I highly recommend upgrading your mattress with this topper
