review/summary: Wonderful for shallow bathtubsreview/text: I grew with a deep bathtub an missed being able to take long baths when i moved away from home. This is really useful for letting you fill a bathtub a few inches more than normal.Pros:- Easy to place and remove. Only takes a few seconds to stick on and it is easy to adjust its placement.- Does what it is supposed to do. It prevents the water from leaking out of the overflow and I haven't had any problem with water seeping in around the edges. It also has a hole at the top so that water can still drain if the tub gets too full.Cons:- Needs frequent cleaning. If you don't wash this frequently, you start to get residue buildup around each of the suctions cups. It can be a bit of a pain to clean because you have to clean around each one of the suction cups.Overall I love this item. I used mine for over a year before I lost it in a move and I immediately bought another one. Because it is so inexpensive, there is no reason to not give this a try.
