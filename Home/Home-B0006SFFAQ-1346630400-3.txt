review/summary: It's Okreview/text: Good coffee. Easy to use. Carafe well designed for no dripping.Can't use certain coffee brand due to overflowing. Gevalia, Seattle's Best, etc. is ground too fine for this machine. It spills over into water tank and clogs things up. At least it has overflow protection, to not flood the counter, and the filter prevents it from getting into the heating part! I stick to using the Dunkin Doughnuts brand coffee or eight o'clock and never have trouble. So grind your own and use a thicker grind, or use DD, Eight o'clock, Starbucks, or similar
