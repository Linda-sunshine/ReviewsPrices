review/summary: Superb Filtersreview/text: We had a mold problem in our crawl space and air samples removed a higher then normal spore count in parts of our house. I used two of these in our house and had the same spaces retested 3 days later and all the bad stuff was gone and the pollen/mold spore counts were less in my house then outside. These are very effective and the 2 I have are very quiet.
