review/summary: The Best! I love love it!review/text: I didn't buy this and the 12" skillets on Amazon, but elsewhere. I love this thing! The steaks came out so evenly brown and juicy on the inside. Fried fish with less than 1 tsp of oil came out so crispy and even cooked on the outside and delicious and moist on the inside. It's so healthy too!Just make sure you season it a couple times before first use for nonstick to work better.I love them so much that started my cast iron collection and got rid of all my teflon pots and pan.I highly recommend buying this and other cast iron products, especially made by Lodge- Made in the USA!
