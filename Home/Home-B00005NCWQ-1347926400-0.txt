review/summary: Faberware Classic Stainless Stell Coffee Percolatorreview/text: I received my percolator. It was packaged very well. I received it before the time the seller said it would be delievered. I love stainless steel products, so when I came upon this coffee percolator I jumped at the chance to get it. I had been using my grandmother's coffee pot for years since her death but decided to get this one. It has not been easy to find a percolator that you can use on top of the stove. I feel the price was fair and I look forward to many good years of using it. I would do business with this vendor in the future.
