review/summary: Best kitchen appliance I have!review/text: I. Love. This. Mixer. I use it for everything. I think a lot of the problems people have had comes from using the wrong speed. You can easily burn out a motor if you mix heavy things too high. I've made dough, cookies and cakes and never had a problem. I've also never experienced any oil dripping but in any motor there needs to be a lubricant so I imagine it could be possible, but I just wipe it down after every use. This was the best Mother's Day present I ever bought myself :)
