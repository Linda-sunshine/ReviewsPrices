review/summary: GREATreview/text: I bought this mostly to dehydrate blueberries. I've used it for so much more than that. I've used it for drying every fruit and vegetable I grow, along with jerky.I don't make fruit butters, so I can't say how it does for making leathers, but I really enjoy this. And I've found the 5 trays are just about right. I've never used more than that, but the 5 trays seem quite optimal for this dehydrator.
