review/summary: glad I bought this one.review/text: I'm pretty happy with this iron. I have never owned my own iron before, only used other people's. What I love about this iron. First, it has never leaked. That's awesome. Secondly, the built-in sprayer is great; no need for a plastic bottle of water. Third, it's easy to figure it out. The instructions for use, including fabric types and whether or not water is needed, is right ON the iron. It couldn't be easier to use. I'm very happy with this purchase.
