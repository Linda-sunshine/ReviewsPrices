review/summary: This is greatreview/text: My husband had a heart attack in July and I now grind all our meats and this is so much easier than the food grinder I have. It is small so it is always on my counter no need to take it off an put it away. It grinds meat great and chops vegetables in seconds I would highly recommend this
