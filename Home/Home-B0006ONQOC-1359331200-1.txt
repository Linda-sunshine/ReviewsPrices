review/summary: Great ice cream makerreview/text: This ice cream maker met my expectations. So far, I have made 2 batches - vanilla and pumpkin - and the texture is perfect. So simple to use. A little noisy, but I turn it on, set a timer, and when I return, my perfect ice cream is awaiting me. I store the bowl in the freezer so it is ready to go when we want to make a batch. I can't wait to experiment with more flavors.
