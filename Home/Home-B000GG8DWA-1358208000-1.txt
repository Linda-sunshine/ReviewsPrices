review/summary: Great little thingreview/text: After buying about 5 of these for my cold, cold, poorly ventilated company, I have to say, this is the best bang for your buck. Haven't run into any issues yet and they're all still going strong. Never gets too hot if you have it at a distance and, despite your area getting exponentially warmer, you'll forget it's even there. Very quiet and noninvasive.
