review/summary: The secret to perfect popcornreview/text: Enough olive oil to coat the bottom. A single layer of popcorn kernels. Turn the crank to coat the kernals in the olive oil. Shake to lay the kernels out evenly again. Low heat until the kernels start to turn brown, and maybe one or two pop. Heat up to medium high, occasionally turning the crank, until the popping stops.Just not the same in a regular pot.Salt to taste. Serve with heated Tostitos Medium Salsa con Queso dip.You're welcome.We actually did a side-by-side popcorn-making comparison at home and subjected friends to a blind taste test. The Whirley-Pop bowl was the only empty popcorn bowl at the end.We have managed to burn stuff to the bottom of one of these badly enough that throwing it out and buying a new one was the only attractive option, but in general I'm able to easily keep the Whirley-Pop clean with just soap and water, no elbow grease really necessary. It's survived countless rounds in the dishwasher as well. The materials are quality.A must-have for popcorn lovers. I'd absolutely give this as a gift.
