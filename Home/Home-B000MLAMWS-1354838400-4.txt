review/summary: Seller: Please contact me.review/text: I bought this mixer almost exactly 10 months ago and have used it less than a dozen times. I was kneading bread dough and it just quit woking and started smoking. I turned it off immediately and unplugged it. It's completely fried and won't turn back on. Please contact me and let me know how to get a replacement. Thank you.
