review/summary: Excellent.review/text: Although only cooked basic white so far, they have all turned out great.Controls are easy, once you read the manual.If you press the crust button, it switches it between dark, light and in-between. I think people were missing this when they were cooking!Smell is wonderful, and so simple to just dump the ingredients, and hey presto, fresh loaf 4 hours later.I have also used the timer function, and I awoke to fresh bread for breakfast! The top mounted holder for yeast works perfectly.Easy to clean.The unit does have a fairly big footprint, but I'm lucky as I have sockets on my island in the kitchen.If you're thinking about getting a bread maker, don't hesitate on this unit.
