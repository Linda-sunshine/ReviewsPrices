review/summary: Great Griddle!review/text: I love Lodge cast iron products and this did not disappoint. I saw this at Crackle Barrel for $24.99 and knew it would be cheaper on Amazon and so it was. I keep it on the stove top all the time because it comes in handy for so many things, even using it to heat up items for just two people in the oven. It's the perfect size for two people and so easy to keep clean. Great product!
