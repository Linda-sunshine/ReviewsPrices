review/summary: After 6 uses it is starting to failreview/text: My first review is below after the first use. I guess I should use it a lot more before I leave a review next time. After 6 uses, it stopped working. We shook it and started to push the button rapidly. It started pulsating. We used it for a few more seconds then tapped it on the counter. It started working fine again. I think it might be getting coffee grounds in the motor but I'm not sure. We've never tapped it or pounded it on anything before this.The way I see it, you risk more of a chance at getting a defective product the less you pay for one. I'm guessing there's maybe 1/4 of these that fail right from the factory or within a few uses. I lucked out at getting one of those. If we had got another product for maybe $10 more, we probably would have a 90% chance at getting one that will last instead of a 75% chance like with this one. That's just my thoughts on it. You're always going to risk getting a defective product but if you pay more that chance goes down. It's still not a bad product but I just lucked out on getting a bad one. I don't feel like returning it because we will probably get half the money back after you take out the money for shipping it back. I'll just got to a local store and pay a few bucks more to get one.Original review after first use:"This is my first coffee grinder and I'm liking it. The button is on the side (the white part) of the lid. It doesn't hold a lot, maybe 2 scoops with a regular sized coffee scoop that comes in the canned coffee. That's all you really need though. I also love the cord storage feature. You twist the bottom half and it pulls the electric cord back inside of it for an easy way to store it. The only drawback is that it doesn't quite break up all the beans into tiny pieces. There were a few bigger chunks left after running it for 15 seconds with some pulsating. Overall it's really not a bad product and definitely worth the money."
