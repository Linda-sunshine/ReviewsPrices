review/summary: How Did I Get Along Without This?review/text: I absolutely love this pressure cooker and wonder why I waited so long to get one. It's easy to use, easy to clean and does exactly what it's supposed to do ... cook food quickly. My electric range makes cooking pasta a chore as it doesn't have a constant boil point. After a little trial and error, I learned how to do it in the pressure cooker. My husband loves the bread pudding and fudge I make in it. My favorite use so far is pre-cooking spare ribs (in only 12 minutes!). My second favorite use is pre-cooking chicken or beef for use in stews, soups or casseroles. At first I found getting the lid on correctly a challenge, but I soon mastered it. My only complaint is this: when it's done cooking I wish it would turn off and not stay on &#34;warm&#34;.
