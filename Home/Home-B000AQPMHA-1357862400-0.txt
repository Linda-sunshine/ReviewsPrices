review/summary: Never thought I'd pay this much for a coffee maker but it's worth it.review/text: Convenience is the key factor for buying this. Each person can make a cup of their favorite flavor of coffee or tea in less than a minute. Nothing to clean up afterwards unless you select the large brew (it will brew three different size amounts) and use too small a cup, but the removable platform will catch any overflow or drips and you can just rinse it out later.You do need to be careful of the water you put in it. Hard water may clog it up from what I can tell from other reviews. It shoots steaming hot water through narrow tubes that puncture the top and bottom of the K-cups. I read something about using a paper clip to clear out any clogging. I don't care for the taste of our tap water so I only use bottled water anyway.I'm still working my way through all the flavors available in K-cups. Mine came with a sampler pack and when you register your Keurig online they offer some great discounts for more at their online store. The majority of flavors are all pretty decent but I'm leaning towards Starbucks own K-cups. If you can't find your favorite flavor in a K-cup you can buy a reuseable K-cup module and 'roll your own' to make one cup at a time; and of course it will make a fast cup of hot water for tea bags, which I've used for some Celestial Seasonings' flavors not yet available in K-cups (they have some but not all yet). Green Mountain's Hot Apple Cider is outstanding when you want something hot without caffine. After one cup I got online and ordered two more boxes.
