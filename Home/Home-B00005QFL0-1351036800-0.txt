review/summary: Works wellreview/text: Bought this bread maker machine in July 2012 and have had only one complaint about it. It tends not to mix everything from the beginning, leaving a small line of raw flour about 1" up from the bottom of the pan. I now just listen for the mixing cycle and use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides while it's mixing. No biggie but you don't want to just start it and walk away. It cooks both plain white bread very well and specialty breads even better. I did not want the collapsible blades - read the reviews! It cooks all sizes and types of bread to my satisfaction. The 1 hr delay took some getting used to but I plan ahead for that. All things considered, I am very happy with this model and its performance. I do add anything 'liquid' before adding the dry ingredients. That's not in the instructions but it works better for me.
