review/summary: It works finereview/text: This is my first steamer, so I have little to compare it to. I like having a way to get wrinkles out that doesn't involve an iron. It meets my needs, especially with sweaters and slacks. I don't think it completely replaces an iron, which is what I was originally hoping. Iron still works best for some items, like men's business shirts.
