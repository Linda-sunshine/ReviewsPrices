review/summary: If you dont fill to the line, perfect steamreview/text: After reading the reviews of this my fellow Amazon reviewers, I decided to take heed to the warning of not filling this to the max line (usually staying a bit over the halfway point). Plainly put, if you follow that direction, this little guy is perfect and because of that reason, I refuse to deduct the star because I feel like it is misleading to how great it is if you lower the water level.It's the right price, and it's exactly what you probably want from this. It heats up in under a minute, it doesn't spurt water and it perfectly steams. This thing has saved me a ridiculous amount of money on dry cleaning and I would highly, HIGHLY recommend this for anyone who steams on a regular daily basis and for those who need something portable just for special events. I have owned a big, long, tall steamer, and I can tell you that this little guy is perfect for my small city apartment (probably for dorms, too). It works just as well, if not better. My boyfriend, how has never ironed a day in his life, willingly uses this.
