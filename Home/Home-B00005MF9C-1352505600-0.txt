review/summary: I was Ripped Off!review/text: I AM A 63 Y/O DISABLED VETERAN, AND I ORDED THIS ITEM WHEN I WAS A PATIENT AT AN OKLAHOMA VETERANS HEALTH FACILITY, TRIED USING IT ONCE THERE AND IT DID NOT WORK PROPERERLY,AND 2 DAYS LATER HAD TO PUT IT IN STORAGE BECAUSE OF CENTER'S POLICLY CHANGE OF COFFEE MAKERS, NOW I HAVE MY OWN APT. AND I REMEMBERED I STILL HAD IT AND TRIED IT AGAIN, THIS TIME WATER AND COFFEE CAME OUT OF THE BOTTOM ONTO MY KITCHEN FLOOR, I FELT LIKE SMASHING IT WITH A HAMMER!! ALSO WHEN I FIRST OPENED THE PACKAGE AND REMOVED THE PLASTIC IT LOOKED OLD AND USED! I HAVE A FRACTURED SPINE AND I WAS BOTHERED BY A LOT OF PAIN AT THE TIME AND I FORGOT TO RETURN THE ITEM SOONER! I HAVE SPENT ALOT OF MONEY ON PRODUCTS FROM AMAZON AND THIS IS THE WORST!! AN ANGRY VETERAN!!!
