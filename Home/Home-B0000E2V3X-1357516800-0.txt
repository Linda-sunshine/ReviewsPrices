review/summary: Great piece of cookwarereview/text: This cookware is not just great for pizza. I use it to cook dinner rolls and bread too. It may be the cast iron; but rolls, bread and breadsticks get that extra rise that make them melt-in the-mouth good. I bought another square pan for the overflow from my &#34;recipe&#34; that yields the same results. Did I mention great pizza?
