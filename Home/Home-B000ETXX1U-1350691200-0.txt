review/summary: Worked great for 10 times and then:(review/text: This bed was very comfortable for what it was. I was super pleased with the purchase I had made until... Unfortunately this bed had literally only been used about 10 times and then it started deflated for no reason. My toddlers were using it to sleep on at my sister's house and the next morning when they woke up they were flat on the floor. Not sure why it started to deflated. I only ever kept it inflated when in use and I then I would directly put it away the next morning. It was never even around a pet or anything that could have scratched it, so I'm just not sure why it stopped working. Considering the money we spent on it I would have at aleast expected to get a year out of it. Won't be buying this brand again to replace it.
