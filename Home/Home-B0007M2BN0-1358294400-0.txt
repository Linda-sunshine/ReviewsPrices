review/summary: Perfectly cooked with set-it-and-forget-it conveniencereview/text: This egg boiler is brilliantly simple and easy to use, as in "set-it-and-forget-it" simple. Fill water to the line, load 4 eggs, set microwave timer, start it . . . and then go do something else. No need to wait, observe, or worry because your microwave turns itself off (after 7.5 minutes in our case). Highly recommended.
