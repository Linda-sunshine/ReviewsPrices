review/summary: looks good but is certainly not "professional"review/text: Got this after burning out an Artisan. This Professional lasted 1.5 years being used once a week on bread etc. It basically will not hold up to any serious mixing requirement. To me "professional" means working most days with somewhat heavy loads... and this could not have lasted more than a month or two judging by the amount of use it got from us. When calling customer service the representative explained that certain loads could not be dealt with by this mixer... and yet it is called "professional?" We are going up to a Viking I think or maybe Vollrath. (a day later) Nope, we got the NEW Pro-line mixer from KitchenAid (see pro-line website) because it has 2x weight capacity AND a FULL Five year replacement warranty! Yes it was almost $700 but the bowl is, it seems, interchangeable, and compared to the 900-1400$ units from other makers this seems the best deal. As of 12/18/2012 Amazon does not seem to offer this high line yet.
