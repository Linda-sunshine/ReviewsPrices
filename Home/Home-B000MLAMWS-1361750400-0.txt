review/summary: KitchenAid Pro 600 Purchasereview/text: This mixer is very noisy. I purchased another KitchenAid mixer last year (also a Pro 600) that was much less noisy. I was hoping that was indicative of a change that had been made, but unless this new one is an older model, that apparently is not the case. Disappointing! Otherwise, good machine.
