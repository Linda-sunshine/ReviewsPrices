review/summary: Now, that's a coffee maker!review/text: I am European and for all the great things in US I couldn't get used to filter coffee and drinking a mug of it :) not a big fan of Starbucks as well. So I went the well travel route of Bialetti and it did not disappoint. Now I get my morning caffeine shot from a short, strong espresso. La Vita e Bella!
