review/summary: Small but mightyreview/text: We've had this unit for a month and use it in our master bath. For such a small machine, it does a wonderful job keeping the moisture down. With several hot showers per day, the mirrors are less steamy each day and mildew is greatly reduced. The unit is almost whisper soft; can barely tell the unit's on. We empty the unit about every 2 or 3 days. Great item.
