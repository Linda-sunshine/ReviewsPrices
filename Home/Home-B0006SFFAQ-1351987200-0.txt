review/summary: Do not buy this model!review/text: We bought this model based on the Consumers Report recommendation. We have owned it for 12 months 11 days and have had 8 months of problems. It steams the water quickly but it never makes it to the grounds. It constantly says Calc or the Self-Clean light blinks... we follow the instructions to the letter and the lights go out, the Calc stops showing and it doesnt work well. Then out of the clear it will work for 1-3 weeks beofre it starts the cycle all over agian. Then it works again without us doing anything!We just bought a Mr. Coffee for 1/3 the price. If this one stops working, well we can buy 2 more before we hit the cost of the Cuisinart.
