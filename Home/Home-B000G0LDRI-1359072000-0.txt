review/summary: HORRIBLE and BAD WARRANTY.review/text: I was very excited when I purchased this humidifier in Oct 2012. It was big, on wheels, and could humidify our whole apt. It was simple to fill the water jugs and set the whole thing up.About a few weeks into using it, the humidifier would only take water from one of the jugs (there are 2) and would run as if empty even if the other one was full. I tried soaking the filter in water (which it recommends doing) and it fixed the problem for 1 night. Then the problem continued, so I changed the filter, also soaking that one in water and it was ok for a few uses. Then it started doing the same thing. We did not even realize because some nights it would take water from both jugs, and other nights it would not and it would run but not humidify. Then a couple weeks ago, the unit would not even power on. Now it just sits in our apt useless.I contacted the seller and I was told that my purchase date was too long ago to receive a refund. I would normally understand but within 3 months a more than $80 humidifier stopped working! I was told to contact the warranty dept, who told me that I will have to first send back the non-working unit and then they can take a look and send me a new one - I would be responsible for the shipping!! I have had this unit for only 3 months and I am shocked at how crappy the follow up service is on the vendor and warranty company.I will not buy this brand or from here again.
