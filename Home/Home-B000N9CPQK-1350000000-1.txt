review/summary: First Purifierreview/text: So, this is my first air purifier ever, as recommended by a friend.Why did I not have one before? I live in an old loft with two cats. The difference was magic, all from one tiny little purifier? I can still barely believe it.Almost no maintenance and takes up barely any space, it also doesn't make any noise-(I run it on low).I placed it in my main living space, near the kitty box. You can tell the difference in the air and no one ever smells the kitty box.I'm thinking I will keep using this the way I have, and buy a second for the bedroom at the other end of the apartment.
