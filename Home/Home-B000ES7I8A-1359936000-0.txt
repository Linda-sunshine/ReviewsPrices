review/summary: NOT SAFE. AUTOMATIC SHUT-OFF ONLY WORKS IF LID IS SHUT.review/text: We have an elder in the house who set of the fire alarms with this kettle last night. If that's your issue, DON'T GET IT. It is too easy to set it to boil with the lid popped open. Also, ALWAYS pours funny and drips on my pets at my feet. Low capacity.
