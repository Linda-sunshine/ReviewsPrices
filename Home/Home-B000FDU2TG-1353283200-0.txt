review/summary: GREAT!!!review/text: I upgraded to this one as the cheaper ones can not hold up to heavy fruit and smoothie blending. Plus, I do not like to have to cut or chop before putting in the blender. I recently did the Dr. Oz 3 day shake detox which is 4 veg/fruit shakes a day and it held up perfect. I would only cut apple and lemon/limes in half and put them in skin seeds and all and it blended them down to liquid. The veg I would put in whole.I will no longer use my juicer as the juicer takes out a lot of the part that has all the nutrients. The blender smoothes it up so it is all drinkable.
