review/summary: Truly makes can opening a snap!review/text: I'd given up on manual can openers years ago. We currently own an electric one that I use religiously, but my wife, who is in food service, always prefers to use a manual one. In need of replacing, I sought out the Zyliss 20362 Lock-n-Lift Manual Can Opener after some comparing online. After a few test runs, we couldn't be happier! Just as advertised, the opener is very easy to clean thanks to its hinged design. This hinged design also makes it easier to clasp the opener to lids. Hardly any effort is required to turn the grip and you can't beat the nifty magnetic lid lifter (though I, personally, usually never completely detach lids from cans). This appears to be a sturdy and superior product that is well worth the cost.
