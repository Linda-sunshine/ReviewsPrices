review/summary: NOT EIGHT CUPSreview/text: If you're looking for a kettle that has 8 cup capacity, this is not the kettle for you.When the description and the side of the box said 8 cup capacity, I assumed that it meant the "standard" measuring cup, which is eight ounces per cup.The Amazon detailed DESCRIPTION even says 64 oz. You have to look up at the top beside the picture to see it says 40 oz. Obviously, Amazon screwed up on this, but Hamilton Beach is deceptive when it says 8 cups.I called Hamilton Beach, and was told the "industry" cup is only 5 oz.Why, then, do they have the METRIC measurement of 1.2 liter's correct? Why not SAY 40 oz. instead of 8 cups on the side of the box and in the product description?With that said, the pot seems to work perfectly. It heats water quickly, and the all-metal construction seems sturdy enough.The tilt lid is a bit strange, but I can see why they did it. The tilt allows for a much sturdier pivot that would be much harder to warp by accidentally getting the open lid caught on something. The lid comes out easy enough with the push button release.The spout is a little undefined, which means you have to pour carefully not to slosh out too much, but as long as you take it slow, it works.
