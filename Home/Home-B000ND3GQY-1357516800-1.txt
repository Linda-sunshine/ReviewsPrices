review/summary: Larger than expected, but very nice first lookreview/text: I just received this product, but I felt inclined to make a post. The wok is much larger than I ever expected, which is not necessarily a bad thing. It has a great finish to it and looks to be a quality product. I have not cooked in it yet, but I am excited to give it a try this week. The top fits well and it looks like a heck of a value for around $30.
