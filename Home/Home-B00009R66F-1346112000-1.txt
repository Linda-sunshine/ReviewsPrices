review/summary: Does the jobreview/text: I've had this carpet cleaner for about 2 weeks. Easy to set up and use for the most part. It's not much heavier than my vacuum cleaner so i have no problem getting it up and down the stairs. It has really great suction. My carpets are dry within an hour of using it. I did not use the shampoo that came with the machine..i just throw in some baking soda, hot water, and a little laundry detergent and my carpets look great. I also use the same ingredients - slightly more concentrated for spot removal with the hand tool and it works great! I read reviews before i bought this and worried about the noise level but it's not any louder than other carpet cleaners. The people who complained about it being super loud must have only used small vacuums in the past or something. I really have no complaints about this machine!
