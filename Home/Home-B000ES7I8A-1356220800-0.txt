review/summary: Not Impressedreview/text: I had a number of complaints right after receiving the product.For starters, it claims to hold 8 cups.Yet, when filled to the &#34;max&#34; line i found the kettle to only hold 4 cups. I then placed it on the counter near a 40 cup percolator and was surprised to find that it was more than half the percolator's size. It is a tremendously bulky kettle for such a small volume capacity. And while it does remain cool to the touch and is all steel, there is no water level indicator that i could find and the lid was quarky to use. Its size also made it hard to fill unless you have a deep sink.The only thing i found going for this kettle was the fact that there was no plastic... unless you count the lid and the built in filter.To summarize, the bulkiness and lack of water capacity offset this all metal kettle.
