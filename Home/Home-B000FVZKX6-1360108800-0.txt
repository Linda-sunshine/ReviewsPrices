review/summary: Best Sheets in the World!review/text: These flannel sheets are amazing. They're very soft and warm, and the quality is phenomenal. I washed them before using them and was shocked that there was almost nothing in the lint trap. The material had obviously been pre-washed and has a nice tight weave. I'm impressed!
