review/summary: Okay, but there are way better options out there..review/text: All these are serrated knives except the longer thicker one. Was expecting more of a variety with how many pieces there are. Came with 3 more steak knives then they had proper slots for and they replaced other knives that were missing in the set. The scissors cut better than most I've had. The knives will def. rust if you put them in the dishwasher, so I would recommend hand-washing only. Flimsy and have a lighter, cheap feel to them, what do you expect for a lower priced set. They cut very nicely now, but I don't expect them to last very much longer. Bought because a friend recommended them, but will not buy again. Gave the knife set to them since they seemed to like the brand so much and they took back their recommendation... This set is okay if your looking for a some serrated knives that will last you maybe a year with minimal use.
