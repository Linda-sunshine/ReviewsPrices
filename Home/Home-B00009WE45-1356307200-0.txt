review/summary: Accurate digital pen thermometerreview/text: I've had this thermometer for about a year now and am very happy with it, primarily because it is very accurate. I just tested its accuracy with ice water and boiling water and it was within 0.5 deg F of 32 F and 212 F respectively. I've used it exclusively as a meat thermometer. It's still running on the original battery and the screen has not fogged up at all. As the manual indicates, it takes about 10 sec to stabilize on a reading.When I wash it, I only wash the stem and not the plastic display unit. Although it says it's waterproof, I would advise to be a bit conservative with that statement to avoid potential issues.
