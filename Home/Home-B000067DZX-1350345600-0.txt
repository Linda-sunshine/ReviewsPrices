review/summary: Don't buy from this sellerreview/text: I bought the 3 pack and after 1 week the tank would only fill 25% which makes the filter virtually useless. My guess is the filters are very old, have been sitting on a shelf and just do not function properly. This is the first time I have encountered this problem so find another dealer.
