review/summary: What a difference...review/text: ...a good coffee grinder makes. You buy the beans and grind right before you brew. This is the best of the household grinders I found through research, and they are right. Quiet, grinds well, easy to clean. Many grinds to chose from. Well priced. A must for the home coffee perfectionist. I am known as the best house to get coffee at...every one who comes over has to have a cup! Of course, I do percolate (none of this cheazy auto drip junk). The smell of the percolator fills the house and your mouth waters...why? Because I have fresh beans that were just ground before perking!!!! Take head....
