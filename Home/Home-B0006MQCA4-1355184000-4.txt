review/summary: greatreview/text: I bought this about a year ago and still give it 5 stars. I had a pitcher with a handle previously, and am glad i bought this model instead of buying the handle pitcher again. Large water capacity, but has a slim profile and doesn't hog all the space in my fridge. I have never had a problem with it leaking or dripping. The filters are easy to replace and are easily found here on amazon, supermarket, drugstore.
