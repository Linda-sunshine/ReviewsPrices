review/summary: Great Humidifier; Bad Designreview/text: The good reviews for this product are correct when they talk about how well this humidifier works. In a little 2 hours (on High), it raised the humidity by nearly 10% and once adjusted it has kept the level constant. However, this product offers more proof that an engineer who designs a product does not use the product. The water tanks fill from the bottom, yet the handles are on the top. We fill this from the tub and there is no way to set it down, so you have to hold it with one hand while it fills and gets heavier. When you are done, you have to balance the loaded tank in one hand while you screw the cap back on with the other. It would have been better designed with a "hands-free" feature so you can manage the tanks when filled to capacity. I love the power and efficency of the humidifier, but I absolutely hate that filling the tank is like juggling a bowling ball!After months of constant use we found that the filters do not last long. We have 2 cats and a dog and that may be a factor, but the filters only last about 1 month and they are $24.00 each!
