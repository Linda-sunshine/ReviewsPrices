review/summary: We've got two of these now,review/text: one for caf and one for decaf. Grinds the full range we need for the Aeropress, the french press and the (Gaggia) espresso machine. We've never pushed them up to superfine for Turkish coffee, but there's plenty of room on the dial to get there. Interestingly, each of ours has its own distinct sound. They both make a nice consistent grind at all the settings we've tried.Having tried the cheaper Capresso 559, which did not grind fine enough for espresso, and having done a fair amount of research, I'd say this unit is pretty much entry level for quality burr grinding, and I don't see much reason to pay more either unless you're an expert or an enthusiast.
