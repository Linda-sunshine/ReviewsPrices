review/summary: Disappointed!review/text: After doing hours of research and reading all sorts of reviews, I gave this bed the best shot I could. Understanding that this bed's PVC material stretches with use, I was fine with adding air after each of the first few uses. Okay, I woke up feeling like I was sleeping in a hammock, but that would change, right?Unfortunately, the situation remained the same. Worse: I'd add air to fill the mattress fully again in the morning. And, without anyone sleeping on it, the mattress would be partially deflated within a few hours. I returned the product.What caused the loss of air? I noticed that the seams joining upper and lower sheets of PVC may not have been fully sealed; there were plenty of splits around the outermost edges.Since some people have excellent, no-leak experience with this bed, another possibility occurs to me: Perhaps the leaks occur at places where the PVC is weakened when folding the bed into its shipping box. If the boxes are stacked, pressure might stress the PVC at these folds more on some beds than on others, depending on their location in the stack.In any event: engineers, technology, ho! From where I sit, manufacturing and distributing a truly leak-proof air bed seems to be in the realm of possibility. Let's do it!
