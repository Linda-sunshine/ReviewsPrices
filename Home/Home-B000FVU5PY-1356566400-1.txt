review/summary: Nice sheets!review/text: These are our new favorite sheet sets. We are fairly picky. Must be soft, reasonably priced, and in nice colors. I wish the offered more colors, but this color just happened to match our bedroom walls perfectly. They shimmer, are VERY soft, and have a surprisingly heavy weight to them (not too heavy). We also have the matching duvet- makes a nice set. I also appreciate that it came with 3 pillow cases. Pinzon also has great down comforters also.
