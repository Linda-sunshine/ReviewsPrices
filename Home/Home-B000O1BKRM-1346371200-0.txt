review/summary: Wish I Could Return...review/text: These trays were okay at first. Then, after a few months the ice cubes began to taste weird and a strange film started appearing in our drinks. The trays smelled so badly of plastic/rubber we had to take them out of the house completely. I thought I could use them for sorting trays at school, but now that same film is started to seep out of the plastic. I feel like they are very hazardous and Amazon should consider banning them from their site. My brother bought the same brand, but a larger cube and his is doing the same thing.DO NOT BUY!!!
