review/summary: Don't use the dishwasher....really.review/text: My last order was the fourth and fifth Aeropress that my wife and I have purchased. They are fantastic and I find them the best way to make great coffee. Just a note to say that I ruined the first two I bought by putting them in the dishwasher daily for about 3 years. The cylinder developed cracks on the inside and the plunger would no longer seal against the inside. With the amount I used (and abused) the first two, I more than got my money's worth. If you keep it out of the dishwasher, it will last forever. Start with sticking with the directions enclosed then experiment with your grind, amount of coffee and amount of water till you find what works for you.These are my go-to method of making coffee at home, at the office and while travelling.
