review/summary: Great Little Vacreview/text: This is the best small vacuum I've ever tried. It'd be wonderful if one could get this kind of power in a cordless, but the length of the cord for this model makes it virtually the same. Great at pet hair, great for quick cleanups almost anywhere. If you remember that it's a small vacuum, and not a biggie with a big bag, you'll be very happy with this gem. Best small power cleaning purchase I have ever made.
