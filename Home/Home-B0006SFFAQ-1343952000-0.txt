review/summary: Leaks after 1.5 yearsreview/text: I started recently using the programmed start feature. One morning I woke up towater on the counter and the floor by the machine. If I brew a pot without usingthe program feature the water does not leak. But if I leave water in it overnightabout 2 cups of the water leaks out the bottom. I followed some instructionsfrom several places on the internet from people having the same problem.I took off the bottom to check if the rubber tubes were brittle and cracked.They were not and I do not want to take it apart fully. I called Cuisinartand they said it has a 3 year warranty and they will replace it.Edit: Now it is leaking while brewing with the standard method. Clear waterstarts pouring out of the bottom of the machine while brewing. If I usethe warranty I will have to pay the shipping both ways and the $10 replacementfee for a total of about $50. No thanks this is going in the trash and I am shoppingfor a replacement.
