review/summary: Beautiful and easy to usereview/text: My old bathroom scale could change its answer by 5-10 pounds in a matter of seconds. The Taylor 7506 has no such issue. Once I step on, one of two things happens. Either I get an Err message or I get an accurate and consistent weight. The Err messages simply mean that it needs to be re-calibrated. As soon as I step off and back on, the accurate number will the appear. Once I have the accurate number, I can step on and off the scale and will always get the same number back. The reason the scale needs to be re-calibrated is because I store it on its side, not because of any design flaw.
