review/summary: Nice features but...review/text: While this has nice features like a radio and the ability to switch the siren to a voice, the LCD makes it virtually unusable. The back light combined with black letters and numbering makes reading it at night very difficult to say the least. From just the right angle, you may be able to read what it says, but when you're in a hurry (like deciding to run to your basement) due to an impending tornado alert, the LCD renders the device useless. I would not recommend this unit to anyone with other than 20/20 vision.
