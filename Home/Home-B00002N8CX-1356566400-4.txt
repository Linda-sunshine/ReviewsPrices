review/summary: Stopped working after 3 monthsreview/text: I wasn't looking for a super vacuum, just something that would do a reasonable job. My last Eureka had lasted for years. This one made it three months before the suction stopped. Trying to get it serviced using the warranty is more trouble than it will probably be worth to buy a new one. Very disappointing.
