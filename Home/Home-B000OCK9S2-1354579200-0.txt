review/summary: A mind of it's own - Waste of moneyreview/text: This alarm clock is not user friendly. You are obligated to read the instructions to figure out how to set time/alarm/radio. Most alarm clocks are self-explanatory. The screen is so bright it hurts your eyes to look at it in the dark and its impossible to make out the time from 99% of the angles in the room. Also it should be easy to change between the 10 different sounds and the radio. But my radio won't change it's literally stays stuck on a mode and I have to unplug it for a few minutes to get to another mode. Then I have to reprogram everything. Just to encounter the same inconvenient waste of time and frustrating situation the next day. If you are looking to buy this please don't. I am dependent on white noise to sleep and this defective alarm clock radio has caused me sleepless nights. It's not worth it.
