review/summary: Cute but leakyreview/text: I bought this for my baby son's room and it is adorable. It is so leaky, however, that figuring out where to put it is tricky. Since it blows stream straight up, it would make sense to put it on the floor, but you would ruin your flooring by doing so. I had to put it under a towel on a small wooden side table that I don't care about destroying. I like that it produces plenty of steam for a small room and it can run for 24 hours without a refill. Overall, I'd say I'm moderately satisfied with it.
