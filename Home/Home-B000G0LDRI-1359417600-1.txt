review/summary: A few design flaws may make this difficult for some people to use.review/text: Overall, this is a good, quiet humidifier, but there are a few flaws that may make it difficult for some people to use.First, the water reservoirs are quite tall. I have a sink that is slightly deeper than most standard kitchen sinks and a tall goose-neck faucet; these canisters barely fit under the faucet. It would be difficult to fill the tanks from the kitchen sink if your home is equipped with standard shallow sinks and regular straight faucets.Second, the canisters fill from the bottom. This wouldn't be an issue, except as you can see from the picture, the top of the tanks are curved and have a nice molded handle. As a result, they're easy to carry, but they don't sit flat in the sink. You can't set the reservoir in the sink, turn the water on a walk away because it is likely that the tank will fall over.Third, as mentioned above, the canisters are filled from the bottom. Each tank has a large cap that screws into place. The cap is about four inches in diameter. If you have small hands or any weakness or discomfort in your hands, these caps will be very difficult to remove. They could have been made smaller and not effect the performance of the product.If the ergonomic and design issues are not a concern, this is a great unit. It does the job it was designed to do and it has worked well for me.
