review/summary: AMAZING, WONDERFUL DEVICE!review/text: Sometimes it takes me forever to get to my coffee, and by then it's cold. Cold coffee sucks! So I microwave it 3-4 times a morning and it progressively tastes worse and worse. Well I tell you: it's all the microwave's fault! I just finished the last sip of a coffee that I poured over 6 hours ago, and it was just as warm and delicious as it was 5 hours and 50 minutes ago (see, I really am slow)! Now that I have my Mr Coffee warmer I am a happy, more efficient worker. I need to get another one for my home! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!
