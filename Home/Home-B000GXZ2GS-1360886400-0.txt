review/summary: Excellent choice for a quick cup of genuine coffeereview/text: As they claim, the aeropress is easy to clean and makes a tasty cup of coffee.We have two, though one is on its last legs - either the barrel has been stretched or the rubber plunger has shrunk over time and leaks. It has faithfully made 2 x cups every day for a year, so at the Amazon retail price that's good value (compared to a plunger. I've smashed three glass inserts over the same time, at $25 a go).I use my aeropress at work where there's a temperature controlled instant hot water system, so it's easy for me to follow all the recommended setup. Not sure that I'd have the patience to boil, then let cool, the water to get it to the 'optimal' 85 Celcius, if I was using a standard kettle.One things I have noticed is that it uses up comparatively more coffee per serve than an equivalent, eg stove top, device which suggests its not as efficient as some other methods, but this has to balance against the ease of setup and cleaning.Paper filters are a negligible ongoing expense once you consist the price of coffee, and easy to get in mostcoffee retailers in my park of the world.Recommended for single serves and there's no comparison with instant coffee, clear winner.
