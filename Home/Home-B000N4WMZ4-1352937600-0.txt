review/summary: Lodge Dutch oven, greenreview/text: It has yet to be used, it is a Christmas gift for my boyfriend but it looks great. The colour is gorgeous and the coating is complete without any scratches or marks. It looks heavy and durable but I will need to update my review once it has been used. So far it is exactly what I was hoping for but time will tell when it comes to its use and function.
