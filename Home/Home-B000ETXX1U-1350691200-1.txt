review/summary: Great Mattressreview/text: I have bought a number of mattress and this was great. It is almost the height of a bed. My mother who is 80 can sleep on this and is no problem at all. We have a memory foam pad that we put on it too so it is great. We are taking it camping and my husband says that is will sleep better than the beds at hotels and that is true. It costs more money than some of the other ones but it is worth it. ENJOY.
