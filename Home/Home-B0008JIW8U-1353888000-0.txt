review/summary: Only 2 cups?review/text: While this is advertised as a 4-cup coffee maker, what we got was only a 2 cup machine. The carafe says that it's 4 cups, but we measured 2 cups in a measuring cup and it exactly filled the carafe. Unfortunately, we've opened it and used it once, so we're stuck with it. When I buy another coffee maker, it won't be through Amazon. This is the first time I've been unhappy with an Amazon purchase.
