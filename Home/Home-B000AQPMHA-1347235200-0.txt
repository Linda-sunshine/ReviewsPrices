review/summary: Keurig B40review/text: The Keurig B40 is a very easy coffee maker to use and it produces a reasonable cup of coffee. I did purchase my own reusable cup for coffee grounds and I have found that it uses less coffee in producing one cup of coffee, than other coffee brewers. However, the flavor is not quite up to the coffee from my prior coffee maker which was a Cuisanart machine that would grind the beans each morning. Still, for ease of use, clean-up, and speed, the Keurig B40 is very nice.
