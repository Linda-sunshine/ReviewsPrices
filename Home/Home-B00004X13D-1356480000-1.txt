review/summary: LOVE THIS!review/text: I read the reviews first, and there were so many that liked this waffle iron, and I can see why! We love waffles in our home and these come out nice and crispy, not like others that soften after a few minutes out of the iron. This has been my third waffle iron in about 20 years, and by far the BEST!
