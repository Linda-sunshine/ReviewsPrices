review/summary: Nice Sheetsreview/text: These sheets have met all of my specifications; they have a deep enough fitted sheet for my new memory foam mattress, the feel is thick but comfortable, the quality is very good. The pillow cases are wide enough to fit my pillows, something I never even considered until I started reading sheet reviews. All in all I would buy these sheets again. One caveat: the color is not as it looks on the photo but more of a gold. Still, a nice color, not yellowish at all. Just keep in mind if you are trying to match these to a duvet or comforter.
