review/summary: How To Prevent Leaksreview/text: I am a guy with a monster grip. No matter how tight I crank them, these lids leak. However, if you double a piece of Saran wrap between the jar and lid, like a gasket, they don't leak. Don't try to make a perfectly round gasket. Just make an ugly oversized square and it will work fine. BTW, putting the lid inside a cheap sandwich bag then screwing it on works well too.C J
