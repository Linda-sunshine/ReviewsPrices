review/summary: TINYreview/text: I usually have instant coffee (a good brand from Columbia) I don't know anything about making any other coffee. I never even buy coffee to drink while I'm out. I'd been looking at the big coffee makers on different shopping networks, they looked good, but are so huge, and you have to keep buying the refills which must be expensive.I saw this coffee maker with good reviews, I even found one being used on YouTube. It looked good, so I ordered it. I didn't know there were lots of different sizes. I thought 3 cups would be perfect, until it arrived, I got a shock at the size. It only holds 5 1/2 ounces of water. The person on YouTube demonstrating a Bialetti 9 cup, must be using around 16 1/2oz of water. I just did a Google search and found out, an expresso cup only holds 2-3 oz. I'm used to drinking coffee out of a giant mug!I gave it 5 stars, because I like the coffee pot, it was my fault that I didn't research enough to know the size. It is quite amazing to watch it work. There are 3 sections, the bottom (where the water goes) coffee is then placed in the basket, which goes on top of the water. You then screw the little coffee pot on the top. It doesn't take long to make the coffee, and it tastes really good. I use my rotating whisk, to make frothy soy milk to put on the top. Sometimes I like to put some whipped cream on the top.I did an experiment about 5 years ago with a small glass Melitta coffee pot on the stove top, I used the same coffee in a filter, but it didn't taste as nice and rich as the coffee made in the Bialetti coffee maker. I like the fact that you do not need a filter for the Bialetti.I'm so impressed with my Bialetti, I'll probably buy a larger one eventually, for when I have company. The coffee is so rich and satisfying from this coffee maker, that it is the right size for me.
