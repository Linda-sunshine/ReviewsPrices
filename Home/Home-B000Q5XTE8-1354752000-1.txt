review/summary: Very comfy computer chairreview/text: It is probably the best computer chair I've ever sat in or used. It is extremely adjustable (even the angle at which you are stilling, as well as the back-rest and height). The mesh back is comfortable and so is the seat itself. I bought it after my last good computer chair wore out and it definitely lessens fatigue if you are sitting for a long duration.My only knock against it is the mesh back is tacky and will grab your clothing. So if you plop down sloppily into the chair or slouch as I do, it will lift your shirt. It definitely is annoying. But for me, it is no deal-breaker, and I simply lay a blanket over the mesh.
