review/summary: Almost TOO Non-Stickreview/text: This is a great pan - when it comes to eggs, it is almost too non-stick as it is hard to get the spatula under them to flip they slide so freely! We have used this pan a lot since getting it and have no real complaints. America's Test Kitchen rates this pan as best bang for your buck and once again they are correct!
