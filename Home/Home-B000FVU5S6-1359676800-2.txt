review/summary: great shetsreview/text: I was looking for some nicer sheets for out bed, these have worked out great. They are a tad bit scratchy out of box, they age great after about the 2nd wash. They are a bit tight on on the sides (queen) but there is enough fabric on the top to keep it from stretching too tight and putting stress on the fabric. Over all i would recommend these sheets and plan on buying more myself.
