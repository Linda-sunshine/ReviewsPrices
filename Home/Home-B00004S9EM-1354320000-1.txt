review/summary: A must in the kitchenreview/text: This has cut the time for preparing everything from biscuits to vegetables. I love having it around because it saves me time in prepping vegetables. I can make biscuits in less than 10 minutes because it will do all the 'cutting in' the butter for me and the pulse option gives me complete control.
