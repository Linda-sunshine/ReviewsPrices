review/summary: I like it.review/text: It works good. Makes good tasting coffee. My only gripe is the 3 cup really isn't big enough. I only get 3 espresso sized cups out of this model. Most mornings that is fine for me. But after I make coffee, I don't want to go back and make it again. It takes only about 3-4 min on an electric stove burner to make. You should be close by to pull it off the burner when it has percolated.
