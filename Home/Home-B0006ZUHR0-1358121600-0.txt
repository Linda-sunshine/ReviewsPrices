review/summary: Good iron...but !review/text: Pretty good-sized iron for guys with pretty good-sized hands. Super slick ss sole plate...unit is capable of putting out a lot of steam...heats up fast...but I'm sending mine back 'cause the steam control dial does not stay where I set it--any li'l touch of my knuckles & bammo! you just moved it to a different setting w.o. even knowing you've done so! Very annoying. If that kinda thing doesn't bother you, then go for this iron as you get a lot for your $. I just tend to want tool settings to remain static unless I "tell" it to change. That's just me.
