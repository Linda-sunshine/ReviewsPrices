review/summary: Works great!review/text: I ordered this a way to get my son off the microwave popcorn kick. Many microwave brands are loaded with transfat and a bunch of other unpronounceable garbage. Add the right amount (I forget at the moment), and it pops a huge bowl full. Adding butter or seasoning is up to you, but at least you know what you are adding, unlike the microwave chemical crap. The only negative is that this thing sometimes litters our counter with popcorn. (maybe we need a larger bowl?!) And there is no on/off switch, just a plug.
