review/summary: Works greatreview/text: I had these old plastic ones that snapped when i tried to take ice out of them so I wanted to get rubber ones. These work well, can be a little difficult to remove lots of ice cubes at once but its easy to remove them individually. its rubber so you don't have to worry about them breaking. I don't notice any weird tastes in the ice cubes.
