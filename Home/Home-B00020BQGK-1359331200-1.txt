review/summary: Floor sweeperreview/text: I bought this floor cleaner cuz I got tired of sweeping the floor with a broom. Originally I bought a rechargeable one and it was great for about a month till the battery started to lose its charge and would only work for about 3-4 minutes before it died. I bought it cuz I didn't want to have a cord attached but after that experience I decide to look for one that has a cord. I love it little vac. It's super powerful. It does my floors and even my rugs through out the house. But like others say the cord is short and I do have to unplug it and replug it back in just about every room I go into. I also bought the Hoover steam mop and its cord is crazy long and it works great also. Great combo for floor cleaning.
