review/summary: The best coffee maker I've ever bought!review/text: It's been two years now since I bought it, while I was still in college, and I cannot tell you how wonderful it's been. Whether you drink 8 oz or 16 oz a day, this maker is perfect for single servings!I time the machine so that it starts to brew 5 minutes before I'm meant to wake up, and the smell of the warm coffee, paired with my alarm clock, insures that I'll wake up.It tends to make a weird gurgle sound, but that's forgivable.
