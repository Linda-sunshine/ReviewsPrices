review/summary: Works Great - But...review/text: This works real good. I've made quite a few pizzas on it and never have a problem with sticking of course but always get a nice, crisp crust. The only issue is - if you own a 12&#34; or larger skillet it makes a fine pizza pan so this is kind of redundant. One thing about cast iron... many of the simpler pieces can perform many functions so specialized pieces become unnecessary. I find I use my skillets more than this for pizza making these days. Probably because the skillets are always out on the stove ready to do.If you are not so much into cast iron but are considering a stone vs. a cast iron pizza pan then I'm thinking this might be for you. I pre-heat it, scatter a little semolina flower on the bottom and drop my pizza onto it and throw it back in the oven. The pizza lifts easily from the pan to check the bottom of the crust. Just like pizzas from a good pizzeria, the bottom swirls with light to dark colors and the crust is crisp. I hear these stones break all the time... you ain't gonna break this.
