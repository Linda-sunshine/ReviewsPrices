review/summary: Love My Beadmaker!review/text: I received this breadmaker as a gift from my Mother. It is one of the best loved and most often used gifts I've ever received. I am not exactly what you would call a cooking enthusiast, but I have been a breadmaking fool ever since I got this handy little machine. It takes me hardly any time or effort to get a loaf started, and my family really enjoys having the warm bread I've made with dinner. I also like to make my own little adjustments and additions to the boxed bread mixes to make unique loaves, for example, adding rosemary or other herbs and spices. I also stumbled on a little trick which I have found makes my breads even better, with a moister and softer texture. Instead of removing the finished loaf as directed, I leave it in the machine until I am ready to serve it. This happened accidentally the first time, and ever since, this is how I serve every loaf. Everyone raves about my breads and I get to enjoy this little bit of extra time in the kitchen each day experimenting on new additions. I would definitely recommend this breadmaker to anyone.
