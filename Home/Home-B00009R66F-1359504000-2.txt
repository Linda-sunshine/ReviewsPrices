review/summary: Great performancereview/text: This machine is not too heavy, and it is easy to use. I have been using it for some time, and the performance has not changed. I keep the extraction container clean, and dry out both containers every time I use it. I have a carpeted doggie room, and even though my dogs are pretty clean dogs, they do come in with dirty feet occasionally. I clean the carpet every month or so, and the carpet has not suffered from the cleaning.
