review/summary: Not very sturdy.review/text: This shelf came exactly as described. I do wish it was a little more sturdy, especially in the back. The shelf grippers were bent when it arrived, but easily moved back into place. You won't be able to put too much weight on this shelf without it beginning to bend again.
