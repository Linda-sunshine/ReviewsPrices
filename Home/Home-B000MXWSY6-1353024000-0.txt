review/summary: Nice!review/text: Nice alarm but bigger than anticipated. The alarm by itself is not loud enough to wake me unless I set it to radio.Can only pick up a few stations on radio but that could be my fault. Other than that it is a very nice alarm clock and has 2 alarms which is nice and the setup is very easy.
