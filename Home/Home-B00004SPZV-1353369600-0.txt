review/summary: Greater waste reducer and no added chemicals!review/text: This cuts down on waste and you don't have to ingest harmful propellants. How else can you get unusual oils or your oil flavored oil in a spray can? Just pour oil (don't fill it all the way to the top), use the lid to pump pressure into the can, then spray! To release pressure and prevent clogs, simply twist the nozzle until the pressure is released. If you leave it pressurized, the lid may not sit flush on the container. Not a big deal. I've used it for 10 weeks without a problem and have saved a lot of oil and disposable cans. It's cheaper at T.J. Maxx, but free shipping at Amazon saves a drive.
