review/summary: Do not buy the elephantreview/text: I bought both the panda and the elephant. The panda has two holes in which the mist can come out so it works great. The elephants trunk is not a big enough hole so its leaks out of the sides. I do not recommend the elephant and would stick with an animals that has two holes for the mist to escape out of. I am returning it today!
