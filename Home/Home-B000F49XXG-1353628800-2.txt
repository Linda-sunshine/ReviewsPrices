review/summary: Love, love this machinereview/text: After visiting Italy in September, I am now a coffee snob! Now I ONLY drink espresso or less frequently cappuccino. I grind my own beans (something I had never done.) I use Illy coffee beans from Italy. It is so smooth. The EC 155 is wonderful and the price is awesome. I don't mind the short wand at all. Be careful when you use the steam button though. I turned the knob the wrong way and steamed milk sprayed every where. I'm now a pro. I am SO happy that I bought this machine. It takes me back to Italy each time that I use it. Ciao!
