review/summary: ecopods are pretty good if all you want is one cupreview/text: They work fine as long as you're a one cup a morning type of person. I like 3 or 4 cups a morning, so it's rather messy for me to be preparing coffee this way. Otherwise, it's a good product. Usually I don't drink coffee after AM, but if I do have one in the PM, I'll use this.At least you can choose the quality of coffee you put in it, rather than rely on the Senseo pods.
