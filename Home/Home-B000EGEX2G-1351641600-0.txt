review/summary: Arms broke off!review/text: This Glide was easy to assemble and was great until one day I was rocking my baby and the I felt a jolt. The front of the arm rests had come apart and one broke completely off. I was so scared when it happened that me and my baby were going to crash to the floor. It hadn't even been a year since purchasing the chair and it broke. The only good thing I can say is that Stork Craft are replacing the arms for free without a problem. But if the one year warranty had expired who knows the hassle it might have been.
