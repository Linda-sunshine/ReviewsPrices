review/summary: Great for WaterPic and Shaving Waterreview/text: I love my little Proctor Silex electric kettle. It's great for bathroom locations that require quite a wasteful draw of slowly warming water before getting some decently hot water. In less than a minute, I can warm up enough water to fill my WaterPic reservoir with lukewarm water so I don't have to endure the discomfort of WaterPic-ing with cool or cold water. It's also great for really hot shaving water, whether I'm adding to the already somewhat hot water I have in the sink, or pouring it straight from the kettle into the empty sink. I also leave some hot water aside in the Proctor Silex to pour over the cutting head of my razor blade and the cutting block and foil of my electric razor. This is really effective at removing shaving cream residue, etc. Oh, and the hot water from this little kettle is also great for cleaning the sink when I'm done.
