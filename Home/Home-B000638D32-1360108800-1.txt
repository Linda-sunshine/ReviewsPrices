review/summary: Outstanding valuereview/text: I own a Wusthof 8&#34; chef's knife that my wife bought for me when I first decided to get &#34;into cooking&#34;. At the time, I had never owned a serious cutting instrument. The Wusthof was on sale at the time (less than $70) and I enjoyed the experience of having a quality knife.After watching America's Test Kitchen, especially the equipment review segment, I saw where the Victorinox 8&#34; chef's knife had repeatedly been rated better than other more expensive chef's knives. I found the knife online for around $25 and decided to buy it. What a joy! Sharp, hefty, well balanced, and the Fibrox handle provides a great grip even when you hands are wet and greasy. Probably the best $25 investment you will eve make for your kitchen.
