review/summary: elite home renaissance queen setreview/text: Finally! Sheets of high quality at a bargain price. These are beautiful sheet sets. Make sure you wash them before using them--to take out the sizing. Yes, they do wrinkle---but if you take them right out of the dryer when they finish--and either fold and put them away--or make your bed--the wrinkles are not apparent. Highly recommend.
