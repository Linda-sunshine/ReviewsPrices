review/summary: Lip Servicereview/text: The coffee pot works fine with one fault. There is a curved lip facing inward all the way around the top restricting the flow of coffee grounds that have fallen to the bottom of the pot from being poured out. Very annoying when cleaning otherwise works as advertised.
