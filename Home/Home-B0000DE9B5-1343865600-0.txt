review/summary: Perfect Replacement for Plasticreview/text: As part of my attempt to rid my kitchen of BPA-contaminated containers, I came to Amazon, shopping for glass pitchers. I read reviews until my eyes crossed. I decided to try the Bormioli jugs, even though many reviews complained of loose-fitting lids. One review addressed this issue with instructions for making the lids fit, and it tipped the scales in Bormioli's favor. I am so extremely happy that I believed that review! I am thrilled with my glass pitchers (I don't fill them to the lid level, thus avoiding BPA leaching). Let me add my 2-cents to the lid discussion. The lids fit exactly as tightly as you want them to. There are instructions for them on an insert inside the pitcher. All you need to do is to hold the outer perimeter in place while tightening the seal using the lid "handle". So easy. I am also happy with the vendor's customer service. One of the two pitchers in the package was shattered, although the packaging was extremely tight and well-padded. The box must have been tossed from the door of an aircraft onto the tarmac and I'm surprised that one pitcher managed to survive. Long story a bit shorter: the broken pitcher has been replaced quickly and I didn't have to ship back the broken shards. The only problem was on Amazon's part - after being told not to mail broken glass (which I suspect is illegal) I got notices that my credit card was going to be charged for the defective merchandise if I didn't mail it back right away. I've made another call to Amazon's customer service and have been assured that the problem has been taken care of. We'll see. I'm watching my credit card bill.
