review/summary: Game changerreview/text: I moved into an old apartment with someone with a cat and started having trouble with allergies once the windows were all shut up for winter. Allergy medicine would take care of my nasal symptoms but didn't take care of my breathing issues. I was wheezing considerably and was struggling for oxygen at times. I have had NO breathing issues since starting this thing up! I just leave it on the low setting with the ionizer on. I can actually enjoy being at the apartment! I really like that this is nicely priced and has a cleanable filter!
