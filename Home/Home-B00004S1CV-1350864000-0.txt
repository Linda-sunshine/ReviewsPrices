review/summary: Leaks; Flawed designsreview/text: This cup leaks between the strainer and the cup. I've spilled tea on myself many times even though I had tightened the seals.Second, this cup is not designed for rebrews or leaving the tea leaves in the cup. You're supposed to brew the tea leaves in the strainer, and throw away the leaves before drinking. ANY REAL TEA ENTHUSIAST KNOW THAT'S NOT THE PROPER WAY TO DRINK TEA. A proper design should keep the tea leaves inside the cup as you drink.Unfortunately since I started using it, I feel obligated not to return it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE SLIGHTLY SERIOUS ABOUT TEA
