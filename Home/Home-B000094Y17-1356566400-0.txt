review/summary: Great water, bad designreview/text: We are longtime Brita water filtration users and up until purchasing this model, were very happy. While this model filters water as well as earlier models, the design of the top cover is just terrible. As one reviewer says, &#34; it floats&#34; and doesn't sit securely on top of the pitcher. If you grab the handle and use your thumb to open the hatch to fill the pitcher with water, the whole top rocks back and falls off. I would not recommend this model to anyone.
