review/summary: Glider Reviewreview/text: Purchased it to give as gift.They loved it and do not have any problems. The assebly was pretty easy and it is exactly what is advertized and looks as the picture.The cusion could use extra padding? yes, but the price matches the product.An additional purchase of $20 for the extra padding or an additional $100 to $130 for better model (take your pick)This is a great product.
