review/summary: Broken in 5 monthsreview/text: This machine worked great. We did find ceratin milk produced better froth. After a few months there were some issues with the steamer producing a lot of dripping hot water. At 5 months of ownership, the machine will no longer pump water through the system, therefor no longer making any expresso. It was a good machine for the money while it worked but I expected it to last longer than 5 months.
