review/summary: Product temperature rating wildly varies and is incorrect!review/text: I bought this item and, upon reading the packaging, instruction sheet that came with it, manufacturer's website and Amazon description, I realized that it is impossible to reliably determine the upper temperature limit for using this product! This is VERY unprofessional from all involved, especially manufacturer and the seller. Amazon mentions one set of limits, product packaging another. Additionally, manufacturer's instructions included with the product vary in setting the top temperature depending whether you read the Fahrenheit or Celsius degrees on the same instruction sheet. In Fahrenheits, they list an upper limit of 480 F but in Celsius it gets to be 280 C. Problem is, 480 F = 249 C (rounded to closest degree C), but 280 C = 536 F! So, which the heck is it, Silpat?! It's blunders like this that create fire hazards when people go for an OFFICIALY stated numbers, like I would, since I think and work in degrees C. Does that mean that Silpat is pushing me (and other such customers) into a fire hazard, health hazard?! I am VERY disappointed! One star up from lowest rating for prompt shipping.
