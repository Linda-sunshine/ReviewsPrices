review/summary: Works as Advertised, but Finnickyreview/text: I've gotten some great results, experimenting with the Aeropress, but it's not a device with which I'm able to achieve much reliability. I use the inverted method, which doesn't require dilution, but I'm never very satisfied with the amount of coffee produced. I still use it when I have those 16-odd grams of coffee left over at the bottom of a bag that I don't want to waste. There are as many recipes out there as baristas and it can be overwhelming for anyone that isn't in the coffee industry themselves. I would recommend a different device for the home brewer that just wants a consistently good single-serving device. Go with the Abid Clever. The Aeropress excels with darker roasts, I find, and don't recommend this for use with Indonesian or Kenyan coffees, anything with a tart or complex flavor gets a little lost (with the methods I've tried thus far). Easy clean-up, though, and certainly produces the clean cup promised on the packaging (zero grinds). Purchase this bundled with the Hario Mini-mill, a marvel of Japanese engineering.
