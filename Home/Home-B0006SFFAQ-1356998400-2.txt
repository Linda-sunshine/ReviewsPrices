review/summary: Short Life Span-Check The Warrantyreview/text: Worked great for 2 years, then it quit. No heat, no brew. There was a 3 year warranty, but it costs $20.00 in shipping, paid by the customer, to get it fixed at Cuisinart's facility. For $24.95 I bought a new Proctor Silex coffee maker. Understand all of the terms of a warranty BEFORE you buy any product. Go to the company's website and check. See if the warranty actually reflects no-cost to the customer. I will from now on.
