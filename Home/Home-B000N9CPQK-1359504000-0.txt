review/summary: rain in seattlereview/text: I bought this item about a year ago.I did a lot of homework looking at reviews etc and decided this seemed right for me.I pretty much live in my bedroom,I keep it neat and clean but I have to blow my nose a lot so thought this may help.I usually keep on medium setting during the day and low at night.I find that it is cheaply made,I agree with other reviews the firsttime you take off the front and put back on seems to have a really sloppy fit and jiggles even when clicked back on.It is way to loud to keep on high.Still don`t like the noise even at night on low.I am still blowing my nose a lot,but not sure if is coming from going out to other parts of the house.I clean the filter front screen and other filter regularly but have noticed that air only seems to be coming out of one side of the back of the machine.Took out both filters and vacumed well and put back,still only air from one side.I am not suppose tohave to ever I know change the filter but thinking of trying that.Can`t see that just vacuming this filter is all the cleaning it will need.I don`t use the ionizing on the unit,gives me a headache.
