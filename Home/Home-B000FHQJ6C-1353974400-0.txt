review/summary: Messy!review/text: I have been doing some research for a juicer for quite sometime now and thought I found it in this Hamilton Beach Big Mouth. Kudos to Amazon for delivering within 2 days (that was a plus) however as it reached, I sat and read through the instructions and washed all the necessary parts - 6 in all - and proceeded to begin juicing. I only had a stack of carrots at the time so I decided to make carrot juice. The juicer worked well in juicing the carrots as I did not push down with the pusher but rather allowed the carrots to disintegrate on their own, which worked fine. However, I noticed that I was getting pulp all over my clothes!!!!! It so happens that there is a vent of some sort at the top-side of this machine that the pulp flies through....needless to say, it was messy, therefore I am returning it. I have enough cleanup as is with the general parts to further have my clothing and surrounding areas to clean?? #notfun. Notice something: the juicer is always shown at one angle that is because the vent is on the other side so it is not visible through the images shown :-(. I do however like the large storage bin, wide mouth and the power of the unit so if Hamilton Beach could redo their design it would definitely be a juicer with good value for the cost.
