review/summary: So far so good.review/text: Has held up well. Is easy to use. The flip up opening is convenient. Works well. Cleanout is easy but could be better as the dust tends to stick to the filter. You do need to clean out hairs and fibers from the brush occasionally to keep the beater bar spinning at full speed. But not as bad as some others I have used. Cord is long. Hose is removable for easy cleaning with the edge attachment.
