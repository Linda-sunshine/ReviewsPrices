review/summary: Brewing systemreview/text: I love this thing. I don't use the K-Cups. I use the refillable/reusable cup and save HUGH bucks doing so. It is fast as long as it is ready to brew, it take about a minuret to get ready to brew. Set the time for it to come on in the morning, place the cup in the machine, hit brew, one minuet later, sip you coffe. You can also set the brewing temp. My wife make tea with this, she runs just he water through it with out a cup and BAM. tea time.
