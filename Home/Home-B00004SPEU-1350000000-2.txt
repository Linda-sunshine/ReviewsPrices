review/summary: Worked Great, but only for a short period of time...review/text: I used this grinder for coffee only. It worked great for about 2 1/2 months but then died. The motor quit. I don't use really oily beans and I never overfill the grinder, so I'm not sure why it quit... I expected to get at least a years use. For the price, I guess I got my money/use out of it... I did use it on a daily basis - once in the morning and once in the afternoon.
