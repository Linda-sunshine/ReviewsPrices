review/summary: Very nice radio/alarm clockreview/text: I really like this. It is a very nice clock. Its build quality is good, doesn't look or feel cheap. It's very easy to setup and adjust if one needs to make changes to the alarm time or time. I'd really recommend this if you are looking for a night stand alarm clock. I also like the dual alarm. I set one for the workdays and the other for the weekend. The numbers are pretty big, but won't interfere with your slip. The radio tuner quality is also very good compared to my previous alarm clock. It is hum and noise free. Of course depends on the location. I use my previous alarm clock as reference.
