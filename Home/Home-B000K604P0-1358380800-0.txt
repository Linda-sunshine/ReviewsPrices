review/summary: Works great! Don't overfill it!!review/text: The only downside is that the lid doesn't come apart for you to wash it. Otherwise, it's a fine coffee mug. Don't overfill it though, otherwise it won't seal and you'll end up with scalding hot coffee all over you! Also, have the lid open when you screw it on. This allows the air to be displaced and will also ensure a tight seal.For a few bucks more, I would recommend the Zojirushi travel mug. The lid does come apart for easy washing and the design is a bit better.
