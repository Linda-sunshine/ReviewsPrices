review/summary: What am I doing wrong?review/text: I've made three batches of ice cream and none of them are even semi stiff except for the parts that touch the side of the frozen bowl. I've followed the directions to a T and after even 30 mins it still looks like semi thick soup. I used the beginning recipes that don't use egg, the vanilla and chocolate, and it took 2 days to truly set-up fairly firm. Background on what I'm doing. I freeze the bowl in my chest freezer for at least 24 hrs until when shaken makes no sound. I use fully chilled wet ingredients and add to the bowl at the last minute, taking bowl from freezer to mixing cycle. I expected more based on the reviews and I'm just not seeing it. Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated.
