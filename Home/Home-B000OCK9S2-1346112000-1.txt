review/summary: Serves it's purpose for the pricereview/text: The service related to ordering & shipping this item was perfect. Upon reciept, I was a bit disappointed. It is of reasonable quality. If all you need is white noise to fall asleep this will be fine; especially considering that the clock & alarm work well and are easy to use.My disappointment is that there is no earphone jack for private listening. I need the white noise/soothing sleep sounds NOT my husband. The other issues are that the sounds are very similar sounding and there is no sleep timer.Some of these issues are mine for not having read the product description better or asked questions. I have resorted to my CD player again and rather than return this- too much trouble- I have put it on my husbands side of the bed as an alarm clock! For that purpose it works well & is easy to use.
