review/summary: Works Greatreview/text: I love pasta but needed to cut way down on my calorie intake. Now make huge bowls of zucchini noodles for all kinds of pastas in just a few minutes. So far we have had excellent Alfredo, spicy Thai, pesto etc. delicious low cal meals. Also I save the centers and cook em up later or chop them and add them to the pasta. Also it cleans easy and is pretty fun to use.
