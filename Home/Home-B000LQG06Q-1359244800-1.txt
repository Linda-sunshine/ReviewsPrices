review/summary: Good to make an old mattress goodreview/text: I bought this mattress topper because the 3 mattress pads I had on my full size bed just wasn't cutting it for me anymore. I started to have lower back problems and I'm only 22.I wanted memory foam because I've slept on a pure memory foam bed before and it was one of the most amazing nights sleep I've had. This topper caught my attention as memory foam that was affordable and a temporary solution before I get an actual memory foam mattress.Un-boxing:When I got this topper, it was nicely wrapped tight and boxed. It smelled of mint which was probably because of the natural hypoallergenic antimicrobial treatments used to make the bed. I thought it the smell would get annoying but it faded after one day.Sleeping:Immediately after placing it on my mattress, I could feel a great difference in comfort. I did notice it is not true memory foam that you see on TV where your hand leaves a imprint for 2-4 seconds. It was good enough for me during my sleep minimizing my tossing and turning to find that &#34;right&#34; spot. I did notice that the topper actually made the bed feel smaller. It seems they cut it slightly smaller than what a full size bed is and when my Fiance and I sleep, we naturally creep towards the center because of the feeling we are falling off the bed. This is a big reason I took a star off. As far as whether this topper keeps you cooler, I'll have to come back to this another time as I've had a fever the first few days of getting this product. I think with this product you might have consider your pillows as well, your body sinks in to the mattress topper leaving your head and pillow inches above your body. You might need a thinner pillow or a memory foam pillow to feel better comfort from head to toe.Overall:For the price, a temporary solution, and the level of comfort it gives, I give this topper 4-stars.
