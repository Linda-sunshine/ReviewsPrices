review/summary: This Bed is worth every $$ you pay.review/text: I took this bed on a camping trip to maine on one of the last weeks in Aug. The nights got chilly but the bed held up really great even with the cold air. In the past I have used other air mattress' at this same location and have had to inflate every day or have found myself enveloped by the bed in the morning after some deflation while sleeping. This bed held firm all night. And the convenient pump which is a part of the bed is awesome. It also takes care of deflating, as well. It does take roughly 5-6 minutes to fully inflate and the same to deflate. It was very comfortable, as well!BUY THIS BED over an aero-bed. Don't spend $200 for those beds. Buy this one for $99.00.
