review/summary: Great Juicer, Tough Cleanupreview/text: This juicer had been great for me. I have had it for almost 12 months using it 1-2 times per week and it still is working very well for me. The only challenge I have had (and the reason for the 4 stars) is the basket is more difficult to clean out that I would have liked. They do provide a teriffic brush to help make the job easier, but the total clean-up time still sits around 5-6 minutes which feels long considering the speed at which it juices...this thing is FAST!
