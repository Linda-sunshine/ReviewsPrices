review/summary: Great Juicer for First-time Usersreview/text: My boyfriend and I purchased this juicer in an effort to make our own juice and live a bit healthier. The price is decent for the product. Our juicer arrive on time with no broken pieces. The machine pumps out a good amount of juice but does leave a lot of pulp. Clean up it pretty easy considering it has many parts. We have juiced apples, pears, pineapples, carrots, and ginger. All went down easily. The juice cup is small and I suggest having a pitcher on-hand if you are making a big batch. I'd recommend this juicer to someone just starting out and who plans on juicing once or twice a week.
