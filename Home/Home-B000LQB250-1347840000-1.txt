review/summary: pretty good for the pricereview/text: I had a similar mattress topper to this one, but it had gotten old. So after reading the reviews I decided to get it. The smell didn't bother me, after the first night I didn't even smell anything. I have a full bed, and the full size fit perfect on top of my mattress. My older one was smaller even tough it was full as well. So I was very happy to see that.Before I got this from amazon, I bought another type mattress top -classic type I guess. But I started waking up with a very bad back pain. I tried using our mattress, but it ws also hurt my back. This mattress topper lessened my back pain, so I'm happy with it.
