review/summary: Best sharpener I've boughtreview/text: NOTE: I bought this sometime around December of 2011I bought this as a gift for my father, who works in a commercial kitchen. The first thing he used it on were our knives at home, and after cutting vegetables for stir fry with them once, I immediately asked him to sharpen the set I used at cooking school before he took it to work. It was amazing, it takes very little time, is super easy to do, and leaves you with VERY sharp knives that feel like they just came out of the store.Dad takes it back to work every few months or so (he decided it was too nice to stay at work all the time) and it still works like a charm, we've never once had an issue with it. As soon as I move out, I'm buying one for myself, because this is the only sharpener I'll take my knives to now.
