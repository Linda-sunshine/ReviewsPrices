review/summary: I had high hope...review/text: The design seems make sense. The reviews are mostly positive. However, I found it OK but not good enough to replace my pod coffee maker. After you pour the hot water, before you stir, 1/3 goes down already. I don't even need to apply pressure. The coffee comes out OK.
