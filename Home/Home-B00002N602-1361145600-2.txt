review/summary: American ingenuity at its bestreview/text: I brought my Presto cooker from the United States when I moved to Ukraine five years ago. I guard it jealously, making sure that I always know where the weight and the trivet are.My new wife had never seen one before, but it took her about a nanosecond to figure out that it is the best thing imaginable for making Ukraine's signature dish, borscht. Fast, energy-efficient, easy to clean, unbreakable. A great product.
