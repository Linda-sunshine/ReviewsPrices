review/summary: needs a better nozzlereview/text: this is a decent sprayer. I like the pump mechanisim. However the nozzle seems to be low quality. the pressure has to be just right to get a good mist. sometimes it spays a steady steam, sometimes the oil just dribbles out. even when i do get a mist, it seems too fine and much of it blows away or simply dissipates into the air.
