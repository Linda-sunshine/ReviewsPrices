review/summary: Love the knife - I have bought 6 and keep giving them away. I hope to keep one somedayreview/text: Fairly sharp to begin with. Its shape makes it feel sharper than most knives. Takes a very sharp edge with ease. Retains it edge well and can be maintained for many uses with a good steel. Best deal on a chef knife.
