review/summary: Works like a charmreview/text: Great product! I have arthritis in my thumb and turning things like the rabbit wine opener is getting quite painful. Since I'm not willing to give up my nightly glass of wine to pain, had to find an alternative. This opener works great on both natural and synthetic corks. It's stylish to leave out on the counter. The lights to show it is charging and plugged in are red and bright enough to almost serve as nightlights. Attractive in the kitchen or on the winebar.
