review/summary: Love it!review/text: We bought this after getting two puppies and a HARD time housebreaking. I rented a Rug Doctor first which did well but didn't want to keep renting one every two to three weeks. This machine is wonderful! It did as well if not better than the Rug Doctor. I'm amazed how much it gets out. I wish I had bought this sooner.
