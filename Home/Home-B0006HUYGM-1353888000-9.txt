review/summary: If you have pets, you owe it to yourself to get this!review/text: LOVE this little vaccuum. Seldom have I purchased a product for such a good price that performed so well. In this household containing 2 cats and 2 dogs, prodigious amounts of fur end up EVERYWHERE. This vac has the strong suction and beater brush capable of removing the fur from hard-to-get-to places that ordinary vacs aren't made for. I use mine for getting the fur off upholstered furniture, dog and cat beds and carpeted stairs. This vac even has the unique ability to be used in a vertical manner without contorting my body or being forced to hold the hand vac at an impossible angle. By flipping the plastic cover down over the bottom part of the beater brush, the upper brush is exposed, allowing me to use an up and down motion to pull and suck hair off vertical surfaces like the sides and backs of chairs and sofas. The crevice tool allows me to run the vac over the edges of the carpet near the walls where pet fur likes to hide and the regular vac can't quite reach. It's easy to empty and has a good long cord. One thing I wish it had was a brush attachment, but for this price, and for such a good little appliance, I guess you can't have everything. One of my best purchases in a long time!
