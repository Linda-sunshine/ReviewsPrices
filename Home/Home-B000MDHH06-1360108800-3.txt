review/summary: Well donereview/text: I've had several other juicers. You would think that one juicer would be enough to last for a decade or more but not today's products. Even the multiply more expensive model I'm replacing just plain sizzled out right after the warranty period ended. This model is heavy, solid, grinds with authority and pulps out juice second to none. I'm expecting a lot of use from this Breville. If that changes I'll update my review.
