review/summary: Mmm-mmm Love Itreview/text: After almost 40 years of water bath canning, I finally stepped up to pressure canning. Honestly, what took me so long? But it did. I like this canner because it is tall enough to can two layers of jelly jars or one layer of quart jars, and it will hold a full 7 quart jars. It will not can two layers of standard height pint jars, but would work if you used the &#34;squat&#34; jars new to the market.I was a little disappointed in HOW LONG it takes to can something since the 75 minutes of processing time recommended for a product containing meat (such as beef and vegetable soup) doesn't count the time it takes to get up to pressure, vent, and release pressure. But this is not the fault of the canner ... it is just a fact of life when canning meat products. As a result it took me closer to 3 hours per batch of 7 quarts, and I couldn't start canning late at night, which was my habit with waterbath canning.With pressure canning, it is very important to read the recipe and follow instructions. I am lax this way. I want to season food and modify ingredients MY way. But pressure cooking affects the flavor of seasonings in ways I had not anticipated. So I will follow the recipes for a couple years until I learn what seasonings I can increase or decrease without adversely affecting the end result.There is really nothing to complain about regarding this cooking tool. It works just like it is supposed to work.
