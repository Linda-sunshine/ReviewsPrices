review/summary: Best carpet cleaner ever!review/text: This carpet cleaner takes a little time to assemble. However once you use it, you forget that. It is a breeze to use and cleans the carpets unbelievably well. It leaves them dry enough to walk on in approx 2 hours! I have also used it to clean up spills. An entire can of grape pop cleaned up beautifully.
