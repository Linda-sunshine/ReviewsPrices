review/summary: mmmmmmm goood!review/text: got this for christmas and instantly made a loaf of cinammon raisin bread. it makes bread making so much easier because of the mixers that are already installed and the settings are very easy to use. didn't even use the manual to set it up. we literally dump in the ingredients and forget about it because it does everything else. it tastes much better than store bought bread. we actually marked the date of the last time we bought bread because we don't plan on ever buying bread again. it also costs less with the few amount of ingredients that it takes to make bread. the machine is very easy to clean once it is done.it comes with all the measuring tools that you would need and a great dummy proof set of recipes. you'd be dumb not to buy it. plus its always nice to set a timer and wake up to the smell of fresh homemade bread like we are going to do tomorrow:)
