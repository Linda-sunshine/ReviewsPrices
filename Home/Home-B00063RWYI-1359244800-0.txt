review/summary: Factory second?review/text: Like many reviewers, I am disappointed in the quality of the pre-seasoning layers. Immediately after opening the box, I noticed a spot where the bottom of the inside of the dutch oven meets the wall where it looks like the iron was seasoned while wet and rust has bubbled and cracked the seasoning. There are also multiple patches where the seasoning has flaked off in chunks around the size of a quarter. I hope to strip the dutch oven of the factory seasoning layer to start over.We have a Lodge Logic pre-seasoned skillet that took a bit of TLC when we bought it 6 months ago, but now it's in excellent shape and performing well for us. I hope that we can have the same success with the dutch oven.
