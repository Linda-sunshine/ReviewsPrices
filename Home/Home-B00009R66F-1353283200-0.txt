review/summary: First impressionreview/text: Delivery was amazingly fast. I don't think I had the two day shipping option, but it came in about 2 days so I was very pleased with that. I had trouble figuring out the hose attachment storage, as the instructions are okay, but pictures could be bigger to make it more obvious what to do for us visual learners. It's on there, but seems like it will fall off and could be designed to fit more securely. And why not just attach the tool attachment bar? Other than those minor annoyances, my first impression of the machine is positive. I had a hoover steam cleaner similar to this 13 or so years ago and that one seemed more solid than this, but same design, and I don't remember that one even having a hose attachment option so I'm glad this one does. I bought this because I have two dogs and a cat. The dogs like to pee on the stairs landing and the cat likes to occasionally "mark" certain carpeted areas like my dining room. I believe this will make my life much better when I can quickly spray/clean/suck up the odorous leavings of my animals. Before, I had to spray with urine nutralizer and blot up with paper towels. I sprayed and then cleaned my dining room and the half part of my living room that the cat has marked with the machine and the water was dirty and I don't smell the urine odors like I did before I used it. I understand it wont be as powerful and effective as a professional cleaning, but I am pleased with it's ability on it's trial run and am glad that I have it. I just have to find a place to store it. I didn't use the hose this time, but it doesn't look terribly complicated and I imagine it will work great on my upholstered chairs. Having something that can suck up dirty water is better than having nothing to suck up dirty water. So there you have it. I'll update if I have anything to add later after more uses.
