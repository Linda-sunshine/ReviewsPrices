review/summary: Best Glass Pitcher For Orange Juicereview/text: The lid on this pitcher really is water-tight. You have to hold the outer edge and then twist the inner handle clockwise. After you do that, the lid forms a perfect seal. Now you can vigorously shake the pitcher to mix up the contents. This pitcher is perfect for reconstituting frozen concentrated orange juice.
