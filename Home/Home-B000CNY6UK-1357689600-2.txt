review/summary: Good, but a hasslereview/text: It makes some of the best coffee I've ever had, BUT I have to stand right next to it when I'm using it. It goes from dead quiet to instant boil with the top compartment immediately fills up and if you're not right next to it to take it off the heat and open the lid, you're in for a surprise. The top blew open on ours and sprayed coffee grounds everywhere in the kitchen, and I do mean everywhere. I'm still finding coffee grounds. The best plan is to put it on a medium heat, which takes longer, and be ready to grab it the moment it starts to boil.
