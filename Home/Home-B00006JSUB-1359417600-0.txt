review/summary: Preseasoned Pan, do reasearch on Cast Iron cooking if this is your first.review/text: Its a good size preseasoned cast iron pan. It is amazing for cooking meats, and I fit about 8 Lamb Lollypops or 3 different 6 oz Filets and Sirloins on it. Cooks evenly and is great for transfering from Stove to Oven and back. Very handy for cold winters or when you don't have accesss to a grill, but not good if you have kids or kid like adults around!It is heavy however and a bit of a pain to clean. You can pour boiling water in it to clean, heat it up and spread oil around with a cloth that won't leave fibers or hand wash it with soap, but note that hand washing will remove the spice coating.Do not get this if you are a clumsy cook or have curious animal or children around as they will find a way to touch it, and because of cast irons tendency to evenly distribuit heat, they will be burned. I have come to always leave a pot holder near it or on the handle while cooking after I burned myself a few times. We get so used to the modern pans with insulated handles that going oldschool can end tragicly.Qualtiy is acceptable for the price point. Do some reasearch on cast iron cooking before buying
