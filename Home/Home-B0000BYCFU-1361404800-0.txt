review/summary: Newbie, but not for longreview/text: I purchased my Presto 23 quart pressure canner a few months ago and have been very impressed with how well it works. Having canned 75-100 jars over the past few months, mostly roasts, chili, and meat, and by simply following the directions provided, I have not had a single failure. It's easy to regulate, reliable, and very easy to become proficient with. I've actually had several friends buy these after seeing how well it worked.
