review/summary: Very powerfulreview/text: A huge difference from our last Juicer. I like the large opening, it saves me time having to cut the larger fruits and veggies. I've been using for about 2 weeks now, the high speed is great to juice leafy items like kale but once it starts filling up with pulp there's a little back blow and things can fly back up the tube. Overall, it's great because now I can juice just about anything.
