review/summary: amazed!review/text: wash the filters after every use and you wont have to buy another filter for atleast a year!I have 2 dogs, a husky and a golden, I also have a 3 y/o and a 14 y/o. This means that there is always something ground into the carpet and then covered in large fur tufts. If you get sick of clogs in your vac, and inefficient overpriced vac's then get this one. This vac has held up in these conditions for 1 year and 3 months, and yesterday it died, the motor burned out, it got a clog in the line that I didn't notice because there was lots of noise in my house covering the whining noise it makes when clogged. Clogs happen very rarely because of the great line they have from head to bagless container (the clog happened because of a small stick that got lodged which caused the hair to ball and clog). I am very sorry to see it go, and will be purchasing the same vac to replace it. It was worth the $45 I paid for it, it does an amazing job on pet hair, and crumbs. It is a bit noisy, but Im cleaning not trying to watch tv or listen to music, just trying to get it done as quickly and efficiently as possible. The onboard tools are great too, it goes under almost anything, and fits into pretty narrow spaces because it doesnt have a huge head on it. you can also clean it easily, I always emptied the container and washed it out and the filter after every use, and check the line for any clogs. its so small and compact and easy to store.
