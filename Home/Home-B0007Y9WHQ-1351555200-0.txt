review/summary: Love it, but.....review/text: This is a great little machine. Does exactly what it says it will quick and easy. Our only problem is that the end of the handle broke on the first use. Of course my husband came up with something using a wrench from his tool box. I would however like to purchase a new handle. It looks like the end of the handle justs screws in. If anyone from world cuisine is reading post please contact me so I can buy a new handle.
