review/summary: Taylor digital scalereview/text: Very consistant and easy to use. Just step on it. No waiting for zero like some other scales.I guess the rubber feet keep it from sliding, but I cant slide scale out from under wall unit. No big deal seeing that I love the scales accuracy and consitancy.
