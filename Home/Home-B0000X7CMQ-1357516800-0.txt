review/summary: A total messreview/text: I received this unit as a christmas gift, and unfortunately it was broken out of the box: Pouring any water into the unit would result in a giant leak onto the counter top. Calling Zojirushi resulted in them telling us to return the unit to Amazon for an exchange, as "A hose probably came loose in shipping or something". We received the replacement machine from amazon, and unfortunately it had the same exact problem. Perhaps it was a bad batch off the line, but in the end we decided to go with a different manufacturer. It was a bit disappointing, because we've read so many great things about this unit.
