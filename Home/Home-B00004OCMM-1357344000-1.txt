review/summary: OXI Can Openerreview/text: I have been struggling with inferior manual can openers for fifty years. The OXO is the first one that actually works like it's advertised. It is slick and easy, and it never fails to open the cans without my having to try multiple times. The issue that other reviewers have named - mainly, the fact that it doesn't cut the lid completely off sometimes - is no issue with me. In fact, I like it this way because I don't have to fish the lid out of the can. I simply give it half a twist and it pops right off. Kudos to the person who designed this terrific can opener.
