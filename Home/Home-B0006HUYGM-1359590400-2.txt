review/summary: Clean those stairs without head injury!review/text: Normally I use an upright vacuum to bash myself in the face while cleaning the stairs. I consider it punishment for not completing that Physics class. Then I realized that I don't live in North Korea and bought this thing. It gives your arm a nice workout because of it's bulk, but it does the job. But it didn't cost me $500. Looking at you, Dyson.
