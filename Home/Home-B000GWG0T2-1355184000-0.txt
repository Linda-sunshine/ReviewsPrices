review/summary: Great Non-stick Panreview/text: The non-stick surface works perfectly. The size is very useful. The handle is safe to touch. The price is right. The only reason I gave it a 4 rather than a 5 is because of aesthetics - it's not the prettiest pan you'll find. But if that's not important to you, then this is the pan for you!
