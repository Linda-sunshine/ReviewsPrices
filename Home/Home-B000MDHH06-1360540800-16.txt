review/summary: amazing juicer! great value!review/text: This is by far the most powerful machine in our kitchen! I feel like it is well-built, like a tank, and will last many years. During a juice cleanse we used it multiple times a day, and it held up perfectly. The bin fills up after two juicing sessions, enough for two or three glasses of amazing juice. Combine this with a blender and you have an entire juice bar at your fingertips! Buy one of the books coupled with this deal...it's great for variety.Pros: it almost juices anything. Seriously. So powerful and fast, it'll amaze you with the first try.Cons: clean up is a bit tedious. Emptying and cleaning the bin isn't hard, but you do have to take the machine completely apart to clear the debris. a small price to pay for epic juice.TIPS:- after veggies and fruits are juiced I put the juice into a cocktail shaker with ice to chill the drink. Pouring the juice into a glass straight from the freezer is nice too!- wash and prepare everything in advance and put into a bowl so you have everything ready to go.- cutting apples into quarters is advised, since the chute is a bit narrow for a while apple.- juicing ginger is amazing! toss a one inch cube into your juice at the end for a nice zing.- adding a little water helps smooth out the taste if it's too strong.- agave nectar or honey can ease overly tart/sour juices.happy juicing!
