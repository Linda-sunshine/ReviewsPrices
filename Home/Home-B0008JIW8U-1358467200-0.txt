review/summary: My alternative to getting a bucket of cold water thrown on my head to get my butt out of bed each morningreview/text: I used to be a morning person. Not anymore. Typically, my boyfriend has to literally drag me out of bed to get me up so I can get to work when I want to. Unfortunately, work is taking him away for 8 weeks and busy season is upon me. My solution? Mr. Coffee DRX5 4-cup Programmable Coffeemaker. Despite the fact that I already have a Keurig and a french press, I am super pleased with this purchase as it has successfully allowed me to scheme myself into once again becoming a morning person. I put it in my bedroom and the smell of coffee each morning is a much more pleasant experience for starting my day. At $25, this is a steal and I can't believe I didn't think of this sooner. Thanks, Mr. Coffee, for helping me conquer this busy season! #CPAsolutions.
