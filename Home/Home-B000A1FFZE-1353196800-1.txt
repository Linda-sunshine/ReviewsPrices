review/summary: Quite usefulreview/text: My stove's oven stopped working. So I ordered this little counter top toaster oven as an interim until I can get a new stove installed. It works fine. I toast English Muffins in the top then I put some bacon or other item on them and cover them with a slice of cheese. Then I flip the gear shift lever and put them under the broiler. The dual functions work.
