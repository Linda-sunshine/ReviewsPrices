review/summary: Good Functional Designreview/text: Impressed with the Proctor Silex hot kettle. I use mine at the sink to save energy (avoiding heating the pipes every time I need small amounts of hot water). I like the lighted on/off switch at the top - an easy one-hand flick when you grab the kettle. I like the detachable power cord and the see-trough water gauge. At first I thought the small pour-filter was cheezy but then remembered that scale builds on the heat element and flakes off so later on I will like that too. I have used a hot kettle for years (I use it in the garden to heat up fertilizer to enable better water mix and I take it to the marina to heat water to wash my boat) in many situations and I'm glad I purchased this kettle to step in as my main workhorse if my existing kettle fails. Obviously the power cord could be longer but the 1000 watt power draw maxes out the length of the cord they can provide (cord on my existing kettle is the same length). Would recommend.
