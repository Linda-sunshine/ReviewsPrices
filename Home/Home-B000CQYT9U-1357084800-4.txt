review/summary: A wonderful giftreview/text: I bought this from Amazon as a Christmas present for my cousin. She has health problems, as does her mom. She also lost her father in early 2012. This Angel of Healing brought her great comfort. I have my own collection of these Willow Tree Angels, and I know the comfort they provide. You can't go wrong with one of these Angels as a gift, especially to someone who is hurting emotionally, spiritually, and physically.
