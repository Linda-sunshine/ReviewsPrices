review/summary: Cover is deceiving... Can't choose your family or anything else in your life...review/text: The cover always kept me from reading this book. But my 7th grader came home with it, so I read it. I really enjoyed it!A friend tells me there are additional books in a series - need to check these out...It was a fast read, so it won't take too much of your time, either. ENJOY!
