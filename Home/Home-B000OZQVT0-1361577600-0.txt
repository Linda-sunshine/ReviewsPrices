review/summary: Creates a cheery, cozy fire, without the mess.review/text: I've been using Real Flame gel fuel for several years. I have never had a safety issue. It burns clean, and has a nice, crackling sound. It actually heats my townhouse a little. It has a little odor, but not bad. Amazon right now seems to have the best price (it tends to be a little expensive.) It's cold, rainy and damp here in the Northeast. I intend to light a fire tonight.
