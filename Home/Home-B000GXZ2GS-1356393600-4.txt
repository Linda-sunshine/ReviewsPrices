review/summary: Good for little cups but but too small to make a real mugreview/text: I have been drinking french press coffee in the morning for years but I would now like to reduce the sediment in it, so I have been trying different coffee making systems, only for American coffee as my Nespresso makes the best espresso. I do not like K cup coffee and filling my own pods has not been satisfactory for many reasons. This Aeropress makes a good very small cup of coffee, but I drink one 16 oz mug in the morning, and it is too small to be useful for that. I have tried making 16 oz in a french press and then filtering it again through the aeropress in stages but that is too much work because the capacity is so small. Why don't they make a size for more than one person or, at least, one man sized cup of coffee? And why only plastic? If they made a double wall insulated stainless steel version that held 20 or more ounces using the same system I would buy it, meantime I will keep using a french press and filtering it through a paper filter. And the fact they claim this makes espresso seriously lessens their credibility.
