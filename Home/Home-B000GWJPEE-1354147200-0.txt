review/summary: Bad motor = bad productreview/text: Length:: 0:41 MinsHere you will see the Crane Hello Kitty Cool Mist Humidifier acting up. Bought this in August 2011, haven't used that often, and the issue started well within a year of purchase. Something is definitely wrong with the motor they use in this particular humidifier. Seems like they do use a different/better(?) one in other characters (i.e. frog, penguin, etc) since reviews are better with those. I'm just ever more so concerned since reading a reviewer that said his humidifier caught on fire!
