review/summary: Good quality product with minor issuereview/text: Quality is great and it works perfectly. Only problem is that it doesn't have a lid for the jar that can act as a barrier between the food items getting chopped and the part in which motor is fixed. We have to wash the bulky part which has the motor and it runs the risk of motor getting wet and cant be washed in dishwasher. Whenever we chop tomatoes, the motor container needs to be washed carefully and dried before next use. It would have been convenient to have an extra lid/plate to make it perfect.
