review/summary: Great machinereview/text: I received this for Christmas since it was on my wish list. It works great!! The bread comes out big and baked to perfection. The only thing I really wish it had was a window to view the dough/bread while going thru the process. But I knew it didn't when I did research and I still wanted this one. You can peek in under the lid quickly and it all is fine. I am enjoying baking bread on a weekly basis.
