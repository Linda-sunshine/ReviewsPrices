review/summary: I use this to grind flax seed - your body can't absorb the omega 3 from the flax seed if you don't grind itreview/text: When I make a smoothie I don't have to grind the flax seed - I can put the flax seed and almond milk in my Vitamix, run it on high for 10 seconds, and the blender pulverizes them. However, once a week I grind some flax seed (which I keep in my fridge to maintain freshness) and put it in a metal container so I have it to add to oatmeal, cold cereal, etc. I use this to grind the seeds, then use a brush to clean it out, then wipe the inside with a paper towel to get the oil out before putting it away.
