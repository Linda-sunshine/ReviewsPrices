review/summary: everything I want in a mattress padreview/text: This is a great mattress pad. It fits my pillow top mattress very well. I've washed it a few times and had no problems with it shrinking. It is also easy to put on the mattress. The last mattress cover I owned would ball up so tightly after being washed that it was practically a two person job to get it back on the mattress.
