review/summary: Best Processor for the Price.review/text: I have been using this processor almost daily for about 1 month and I am very pleased. I have used it to make nut butters, mix desserts like fudge, and chop veggies. It is a small cup size, but works well if you are making a meal for a family of 4 or less.
