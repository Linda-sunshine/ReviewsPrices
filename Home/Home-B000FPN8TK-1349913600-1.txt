review/summary: The best tea infuser I have ever used!!!review/text: I grew up using the ball style tea infusers and just got used to having tea leaves in my tea. I found a wonderful loose tea on Amazon and decided that there had to be a better way to brew my loose leaf tea. The Adagio Ingenuitea Teapot is wonderful! Beyond easy to clean....fun to use....and best of all....no tea leaves in my tea!!! I am so happy with this product that I plan of purchasing several to give to my family as Christmas presents.
