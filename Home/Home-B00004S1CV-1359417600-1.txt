review/summary: Good but could be better.review/text: This tumbler is very nice for keeping your drink hot. And if you're brewing black, white, or green teas, there is no problem. Brews quickly, loose tea stays separated from the liquid, and it seals great to prevent leaks.But, the strainer is a decently large mess and any finer-sized teas (like Roobis or herbal teas) will slip right through the mesh. I do not recommend this tumbler if you're going to be using fine ground teas or coffee as the strainer is larger than most tea strainers.
