review/summary: quiet heater that warms your body rather than the airreview/text: I recommend this unit if you are looking for something to warm your toes while you are in a cold room. With settings for 800 and 400 watts of output, [both elements or just the top one], this heater can not heat the air in a large room. What it can do, is to silently and safely blast you with radiant energy, like a heat lamp.I use mine to provide comfort while I sleep in my unheated trailer in winter. I can feel it right through the blankets, and it is lovely indeed. The unit turns itself off if it falls over, and the screen does not let flammable objects close enough to the elements to ignite. Get this little heater if you are cold, and do not like loud gismos that turn on and off when they want to.
