review/summary: Markings wash off in the dishwasherreview/text: The painted markings that let you know how much you are measuring begin to disappear after a couple washings in the dishwasher. After a few more washings, the cup becomes useless for measuring. I own cheaper plastic measuring cups that have held the markings better and I will be going back to buying those in the future.
