review/summary: Mixed Reviewreview/text: Here are the pros: Strong sucking power, very lightweight, great price.Here are the cons: cleanup is very messy, cord is too short, hose is not easily removable.I use my old vacuum for hose cleaning and miss its easy cleanup. At the same time, this little guy has great sucking power and is so cheap that I don't know what I'm complaining about.
