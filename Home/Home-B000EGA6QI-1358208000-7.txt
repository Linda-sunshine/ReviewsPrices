review/summary: Plastic Stripped so Will NOT work anymorereview/text: I used this blender for 1 weekend making baby food and it crapped out. The motor is still working and the blade will still spin but where the 2 connect the plastic is stripped so will not longer work properly. I will have to toss the whole thing out as there is no fix for this. What a waste! Please save your money.
