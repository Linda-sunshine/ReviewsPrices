review/summary: Great Productreview/text: My 24 yr old daughter (5'10/140 lbs.) just moved to Brooklyn and is sleeping on a raised platform bed in her apt. She's using a futon mattress on it which doesn't add a whole lot of comfort & support, but with this foam topper and the Pinzon Overfilled Plush mattress pad, it made her bed super comfy...I know cause when I visited, I slept on it! I was very comfortable sleeping on it. The quality seems quite good and I didn't notice any kind of smell. She did not indicate about any bad smells when she received it. She said it's like sleeping on a cloud.
