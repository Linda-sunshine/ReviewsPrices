review/summary: Strong little thingreview/text: This heater is small and strong. I purchased this last winter and usually used it on the low setting. Kept me nice and toasty in the living room. I would place this heater near me while sitting on the sofa. I also used this in the bathroom for those cold winter mornings getting out of the shower ughh. I plan on buying 2 more this winter- one for my bedroom and one for my bathroom so I don't have to keep lugging this thing around from room to room lol. No, this isn't the most attractive heater BUT it saves me money so whatever!
