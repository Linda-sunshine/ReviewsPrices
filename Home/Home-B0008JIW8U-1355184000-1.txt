review/summary: No frills coffee makerreview/text: I got this coffee maker for personal use at my office. 4 cups is the perfect amount for me in the morning, so the size was right.Notes:1. The between the coffee pot/basket there is no automatically closing valve. When you fill the coffee maker, any water that inadvertently drips into the basic goes right onto the boiler plate, and then right onto your desk/counter. 99% of larger coffee makers have these valves and not having one is annoying.2. The coffee filters are not readily available at the grocer of big box retailers, so you will need to buy them from Amazon when you purchase the coffee maker.3. The coffee quality is good, not great. But in sub $50 coffee maker (that is 4 cups no less), I didn't expect miracles.Overall I am happy with this purchase and got pretty much what expected.
