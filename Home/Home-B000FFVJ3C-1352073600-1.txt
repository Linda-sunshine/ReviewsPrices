review/summary: Quick and quiet - a good buyreview/text: Bought this so I could start making dehydrated treats for myself to take to work as snacks. Have used blueberries, strawberries, mangoes, bananas, plantains, and apples - all have done great and none took more than a day to fully dehydrate with good flavor.
