review/summary: Perfect Popcornreview/text: This air popper is perfect at making popcorn a yummy, healthy snack. Very easy to clean and use. The only downsides are that there is no actual on/off switch--you plug it in and it starts, it's slightly bulky, and the popcorn does not hold salt on its own. You have to add butter or popcorn oil after popping in order for the salt to stick.
