review/summary: I never really knew brown rice...review/text: ...until I cooked it with the Zojirushi NS-LAC05XA.Rice and I have always traveled a difficult path together. Boiling over, under done, burned bottoms, need I go on? Biting the bullet and purchasing this little robot has taken me to a new rice realm which is one that I foresee myself living in happily for quite some time.Oh, what's that? Feel like a little oatmeal but are too lazy to use the saucepan? You are in luck because the Zorijushi does that as well. It comes out fluffy of all things and perfectly cooked, albeit about 40 minutes after you start it. Because of the generous amount of time needed to cook quick oats, the timer function is most convenient as it allows you to program in when your [insert grain here] finishes cooking.
