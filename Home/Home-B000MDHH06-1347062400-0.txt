review/summary: I love my Breville!review/text: This is my very first juicer, and I love it! Although there are many parts to the machine, it's easy to clean (love the brush it comes with). Make sure that when you put your veggies or fruits, that you cover it -- my niece was making fruit juice, didn't cover it, and the strawberries were shooting out! :)
