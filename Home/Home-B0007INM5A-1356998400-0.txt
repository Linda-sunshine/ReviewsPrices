review/summary: EcoPad Refillable Coffee Filter for Senseoreview/text: The EcoPad refillable coffee filter for Senseo works well. I use it in my Hamilton Beach one cup (pod) coffee maker. In order for it to fit into the pod holder, I had to clip one of the little tabs off the cap, doing so without damaging the filter area. This didn't affect the efficiency of the filter.The only drawback of using this filter is that on occasion, the water doesn't pass through the filter quickly enough dripping out the sides of the pod holder at that time. This doesn't happen every time, just with the more finely ground coffees. A medium grind works best for me.I would recommend this filter for anyone who wishes to use less expensive ground coffee or flavored coffees rather than the limited flavors, and varieties of pre-made pods.I find it a wonderful buy and will probably get more to always have a clean, dry one 'on call'.
