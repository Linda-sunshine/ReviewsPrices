review/summary: Incredibly useful, but breaks.review/text: This is my third Cuisinart SmartStick because it's a great product but it also breaks a lot. The plastic on the end that connects it to the motor can melt in the dishwasher. Just FYI. It's why I had to buy my third one. I had been washing it in the dishwasher for months and then suddenly it was too deformed to click onto the motorized part anymore.
