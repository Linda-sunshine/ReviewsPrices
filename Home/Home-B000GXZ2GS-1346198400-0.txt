review/summary: A great travel coffee makerreview/text: If you need a compact coffee maker that takes up hardly any room in your luggage this is it. Clean up is fast and easy. I had Starbucks grind me a pound and took it to Easter Island and Peru and had coffee in the room just by heating water in a microwave. If you use a quality coffee like Starbucks you'll be amazed at the results. This coffee maker along with my men's Ex Officio underwear and Fenix MC11 flashlight are my "travel friendly" finds of the year.
