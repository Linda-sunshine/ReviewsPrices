review/summary: Great Item!review/text: This is one of the best purchases I've made in the last couple of months. As an admitted latte addict, the dough I'm saving by making my own coffee (versus paying five bucks plus at the local shop) will quickly pay for this machine, the grinder I had to buy, and the rest of the setup I've put together. I've posted a pic of my rig, which includes an Allsop Monitor stand, a Capresso grinder, etc. to the product page. The notes in the pic have links to the actual products. Hopefully, that will help some folks.When I bought my unit a couple of months back, I wondered at the size of the frothing pitcher to buy. Please note that a 12 oz. size is perfect for a single large serving. Any larger and you'll struggle to get your pitcher under the machine and the frother-arm won't reach the milk.
