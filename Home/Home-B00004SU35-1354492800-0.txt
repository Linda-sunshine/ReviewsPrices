review/summary: Works Well and Easy Cleanupreview/text: This product works well and holds a good amount of popcorn, which I like as opposed to doing multiple batches. The flavor is close to movie theater, but not quite there. I am using good corn, coconut oil, flavacol seasoning, and buttery topping and have popcorn that tastes about 90% close to movie theater taste.I think to get true movie theater flavor you have to cook it in a true popcorn popper with the kettle that dumps the popcorn right after popping it. I think that on the stove you lose some flavor as the popcorn stays in the kettle and is subject to additional heat and moisture after it pops.BE CAREFUL and DO NOT leave this unattended for even a second. I added my oil and was waiting for it to get to the right temp and my sister came in the room to show me something. I turned my back on it for maybe 10 seconds and the entire pot of oil caught on fire. It gets hot super quick and if the oil is left alone it will ignite. Luckily it just discolored the pot and no harm was done.I just rinse it out with hot water after I am done using it to keep the pot seasoned. It is not dishwasher safe, but as I said I do not wash it completely.
