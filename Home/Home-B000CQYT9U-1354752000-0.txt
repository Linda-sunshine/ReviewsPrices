review/summary: Perfect Gift for the Intended Personreview/text: I purchased this as a gift for a family member who is originally from Texas and misses her native sunflowers all the time. She also loves all the Willow Tree figurines. On inspecting it, I know she will love it.There is only one detail that I think should be made note of. This is not an issue for me or the person for whom this gift is intended; however, there have been comments made in reviews on other WT figurines regarding hair color or skin tones not matching up to what is shown online. I wish for this to be a fair review for those for whom this might be an issue. On close up, the photo makes the figurine look very pale and like she has blonde hair. The figurine I received has a more tan complexion and has a soft brown color of hair.
