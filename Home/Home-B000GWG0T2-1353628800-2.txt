review/summary: Good non-stick, but warped and useless for certain cooking itemsreview/text: I purchased this pan 7 months ago. The non-stick is great and has retained its properties. However, the pan is elevated in the middle, and oil, pancake batter, liquid egg etc, run to the sides. Warping increases even when heated slowly. Had to buy a different pan for these items. I guess for the price this pan is ok, but I will not buy T-fal again when I need to replace it.Revised on 12/09/2012: I purchased a T-fal A9101562 A8481562 Specialty Nonstick 13-Inch Giant Round Pancake Griddle. It is excellent for pancakes with no warping, larger surface, much better than this pan for the purpose.
