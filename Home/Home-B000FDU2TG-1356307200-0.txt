review/summary: Great speed. Tends to &#34;walk&#34;review/text: Compared to my Oster brand blender, this is many steps up. it makes quick work of anything i throw in it. The only gripe I have is the you need to hold onto the top when it is blending in order to keep the unit still, in spite of its rubber feet. I have tried this on a wooden cutting board as well as well as my smooth granite counter top but it still wants to twist as it is operating. Given the other positive attributes to this blender, I can certainly live with this problem.
