review/summary: Great for most kinds of juicingreview/text: We have been using this juicer for a month now, and for the most part we love it. It's great for getting the max amount of juice from most fruit and vegetables. Clean up is super easy, the entire process is pretty quick. However, wouldn't recommend it if juicing leafy greens is your primary interest. we have juiced spinach a few times and it just doesn't grate it finely enough to get very much juice out of it. Other than this minor issue, would highly recommend this product.
