review/summary: Gauge issuesreview/text: Well, I thought I had done research, but I guess not enough. I just actually read ALL the reviews instead of just a sampling, and lots of people have the same issue. Steam leaks out where the pressure gauge is attached, and fogs up the dial to the point it can't be read. I've adjusted the tension several times, and oiled the rubber gasket... same result. After being on hold for 20 minutes with customer service, the VERY RUDE rep agreed to send me a new gauge. But from the other reviews, it sounds like I will have the same issue when the new one gets here. My engineer husband says it's a design flaw with the white gasket...it should be a tighter fit, and the pressure gauge should be sealed so steam can't get in anyway. I haven't decided if I'll be keeping it. But I'm super frustrated that this is a well documented issue, as is the rude people at customer service, and Presto hasn't bothered to fix either. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it held pressure and didn't blow the dial off like some of the other posters described. I guess you get what you pay for.
