review/summary: The best iron for the pricereview/text: I decided to get this iron based on customer reviews after ordering and returning the T-fal FV4476003 Ultraglide iron. I hadn't gotten a new iron in years and after getting into garment making decided to make an investment. The T-Fal was a huge disappointment from the first try, it spit and leaked all over. The directions for the T-Fal are all in pictures (no words) so I couldn't even figure out if I was doing anything wrong. I returned it immediately, and decided to give this Black and Decker iron a try based on all of the reviews for it. Happy, this has directions in English, which specifically state to NOT use softened water, which we have in our house, so I bought a gallon of spring water for it. This may have been the problem with the T-Fal iron but given the vague manual there was no way to tell. Anyway, I've been using this iron for about a week I couldn't be happier. It has great steam both horizontally and vertically, and is very smooth to use. It's a little heavier than the T-Fal, but that's OK I don't have to press as hard, plus I didn't really like the soleplate on the TFal. Don't know where I'll be with it in 6 months, but right now I recommend this iron.
