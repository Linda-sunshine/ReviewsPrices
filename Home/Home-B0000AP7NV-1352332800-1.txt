review/summary: As good as bottled water if not betterreview/text: Just got pitcher today, make sure read instructions before using, some helful tips. So far I like it, it doesn't take up too much room in my refrigerator, the water seems to taste okay. After reading online, filtering tap water is just as good as buying bottled water(80% of bottled water comes from local water sources that supply water to our homes). Can get more info online about health rosk of bottled water and figure out which way may be the best water source. I calculated how much water was costing me at the store per month since I didn't want to drink tap water at home, however after finding out the water was coming out of taps somewhere else, made me decide to get a Brita water filter. I didn't choose to get one of my faucet, didn't want to replace the filter more often for water I wasn't drinking. This size is the right size, can hold with one hand and pour into my water jug or coffee maker in the morning. I also calculated how many gallons of water each filter will last and how many gallons I use per month, since I'm the only person drinking from the container I won't have to replace the filter as soon as it suggest(says every 2 months, where I can go longer before replacing - saving even more money). Definately don't want to drink water with a fully contaminated filter, that will defeat the the purpose of filtering the water! The price is reasonable for what it does, I passed it up in the store many times because didn't want to spend the money, however realized I was spending even more on bottled water(I was even buying the gallon jugs which was cheaper than indivdual bottle packs).
