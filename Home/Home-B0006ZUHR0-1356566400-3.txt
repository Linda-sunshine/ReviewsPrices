review/summary: A great deal!review/text: Our $100 super name brand iron lasted about 1 year and had to be trashed. We bought this one and expected not a whole lot. Its low price was a decision factor this time. If this new one should last only a year, at least we did not a great job. It is lightweight, and lacks none of the features we had on the $100 one. Wait for my update in about a year!
