review/summary: Wow.review/text: I can't say enough about this trash can. I kept waiting to write the review until the fist set of batteries ran out since there were complaints of battery life. I ordered this in December of 2010 and now in the middle of Nov 2012 I am finally replacing the batteries. Almost 2 years of opening and closing this trash can. Keep in mind that in that time we have a family of four and a now 2 year old which equals lots of trips for dirty diapers to the trash can. Even with all that the unit is working great and as a bonus it keeps the smell hidden from what is in those dirty diapers.
