review/summary: Okay pot except for unforgivable design defectreview/text: It looks like everyone has trouble with the knobs on these, so much so that an aftermarket replacement knob is a recommended add-on. Given the long history of this type of brewer, this design defect really isn't forgivable. It's still a usable pot, but I had to de-merit it 2 stars. =( Farberware's product support isn't really helpful either.
