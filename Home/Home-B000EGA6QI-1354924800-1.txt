review/summary: Good Value & Ergonomic Design.review/text: This seems to be a well-made and very easy to use blender. I needed it for pureeing hot soups that were far to messy and slightly dangerous to be doing in the regular blender.First, it looks great and feels solid. When I wrap my hand around it and press the button, it feels just right. I like the ergonomics of the thing. It blends well....I have made a few soups and homemade whipped cream with it. The blade attachment comes off very easily, and is also easy to clean. The only thing I would want that this doesn't have is variable speeds, but this is just quibbling. For what I spent, I am very happy with it.
