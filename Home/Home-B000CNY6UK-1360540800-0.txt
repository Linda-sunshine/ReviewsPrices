review/summary: Love it!review/text: This espresso maker makes better coffee than the electrical capuchino maker I had.It is easy to maintain, easy to clean, and I am absolutely addicted to the coffee it makes. I also bought a milk frother and make much better tasting capuchinos than those of the Starbucks, at a much lower price!
