review/summary: Hard workerreview/text: Received this as a gift a year ago now, still works great ! We use it for everything from gravy to smoothies ! Chops ice, whips cream it gets a lot of use and abuse in our kitchen (Use from me.. abuse from my girls) and the motor is as good today as the day I received it! I was worried about the latch that allows you to take the blender part off of the handle but still have not had any problems with it at all. It is easy to clean, Easy to store and easy to use.
