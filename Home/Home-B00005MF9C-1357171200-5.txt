review/summary: Makes Coffee, BUT... BUT... The Mug Is Useless!review/text: I realize I purchased a cheap item. BUT... I didn't buy it for the coffee maker aspect, but rather the unique mug that's included. I've already 2 of these and only bought this one because I wanted another identical mug. The coffee maker is still in its original box... I don't need it. However, the mug being my reason for buying this since I can't find another like it to fit under my k-cup brewer... IT SUCKS! The lid is loose fitting making it a dripping nightmare on my way to the office in the morning. It's too late I think for me to return this so my option is to consider my money flushed down the proverbial toilet and throw the whole mess in the dumpster. If you want a useable, dripless mug... DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!
