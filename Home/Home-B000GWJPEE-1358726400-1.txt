review/summary: Great Humidifier for Kids' Roomsreview/text: We have the frog and the penguin. They are both several years old. They work fantastically. Both are quiet and put out great moisture.The humidifiers are set on TV tables in each kid's room. They take up minimal space.Con: the Penguin is a bit more of a challenge. The handle is on the narrow top portion of the tank. Ours broke off. It's best to maneuver this tank without the handle. It's possible and easier. The tank actually cracked & broke because of the handle and Crane replaced it for us! No problems since we simply removed the handle.We use the Crane Demineralization Filter Cartridges. They need to be replaced monthly (or so).
