review/summary: Solid Thermometerreview/text: The probe wire does not look like the one pictured above. Instead, it is a gray silicone coated wire. There are some good and bad parts to this change. On the down side the probe and wire are only rated to 392 degrees Fahrenheit. That means the maximum temperature your OVEN can be set to, not the temperature of the food. If you have your oven set to 400 degrees then do not insert this thermometer, you will ruin it! The benefit of the silicone probe is that it is water tight. The curved design of the probe also holds the silicone/wire connection away from the steam, further improving the reliability of the unit over a pot of steaming water. As someone who brews beer this is a huge plus; if you are a home brewer I would highly recommend this thermometer. The silicone also means you can wash it after sticking it in your pot roast without worry. There is also an on/off switch on the underside of the unit, I'm not sure what the reviews claiming there isn't one are talking about.I have lost probe thermometers due to the metal probe wire coverings being shoddy. They allow water in which destroys the sensors, and they allow the probe to spin on the wires and break the connection. I will take the trade off of not being able to use it above 392 degrees for a unit that lasts through normal use. I will update this review if my sensor over malfunctions.Pros:Solidly builtAllows for calibration of sensor (in ice water)Seems very accurate right out of the boxCons:Only rated to 392 degrees FahrenheitNo separate sensor for "oven temp"
