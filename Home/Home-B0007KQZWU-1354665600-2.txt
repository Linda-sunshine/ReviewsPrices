review/summary: Starter induction setreview/text: I read many Amazon reviews for induction capable cookware and settled on this set. Most of my older pans were Cuisinart classic stainless and would not work on my new stove.First impressions: Set appears to be solidly constructed and substantial. They look good hanging in my kitchen. The set has two smallish saute pans, so plan on purchasing an additional 12" skillet.Cuisinart MCP22-30H MultiClad Pro Stainless 12-Inch Skillet with HelperI also purchased a 16 quart stockpotNew Professional Commercial Grade 16 QT (Quart) Heavy Gauge Stainless Steel Stock Pot, 3-Ply Clad Base, Induction Ready, With Lid Cover NSF Certified Itemto complete the set. It also comes with a rather useless steamer insert and would be better off with a pasta strainer.Cooking: Some reviewers complained about food sticking. All I can say is it's not the pan's fault. I made chicken franchise (Basically cutlets with an egg batter) and was able to wipe the pan clean with a paper towel. This was after many temperature changes trying to learn how to use the new cooktop.Cleaning: Stainless needs to be chemically cleaned to restore the "like new" appearance. If you are going to keep your pans in a cabinet, don't bother. If you have them out like I do, spray with a little calcium and lime remover, wipe and rinse.I gave this set four stars because it lacked a 12" skillet, not because of quality.
