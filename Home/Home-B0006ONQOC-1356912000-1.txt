review/summary: Simple Enoughreview/text: I love ice cream, and decided I'd like to try a countertop machine so I could make any flavor I want, any time I want. Once I found a good vanilla recipe, there was no stopping me. Now I can make many different flavor variations using the same base recipe.I do agree that the consistency is more like soft serve ice cream when it is first done, but that's the same consistency I got from my 'rock salt' churner (which required a lot more effort). Once I take the soft ice cream and put it in the freezer for a bit, the consistency is just like store-bought cartons, but much tastier. If you are expecting a 'hard' ice cream from a countertop machine of this type, then you will be disappointed. But if you understand the usage and limitations of this setup, you'll be in ice cream nirvana.I'm not sure how this machine is going to fit in with my typical "lose weight" New Years resolution, but I'll figure out a way to work around that!
