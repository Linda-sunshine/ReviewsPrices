review/summary: New ownerreview/text: I haven't had this glider too long (in fact, I just assembled it today), but I wasn't too impressed by the sturdiness of it. I'm hoping that it can hold up to the test of time. I was also a bit put off as the arms didn't line up too well with the base bolt holes and the back bolt holes at the same time (noticeable when installing second arm). More than once while tightening bolts I would suddenly hear wood fracture when I wasn't even muscling down on it.It looks nice, though, and is very comfortable. The wife loves it.
