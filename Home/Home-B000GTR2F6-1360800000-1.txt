review/summary: Bitter Coffeereview/text: I bought this from Costco and love the concept. It is neat and clean and quick along with being attractive on the counter. After trying many different coffee pods including using my own coffee with a reusable filter I eventually gave up and went back to making coffee with a drip cone. No matter which coffee I tried they were all bitter. Some were just horrible tasting. Hopefully in time Keurig will address this problem.
