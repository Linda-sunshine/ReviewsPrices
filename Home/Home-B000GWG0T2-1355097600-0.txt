review/summary: Good Panreview/text: I have used various t-fal products for years and have always been impressed with the non-stick qualities, this pan is no exception. In addition, this being the professional series the handle grips well and are riveted so they don't wiggle like some some t-fal pans that you have to tighten up about twice a year. They also have a good feel and durable design. I read several ratings saying that this brand didn't work with certain induction cooktops; well I have a NuWave iduction cooktop and the entire set works with them.Other raters say this pan has a slight upward bow in the middle that causes oil/liquid to pool to the outer edges (they are correct). I have a simple fix for this.1. Place the cool un-used pan on a couch cushion or any similiar surface that will give.2. Place the heel of your palm directly in the middle of the pan, apply downward pressure.3. Enjoy.It lost a star only due to the upward bow other than that this pan is perfect.
