review/summary: Wonderful Juicerreview/text: I did a lot of research before purchasing this Juicer as I was looking for something that was easy to use, easy to clean, and also small and compact to fit in my way to small kitchen. The Compact Juice Fountain by Breville was the answer. Now I am juicing at least twice a day, whereas with my old Hamilton Beach Juicer I rarely ever juiced because it was such a pain to take apart and clean, then reassemble. Plus, I get a lot more juice out of the vegetables and fruit than I used to.Thank You Breville
