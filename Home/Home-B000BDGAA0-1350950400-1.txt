review/summary: FIRM pillow.review/text: I was sick and tired of my head depressing pillows so far that the pillow covered my nose. I developed the habit of sleeping on my hand in order to not block my nose with my pillow. THIS PILLOW SOLVES THAT PROBLEM!! No more nose tickling nor blocking with this pillow. Another reviewer compared it to "sleeping on a bag of cement". Well, it isn't quite THAT firm, but it is the firmest pillow that I've ever had, by far. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is just a little too firm. But I'd rather have that little bit of extra firmness than another too soft pillow. A soft pillow on top of this one (to reduce the firmness) puts my head too high unless (or until) I find a thinner soft pillow to put over this one.
