review/summary: Not for side sleepers & way to firm.review/text: I purchased this pillow because I like micro beads & the way that they feel in silly looking children's micro pillows that you find in stores for kids. Therefore, I purchased this thinking that it would be comfortable for me to put my head on at night & sleep with.Turns out that after about 40 minutes of trying to get my head & neck comfortable with this new pillow here, I could not especially when I tried to sleep on my side with it seeing as I am a side sleeper. I got up finally & dug out my old existing water pillow from a closet because I knew that I was not going to be able to fall asleep & sleep well with this pillow. I has way to many micro beads stuffed into it for medium to soft comfort & support making it very firm & uncomfortable on the neck. It reminds me of a boxing/punching pillow instead of a sleeping pillow. Allot less micro beads would have helped make this pillow more comfortable & more like what I was expecting this pillow was going to be that it is not as it turned out. I am currently using it as a knee & leg dividing pillow for when I am sleeping on my side at night to try to at least use it for some sort of purpose.I would not recommend this pillow to a friend or family member.
