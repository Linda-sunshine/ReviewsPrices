review/summary: Good toaster for the price!review/text: For the price, this is a good toaster/mini oven. It looks good, is light and slim, which I like, although it's slimness does mean it doesn't fit as much in the oven as the dinosaur it replaced. It also tends to cook a bit faster, even at low temps, so if you are used to a bigger oven, beware. It toasts fine. The only drawback so far is getting the crumb tray out-the door angle is awkward, so it takes a little finagling.
