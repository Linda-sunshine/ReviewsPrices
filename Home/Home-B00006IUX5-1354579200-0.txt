review/summary: Not the best grinderreview/text: I got this grinder considering the low price but should have spent a couple of dollars more and gotten the other brands.My previous grinder would grind flax seeds and 6 almonds in a 5 sec pulse. With this one I have to pulse for about 30 to 45 seconds to do the same and yet 2-3 of the almonds are not crushed at all. It seems like this grinder has a very weak motor.Am very disappointed with this product and would not recommend this to anyone - not worth spending the money.
