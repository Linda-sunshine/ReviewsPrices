review/summary: great kitchen toolreview/text: How did I ever live without this handy kitchen tool? I've even used this for smoothies with frozen fruits. The blade is really sharp so be careful when washing - it is hard to wash the underside of the blade without slicing a finger (turning it on in a sink full of soapy water to remove peanut butter residue didn't work). The motor can actually get pretty hot when blending a big pot of soup.
