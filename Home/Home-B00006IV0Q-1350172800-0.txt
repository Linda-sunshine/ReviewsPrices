review/summary: A helpful hint...review/text: A helpful hint that I do not think anyone else has mentioned here. I know this does not sound too effective but there is a trick to getting the coffee right and its not necessarily going with a bigger grind.DO NOT LEVEL OFF THE COFFEE IN THE BASKET BUT INSTEAD KEEP IT OFF TO ONE SIDE.I know it doesn't sound like a big deal but I am sure that you will be surprised how much stronger your coffee is.*I might add that I've owned this for something like two years and I use it everyday, all day long- I hang a tea "egg" in it after my 12 cups of morning coffee (really strong tea that way).
