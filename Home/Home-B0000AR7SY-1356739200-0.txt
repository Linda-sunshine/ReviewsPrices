review/summary: After 2 years, I'm still entirely happy with this excellent grinderreview/text: I bought this from Amazon in January of 2011, and I've used it almost every day since then. It is a very high quality product and it is working as well today as it was out of the box.First off, if you have only used spin grinders (the little ones with blades that grind the coffee to chunks and dust), you're in for a happy surprise: this grinder grinds the coffee to the size you set - no chunks and no dust. This gives you noticeably better coffee - more taste without the bitterness.This grinder adjusts easily from fine grind to coarse grind - I use a pretty fine setting for my Capresso drip coffee maker, and a coarser setting for my espresso machine. it is nice to be able to control the grind exactly. Also, I don't leave beans in it (although you can if you prefer - it has a lid) - I measure out what I want and grind only the right amount. It also comes apart easily for cleaning.Finallly, the motor is geared so that the grinder spins relatively slowly - you can stick your finger in the coffee when it is done and tell that it hasn't heated the grounds up in the process.If you like good coffee, you can't go wrong with this grinder.
