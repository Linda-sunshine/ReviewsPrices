review/summary: Eh, it could be better, but for $56 I bought it.review/text: I almost wanted to return this thing back, but I figure that for $56 and being on a budget, that I may as well keep it.All the attachments are very cheaply made. You'll have a better time cleaning with the other attachments than the main vacuum piece.I did want a bag canister. I don't like the bagless ones, so that was a factor in me buying this one. The bag is easy to change, though. One other reason I decided to keep this.I would suggest spending an extra $20 dollars and getting a better hardwood floor vacuum.
