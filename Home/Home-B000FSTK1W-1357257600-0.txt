review/summary: LOVE IT. its soooo worth the money!review/text: I use Aussie and I buy the large size. This caddy fits them perfectly with a bar of soap. I used to have a small suction cup caddy for soap then put my shampoo bottles on the floor because the holder would always come crashing down. This is the best thing ever. Very secure and sturdy.My shampoo has a pump on it and i press down on the shampoo IN THE RACK and havent had a problem.
