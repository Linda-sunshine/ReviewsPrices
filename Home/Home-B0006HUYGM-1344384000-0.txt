review/summary: Everything as expected!review/text: This Eureka Hand-Held vacuum lived up to its reputation. I would recommend it to anyone with an animal hair problem around the house. It is great for lifting my dog's hair off the carpet, rugs, and sofa. I thought it would be cheaply made; however I was truly surprised by the suction power and the cleaning results.
