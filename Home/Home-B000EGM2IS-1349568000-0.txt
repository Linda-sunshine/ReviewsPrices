review/summary: Great for Elderly!review/text: This item is a staple in my house. My 91 year old Dad can still feel independent using this item to heat his water for coffee or tea. No boiling water on the stove in a kettle. NO stove at all! Easy to use, he uses it safely. Not everyone's elder is the same, but for some this is an independence uplift!
