review/summary: Old Faithful!review/text: This machine has done much good for my carpets! I think my problem now is not the machine, it is me. I have slacked on cleaning my carpets, and also keeping the machine clean as well. Cleaning carpets is labor intensive! From pre-vacuuming, cleaning with the machine, to cleaning the actual machine! SO now my carpet is past the point of return. The machine still works wonders. It will not make your carpet perfect (especially if you have light tan colored carpet like mine) but it will clean the top layer and make it look fresh for a couple of weeks! If anyone finds a cleaner that will make your carpet like new- please- let us all know!
