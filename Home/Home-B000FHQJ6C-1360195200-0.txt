review/summary: Nice Juicer, But.......review/text: This really is a nice, heavy , well built juicer. However, it's really a nightmare to clean (the screen is really difficult to clean). It does remove all the pulp, so if you want pulp in your juice, this one is not for you.I used it a few times and put it in the garage in it's box. I'll sell it at a yard sale. I'm buying a Vitamix.
