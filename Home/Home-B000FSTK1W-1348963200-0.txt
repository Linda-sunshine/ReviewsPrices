review/summary: Exactly what I Neededreview/text: Bought this about 5 months ago and hung it in the shower right away. It is exactly what I needed and more spacious than I expected. It holds my regular size shampoo and conditioner bottles, body wash, and shave gel. I really like the clever little razor holder/double hook that can be placed on either side. The caddy will also hold the mega bottles of shampoo and conditioner, one on each side, but not much else if you go that route. It certainly bears the weight of all of my stuff, no problem. My only suggestion to 3M would be to include two of the little razor holder/double hook things, one for each side. Otherwise perfection, easy to hang, sturdy, easily detaches from mounting bracket to clean.
