review/summary: Used it for 7 brews, so far so good.review/text: It is an exquisite brewer. The capacity of the travel mug is 15 ounces, so it is almost a &#34;grande&#34; size, according to Starbucks' standard.Usually, the amount of coffee powder to be used depends on the coffee. I use the &#34;blonde roast&#34; from Starbucks for brewing and usually 2.5 to 3 teaspoons brews a rather crisp coffee. The filter is a cone filter and a medium to coarse grind will work well. All in all it is extremely easy to use and brews a cup of coffee in less than a minute or two.
