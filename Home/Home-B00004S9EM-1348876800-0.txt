review/summary: This was smaller than hoped for.review/text: I ordered this food processor to replace a DCL 7 that I had purchased about 25 years ago, which was rated as a 7 cup model. When I received this, it was half the size. Turns out I needed the 14 cup food processor. I returned this one and ordered the 14 cup model, which worked out great. All the accessories for the DLC 7 fit the 14 cup food processor. The DLC 7 still worked great, but the cover was getting very hard to lock into position. Needed to be muscled into position to make it run. Really like the new cover design. Amazon was great about returning the 7 cup model. Very happy.
