review/summary: Awesome Steamer!review/text: The SteamFast SF-407 was perfect in every way for getting all of our wedding apparel and the bridesmaid dresses ready for my daughter's wedding. The water tank is large, the hose is long, it heats up quickly and the head with brush or without works beautifully. Another reviewer's comment about steaming from underneath the bridesmaid dresses in long sweeping strokes gave me just the right technique to use. I highly recommend this steamer for everything from a linen suit that needs a freshening up to a bridesmaid dress.
