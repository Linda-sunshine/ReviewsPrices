review/summary: I LOVE LOVE LOVE this juicer!review/text: This is the most amazing juicer I have ever used. I have become a fearless juicer with this guy at my side. The motor is durable, the blades are sharp yet safe to the touch, the pieces separate with ease, clean-up is quick, and the digital reader and rotating dial assist in choosing the right speed like a dream! It turns out that making fresh raw juice is a cinch because of this appliance! I've been juicing in lieu of diner approximately 4 nights a week and the weight has fallen off of me and I have never felt better. Buy this juicer!
