review/summary: Works with induction cooktops.review/text: One of the few (maybe the only) stainless steel pressure cookers made with the 18/0 stainless steel that is necessary for induction cooktops. A fine pressure cooker at a very reasonable price. Pressure cookers excel at certain tasks like stews, stocks, sauces, chili- anything where you are infusing liquid with flavors.
