review/summary: Definitely NOT Le Creuset on a budgetreview/text: I purchased this dutch oven specifically to make no-knead bread. I have a Le Creuset 3 1/2 quart dutch oven, which I have used for almost 20 years. However, the recipe for the bread calls for a 5-6 quart oven, and not wanting to spend a small fortune, I opted for the Lodge. Boy, that was a mistake. I just unpacked it, and as one reviewer noted, there are three raised areas on the lid which don't allow it to seat properly on the pot, and in my opinion that pretty much renders this pot useless. I was hoping that was an anamoly, but apparently not. What good is a dutch oven that doesn't have a tight fitting lid, might as well use a roasting pan. It's going back. The best thing I can say is that it did have a nice color and weight to it. But they really need to fix that problem with the lid. That old adage really does apply - "you get what you pay for". Guess I'll start saving my pennies for a new Le Creuset.
