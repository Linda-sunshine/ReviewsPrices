review/summary: Close your eyes and point to a numberreview/text: So, I followed the instructions, weighed myself the first few times on this scale in the course of....5 minutes. My weight miraculously changed from 137 lbs to 152 lbs and all readings in between- on as flat, stable surface you can find. Accuracy to 0.2 lbs this scale says? I don't think so. Tried it on a different, flat, stable surface. 137 lbs to 148 lbs. Seriously?
