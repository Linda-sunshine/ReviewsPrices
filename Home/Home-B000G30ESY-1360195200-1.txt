review/summary: Does The Jobreview/text: I've actually owned rice cookers since the late 1970's (when you live in Hawaii you eat a lot of rice). This is the best, most versatile cooker I have ever had. Perfect rice every time. I just wish the darned thing would tell me HOW LONG IT&#34;S GONNA TAKE. It makes it difficult to plan when to start cooking the rest of the meal when I don't know how long my rice is going to be cooking. Haven't tried it for anything else but I'm going to buy some quinoa and try cooking that in it for brekkie tomorrow.
