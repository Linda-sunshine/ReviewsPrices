review/summary: OMG I love this!review/text: the rating 5/5 why because this thing rocks i been using it everyday for one year now...pro's- if you can juice it, it will juice for you. its a good starter juicer for people that are getting in to juicing them selfs..con's- cleaning it but you have to baby those blades tho at least i do. then holding tank for the dry leafs that you juiced somewhat sucks doesn't hold much so you have to clean it out if you're making a lot of juice.but other then that its great its not running slow or anything.keep juicing my friends and be healthy
