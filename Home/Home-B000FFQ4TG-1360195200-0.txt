review/summary: After 10 years-just purchased our 2nd Bunnreview/text: Our first Bunn Coffee Maker lasted 10 years, we loved it. It stopped heating earlier this week so we went out and purchased a new one. Works as good as the last one, however one BIG problem, I am not sure what they did to the coffee decanter itself to redesign, or why or if they don't have quality control--but every time we pour coffee it leaks all over. Not happy about this at all--good thing we have our old Bunn Decanter, we will be using that.
