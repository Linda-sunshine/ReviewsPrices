review/summary: Brews a GOOD cup of coffee.review/text: There are times we need a whole pot of coffee, and times we just need a 15 ounce cup. This actually tastes better than our Mr. Coffee machine. While the permanent filter would be great, I have a septic tank and grounds are a BIG no no down the drain. Even banging the filter on the trash and then rinsing still puts some grounds down the drain. SO. . . the Mellita (sold here or in grocery stores) or the &#34;world market&#34; (Target) filter #2 is perfect. #1 is a little too small and grounds splash up the sides. With #2, remove the permanent filter, on the side seam just fold over about 1/4&#34; open and put in the basket holder. It is high enough to catch everything going up the sides and give you a bit of a tab to aid removal to the trash. The only thing with this model is the cup IS 15 ounces but is shorter. Your average tall to-go mug doesn't quite fit,only the shorter ones or a traditional coffee cup or a disposable 12-15 ounce one. In any case, this is a really good coffee maker. I even threw a couple tea bags in the permanent filterand made hot tea with it and that worked great too.
