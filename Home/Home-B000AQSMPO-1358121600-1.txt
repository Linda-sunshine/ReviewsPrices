review/summary: Phenomenal - Changed the way I enjoy coffeereview/text: It's quick. I don't think there would be a faster way to have a cup of coffee unless the pot was sitting there ready and full of coffee. Yes, it requires about 15 seconds between cups to refill its reservoir and to heat the water, no it's not a big deal. Yes, if you turn the machine on, it needs to heat the water (fairly quickly, actually) before it can make you a cup of coffee.I found it much easier to leave the water reservoir in place and just top off the water with a pitcher or cup instead of taking it out and putting it back in... seemed like too much of a hassle.I have 14 oz coffee mugs at home, I simply press the 6 oz cup and then the 8 oz cup, using the same K cup for both. The coffee is not too weak for me and my cup is still ready in record time. I do the same thing with my travel mug every morning. What IS a bit confusing (but also incredibly helpful first thing in the morning when you're not quite awake) is that you MUST open the k cup area before it will make you coffee. At first I found this incredibly annoying (remember, I'm using the same K cup twice) but after the number of times it has saved my butt because I wasn't quite awake enough to put a fresh one in... I like this feature.All in all, a phenomenal system, which I love.
