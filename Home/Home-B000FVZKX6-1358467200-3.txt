review/summary: Nice soft sheets that smell like oilreview/text: Nice soft flannel sheets that out of the plastic wrap smelled like oil. I washed them six times, left them outside on a line for three days in the wind and sun and still they smelled like oil. So i can't recommend unless you enjoy the smell of oil.
