review/summary: Highly rated by my cat!review/text: I actually purchased this heater because my cat likes to sit in front of it on cold nights. This is not a high wattage heater, which is one of the things I like about it. Wattage options are 400 and 800. Radiant heaters are good at warming the object (person or cat) sitting in front of it, but they do not heat a room. Ironically, I purchased this heater after I read that it was rated unacceptable by Consumer Reports. I believe they stated something to the fact that it would start cloth on fire if it had direct contact with the heater. Apparently, you should now be able to lay combustible material against an electric heater without adverse consequences so if you are inclined to do this, do not purchase this heater! But if you are a freer spirit and don't feel that you should constantly be protected from yourself, I highly recommend this unit.
