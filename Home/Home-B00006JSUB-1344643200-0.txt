review/summary: Great if taken care with lovereview/text: This cast iron skillet is really nice if you take care of it. If you are not careful it can turn on you.I would recommend taking off the pre-seasoning and re-seasoning the skillet yourself. You will get a much better season.Wash with hot water and a scrubber or with hot oil and salt. Never use soap and never leave water sitting in it for long. Always dry after using. If you are not careful your non-stick seasoning can get removed and you will end up with a ruined meal.I have had a good number of times where I did a poor job cleaning it the time before and then my eggs will stick the next time. It makes me a bit hesitant with really sticky foods, like eggs.Get into a good habit of taking care of your skillet and it will serve you well.
