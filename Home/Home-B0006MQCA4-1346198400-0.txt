review/summary: perfect for mereview/text: I really love the handiness of this water filter. Not only can it hold a LOT of water, but you don't have to wait for it to filter out before you flip the switch to get some. And you don't have to pick up the whole thing to get some either. All parts are sturdy, especially the dispenser.
