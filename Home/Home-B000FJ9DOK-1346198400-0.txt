review/summary: 5 years and still works great!!review/text: We purchased 7 of these and they have been awesome! They keep drinks cold for hours and the ice is slow to melt (12 hrs later and still have some ice left sometimes). After close to 5 years, I finally just threw one out because it was condensating on the outside. The kids have been taking them to school and sports practices every day. They don't condensate on the desks which they love. They have gotten knocked off desks with only a minor dent. We have replaced 2 of the gaskets in 5 years and only one lid due to getting dropped. With care while drinking, we even put hot cocoa in them. (NOT RECOMMENDED FOR YOUNG ONES DUE TO BURNS!!).
