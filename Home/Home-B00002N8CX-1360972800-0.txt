review/summary: Mighty Mitereview/text: It is light weight, and that's what I wanted, but everything gets caught in the small hose, then the motor strains and gets quite hot.Also it is terrible on rugs. It was so highly recommended to me but wished I had done more research. Have to keep my old heavy klunker because it really cleans my rugs
