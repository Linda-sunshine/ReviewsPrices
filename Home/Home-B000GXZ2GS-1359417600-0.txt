review/summary: This has changed my coffee lifereview/text: I used the good old Mr. Coffee for a long time after weaning off of coffee-chain coffee because of the expense. I was pleased with my daily 2 cups from the Mr Coffee until I found this. Now, poor Mr. Coffee sits dejected on the kitchen floor, facing the wall, waiting to enter exile in the garage. The coffee the Aeropress makes is fantastic. When done right, there is no bitterness, and a whole lot of new flavors, aromas, and textures I had never experienced with coffee before. I prefer to use the Lavazza espresso grind (in the black can) but I enjoy experimenting with the ethnic coffees at the supermarket. I used to get out of bed just to turn off the old automatic machine and pour myself a cup. Now, I wake up tingling with excitement about my morning cup. I get a rich, creamy &#34;shot&#34; of concentrated coffee (not true espresso, because of the lack of 9psi pressure) that tastes like vanilla and is just amazing. 6/5 stars.
