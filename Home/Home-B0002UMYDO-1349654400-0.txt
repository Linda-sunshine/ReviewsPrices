review/summary: Inferior can openerreview/text: This can opener worked fairly well for a few months but would occasionally stick when it didn't grab the can. Usually I could pry it back into place and then try to get it to grab the can again. Tonite, I couldn't pry it back and now it's stuck in the down position, lever pushed down as if trying to open a can and cannot lift back into place. I would return it but the return window has expired. I would not buy another one.
