review/summary: Works Better than I Expectedreview/text: This is very simple to use and uncorks a bottle of wine with very little effort. It was a very good value on Amazon. I don't expect that it will last forever, as the integrated batteries for this sort of thing tend to wear out over time. At this price, I'm not worried about that. It is nice looking and very functional.
