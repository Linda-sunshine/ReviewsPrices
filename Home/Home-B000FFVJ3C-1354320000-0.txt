review/summary: NESCO Dehydratorreview/text: Product arrived on time as promised. I love it! Bought it specifically for making Venison Jerky. It works wonderfully. I use ground venison and ground beef at a 50% - 50% mix. At four hours of drying time I turn the strips of jerky over and shuffle the racks. I then dry for another 4 hours for a total of 8 hours. You may want to vary your time(s) based on personal texture preference. I would recommend this product to others as a good value and a very effective dehydrator.
