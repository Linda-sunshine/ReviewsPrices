review/summary: BEST LITTLE COFFEE MAKER IN.....review/text: Absolutely perfect for me. More than enough coffee for the morning start. I fooled a little with the amount of coffee vs. water a few times to get it exactly perfect for my taste. This little unit is FAST, haven't noticed any overly &#34;noisy&#34; sounds from the brewing either for those of you interested in using it as a cubicle coffee maker.Didn't think I would use the cup provided because I don't travel, but it has turned out that it feels so good in the hand that I'm using it and washing it every day instead of a regular cup. The BIG plus is that this cup KEEPS the coffee warm while I peruse the internet reading the &#34;paper&#34; while drinking my coffee. An unexpected benefit that I'm loving.If I were to have a criticism, it would be that the fill line on the inside is virtually invisible; however, just adjust the lighting to where you can see it the first time and then measure the amount of water in something else and pour it in. Solved.I absolutely LOVE this product and would recommend it highly. It produces more coffee than I drink in the mornings, so I have gotten the water vs. coffee measured to my standards and now even save wasting coffee grounds!Try it - you'll LOVE IT!
