review/summary: Leaks from the bottom of the handlereview/text: I was happy that the entire vessel is stainless steel, hoping that plastic parts wouldn't crack with the heat. But, there is one hole near the bottom of the handle for the temperature sensor, I think. It leaked the first time I filled it with water.
