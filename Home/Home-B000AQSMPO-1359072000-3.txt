review/summary: Best single-serve coffee makerreview/text: I got this unit as a gift in December 2011 and I've had no issues whatsoever. Our home has a well for water and our water is very hard, so I use only store-bought distilled water in the machine. It's a bit more expensive, but there are no "added flavors" from the water (chlorine, minerals) and I don't need to use water filters.I enjoy this single-serve unit because I am the only coffee drinker in the family. I've tried the "pod" brewers before this, but - like the Keurig - buying pods (or k-cups) is a relatively expensive proposition. I use the ekobrew cups (Ekobrew - Reusable K-Cup Coffee Filter for Keurig Single Cup Brewers - 1 Filter(s)) so I can use my own ground coffee ... perfect!My only complaints are that:1) because I usually have a BIG mug of coffee (12 oz), even the "large" cup is too small, so I push the small button twice (or the medium then small buttons, depending on the mug size).2) the coffee is not quite as hot as I'd like it, so I will often put the cup in my microwave oven for 30 seconds or so after brewing.
