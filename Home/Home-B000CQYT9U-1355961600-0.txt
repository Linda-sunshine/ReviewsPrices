review/summary: Not cute, super heavyreview/text: I was looking for a Christmas tree ornament to commemorate my pregnancy. For some reason, and I wasn't paying enough attention, THIS popped up in the ornament section even though it isn't an ornament. It's clunky and heavy...definitely not something I could use anywhere in my house because my child would probably break their nose with it. It isn't even attractive once you get it out of the box. I'm sorely disappointed and will never buy one of these products again.
