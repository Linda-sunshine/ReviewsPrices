review/summary: Very handyreview/text: This machine is very handy for quick cleanup of dog messes and spills. It is not as good as the rug doctor that you rent at the grocery store, but I am happy so far. It was handy for sucking up water out of my rug and off the floor when a pipe burst under the kitchen sink. It did ok on the foyer rug, which gets very dirty from traffic, but again I'm comparing it to the rug doctor which removed almost all the dirt with one cleaning.
