review/summary: Rust Problem After Only 6 Week's Usereview/text: Years and years ago my father in law gave me a Ginsu knife. I loved it, I still use it. I gave my godson this knife set for Christmas. Imagine my horror when he called me 6 weeks later to say all the knives had begun to rust. A rusty knife is useless.
