review/summary: They pilled/balled up within a month...review/text: After reading review after review, I selected these sheets as the best bang for my buck. These sheets have great reviews, but I wish I had noticed that the most popular reviews were written six years ago! Maybe they were better back then. The first few weeks we just loved the sheets; they are very soft and at the same time feel sturdy. We did not experience the problems with them being scratchy that others have had. Unfortunately, after the first washing the sheets started to pill/ball up. It got worse and worse, and within a month, we could no longer use them because they were a sea of little balls. I expected more from the Amazon/Pinzon brand and am really disappointed. It's obvious that there is very little consistency in the quality of these sheets. Save your money and go with something else! Amazon, please note that this product needs to be improved!
