review/summary: Awesome ironreview/text: This is the best iron I've ever owned. It reaches the right temperature quickly and the steam feature work wonders. It's not too light or too heavy, just right. I've used it several times but I don't owned it for very long, so I cannot talk about its durability. I intend to update this review in a year or so. Hopefully, it will not disappoint me.
