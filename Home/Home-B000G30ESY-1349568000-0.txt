review/summary: Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star, How I Wonder What Rice You'll Makereview/text: I have had my rice cooker almost six months now and LOVE it. I have had cheap rice cookers before and was satisfied with their quality and time, but never exactly pleased or excited. This cooker is fast, mess-free, easy, and smart! The high price is well worth it if you eat rice multiple times a week.
