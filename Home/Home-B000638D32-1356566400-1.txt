review/summary: Fantastic knife for the pricereview/text: I've been researching for the perfect chefs knife for quite a while and couldn't decide what to purchase. I decided to buy this knife since it was only $30 while I waited to make up my mind. I figured it could be my spare, but I have liked it so much I have decided to not purchase another chefs knife and use the 100-150 dollars towards other items in my kitchen
