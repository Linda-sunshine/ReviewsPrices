review/summary: The next 25 yearsreview/text: I bought my first one about 25 years ago and it has been my go to gadget. It began wearing out about 6 months ago so without thinking twice I begaan the search for a replacement. You can imagine the number of new products on the market in the past 25 years, but I only wanted the Borner V slicer. It never needs sharpening, I love the safty feature when you store it away. And in 25 Years I only cut myself once and it was my fault for not having used the safty handle. Lesson learned. Hope you enjoy yours as much as I have enjoyed mine.
