review/summary: first juicerreview/text: I like this juicer a lot. I don't really have anything to compare it to, but my juice tastes great. The juice does come out frothy, which I like.It isn't that hard to clean, but it does take a little while. I don't make as much juice as I'd want, because I don't have that much time to clean it up in the morning. So I prep the night before.My only criticism is that I'm not getting as much juice out of my apples.
