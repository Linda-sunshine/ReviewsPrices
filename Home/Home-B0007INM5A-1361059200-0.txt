review/summary: Not a $ saver, but $ wasterreview/text: The product is described clearly; It is what it says~description good, However, the ecopad doesn't hold enough coffee to make a decent cup of coffee. Regardless of the ground (dark roast, etc) there's just not enough coffee grind able to be enclosed & cup of coffee comes out like water, literally. I'm a &#34;light&#34; roast coffee drinker, but this isn't good at all. We will have to go back to the regular coffee pods.
