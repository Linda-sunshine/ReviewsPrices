review/summary: Fantastic productreview/text: This is one of the best purchases I ever made. This is an extremely high-quality piece of kitchen equipment. One side is a griddle, smooth and without ridges, and the other side is a grill, with the necessary ridges. My husband and I use this to cook vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. It is terrific for grilling onions, mushrooms or mixed vegetables. It works well for pancakes, eggs--just about anything you can imagine. We've gotten quite creative with it.For cleaning, I let it cool down, then wipe it down well with a paper towel and olive oil. For a while we scrubbed it in the kitchen sink in a pan of soapy water, but we decided it wasn't worth all that trouble. The griddle made pot marks all over the sink; the water caused the cast iron to rust, and we just had to wipe it down with oil anyway to "season" it.Note: Because this is iron, it will leach iron into whatever you cook on it. For men and for women past menopause, using it on a daily basis can cause you to ingest too much iron in your diet. For pre-menopausal women, however, it is a great source of dietary iron if you choose to use this daily. It's also a useful source of iron for vegetarians, who get less in their diet than meat-eaters.This makes a terrific gift for anyone you know who likes to cook.
