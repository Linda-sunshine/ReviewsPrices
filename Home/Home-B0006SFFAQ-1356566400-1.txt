review/summary: Very good coffeemakerreview/text: When my beloved Braun died, I was disappointed to learn that Braun has apparently discontinued their coffeemakers in the U.S.However, I am happy with this Cuisnart. It makes very good coffee. The only thing I don't like is the water reservoir: the opening is so small, it makes pouring water into it a little awkward. The water level indicator is inside the reservoir, which makes it hard to see how much water is there. Other than that, I have no complaint. I'm glad to report that I haven't had any of the problems mentioned in several Reviews; no spills, no overflows. The people at Cuisinart must have read the Reviews,too, the beeps are barely audible! I love the carafe, it never drips coffee.I would recommend this Coffeemaker to anyone !
