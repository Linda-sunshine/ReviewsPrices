review/summary: Great productreview/text: I have had Sunbeam hot shot water dispensers for years. You get very hot water in a short time instead of heating a kettle on a stove and get more hot water than you will use. In fact, I don't have a kettle anymore. I just rely on the hot shot for hot water. If I need a lot more water, I heat in a pan. If you haven't bought a Sunbeam hot shot, you are missing out on getting hot water in a short time on less you like to hear the whistling of the kettle when the water is hot.
