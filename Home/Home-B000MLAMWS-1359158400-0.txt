review/summary: Essential for serious bakersreview/text: I have used KitchenAid mixers for over 20 years. I love the stand mixer because when I'm mixing bread dough, I don't have to contend with the head lifting itself up. I keep going up in size - did I mention I'm a serious baker? The 6-quart size is finally big enough to hold double recipes of cookie dough at Christmas and bread dough the rest of the time.
