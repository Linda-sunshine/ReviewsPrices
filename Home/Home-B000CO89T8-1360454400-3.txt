review/summary: Good choice to keep your coffee or tea warm over timereview/text: Does the job of keeping hot beverages warm if they start out hot to begin with. I keep several of these all over the house, by my computer, next to the bed, etc. If you have a really huge mug base, it may not fit on the heated pad. There is an on/off switch, and if you forget to turn it off, it doesn't turn itself off. I also have an older different brand that's no longer available that turns itself off if the mug is lifted off the base, which is a much better idea, but unfortunately Mr. Coffee mug warmers don't do that, though they should. But all in all, this does what you need it to do, especially if you are someone who wanders away from your coffee or tea, and wants to come back to find it still hot.
