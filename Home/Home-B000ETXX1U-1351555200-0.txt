review/summary: 3 1/2 months constant usereview/text: We have slept on this bed for the last 3.5 months and only now have purchased a real bed. Never fear, this bed is still going strong. We now have it for when guests visit. This was such a great way to get started after a move overseas. Do not skip over this bed as it will definitely last.
