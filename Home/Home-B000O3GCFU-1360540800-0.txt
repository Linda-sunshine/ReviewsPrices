review/summary: Does the job!review/text: I was surprised to see that most of the reviewers were purchasing this for their kids lunch boxes - well I'm happy to report that as a mature adult, thank you very much, it's been a welcoming addition to my daily lunch box :). Granted it doesn't look too grow-up but it's the best I could find. For some reason, it did leak the first day and I was ready to be disappointed but I decided to give it another try - strange as it my seem, it never leaked again. Maybe the lid just needed to be opened and closed a few more times. It was sad to see my Tupperware container; after many years of service, go out with the recycling.
