review/summary: Don't waste your money!review/text: Used this for two cups a day (only ) was not fixable after two years. Buy a $20 Proctor Silex that lasts 4-6 years !,Customer Service offered new purchase at reduced price but why waste more $'s when it'll be useless again in such a short time. $200 machine should last or at least be fixable!
