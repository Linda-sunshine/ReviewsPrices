review/summary: For the price,this seems to be a good productreview/text: The locking valve in the handle did not &#34;pop-up&#34; the 2nd time that I used the crockpot; it took some hard tapping on the handle to finally get it to go up, thus sealing-locking the lid on and sealing in the steam so it could actually cook like a pressure-cooker should. It worked great afterwards, but a little concerning after only my 2nd usage. I will contact the manufacturer to see what appends (if any) they make, and update this posting...
