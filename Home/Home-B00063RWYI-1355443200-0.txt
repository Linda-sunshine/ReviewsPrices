review/summary: heavyreview/text: I've used cast iron skillets in the past for cornbread and felt that that was the way to go. But this thing is extremely heavy without anything being placed in it but once it is loaded with food then it will even make the wire rack in the oven sag. I can see using this on a camp fire if you want to lug it on a camping trip.
