review/summary: Works great for the nurseryreview/text: I bought this for the baby nursery and it works great. I noticed a huge difference within a few hours of turning it on. Even though we use a Diaper Champ, there was still a lingering smell. Within a few hours of having this on the high setting, we noticed that it was eliminated. It's compact size is perfect for a little table next to the crib. The plus is that the low setting creates a soft hum which helps lull baby to sleep.
