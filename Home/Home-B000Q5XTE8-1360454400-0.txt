review/summary: Pretty good chair for the pricereview/text: I'm not a chair expert by any means, but my last office chair pretty much fell apart over the course of a year. I spent a hundred bucks on it from Target and within a year a caster had snapped off, and then 6 months after, the hydraulic arm started to fail. As a returning college student on a tight budget I was not happy.So about a month ago I took the chance and bought another chair. After reading the reviews I decided to go with this one. So far I have no complaints. The chair is mighty comfortable and don't let the mesh backing fool you. My last chair was an "executive" chair with all sorts of padding. This new chair blows it out of the water, at least for what you pay for. Assembling the chair was easy and most of the parts seemed very solid. Like one reviewer said, the arms are kind of wobbly but I don't usually use the arms so it is a non issue. I guess I didn't give it 5 stars because of the wobbly arms and plus, it's definitely not a kings throne by any means.But if you are on a tight budget like I was, or just don't want to spend more than 200 bucks on a chair, I would recommend this one.
