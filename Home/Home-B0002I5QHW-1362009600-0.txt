review/summary: Serves its purpose well.review/text: This is surprisingly sturdy and easy to clean. I have used it to grind beef and turkey, and have experimented with semi-frozen and thawed meat. The results have been satisfactory both ways. I am unable to speak to the pasta option, since I have not tried it, nor do I expect to. (This was purchased to be used in lieu of the Kitchenaid grinder, which for me is less convenient to set up.)
