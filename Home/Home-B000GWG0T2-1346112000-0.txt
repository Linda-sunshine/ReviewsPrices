review/summary: Should be great while it lastsreview/text: Bought to replace a $$$ Circulon pan - coming to the conclusion that non-stick pans are "wear items" to be replaced regularly. America's Test Kitchen recommended the T-Fal, so far as slippery-when-new as any pan I've used. Sadly, even on T-Fal's own site I do not see a lid for it or a similar pan w/lid. Good value -- so far - nonetheless.
