review/summary: Discarded our old coffeemakerreview/text: So happy with our Keurig. Been wanting one for awhile, and finally decided to purchase it. Glad we did. Can have that cup of coffee, tea, hot chocolate whenever we want it. My family likes different types of coffee (decaf, 1/2 decaf & regular), now they can make their choice without any hassle. A good, dependable product.
