review/summary: Fairly good productreview/text: I have been using the product for about one month. At first it seemed to filter the water very well but after only one month it doesn't seem to be filtering out the impurities very well. The claim was that each filter is good for two months. I'm worried that I will have to replace the filter more frequently than the product claims. This might mean a greater expense than I had anticipated. I will try it for another month then decide if I want to keep using it or try another product.
