review/summary: Holds up in the showerreview/text: I really like this product. I have had the product for 3 months now and it holds up great. I followed the install instruction exactly to make sure the product sticks to the shower surface correctly. The side compartments will hold only one 24oz sized bottle of shampoo/conditioner/soap, which is the larger of the two sizes you will usually see in the store.
