review/summary: Leaky Messreview/text: Fast hot coffee, but after a few months it leaks a mess of water across the counter with every pot. It also molds/mildews in the back machine because of the hot and moist and dark environment.Took the bottom plate off to see if I could discover the leak. Need a long (12 inch shaft?) small Phillips head driver to remove the reservoir. I don't have one so I reassembled, but not before I discovered the leak comes from the top. Steam collects in the machine spaces outside the reservoir and leaks down the inside before pooling out the bottom. Am complaining to cpsc.gov.
