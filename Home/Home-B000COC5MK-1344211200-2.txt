review/summary: Excellent Wine Bottle Openerreview/text: This is the newest innovation in 'corkscrews', works beautifully, stays recharged for long periods of time so you don't need to keep it plugged into the wall, so it is quick and easy. There are many others on the market now for lots more money, but Oster is an excellent brand, and I have had mine for so long that I'm now buying them as gifts for friends.
