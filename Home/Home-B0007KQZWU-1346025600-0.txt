review/summary: food seems to stickreview/text: This is a great looking set of cookware. The rubberized lids are really nice and do not rattle at all when you have a full boil. My only complaint is that food seems to stick really badly, but this is the first time I've ever owned cookware like this so perhaps it's normal.
