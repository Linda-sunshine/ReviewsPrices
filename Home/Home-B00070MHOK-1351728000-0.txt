review/summary: Very goodreview/text: Depending on how wrinkled your shirts are, this can do several before needing to be refilled. My shirts were horribly wrinkled (to the point where I thought I might take the the cleaners just to get the wrinkles out), and this steamer got them all out! It's also small enough that I can pack it and take it on trips with me.My only complaint is that the cap threads are made of a softer than usual plastic, so you need to be careful you don't accidently cross thread it and damage it. Just be careful and don't try to force it.
