review/summary: almost 2 years, going strong!review/text: This machine is part 1 of my morning cubicle-slave ritual. Brews whatever I put in. from a bag, or beans I grind myself, no problem. 2 spoonfuls of coffee grounds, half my Nalgene water bottle, and in 5 minutes I'm catching up on all the emails I ignored yesterday afternoon.Ever get KFC to go? The little reusable side-order containers hold exactly one workweek's morning coffee, just sayin.Simple to clean.The included cup will keep your java hot about 20-30 minutes in case you get called to some BS meeting. (it happens)This is one of those things that if/when it ever dies, you'll want to buy another just like it.
