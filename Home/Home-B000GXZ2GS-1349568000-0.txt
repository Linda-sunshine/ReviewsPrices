review/summary: Echoing the Ravesreview/text: Suffice it to say that I own several kinds of coffee makers and since finding this gem, it is the ONLY one I use. It is quick, easy, clean, safe and --most of all-- it makes the most delicious cup of coffee. The only down side is that I have developed very high standards for a cup of coffee that are hard to meet outside my kitchen.
