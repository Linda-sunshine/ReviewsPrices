review/summary: So far so goodreview/text: I've had this machine now for about three months and so far I'm very happy with it. The coffee machine makes a good, hot cup of coffee in just minutes and the beeping when it's done is not loud like so old machine. I like the self cleaning feature even though I haven't tried it out yet. I can't tell how long I searched for a good coffee maker - not to say this is the best one out there but it does the job and isn't too terribly expensive; and it looks pretty cool sitting on my counter too.
