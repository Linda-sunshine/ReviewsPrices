review/summary: Perfect for small houses and apartments.review/text: I ordered this vaccuum and was a bit surprised about the size, the vacuum is fairly small. This however was not a problem,, in fact it proved to be helpful in reaching difficult areas around and under furniture. It works like a dream and pulls everything off the carpet. It also leaves a clean smell after use without resorting to scented powders. I am a big fan of this little clean machine.
