review/summary: Amazing!review/text: This pan was bigger than I expected it to be. I am glad I did not get the bigger size because the bigger size would not fit on my tiny apartment's electrical stove top. It is SOOO heavy! I love it! The only down side is if you leave water in it for an hour, the pan starts to rust and then gets that weird metal smell (duh it's iron! lol). I love it so much that I cook with it each and every night and love that I can move it from stove top to oven without worrying. I am purchasing the lid right now! :)
