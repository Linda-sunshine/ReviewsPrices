review/summary: Meh...review/text: Meh. Maybe because I have read a lot of dystopia now? I just found this boring. And the ending stinks! But I didn't care even then what it meant. I am not the slightest interested in reading the next book. If it came to be for free I might try. I am again sad that I can't dance to everyone else's idea of fabulous, classic clucking. But guess I must sway to my own waltzes.
