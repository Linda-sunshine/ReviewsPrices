review/summary: Six months with the Aeropressreview/text: At work we have free bottom barrel coffee made in giant industrial coffee makers. My department used to have a decent drip machine and we'd pitch in on bags of decent coffee. In an effort to save electricity, the company banned all personal coffee makers. French Presses became all the rage in our department. I decided to try the Aeropress. The fact that we have a hot (nearly boiling) water dispenser at work makes the aeropress ideal.It took several weeks before I perfected a brewing method that I was happy with. The instructions recommend using two scoops of grounds and a tiny amount of water, producing an extremely strong coffee concentrate. This is fine if you want a massive cup of coffee, or a cup of ridiculously strong coffee, or a triple shot of espresso. I have settled on the following method:Flip the aeropress upside down and place the top of the rubber plunger in the middle of the number 4. Add in one level scoop (the aeropress scoop) of ground coffee. Add nearly boiling water up to the middle of number 1 and screw on the cap with filter. To be clear, since you have the aeropress upside down, the water spans the middle of number 4 to the middle of number 1. Place your cup upside down over the cap and turn the aeropress and cup over. Pull up slightly on the plunger to keep the water from dripping out. Wait about 20 seconds and then plunge until you hear the hissing. Stop immediately upon hissing unless you want bitter coffee. Add more hot water to your cup until you have the strength you want (about 20% more in my case).I grind my beans at the store and go two clicks past drip machine towards espresso.
