review/summary: Great until it fails...review/text: I bought this about 10 months ago, and used it daily. It has now failed, unable to deliver water, the same problem as many others have reported. I have maintained it as instructed, cleaning out with vinegar every 2 months or so. This is an unacceptable life for any kind of commercial product. I liked the great espresso, with good crema. It easily makes frothed milk, and the steamer is very easy to clean (just wipe it and let steam for half a second). It has height limitations for cups but espresso cups and shorter cups all fit fine. If you can accept that this thing will last about year, go ahead. If not take my advice, don't buy one. Build quality has to be suspect (cheap materials in the pump construction?).
