review/summary: Very Pleasedreview/text: The Honeywell HHT-011 Compact Air Purifier is a very good product. I have a much more expensive Air Purifier in my living room and it is not all the rage. It is noisy if the control is on any setting but low (and even that is questionable), it is bulky, and last but far from least - it is a somewhat unattractive addition to the decor. The Honeywell HHT-011 however, is the total opposite. It can be somewhat distracting if set on high, but set on low or medium, this product can double as an Air Purifier/Relaxing Sleep Tool. I have looked at the filter once, and I can tell that the job is getting done, just be careful to read the directions in its' entirety, to get the full benefits from this product.
