review/summary: excellent ironreview/text: recently purchased this and just used it for the first time today. for $40, this thing offers incredible value. the stainless steel sole plate is excellent, smooth and much better than other materials. the steam settings are excellent, and water doesn't run out of this thing like it does on cheaper irons. best iron for the price, hands down, and should be free to ship.
