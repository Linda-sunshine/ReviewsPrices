review/summary: Bottom line - it makes good coffeereview/text: We had to find a new coffemaker after our Braun died and could not be repaired. Braun has quit selling coffeemakers in the US. We tried a Black and Decker and a Krups. The Black and Decker did not make very good tasing coffee and the Krups constantly spilled when trying to pour it, so we tried this Cuisinart.The bottom line is - it makes good coffee. It also has a strudy , well designed carafe and doesn't spill when pouring into your cup. It has a variable auto shutoff of up to 4 hours, which we view as essential.There are some negatives about this pot. There is no fill line visible from the outside of the pot, so you have to peer into the water reservoir where there is a fill indicator inside. In addition, the clock is very small and hard to read. The dials are antiquated and hard to read as well. It is hard to tell what position they are set on- but on the other hand, we rarely change the settings If we need to buy another pot, we might look to see if other Cuisinart pots might be better designed in these areas. However, since this pot makes good coffee, we are willing to overlook these inconveniences.
