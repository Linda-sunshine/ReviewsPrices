review/summary: Great Machine if it would only work for more than a yearreview/text: This is my 2nd coffee maker from Keurig and they both came down with the same problem after about a year. They just stop working. I've de-scaled it on a regular basis and even went so far as to only use filtered water on the 2nd machine. Don't get me wrong I love the coffee, but to only last about a year and to fork out over $100 each time is just not cost effective for me... I've owned a Cuisinart drip coffee maker over 5 yrs and paid around $100 and it still works great... My suggestion is to make sure you register it and keep your factory warranty information because I'm 90% sure you will be asking for a replacement before the warranty runs out...
