review/summary: It's a Measuring Cupreview/text: So yep, it's a measuring cup. It's Pyrex so you know it'll bounce down a flight of concrete stairs and remain intact. The red measurements are easy to read and so far after 1000's of washings (was purchased over a year ago) all the lettering remains.
