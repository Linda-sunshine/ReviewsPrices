review/summary: Decent skilletreview/text: My formative years were spent watching my mother's generation swearing by cast iron skillets. I am thinking I didn't pay enough attention then, but still working through getting used to it. Follow instructions and you'll be fine. But always pre-season before using, regardless of what they say.
