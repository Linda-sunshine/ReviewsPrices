review/summary: A very fine juicerreview/text: I have purchased several juicers of various types over the years. I give them to my grand children etc. when I want to try another one. I have found that the juicers that work by spinning the juice in the extraction process changes the flavor of the juice. For example: cabbage juice taste very strong when the juice is aerated. With the gear type of extraction the juice is sweet and very palatable. I ended up with the 8006 model however. I am very satisfied with it. Most juicers do a poor job with leafy greens. This one does an acceptable job. The plastic container supplied with the juicer is "el cheapo". The warrantee is good for 15 years. I hope it last for at least for 1/3 of that. The juicer is well worth the money even though it may be a little harder to clean.
