review/summary: Mandatory for dog and pet owners! Very happy!review/text: Will update if it doesn't last at least 5 years, this is a barely used item.PROS-Cleans up the floors, very well-Very straight forward to use, IF YOU READ THE MANUAL-Use oxy-clean. Use with warm water. Cleans up all puppy mess.-Clear instructions on how to clean the unit, this is a NECESSITYCONS-As with any carpet cleaner the setup/clean up of the tools & cleaner takes longer and is far more annoying than vacuuming. THIS IS NOT ACTUAL CON TO USING THE PRODUCT, just plain annoying.
