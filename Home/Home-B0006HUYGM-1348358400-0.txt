review/summary: Junkreview/text: Sorry to say it is a piece of junk. Worked pretty good 5 or 6 times then brush quit rotating. I called Eureka and was told to take it to a service center where it would cost more to repair than buying a new one. PLEASE NOTE...It does not have a belt that can be replaced.
