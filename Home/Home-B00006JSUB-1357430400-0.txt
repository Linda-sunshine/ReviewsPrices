review/summary: Great Productreview/text: I love my Lodge cast iron skillets. This is the perfect size for two fried eggs or a nice fluffy omelett that is thick enough to hold saut&eacute;d veggies. I like to make an omelett in the oven with it. Great size for making small pies and so on. My particular skillet had chipping on the inside towards the top and scraped paint on the rim of the other side. Because of this, I will never buy cast iron online again. I would rather be able to inspect it for signs of potential rusting and so on.
