review/summary: It's Okayreview/text: For years, I lugged 2.5 gallon plastic containers of spring water from the grocery store because I didn't trust the pipes in my ancient apartment. Sometimes I'd buy 3 or 4 at a time so that I wouldn't have to go to the grocery as often. Then I kind of got sick of it and I also realized that I was just consuming too much plastic with containers so I finally bought this water filter. I'm bummed to say that the water does not taste as good as the spring water. The chlorine-y taste is still there although not as much as if I never filtered it. But it still doesn't taste as good as the spring water. Maybe I'm expecting too much? But I'm still gonna stick with it because I think that using less plastic is more important. It does take less space than those 2.5 gallon jugs. However, it is a slight annoyance to lug this container in and out of the fridge to refill. Maybe use a smaller pitcher to pour water into this filter so you don't have to take the whole thing out? I suppose there are trade-offs for everything.
