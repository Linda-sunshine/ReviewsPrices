review/summary: Aeropress is best!review/text: After many years of searching, this is the best coffee maker I've come across. Easy to use and clean. I let the coffee and water sit for an extra 30 seconds in the vacuum state to pull out even more flavor-Highly recommend! My $300 coffee maker was returned within days of this purchase
