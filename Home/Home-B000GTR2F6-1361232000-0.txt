review/summary: A most-convenient cup of anything you likereview/text: My wife and I decided that we were interested in a Keurig system before the holidays, so we were standing in the aisle of our Target looking over the models they had on display. We were particularly interested in the B70 Platinum Edition. So there we stood, looking it over, when a woman suddenly stopped her cart and offered us her unsolicited opinion on how great she thought her Keurig was and how we absolutely HAD to have one. We thanked her and she walked away. So there we stood, looking it over, when a man suddenly stopped his cart and offered us his unsolicited opinion of how great he thought his Keurig was and how we absolutely had to have one. In fact, he picked up another one and instantly decided to buy another one for his wife to use at work. He walked off. So there we were, looking it over, when ANOTHER woman stopped her cart... you get the idea. It happened FOUR TIMES. On other occasions, I'd be looking over the available K-Cups to see what kind of things we could make if and when we bought a Keurig. Again, people popped out of nowhere to offer me their opinions of how I just had to have a Keurig.So, we bought one from Amazon.We love it. We make coffee. We make tea. We make hot chocolate for the kids. We use it for hot water to make other teas. I used to, (shudder), wait to drink my coffee at work. Now, I brew up a quick travel mug before leaving for work. And then I, (shudder), drink some more coffee at work. Now, however, I get at least one really good mug of coffee a day! Two on Sundays. This machine has quickly become the most-used appliance in our home. My Mr. Coffee is about to get relegated to storage.So the other day I was walking through Target and I saw this couple standing in front of the Keurig display...and I thought, &#34;I just have to let them know...&#34;
