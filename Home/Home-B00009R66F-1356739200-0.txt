review/summary: Hooverreview/text: Ok, I got this product scared that it wouldn't work because of the mixed reviews. However, I am very pleased with its performance. It was simple to put together, and it cleaned the carpets very well. I will say that it is CRUCIAL TO MAKE SURE YOU PUT THE BOTTOM TANK LID ON CORRECTLY. FROM FRONT TO BACK. If it doesn't snap on the suction will not work. No leaks, no problems. Just follow the instructions.
