review/summary: No problems to date.review/text: We have used this Dutch oven for a number of different cooking duties in the last month or so, and have been extremely pleased. The heat retention after removal from the heat is outstanding. It is smooth enough on the bottom to use on our glass-top range with no problems or wobbles. The results have all been as expected or beyond. We did re-season it when we got it, although for no particular reason except we wanted to, and keep it greased in-between times. We have had no problems with any peeling as of yet, and really don't expect any, although we have not had it long enough to really say. I personally think it is well worth the money, and may eventually get the next size up, although this one holds a lot. At this point, I would not hesitate to recommend it.
