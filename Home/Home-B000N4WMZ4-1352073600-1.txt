review/summary: the pot were the lid touched.review/text: I order this via site-to-store. When I picked it up the packaging didn't seem very substantial given the weight and make-up of the pot. When I got it home and opened the box my fears were realized. The pot had numerous chips in the porcelain near the top of the pot were the lid touched.
