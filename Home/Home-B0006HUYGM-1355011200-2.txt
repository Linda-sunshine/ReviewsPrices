review/summary: Great hand-Held Vacuumreview/text: Amazingly powerful vacuum. Small enough to take anywhere in the house. This is not a dust buster or anything in that class of handheld vacuums, it is a serious tool, powerful motor and suction. The cord is long enough to take it anywhere and the versatility has made it the only vacuum I use. Ideal for apartments and small spaces.
