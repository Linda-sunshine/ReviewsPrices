review/summary: Best Stove Top Espresso Makerreview/text: I have had this product since 2010 and I absolutely love it. Unfortunately, I lost my first original espresso maker in the mail. As soon as it was cold enough to drink coffee every single day I bought one. This is by far the best coffee maker that I have ever had. I would ALWAYS choose this over regular drip coffee any day. Also I was given a brand new cappuccino machine when I first moved into my apartment, because my family knew I LOVED coffee. I never ever use it now that I have this. It is faster, and I believe tastes so much betterProEasy To UseMakes great espressoEasy clean upTravels wellConsCan spill over if not watched carefullyCan only make 1 1/2 shot at a time ( Just buy the bigger stovetop unit to fix this )Makes a mess if it spills overFor 20 dollars, this is well worth trying it out. If you don't like it send it back because this is way cheaper than a cappuccino machine.Also, for the best foam get this :[...]Heat up your milk, put some flavoring in it ( if you are into that ) and froth away... AMAZING !!!
