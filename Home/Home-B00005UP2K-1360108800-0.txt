review/summary: great time saver and allowsyou to enjoy your favorites even if you are very busyreview/text: I bought this mixer in 2011, and really enjoy it. Because I am from north China, and my family like many Chinese tranditional foods made from flour, such as dumpling, Zheng-Bao, Onion-You-Bing, hand-made noodle, etc. It normally costs 15-20 minutes to make any kind of such dough. Because both my wife and I are very busy, we only cooked such delicious food very limited times. But with this mixer, things change. And to my suprise, my then-13-year-old daughter, also started cook her favorite cookies and cakes with this mixer all by herself! That makes me even happier. Another reason I like this mixer is that it is very reliable in the past 2 years, it didn't appear any malfunctions after one year warranty as I worried before. Wish my experience can help you!
