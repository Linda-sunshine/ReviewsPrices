review/summary: Best coffeemaker I've EVER owned!review/text: Think you're getting more 'bang for your buck' with those $30 coffeemakers? Wrong! After going through an average of one coffeemaker a year for the last 5 years...at a cost of approximately $150, my husband and I have FINALLY seen the light! I did my homework and found this model coffeemaker to be 'the best' and I found the best price on Amazon. We couldn't be happier. The design is 'retro' what with the old school toggle switch and knobs, including the option of how warm to hold the coffee/hot water. I hope you'll be as happy as we are with our purchase...just wish I'd done it sooner!
