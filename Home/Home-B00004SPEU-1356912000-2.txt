review/summary: Good execution of a poor designreview/text: I use a french press and so want my beans ground consistently coarse. It is not possible to achieve that with any blade type of coffee grinder. I used this for several years and from a functionality standpoint it is a solid product. It was not until I switched to a burr type coffee grinder that I realized how poor a job this product was grinding beans to a desired level of coarseness. If you are grinding spices or do not really care about a consistent coarseness of your beans, then this product will do a good job. If you want more control, look at a burr type of grinder.
