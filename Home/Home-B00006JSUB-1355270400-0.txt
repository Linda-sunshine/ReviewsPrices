review/summary: Love this thingreview/text: Great quality product and everything seems to come out good on this. I have used this on our electric stove and directly on our grill and it is just a wonderful item to have. I have cooked eggs, bacon, hamburgers, steak and tons of other stuff and it all cooks up great. I would like to suggest getting a skillet handle mitt to pair with this like this item -&#62; http://www.amazon.com/Lodge-HHMT-Temp-Handle-Black/dp/B00063RWG6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1355370065&sr=8-1&keywords=skillet+handle+cover
