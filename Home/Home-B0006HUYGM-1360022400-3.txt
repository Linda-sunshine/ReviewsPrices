review/summary: Amazing!review/text: I never thought I would say this, but I love this vacuum so much!As the owner of two black dogs, I pretty much just accepted the fact that I would never be rid of the fur all over my floor. But I decided to give the Eureka Hand Held Vacuum a go. I purposely picked this model for two reasons 1) plug in rather than battery for more power and 2) has a hose which the Bissel pet one did not.This is just amazing and sucks up every little hair on the carpet. I am actually excited to vacuum! Works great on stairs, furniture, car interiors and whenever you don't want to bust out your full size vacuum. I was initially a little surprised by how heavy the vacuum was (I think it says 5 lbs?), but really that just speaks to the quality and durability of the vacuum.
