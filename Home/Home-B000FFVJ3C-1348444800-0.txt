review/summary: Quiet and easy to use!review/text: After researching other dehydrators I purchased this one for my husband. We had tons of figs from our fig tree and this dehydrator worked beautifully. I did apples and bananas for my own healthy snacks and plan to dry our garden herbs soon. Can't wait to try the jerky recipes. It is so quiet I can hardly hear it, sits on a counter and is easy to clean.
