review/summary: Love this rice cooker!!review/text: I have a 10 cup rice cooker that's a panasonic and I've had it was years but I really wanted something smaller since its just my husband and I. I found this 3 cup Zojirushi and absolutely love it. Its so much easier to clean too and takes up alot less space than the big 10 cup cooker.
