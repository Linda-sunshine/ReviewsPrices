review/summary: It's basically junk.review/text: I've had the machine just under 90 days. About once a week, it fails to brew and there's nothing you can do about it except unplug it and try again - and that often takes several tries and 20 minutes - and you'll need to reset the clock each time.Sometimes the device pumps water back into the reservoir. Sometimes it pumps water all over the counter. Since I've missed Amazon's window to return the damn thing, I'll keep using it until it completely fails, but then it's back to Melitta cone drip coffee for me.At $150 for the machine and .80 a cup for just OK coffee, this machine isn't worth the expense OR the trouble. Do you have 20 minutes to spare in the morning trying to get some piece of junk to spit out a cup of joe before giving up and swinging by Starbucks instead? Me, either.
