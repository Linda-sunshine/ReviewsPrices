review/summary: Good productreview/text: The coffeemaker is very speedy and efficient with it's coffee making process. You can fill up the travel mug in approx. 3 mins of turning it on. The filter is also very convenient because all you have to do is rinse it out, then you can reuse it.The travel mug does the job and no complaining there for how much I spent. It doesn't hold the heat too long though, I'd say you'll have a cold cup in no more than 2 hours. The handle is made of thin rubber so I feel like it will break off eventually. The most difficult feature is the sipper, it's kind of odd and very difficult to keep it neat, you will most likely drip down the side of the cup before you master it.For the price you're paying, you're really getting 5 stars worth of product. My only concern is in the future if I use a slightly taller mug than the travel mug (it doesn't have to be much taller), then it won't fit under the brewer.
