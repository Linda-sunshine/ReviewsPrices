review/summary: Don't forget the non stick sprayreview/text: I forgot the spray once and it the waffle broke in half, but was still able to get the waffle out without a huge mess, but it didn't look so good on the plate. Other than my own mistake, I have no complaints. I've made waffles about 7 times since I got this 2 weeks ago. So far so good.
