review/summary: Excellent machinereview/text: I researched this machine before I decided to buy it and it had super reviews so I ordered it.I've made four loaves of bread and all turned out GREAT. One I went to an old cook book and revised it to fit the michine. I find that the bread that calls for more yeast tasted better,more like my mom use to make long before they made these machines.
