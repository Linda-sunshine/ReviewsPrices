review/summary: Awesomereview/text: I love this thing. When it arrived, I didn't have anything that I needed to make with it, but I had to try it out---you know how it is when you get a new gadget-- so I had a bag of stale chips sitting on my counter that I was going to just toss out. Dumped them in it, turned it on and it turned the potato chips into crumbs that resembled bread crumbs with no fuss at all. This is great! I can't wait to test it on other things.
