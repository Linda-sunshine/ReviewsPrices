review/summary: Too hard to usereview/text: I bought this grinder last year. My purpose was to use it for grinding meat but I found it very hard to use it. You have to hold it when you grind the meat and you will also have to clean the plate often. Each time I ground about 2 pounds of pork and my hands ended up sore.
