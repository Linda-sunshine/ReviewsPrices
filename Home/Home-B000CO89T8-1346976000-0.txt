review/summary: Excellentreview/text: TIP: Turn on BEFORE going to get your coffee! This has been working GREAT for me. I turn it on, then go fix a cup of coffee, and it's already warm when I set the mug down, and keeps it hot for as long as it takes me to drink it. I keep the warmer on my desk - I work at home - and I'm mostly on the computer but also up and down, sometimes forgetting I have the coffee! I take phone calls, etc. - in other words - sometimes long breaks between sips! This works perfectly for keeping my coffee at drinkable temperature (I like it pretty hot and do not like to drink cooled down coffee AT ALL). I am going to order another one for my nightstand for my evening tea while reading in bed! Good product. Attractive, good price, sturdy, and as others have mentioned I like that the on-off switch is on the unit with a reminder light, and not halfway down the cord. All in all a great product.
