review/summary: Best for Smoothies, Vege Chopper Not Goodreview/text: Rather than another chopper, I ordered this product. It's very good for a smoothie. It's easy to clean, and store. But for some reason I though I could chop veges, make hummus, etc. But that seems not possible because you need to add sufficient liquid.
