review/summary: Good purchasereview/text: We have used the Misto Olive oil sprayer for a weeks. I enjoy using it to add olive oil to my air popped popcorn. Following the directions for the sprayer by pumping before each use make for a perfect fine spray each time. My husband, the cook in the family, uses it for salads and everyday cooking. This is a good product.
