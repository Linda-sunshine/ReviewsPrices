review/summary: Great litttle vacuumreview/text: Thsi is our second Eureka Mighty Mite. What a great sweeper. Our first one lasted about 8 yrs and finally wore out. We have 6 children and this sweeper gets worked to death. It has great power and is very portable. We use it from cleaning up pet hair to sweeping out our wood stove. By far the best sweeper we have come across.
