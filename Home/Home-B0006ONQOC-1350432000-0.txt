review/summary: Great first impressionreview/text: We ordered the machine last week and it arrived promptly and was nicely packed. It came with a easy recipe book for starters like us. We have never made ice cream at home. So the thought that ice cream can be made at home made our kids super excited (well they are 3 and 5 years old).So we followed directions, freezed the bowl (the rotating one) in the deep freezer overnight. Next morning, the kids helped me prepare the ice cream mix following instructions in the recipe book. And then in 25 minutes we had delicious ice cream! It was really nice and soft. Didn't feel any different than store bought. Just didnt have the artificial colors, preservatives and the plethora of potential risks that the store bought ice cream comes with (due to the artificial colors, flavors, preservative, etc).Overall a great buy. The quantity was more than enough for a family of 4. I hope this will last at least 50 times.
