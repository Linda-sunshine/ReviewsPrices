review/summary: Attractive, well made and affordablereview/text: I ordered this product after about a month of shopping around. I looked at Le Creuset (Really? For that price you STILL want to sell me a $12 stainless knob?)This one came with the Stainless knob for a fraction of the price. I'm a southern gal and have had Lodge brand skillets in my home from the beginning--to me Lodge IS the "Le Crueset of the south".I've used it three times since I got it and I absolutely LOVE it. It was PERFECT for the stews and roasts I've done in it.It DID seal well to keep in moisture, it DID have a Stainless knob (unlike earlier models).It is more of a sky (N. Carolina) blue, while the picture looked more like Fiesta's peacock color...but I was fine with that.
