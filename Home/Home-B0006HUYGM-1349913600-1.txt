review/summary: Powerful!review/text: Powerful little vac!! Loved the hose and attachment, makes cleaning very easy. The cord is very long, so you don't have to stop very often. You need to buy the replacement filters when you purchase this, it's so powerful you will have to change them soon because of all the stuff you pick up! I used it on my couch, chair and ottoman....oh my goodness, I only thought I was a good housekeeper!! You will love it.
