review/summary: Great item!!!review/text: This is my second hand blender and my first Cuisinart. I only wish I had found this one my first time around. It is a great multi-purpose blender and very easy to clean and care for. I love the measuring cup that comes with it which gets used for shakes nearly every day. The colors are fun and the pricing is excellent. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
