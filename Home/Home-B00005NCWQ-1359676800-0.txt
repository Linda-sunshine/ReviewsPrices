review/summary: Great little coffee potreview/text: My husband and I retired to the mountains were we have lost electricity serveral times a year. This Christmas we lost electricity for 6 days! Thought I would die not having my good coffee. Didn't even have instant (which I really don't like)! So I purchased this percolator for my gas top stove and it makes a wonderful pot of coffee. Just be sure and read the directions and grind your coffee coarse. Love the smell in the morning, reminds me of my mother percolating the coffee when I was a child. The smell is wonderful!The ONLY reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that there is a rim in the bottom of the pot that is not as easy to clean as it should be. Other than that I love it!
