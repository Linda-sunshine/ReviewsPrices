review/summary: annoyed price dropped 5 dollarsreview/text: my guess is because consumer reports gave it a fire hazard rating,and said dont buy,i just bought 4,then they dropped the price by 5 dollars was 30 dollars now 25dont put it near fabric,i bought because i have leaky house and fan heaters will just heat the ceilingit heats people and furnature so you need it near you, bought it also to save electricity,as t uses 800 wattsrather than 1500 of fan heaters,does not heat the air which is good as you are wasting heatpersonally i am not to worred about consumer reports fire hazard rating as i keep it away from curtins and fabrics,if you need a good heater buy it,but you need to be near it to get the heat,it will also save electricityamazon should bring back its price policy as i bought it full retail price,when i could have shopped elsewhere at same pricenext time i would buy where they will give you a price refund if price drops in days
