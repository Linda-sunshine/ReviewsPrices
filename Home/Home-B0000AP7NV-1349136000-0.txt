review/summary: Great Product, last foreverreview/text: I am just in the market for another brita filter after dropping this one of the floor and cracking the pitcher. It lasted about 6 years with no troubles. Although, I got the slim pitcher as a gift after my first grande one disappeared. If you have a couple people in your home, you may want to buy the larger model because i found myself filling this one a lot with a new baby in the house. But over all, these last forever and work well.
