review/summary: works greatreview/text: loved the compact size. We always buy a tea boiler when we go on a cruise so we can make our own coffee (cruise ship coffee sucks unless you want to pay $5 for coffee in the speciality cafe) This is perfect and the price of $10 is great. We typically leave for our cabin steward who is thrilled to get it. Damn cruise ships nickel and dime you to death.
