review/summary: Makes great popcorn!review/text: I love how easy it is to cook healthy, fresh popcorn with this. It does just what it says, and I've not had any burnt popcorn - it cooks perfectly, it pretty much all pops in a few seconds once it starts, and as long as you crank, it won't burn.I'd give it 5 stars, except it is kinda a pain to get the lid off once it's done. The little prongs end up throwing some of the popcorn on the stove- best to have your stove cleared off and clean before you make popcorn.Clean up is easy-I just rinse mine out and wipe it off.
