review/summary: Disapointing Productreview/text: My 30 year old stove top coffee pot sprang a leak and it needed to be replaced. Although this pot is larger than what I wanted, it seemed like a good value at the 4 cup minimum. However, the design is terrible. The design flaw is a spring that adjusts the height of the coffee grind basket. Can only imagine how easy it is to lose or damage the spring. The use of a spring is no doubt due to the wide range of number of cups it is designed to make. Farberware should offer two different pots rather than one. It probably works best for many who brew the maximum 8 cups.I am somewhat disappointed that no where in the description does it indicate that a spring is part of the item. The Farberware site does not indicate a spring either and it calls it an 8 cup coffee pot and not 4-8 cups as indicated in the Amazon description.Interestingly, I bought this same pot as a gift for someone last year but don't recall it having a spring and as it turned out, I returned it because they had already bought a pot elsewhere.As many reviewers have commented, they should charge a couple of bucks more and use a glass percolator top but the plastic percolator top was not a make or break characteristic since optional glass tops are available. Of course, the biggest disappointment, is finding another stove top coffee pot that makes 2-4 cups.
