review/summary: I am in love with making my own popcorn!review/text: We love this little appliance. It makes enough popcorn in about two minutes for two adults who love to eat a lot of popcorn. Its about as loud as a hairdryer, works great. The only drawback is there is no on or off switch, but its not the end of the world. Easy clean up, you do need a big bowl to catch all the corn!
