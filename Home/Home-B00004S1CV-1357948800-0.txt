review/summary: Good on Salereview/text: I purchased two of these on sale and they were worth it. I wish they held a bit more liquid, and you need to make sure whatever lid you're using is on tight and the seal is in the proper place, of else you will smell like tea or coffee all day because of the spillage. Otherwise, well designed and will last a long time. I like how the tea infuser/strainer is small enough mesh to use loose tea, which I enjoy quite a bit.
