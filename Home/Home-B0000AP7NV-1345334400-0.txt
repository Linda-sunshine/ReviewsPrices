review/summary: In my case, chemical flavor leaves bad aftertaste.review/text: I've bought this pitcher twice. I did follow all instructions for prepping the filters I tried here.I have not done any scientific testing on how well the filtering works - this review is only to illustrate the differences from tap to tap I have faced.The first time I was very satisfied with the pitcher - caused water from my tap in an old high rise building built in the 50s to come out with a neutral taste, which was different from the tap, and I was very satisfied with the water.I bought this pitcher again when I moved into a new place (had to throw out the old one due to a fire in the old building contaminating it) and for my new building (built in the past 10 years), the water from my tap gained a chemical taste after being filtered. This taste became significantly more pronounced when I chilled the water in the fridge. I thought this may fade over time or be due to a defective filter, but the issue persisted after a few weeks and when replaced with a new filter. I instead bought a Pur pitcher and filter instead, and the taste from it was much better.Just wanted to point out that your experience here may vary based off the input!
