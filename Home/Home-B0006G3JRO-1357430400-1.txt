review/summary: 10 second butternut squash soup!review/text: This is the best kitchen gadget I've ever purchased! I used to be stuck with a "rustic" consistency on any and all creamy soups. The first day I used it, I made about a gallon of amazing butternut squash soup. I pureed it hot and had no splatter; even with my caution about a new appliance, it was done in under a minute. I've done it since then in 10 seconds! It elevated my soup to a high-end restaurant quality and all my friends were impressed.One of the reasons I purchased the item was because I wanted to eat healthier and eliminate grains/gluten without feeling deprived. With this item, I don't need to add any flour, cornstarch, or other thickeners to gravies. I can simply puree a portion of the food. For example, I can puree a potato into my turkey gravy or use some of the potatoes and carrots straight out of the pot roast to thicken the sauce!The cup it comes with is also fantastic for making homemade salad dressing emulsions and aioli. I can replicate bottled balsamic dressing and others with ease.When I purchased the item, the Prime price of the one with whisk and chopper was only a few dollars more than without. So, I splurged on this one. I've made about a dozen homemade fruit & traditional salsas with the chopper. The whisk is also wonderful as it has more control than the traditional electric whisk/beater, is far lighter, and can reach in corners.The only thing I can't really do with it is smoothies. I bought the milkshake cup and was not very happy with its failure to puree frozen fruit. However, I have a blender for that.
