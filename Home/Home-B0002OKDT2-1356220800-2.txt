review/summary: But for 1 small thing, this is an amazing buy for me. (4.75 stars)review/text: First of all, I would like to give it a 4.75 stars for only one reason; the opening is a little narrow. Which means I have to cut my beets & pineapple into slightly smaller slivers. But other than that, this machine is a ... 'WOW!'. I have been using it for 2 weeks now. The whole family drinks 1 cup of juice (as a supplement; not replacement for meals) every day. My son loves it. My daughter needs some OJ added to it.Cons: First, let me finish the cons.* You will need to cut your veggies into smaller slivers. Note: A whole carrot works without any problem. I sometimes have to re-cut my beets & pineapple into more pieces. SERIOUSLY, this is not a stopper for me.Pros:* I was using a different (inexpensive Costco brand) juicer before. This juicer gets a lot more juice. The pulp seems dry* What a cinch cleaning up! Wow! I am done fully cleaning and putting away my machine, in 2 mins.* I made my first batch of peanut butter today. My goodness! How delicious! And cheaper to :-)* It also extrudes pasta. Plan on testing that out today/tomorrow.My standard juice recipe:* Carrots* Kale* Apples* Celery* Pineapple* Beets (start with less, if you or your family does not like beets)* Watermelon (sometimes)
