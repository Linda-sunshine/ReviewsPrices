review/summary: What I was looking forreview/text: The only reason I give this a 4 star instead of 5 is because I would prefer that they use glass lids. In all of my internet searching trying to determine the best set of pots and pans I neglected to pay attention to the description of the lids and was a little disappointed when I opened the box to see that the lids weren't see through. It isn't a big deal, but I like to see my food as I cook it. Other than that these pans have done a great job. I am still trying to figure out the best prescription for making scrambled eggs so that the whole pan isn't covered with egg at the end. It will take practice and patience getting used to this cookware so if you like to turn your food on high to cook and walk away these are not the pans for you. If you are willing to do your homework and experiment than I would definitely recommend them. These are the nicest pots and pans I have ever owned and the price on Amazon was such a great find that I really can't complain about anything.
