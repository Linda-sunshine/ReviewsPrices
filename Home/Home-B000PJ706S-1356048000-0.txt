review/summary: Beautiful but Flawedreview/text: This kettle is so beautiful and it heats water so quickly that I hate to give it a bad review. I have owned it for about a year and use it at least twice a day. Yesterday it turned itself on and boiled dry. I didn't realize it was still on until I smelled melting plastic. I am still using it, but unplugging it after every use.
