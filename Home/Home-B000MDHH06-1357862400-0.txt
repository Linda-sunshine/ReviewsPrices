review/summary: My kid loves itreview/text: I bought this as a housewarming present for my son, who had moved into a new apartment, to help him meet his bachelor nutritional needs. He had said he wanted a juicer. I looked at several models, and some of the less expensive ones had feedback that they were flimsy and didn't stand up to daily use, but this one got good reviews. He now says he juices (mostly carrots) every day and lives this unit -- it's the best thing he's got going to maintain a healthy diet... says it's also easy to maintain.
