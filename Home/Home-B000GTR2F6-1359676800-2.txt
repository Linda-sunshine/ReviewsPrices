review/summary: Purchased this and like it so much, bought another for a friend as a gift....review/text: This is a great coffee maker, as in our home, everyone likes different flavors, and therefore, this is the best of all worlds. It would be great if we could get the coffee a little bit cheaper as it can be expensive. It comes with a couple of free boxes when you purchase directly from Keurig's online, but I find it frustrating that many of the more exotic flavors are now discontinued.The coffeemaker does need periodic decalcification (after about 6 months). It appears to be very reliable.
