review/summary: Love itreview/text: This motor is strong and not ridiculously noisy considering I use it to do everything from mix dough to make nut butter. The blades that come with it do pretty much everything I need. i am able to clean it in the dishwasher. I would suggest getting the blade storage accessory with it.The last cuisinart I had lasted through my grandmother and myself (20+yrs.). I have high hopes for this one, too.
