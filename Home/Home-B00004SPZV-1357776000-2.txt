review/summary: Didn't Lastreview/text: The Misto Gourmet Olive Oil Sprayer spayed well for a few months. Then the spray turned into just a stream of oil. The first few times, just cleaning out the nozzle fixed the problem. After that, it couldn't be fixed. I bought it because my Pampered Chef one melted next to the stove, but they are really expensive. Maybe you really do &#34;get what you pay for.&#34;
