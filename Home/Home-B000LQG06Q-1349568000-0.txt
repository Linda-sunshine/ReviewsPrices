review/summary: Product is not as stated - BEWAREreview/text: When I ordered my "ViscO2 Ventilated Memory Foam Mattress Topper"size: Twin XLit stated on Amazon that the size was 78" x 37" ....in fact after allowing the pad to rest (in case it might expand) I measured and received a pad that was smaller than what was claimed/stated as it is only a 77" x 36" - 2" thick pad.It also stated/showed that the topper shipping weight was 11.6 lbs when in fact the UPS package (according even to UPS) only weighed 9.7 lbs.As far as it being "memory" foam I guess we have different definitions of what memory foam is.I had expected a topper similar to the Tempurpedic brand. After all the claim stated on Amazon was that I was saving 69% (paying $49.99 instead of $159.99 and they claimed I was saving $110.00).So is this topper worth keeping?If you're looking for a nice foam pad which appears to have a tiny bit of "memory" (as most basic foam pads might be seen as having) and you are willing to and can afford to pay a premium price for a "nice basic foam" pad with some holes punched in it then I say this is the topper for you.Me? I'm sleeping on it and it's better than "nothing" and don't have the energy to return it eventhough I feel that there was some major misrepresentation of the product and if I was to do it again would NOT be ordering this foam pad.
