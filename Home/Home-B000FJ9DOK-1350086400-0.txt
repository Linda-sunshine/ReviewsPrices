review/summary: This is a well designed bottle.review/text: Great design but I don't think it keeps the water cold as long as the thermos tumbler I bought at Walmart for $10. I also have the 20oz Klean Kanteen and that keeps ice and cold water much longer than this bottle.But it still keeps water cold a long time and is GREAT to use so I would recommend it to anyone.
