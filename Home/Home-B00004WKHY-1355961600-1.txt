review/summary: Lived up to my expectations!review/text: I did a lot of comparison shopping and reading of the reviews for food processors out there and decided on this Cuisinart 9-cup model. Although it costs a bit more than its competitors, I am very happy with my investment, and found a reasonably priced one on Amazon. The capacity is just right, it has an extremely powerful motor, and does a great job with grating, slicing, and pureeing foods. And I did not find that a lot of food was left above the blade when slicing or grating, as I read in reviews of other machines. I have a bread machine, so I have not yet tried out the bread making blade that came with this processor. I decided to purchase the blade storage container, which I like for safety, but find the child-proof lock on it just a little awkward to use (arthritis makes using it a little difficult).The part I like best about this product is that it is so easy to clean up and re-assemble. The only detraction might be its weight, but I expect more weight from a more powerful motor, and it is nicely balanced, so that moving it from my small storage counter to my working counter is no big deal. I would not try to store it on an upper shelf or on the fridge, though. All in all, I could not be more satisfied with this processor, and I highly recommend it!
