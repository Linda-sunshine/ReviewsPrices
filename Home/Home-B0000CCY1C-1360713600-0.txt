review/summary: i really like the small cookie scoopreview/text: i have a cookie scoop from italy that i purchased in a high end kitchen store that everyone is very familiar with. i needed a scoop while staying at my parents' house and decided to give this one a try. i purchased it based on reviews and have to admit, i wasn't sure i was going to love it as much as the one i have. i made endless dozens of christmas cookies and this scoop made it a breeze. i loved using this scoop. the cookies weren't too big, they were actually perfectly sized. the scoop is smooth and well made, and it was a third of the cost of the one i already owned.
