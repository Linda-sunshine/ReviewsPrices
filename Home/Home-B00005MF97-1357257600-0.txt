review/summary: top motor unit in contact with foodreview/text: I had bought the processor after my Sunbeam Little Oskar died. It is small and compact and does a good job of chopping small amounts of food. However I am returning it because the top part which contains the motor unit is directly on the food making it harder to clean. I will buy a chopper that is fully enclosed and all I have to do is put the chopping chamber into the dishwasher.
