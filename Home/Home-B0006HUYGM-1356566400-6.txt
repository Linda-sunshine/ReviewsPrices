review/summary: Strong Suction, a little bulkyreview/text: Machine has a lot of power; the brushes are strong; sometimes pull up the carpet! Flip front for vertical surfaces is a little awkward, but I'm not sure it could be designed differently. Filter needs cleaning fairly frequently. Overall, decent value.
