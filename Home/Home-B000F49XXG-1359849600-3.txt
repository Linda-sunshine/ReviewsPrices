review/summary: For All You Baristasreview/text: I have been making lattes for many years, the past few with a Breville Cafe Roma. Bought this one for the camper and have been using it to make sure it works ok. The shots are better than the Breville and for those that struggle with making a moist rich foam this is real easy. The main difference is the steam is created in the heating chamber and not pumped like the more expensive machines so you have to remember to fill the shot reservoir after you steam or you risk burning your coffee. Another plus is the plastic is PP, better for you and the Breville water container is a number 7, a known unhealthy plastic.
