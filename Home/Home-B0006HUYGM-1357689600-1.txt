review/summary: Great for small jobsreview/text: I purchased this for small jobs around the house and especially for the hose and attachment. I love that I can use the hose and not have to drag out a large vacuum. The suction power on this little vacuum is amazing and the bare floor feature is a plus too (where the brush can be turned off).
