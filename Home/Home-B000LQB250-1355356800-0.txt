review/summary: Too soft and too much of a chemical smellreview/text: I followed the required 48 hours and then some, to air out this memory foam but unfortunately, the chemical smell would not dissipate enough for me to be able to enjoy this product.In addition, to the smell, this memory foam is VERY soft, with very little density, causing you to sink too much into the foam. As a result, my pillow was too high and my neck was at an odd angle. Perhaps, I need to buy a thinner pillow when using this type of memory foam but I think it's related more to the density factor of this product.Pretty much agree with everyone else here who states, you get what you pay for.I give 1 star for the product and 1 star because they accepted the return without issue.
