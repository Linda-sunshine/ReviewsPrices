review/summary: Great Product, Would recommend to anyone!review/text: I got this food processor to replace one that I had that burnt up. I had a 7 cup of another brand before and decided to go ahead and spend the money to get a Cuisinart and the 9 cup. I am not disappointed. It works great. I have used it for grating and chopping everything and am very pleased! Our biggest use is homemade salsa and it chops everything together and just the right consistency.
