review/summary: Best water bottlereview/text: I'm quite pleased with this Thermos bottle. I filled it with ice and water in the afternoon, left it in the car while I shopped, opened it a few times to take a drink. Then I forgot it in the car all night...and it was a warm night. The next afternoon the water inside was cold and still had a clump of ice in it! It's easy to drink from and it doesn't leak.
