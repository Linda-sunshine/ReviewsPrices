review/summary: It changed our dinner routinereview/text: For the short review:Awesome. I absolutely love it.Slightly longer review:I ordered this as an educated impulse. It came up on the lightning deal of the day. I reviewed it and ordered it. Upon ordering it, I was informed that there was already a Rice Cooker in the house and we never use it. I have been wanting to modify my diet lately to include Salmon and Rice at least twice a week. I had recently obtained a Weber Grill, so I had the Salmon part down.This seemed like the best way to include the rice portion. It claimed a set it and forget it ability. That part is absolutly correct.It has never failed to produce perfectly cooked rice. I am now trying out all kind of Rice recipes and loving it.The inclusion of rice in my regular diet has already shown me some benefits.The ease of use is amazing.The size is perfect for a house of one to three people.I am actually thinking of getting a larger one just to do some complete rice meals that I have found in the book.Bottom line:The simplicity of use and quality of rice produced makes it enjoyable to use.Clean up is almost effortless.
