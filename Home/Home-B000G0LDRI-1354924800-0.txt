review/summary: Like living by an airport, but excellent at humidifying.review/text: I live in Las Vegas, NV, where we have low humidity and 4 inches of rain per year. How dry is it here? It is SO DRY that our ice maker makes DRY ice!I've owned Vornado brand but the pads need to be replaced every 2 months, or you have really nasty mould growing, and they get clogged with dust and stop working. That is expensive.I had a highly reputed ultrasonic unit, which had to be tossed because the white dust (which clings to plastic surfaces) was making my wife's asthma much worse. Also, the unit was CONSTANTLY in need of cleaning. (The mineral removal cartridge never did much to remove the white dust.)This machine is HUGE."Quiet Care!?" The twin water tanks sit side by side, and when the motor is running (even on Low), the vibrations make all the plastic pieces BUZZ. We found that placing a large, heavy bed pillow on top changed the pitch so that it could be tolerated. If you are not hearing impaired, you WILL BE after sleeping with this machine one year.Lucky for me, we have a master suite with an open bathroom, so the unit is in the bathroom, as far as possible away from us at night. That makes the noise tolerable.The evaporation pad (actually a big ring), which I flip over every day, looks like it really will last a full season. And it is cheap to replace.This is the best humidifier I have owned. It is not perfect. But it does a fabulous job of keeping the humidity in the room up. Low maintenance. Rather inexpensive.
