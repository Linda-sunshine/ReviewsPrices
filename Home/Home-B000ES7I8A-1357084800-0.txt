review/summary: Great Productreview/text: Bought this for our office. Boils water quickly and fits nicely in our &#34;tea-station&#34;. The stay-cool feature is great. It feels solid in spite of the plastic handle. Also like not having a power cord attached to it. Everyone in our office is happy with this product.
