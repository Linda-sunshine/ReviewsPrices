review/summary: Must have, worth the money!review/text: After i ordered the juicer, i waited impatiently. Once it arrived i immediately UN-boxed, unwrapped, washed, and started juicing. I've had it for about a month, and its fantastic, I've juiced tons of items from mixed greens, cabbage, peppers, berries, apples, tomatoes etc. it works great, clean up is pretty easy, the only part that is a little hard is the screen. However the included brush is very helpful. The Juicer does a great job and doesn't leave a lot of liquid behind, the waste may feel damp but trust me it only held onto a tablespoon or so in the 5 occasions i tried to re-juice the pulp/waste. I love this juicer and even though i didn't want to spend the extra money I'm happy i did. One last thing if you are afraid of the foam or just don't like the taste but want to juice anyways. juice veggies and greens first, then fruit to help it get mixed together better. oh and the pitcher included does a pretty good job of keeping foam out while you pour but you can spoon off the excess if you choose.P.S. you could make and awesome Bloody Mary's by juicing a jalapeno first then your tomatoes..... add pepper, Worcestershire (&lt;- i don't think anyone really knows how to spell it :)..) and your liquor. feel snazzy....
