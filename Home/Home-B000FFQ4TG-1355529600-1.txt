review/summary: Complete disappointmentreview/text: I can only blame myself for making an impulse buy, but this product receives a 1-star for three reasons:1. The Velocity Brew is made in China. I went Bunn because I thought I was buying American.2. It demands energy all of the time. I would prefer a coffee maker that takes longer to brew and doesn't need to warm water at all times. It seems like a complete waste of energy.3. It's not suited for left-handed people! The coffee pot only has the cup-levels labeled on one side...the side you would see if you reached for it with your right hand.
