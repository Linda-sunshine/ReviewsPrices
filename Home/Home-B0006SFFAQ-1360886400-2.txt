review/summary: Constant Use, Never Fails, Flawless Performerreview/text: My Most Used Kitchen ApplianceOne year of use so far and I could not expect more from any coffee maker.Auto Timer functions perfectly.Hold Temperature is Just RightSpacing between pot bottom and heated base is perfect for allowing drips to burn off without the usual sputter and pops associated with other drip makers that have water trapped beneath the pot.Energy used while brewing is comparable with other drip coffee makers, hold temp clicks heat pad on and off as necessary.Screen for grounds is durable and perfectly sized to prevent grounds from getting into coffee, yet doesn't clog.Plunger in filter basket allows taking coffee while brewing... (don't be slow or the drip basket WILL overflow)Easily cleaned and serving temperature is perfect for my taste.I would buy another one, BUT have upgraded to the model which also grinds the beans and absolutely LOVE that one also.Would absolutely recommend it to a friend without reservation.Same coffee maker used on the set of the popular sit com- Two and a Half Men, so even Malibu likes it!
