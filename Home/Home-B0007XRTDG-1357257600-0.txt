review/summary: Perfect for company dinner!review/text: I live alone and rarely cook, but have frequent overnight family and dinner guests and suddenly need to cook for four to six people. This is my &#34;family&#34; cook pot and we can just set it right in the serving line. Perfect for frying, saut&eacute;ing and also soups/stews. I can go from being a microwave queen to my Martha Stewart incarnation with just one pot!
