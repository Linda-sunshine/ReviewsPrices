review/summary: Great pad!review/text: I have a single bed with four inches of memory foam on it. The sheets would always crumple to one side of the bed from me climbing in and out. Every couple of days the bed would have to be torn down to the fitted sheet and made fresh again. The pad stopped all of that nonsense and accommodates the memory foam well. Highly recommended.
