review/summary: Time will tellreview/text: While I stand amazed that this pan was not damaged in shipping, I am also quite pleased with its performance so far. It does take more time to heat up than others, but the results have been consistently outstanding regardless of the food being cooked. I have used it for bacon, chops, mushrooms and onions, sandwiches, and various egg dishes (always with cheese) to include frittatas finished under the broiler. Initial seasoning was easy, rubbing in an olive/canola oil mix after cleaning. After that, "slick" is an understatement. Only time will tell how long the non-stick finish will last.
