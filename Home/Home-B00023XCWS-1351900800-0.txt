review/summary: Proctor Silex, fast heat, flawed handlereview/text: This kettle did exactly what it was supposed to do. Heats water quickly and is easy to use. My only issue was the way the handle is attached to the lid is not the best. The plastic handle is attached on each side with screws and if it is over-tightened it can crack, break the plastic and the handle can lift off. This could be a safety concern if the kettle is full of hot water when the handle breaks. I was able to heat one kettle full of water before I realized why the handle felt so loose, one side was completely cracked through the plastic. Amazon was great at processing the return, I packed it up, dropped it at the shippers and received my credit. I think I will be looking for a metal kettle now instead of plastic, it will be safer.
