review/summary: Great itemreview/text: This handy item is great. I like to put a hot chocolate pacet in the cup and then the machine fills it with hot water stir and yumm. also when I make coffee I lke to put cream and sugar in the cup. really good. If I just want one mug of coffee and do not want to use the travel mug it works just fine. I do not know how I got by without this item. Being the only coffee drinker in my household this has really helped to keep me from dronking waaay too much coffee. Not as tempted when I make it one cup at a time. I highly recommend these.
