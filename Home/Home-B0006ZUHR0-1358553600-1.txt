review/summary: Very Nice Ironreview/text: We seem to go through irons fairly regularly. We try to find heavier irons that heat quickly and this one seems to be both. The little water filling cup is a joke and was thrown away the first time we used it. The only change I would make to this iron is a memory setting for the temperature. Everytime you plug it in, it starts at the lowest setting. The steam is excellent. We have tried Rowenta and Shark among many others. This iron works as well as those for a lot lower cost.
