review/summary: It won't turn offreview/text: For the first month or so everything worked very well. I love how easy it is to set the independent alarms. About a week ago the off button stopped working. The radio will not turn off, even after power cycling the clock. The only way I can sleep is to turn the volume knob all the way down.
