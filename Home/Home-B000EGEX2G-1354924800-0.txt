review/summary: Great Glider!review/text: We looked at several glider and ottoman combos in stores and they all exceeded $350. We wanted a good quality and stylish chair however for something we are not planning on using for more than a year could not justify the price being charged in stores. We purchased this set from Amazon and were very pleased with the delivery time, quality and ease of assembly. It is a perfect size for a nursery, very comfortable and made of quality materials and is a great value.
