review/summary: Good but messyreview/text: I purchased this juicer after the Jack Lalanne one broke after a week. It's definitely better, however there is one flaw to this machine, hence the -1 star. Every time you lift up the food pusher from the top, pulp seems to fly out, making a mess on your counter.
