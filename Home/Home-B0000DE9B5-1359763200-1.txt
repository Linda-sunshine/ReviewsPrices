review/summary: great pitcherreview/text: I keep water in the fridge with essential oils added to it, so I needed glass. these pitchers are wonderful. compact, so i can put them just about anywhere. the lid is tricky, but totally stays on tight...no leaks. I have two and am very pleased with my purchase. we use them daily.
