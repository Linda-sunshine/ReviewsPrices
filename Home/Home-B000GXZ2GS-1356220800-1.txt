review/summary: Best coffee maker ever!review/text: This makes better coffee than any other coffee maker I've used, and I've tried many different varieties and brewing techniques. It also cleans up very easily, which is a huge plus. I use mine daily at my office. The water that comes out of the hot side of our break-room water cooler is almost exactly the 180F that the instructions say is ideal, so that means making coffee is just about as quick as it can be. Since I bought this and brought it to work, 6 of my coworkers have bought one as well. I should be getting a commission!
