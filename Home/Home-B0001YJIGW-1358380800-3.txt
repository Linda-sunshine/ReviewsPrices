review/summary: Best Invention Everreview/text: This is a great compliment to my beautiful 72" double slipper cast iron claw foot tub. I took it for a spin last night & was able to add an additional 3" of bath water to luxuriate in - still could have added another inch to the water. The seal was fast & solid. Nice to know that you can through into the washing machine to disinfect it. Like the flexibility of unit & that is is not rigid plastic. If you want to soak in your tub without losing your water to the overflow - get one of these.
