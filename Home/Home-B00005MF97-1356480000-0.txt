review/summary: Perfect for chopping nutsreview/text: I got this device to chop nuts for gluten free crackers. I make these all the time and was tired of getting the big food processor out and cleaning it and putting it away. Besides the food processor is LOUD. Well I received it and started using right away. It is quiet and convenient and it does a better job chopping nuts than the larger processor.One or two down sides to this unit. 1. When you put the nuts into the bowl, you need to make sure that none are under the S-blade. It will not run unless the blade is all the way down. The way I have dealt with it is to put my finger on the top of the plastic blade unit while pouring the nuts or seed into the bowl. Then carefully place the lid on. Works every time.2. The blades are as sharp as a surgical scalpel. BEWARE. I was drying it the first time I used it and got a nasty little cut on my thumb. And that was through a paper towel. Care must be used when handling the blade.Otherwise this little baby does a lot with a little. Great price, great product. Good Job Black and Decker.
