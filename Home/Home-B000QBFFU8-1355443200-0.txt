review/summary: Good reliable juicerreview/text: We use this 3 to 5 times a week. It works and works well.The good:*POWER: 900 watts of juicing glory! we drink carrot juice a lot and this thing goes through them like nobody's business*Easy to clean: the brush that comes with it is clutch. Works well to clean the mesh screen, which is the hardest part to clean. Total clean time is about 2 - 3 min. no complaints here.*Multi-speed: With so much power, you really need to tone it down for softer fruits and veggiesThe Bad:*Bananas are wasted: Don't even try them unless you are okay with about 1 tablespoon worth of juice per banana, better off putting them in a blender. same is true with other soft fruits (i.e. raspberries, blueberries, etc)*Size: This is debatable, but just want to give a heads up, this thing is BIG. 900 watts is no joke. But it does look good on my countertop
