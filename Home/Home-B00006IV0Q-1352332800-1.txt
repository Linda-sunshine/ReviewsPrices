review/summary: not all stainless steelreview/text: i had to write this review because i contacted presto regarding a metal taste in my coffee. i was told that the bottom part of the maker (the round shaped bottom inside the pot) is not SS, but instead aluminum. just a warning. not sure what is better aluminum or plastic parts, but now you are warned.
