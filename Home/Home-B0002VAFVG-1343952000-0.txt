review/summary: Excellent Juicer, with a few minor but understandable flawsreview/text: I love this juicer! I've used it at least daily since I got it 3 weeks ago. I have mostly used it for carrot juice, though I'm always experimenting with other veggies and fruits. I love how easy it is to keep clean (I wash it immediately after use). I put a plastic bag in the pulp catcher to reduce the mess as well. I wish it could get more juice out of leafy greens, but I guess I'll have to find a masticating juicer for those.Pros: Very effective juicer for carrots, apples, nectarines, celery, pears, peachesCleans easily, easy disassembly, reassemblylooks good on the counterrelatively quiet for the RPMs it's doing.Cons: Not terribly effective at juicing Kale, spinach, etc (I tried rinsing them immediately before, and it helped, but not by much). Also, strawberries, blackberries, blueberries and raspberries were not juiced very fully on either high or low speeds - I prefer to blend those.Other observations: Why the cord comes out of the front of the juicer is beyond me. inconvenient cord placement, guys!
