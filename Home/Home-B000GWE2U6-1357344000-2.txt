review/summary: Works great and cute.review/text: Works great. Our daughter kept having this dry cough during the night. We got this for her room and it help dramatically. The only thing I would say is that it is a little awkward to refill because of the shape. My husband actually dropped it in the tub while he was refilling it and it completely busted so had to order a new one. So be careful when filling.
