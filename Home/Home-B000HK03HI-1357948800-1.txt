review/summary: Don't like the locking mechanismreview/text: Well, it works. That's about all I can say about it that I like. We got this as a wedding gift--not exactly sure why, as we never put a can opener, manual or electric, on our registry. I had absolutely no intention of using it, as I have a metal Swing Away can opener, have had it for years, and it does the job. I only used this because our neighbor borrowed that one and forgot to bring it back as soon as she bought a new one for herself, and I found myself in need of a can opener while making soup. I don't like it. I don't need a magnet or a locking mechanism on my can opener, and I really don't like the locking piece of it. I don't want to have to unlock a can opener every time I want to use it, or immediately after opening a can with it to remove it from the can. It seems ergonomic, which I guess is great, but once I find it difficult to open cans (yes, if I get arthritis eventually, which is a possibility for anyone), I'll just buy an electric can opener. I don't see the need for a fancy can opener for my kitchen, as while I do open lots of cans, I'm not opening 20 a night like a restaurant might. Regular old metal ones are just fine.
