review/summary: My 7th Yearreview/text: This is the 7th year to use the gel. I usually buy about one case per year to enjoy through the winter months in Oregon. Nice heat output and light crackle. I live in an older condo downtown without a fireplace so this is a great substitute for that and much easier than chopping wood! Enjoy.
