review/summary: I reseasoned the pan when it arrived.review/text: I did the inside and outside surfaces with lard and placed it in the oven upside down for 1 hour at 350 Deg. F., I only wash it in hot water when cleaning it and put in on the stove after drying it out, turn the burner on for 3 Min., apply peanut oil all around the indide of the pan and it's ready to use again with no rust forming.
