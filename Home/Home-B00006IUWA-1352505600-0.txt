review/summary: Efficient clean way to pop popcornreview/text: We purchased this Presto air popper after using one at our daughter's home. I pops corn with no mess and leaves very few unpopped kernals. The popcorn is an excellent low calorie and low sodium snack. It is well made and very easy to use witht he built in measuring cup. It is very cost effective when compared to typical microwave popcorn selections.
