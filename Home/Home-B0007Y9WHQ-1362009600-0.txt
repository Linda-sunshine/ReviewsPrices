review/summary: Simply easy and FUN!review/text: Love how it made LOADS of zucchini spaghetti! Delicious with home-made pesto! Many stated that they didn't like the 1/8&#34; that is 'lost' when you use the machine but it is so easily used in other dishes or just chopped up and added to the spirals. I love this and cannot believe I have prepared tons of meals without it! Buy this!
