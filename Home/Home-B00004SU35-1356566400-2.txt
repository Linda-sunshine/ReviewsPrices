review/summary: a good to very good popperreview/text: if you follow the instructions, you will get delicious popcorn with no kernals unpopped. add a little salt, and you will be extremely happy with the taste - it beats the mass produced popcorn by about a 1000%. if i had to add a negative: it's a lightweight pot and that makes it feel somewhat cheesy, but it does just what it's supposed to so who cares?
