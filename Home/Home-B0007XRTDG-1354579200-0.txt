review/summary: Nice replacementreview/text: I bought this skillet for my husband. He had a 10+ year old skillet. The handles were broken and the temperature gauge didn't work anymore. The cover was not see through, which I hated.The other night my husband tried it out for the first time and he really liked it. The temperature gauge worked well and he didn't have to guess anymore, food did not stick to the pan and was heated evenly throughout. There was much less splatter to clean up with the glass cover. I am thankful for that, since I usually do the cleanup. Have not put it in the dishwasher yet, but according to the manufacturer you can.This skillet is a bit larger than the previous one we had. My husband said he could probably cook a whole chicken in it or 6 pork chops pretty easily. The pan is deep and the top just a cover. Our old skillet was just the opposite, which didn't make sense to me. This skillet makes stirring or mixing things without spilling a cinch.Overall, my husband is happy with his replacement.12/5/12 update I tried to put the skillet in my dishwasher and it doesn't fit with the handles on. My dishwasher is a regular size. Well, it does fit but with nothing else in there. I'll be washing it by hand, since I don't want to keep taking the handles off and I can't rationalize the amount of waste it would create by being the only item in the dishwasher.
