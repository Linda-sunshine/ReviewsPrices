review/summary: Perfect for the small jobsreview/text: I would give this product 5 stars if it held more food. I know, I know, I purchased a MINI-prep, I should expect it to only process small jobs. The thing I didn't realize though, is that you can't really fill these things to maximum capacity or even close to it. You can fill it about 2/3 full before it starts to not process well. All that being said, this thing is the BEST for very small processing jobs. A cup of nuts, salad dressing, sauce for rice bowls... For those things it works GREAT! The light green color is exactly what I wanted and matches my kitchen perfectly. It is simple to use with only 2 buttons - although I don't see much difference between the chop and grind button. They are helpful to alternate though, as it reverses the blade and keeps things from getting stuck in the processor. I have actually made some pretty large batches of food with this little thing, it just takes 4 or 5 uses with the processor to get the job done. For a mini processor, this thing is great. Don't expect this thing to do anything more than a small job and you won't be disappointed one bit. When they come out with the papa version in the same color, I will be the first to buy it...
