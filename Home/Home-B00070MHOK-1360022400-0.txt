review/summary: Look it's a fountain!!!review/text: Terribly disappointed with this product. I used it acceptably for about 5 minutes. After that this thing just kept spewing water like it's a fountain. And YES, the water line is below the MAX line! Yet another product here at amazon that makes me wonder who writes these really high reviews. I think it's a bunch of guys from the maker of this steamer flooding amazon with great reviews to increase visibility for their product. This is a massive fail product. Unless of course you are looking for something to spray your garden with or something.
