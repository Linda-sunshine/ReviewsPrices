review/summary: Wish I had read the Reviewsreview/text: Does it make good coffee ... yes. But everything else is terrible. I have used the unit for a few weeks and it makes a good cup of coffee and I have had no issues. That said, the unit is not tall enough to get any cup under the dispenser. I end up taking out the metal tray. I even bought more cups and searched DeLonghi for a solution ... none found. Bottom line ... works well but I wish that I had returned it ...
