review/summary: Best kitchen purchase ever.review/text: It never occurred to me that on a student budget it could be a worthwhile expenditure to get a waffle maker, but I've never looked back since getting this little Cuisinart! We love how easy it is to use, how perfectly you can calibrate your waffle-making to your preference for soft or crispy waffles, and how easy it is to clean -- not to mention how delicious its products are. Friends who have stayed with us loved the waffle maker as well, and we've even taken it to dinner parties for the &#34;dessert&#34; portion of dinner. Special bonus: It's super-easy to store either flat or on its ends.
