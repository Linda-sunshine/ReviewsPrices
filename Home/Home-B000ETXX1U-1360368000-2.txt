review/summary: Not worth the pricereview/text: I was close to 2 stars for this product. I actually ended up returning it, so I probably should have been tougher on them. But, the reason I returned it was more related to price for quality than anything else. I can't blame Wenzel for setting the price wherever they want to, they just can't expect me to pay it.I just didn't find this bed comfortable. Plus, it's just too big. Takes up a ton of space, both filled and folded. If you have enough space for this thing, why not just get a real bed?I ended up buying an Intex bed for half the price. Honestly, it's just as comfortable (not great), and half the price. So I'll take the savings...
