review/summary: Buy one!review/text: Love the color, they say nickel pearl, I say flat silver but I love it! I used an older version of this mixer and then I moved out of my mom's and bought my own. This one definitly has more power. I hate needing bread because the workout makes you gain muscle like a man, so this helps prevent that for me. The plastic thing to help you pour your ingredients in the the mixing bowl is really stupid and unnecessary. I put it somewhere in the closet or in the garage, but trust me you dont need it.
