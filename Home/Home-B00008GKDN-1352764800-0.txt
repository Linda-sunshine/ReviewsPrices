review/summary: Love it, love it. love it!review/text: I got this griddle so that I could make homemade tortillas, and to heat store-bought ones easily. I did have to season it more, which is easy. It takes longer to preheat than a standard pan, but the results are well worth it! Perfect tortillas every time! My son is a quesadilla addict and loves the tortillas. It also works great for pancakes. I use it so often, I just leave it out one my stove. It now has a lovely coat of seasoning on it, which makes it very easy to clean, especially since I don't cook anything gooey in it. I recommend getting Lodge's handle mitt too, since the handle get quite hot.
