review/summary: Eureka hand vac 71Breview/text: I was looking for a hand vac that picked up pet hair. I have went through many and the Eureka hand vac 71B is great. It has a rotating brush and a hose to get small places. It has alot of power and suction. If you have pets and can't stand hair all over your furniture this is what you need. It is lightweight and easy to use. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!
