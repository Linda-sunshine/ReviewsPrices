review/summary: Works like a charmreview/text: This is the single most useful hand-held appliance in my kitchen. I'm getting rid of my old blender (hello, more cabinet space!) and am eating healthier now that I can whip up fruit shakes so easily. The measuring cup (included) is great for portion control as well. The blender is sturdy, well-made, and I expect it to provide delicious food for years to come.
