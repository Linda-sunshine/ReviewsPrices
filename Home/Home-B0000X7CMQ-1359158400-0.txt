review/summary: Great coffee maker - for a while.review/text: I loved this coffee maker for all it's positive features - programmable, keeps coffee hot for a LONG time in its wonderful carafe, easy settings etc. BUT...after replacing it three times, it's time for a change. They work great for several months, even a year or so, then something always goes wrong and it starts dumping the coffee all over the counter and floor - not a pleasant sight when one first arrives in the kitchen in the morning. I went to great pains to try to clean out any plugged up areas and the parts came apart but the 'nipple', if you will, that pours the coffee into the carafe would not stay in place. The heating element (or some kind of spring) is now exposed, rendering the entire machine useless. I've had enough! Bought a Cuisinart today. Fingers crossed...
