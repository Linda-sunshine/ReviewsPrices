review/summary: Love it.review/text: This arrived on time. It works great. This has 200 watts and you can sure feel it, I usually buy the 120 watts and I had no idea what I was missing. I've used this blender to make soups and pesto, both turned out very creamy. I like that the bottom part detaches from the motor because it makes it much easier to clean. I recomend this product and would buy it again.
