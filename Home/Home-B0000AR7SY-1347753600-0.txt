review/summary: A nice grinder at a nice pricereview/text: The Caprezzo Infinity grinder is less noisy than my "chopper" which I previously used, and grinds well for each of my four different needs - I have a drip pot, a press pot, a stovetop espresso pot, and an espresso machine.I have one small caveat: the hopper and the drawer into which the grounds fall are both made of polycarbonate, which is a relatively brittle plastic. When mine arrived, a small piece was broken off the bottom of the hopper. (This is not the only time I have received a piece of equipment made of polycarbonate which was broken in transit.) It turned out to be crucial, as the upper burr was locked into position by the hopper. Fortunately, a little superglue fixed the problem. But I do wish that parts made of polycarbonate were better packed. And I am taking good care not to crack those pieces. (But just so you know, polycarbonate can be easily superglued.)I have also had the static problem complained of in other reviews, but it doesn't bother me too much. All in all, I'm extremely happy with this grinder.
