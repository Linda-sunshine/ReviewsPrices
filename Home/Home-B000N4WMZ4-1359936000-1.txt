review/summary: Where has this been all my life?review/text: I have a small enamel Le Creuset dutch oven and because of the size had not really used it much. I purchased the Lodge for using in Artisan Bread making and since then it has become my favorite piece of cookware. It is beautiful, the handle is metal so can take the high temps for bread, and it cleans up like a dream. So glad that I got it for the bread making because now I have it for everything else :-)
