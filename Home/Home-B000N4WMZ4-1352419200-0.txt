review/summary: love itreview/text: got this as a gift for hubby, We love cast iron, I have switched all my non stick cookware out for cast iron over time and already have a smaller oval dutch oven and went in for the bigger one this time. I love it have used it several times with no problems, I was worried about the handle, but didnt want to spend the $$$ on the le crusets etc, high end ones. The handle is holding up fine after several times in the oven at high heats. So far so good!!
