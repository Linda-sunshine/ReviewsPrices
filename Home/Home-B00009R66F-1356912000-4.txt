review/summary: Pretty good quality.review/text: It really cleans quite well. But, one thing i would change, is where it sucks up water in the front. There is really no way to clean that. You can suck up clean water, and it cleans it somewhat, but I wish there was some way to take it apart, and there is not. Also, using the furniture cleaners, is such a hassle, I am not going to use that brush. Too much junk to hang on the cleaner, just too difficult to use.But, for carpet cleaning it really cleans well. With a new puppy, its a must. I will see how it holds up, so far so good.That is why i rated it a 3, for the carpet cleaner , alone, i would rate it a 4.
