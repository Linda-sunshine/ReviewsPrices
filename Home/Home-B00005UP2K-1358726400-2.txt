review/summary: Not what I thought!review/text: I bought it at Bed Bath and Beyond because of their return policy. After 3 uses I noticed a dusting of black powder that fell into my batter (only noticeable because my batter was cream color. I took my machine back and was told that another customer returned theirs as well for the same reason. Pay attention to your batter.
