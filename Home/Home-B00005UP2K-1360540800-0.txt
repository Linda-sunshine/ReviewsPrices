review/summary: This was a big hit!review/text: Bought this and a necklace for my girlfriend for her birthday. She was a lot more excited about getting this than the jewelry. She couldn't wait to use it. She's said that she's wanted one for years. It replaced a sunbeam or hamilton beach mixer, I'm not sure. But there's no comparison between the KitchenAid and any of the others.Got a great deal and Stufforegon shipped it and we had it several days before her birthday!
