review/summary: LOVE IT!review/text: Definitely worth the time looking for it, and the money spent on it. :) I couldn't be more happy with it. Rice cooks beautifully in it, and keeps for QUITE a while. (We accidentally left rice in there over the weekend once. It didn't leave a smell or get all wet/yellow or anything! ...though we didn't eat it.)
