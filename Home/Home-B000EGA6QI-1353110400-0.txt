review/summary: Wife Loves Itreview/text: She watches a lot of those Food Network how-to shows and says it's a big help when making soups and sauces. Very sturdily built, nice design (looks good with her Kitchenaid mixer she says -- also blue, also purchased here), easy to operate. Not much else to say. If you need a good immersion blender I can't see a good reason to get something more expensive, based on my wife's thoughts.
