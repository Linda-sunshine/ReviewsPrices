review/summary: Great little single coffee makerreview/text: I have this for over 6 years and it finally died this morning. I can't blame it for that it got it's use that is for sure. It always made a great cup of coffee and quickly. I love that it has a reusuable filter basket so I'm not throwing away a filter every morning. I can't wait until my next one comes.
