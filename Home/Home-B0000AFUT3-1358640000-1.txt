review/summary: didn;t last longreview/text: I was given a mirror such as this from a friend who had since she was a teenager. when she gave it to me she was 48 and I've had for about 10 years after. Then it finally retired. So I bout this new one just like it. It only lasted six months. first the mirror failed then the plug attached to the mirror failed. Things these day are not made to last. Won;t buy another again.
