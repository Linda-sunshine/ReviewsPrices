review/summary: I am very pleased!review/text: Pretty much the cheapest vacuum out there and totally worth it!!! We got this after having trouble with the Hoover that arrived damaged twice and I was totally skeptical given the low price but I must say I am quite impressed, this is perfect for what we need and the retractable handle stick makes it very convenient to stow!
