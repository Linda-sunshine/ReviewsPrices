review/summary: Delicious!review/text: I've got one for tea, and one for coffee. I actually use the coffee one more - my coworkers were very curious about it at first, but now there are a few converts. Pour your coffee grounds in, pour hot water in, and give it a stir. The taste (and look) is much like a gravity-fed french press.Of course, it makes great tea too.
