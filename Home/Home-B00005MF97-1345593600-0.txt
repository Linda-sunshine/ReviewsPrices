review/summary: Chops Well, Cleans Easyreview/text: This is a great little food processor/chopper. I've had it for about 6 months. Haven't had any issues with it. Works like a charm. Chops things nicely and evenly. Blade has remained sharp. Comes apart really easy so cleaning it is a breeze. Only very minor issue is the top, which is connected to the cord, has to be washed with a little care. Since it houses all the electronic bits, you have to be careful about how wet you let it get when cleaning. Basically, just a quick swipe with a wet paper towel should do the trick. Like it says, it's only 3 cups (and you're not supposed to fill it if you expect it to work), so don't expect this thing to make a pitcher of smoothies for everyone. If all you need is a little helper to chop onions, garlic, nuts, etc, this will do the trick pretty cheap!
