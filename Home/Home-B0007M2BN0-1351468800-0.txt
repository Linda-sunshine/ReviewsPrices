review/summary: gets too hot to handlereview/text: Good for hard eggs, but difficult to get soft eggs. I like soft eggs, but even 5min in the microwave gave a hard egg white with runny yolk. Some people might like this kind of eggs though. Maybe I'll try 4min next time. My main problem is that i burn my fingers each time I use this. It gets so hot I have to use mittens to get it out of the microwave, and it's almost impossible to pry open the lid with mittens. They say you're supposed to let it cool, but it takes a long time to cool, and I want to run the eggs immediately under cold water so they don't overcook.
