review/summary: Scale Reviewerreview/text: This product came in the mail very fast. It is also very simple to use, BUT it will not give you an accurate read every time. I have calibrated it over 20 times and it still gives varying weight. Not much but still different reads. Ranging from 4.5-5.2gs. Would not recommend this product even though the price is very reasonable.
