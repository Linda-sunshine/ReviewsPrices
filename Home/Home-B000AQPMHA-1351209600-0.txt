review/summary: Very upsetreview/text: Got the first one. It stopped working. We Sent it back to amazon and they sent a new one. This one acted the same as the last one. It worked for a while and then stopped. I was so angry I put it on the shelf, then decided the trash was the best place for it. With a tea drinker in the family this was thought to be ideal. But beware some of these are lemons
