review/summary: Noticeable differencereview/text: Now I see the difference between a quality knife and a regular one. I'd had a few &#34;Chef's Knives&#34; from different sets I'd acquired over the years, but none were of great quality. After reading reviews on ATK and Amazon, I decided to give this one a try and am very pleased I did. First time I cut with it I noticed the difference, and now use it for everything. I'm also very impressed with the brand, and will surely buy other products from them in the future.
