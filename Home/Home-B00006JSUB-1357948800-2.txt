review/summary: Fine cast iron skilletreview/text: I have had this skillet for a long time. After having used this for so long, I have finally learned how to use it better.There are several different versions of how you season a cast iron skillet. I did not use a "best practice" before. And I wondered why food would stick to the skillet. . . I have checked out suggestions on the Internet and have come to know how to season this better. More recently, I have not had those same problems.I had moved away from cast iron skillets to nonstick skillets. My recent return to my 12 inch cast iron skillet has convinced me to use this as opposed to my nonsticks. I even purchased a cast iron Dutch Oven recently as a result of recent successes with this tool.So, a satisfied user. . . .
