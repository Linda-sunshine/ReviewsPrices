review/summary: The Giver seriesreview/text: I enjoyed the series as a whole. I felt the story lines were heart warming, relatable, exciting and interesting. I wanted to see where their lives went and how things developed for them. I read the series quickly to keep up with the adventures. I would recommend it to others.
