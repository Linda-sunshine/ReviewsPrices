review/summary: Good product, tasty wafflesreview/text: I have been meaning to buy a waffle maker for some time, but I didn't want to buy a Belgian waffle maker. When I found this product I decided to give it a try and I am glad I did. The product is well built and looks nice in the kitchen. A cooked waffle is 8 or so inches across, and the pattern is slightly larger than an Eggo, but not large like the Belgian waffle, which is how I like my waffles. As with every waffle maker I have ever used, a nonstick spray like Pam is absolutely needed to keep the waffles from sticking, but that is true of all waffle makers. The one unexpected feature that is very nice is the ability of the maker to stand vertically on its own. This makes storage nice as you don't have to store horizontally or deal with the device falling over. The only negative, and it is not the fault of Cuisinart, is that since the outside of the waffle maker is steel, touching it anywhere but the plastic when hot will burn. My previous waffle maker had a completely plastic outside, so that was not the case. Once I get used to remembering to only touch the plastic while hot, I won't burn myself any more.The bottom line from me: good product, tasty waffles, and a good choice if you're looking for a waffle maker.
