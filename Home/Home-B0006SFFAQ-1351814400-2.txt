review/summary: 10+ Years and Still Going!review/text: I just had to chime in and say that when my KEURIG broke down for the SECOND time!!!! This coffee maker has saved us! While the Keurig was a nice novelty while it lasted, I don't want a 3rd let down...We're buying bags of coffee once again and this model just keeps on running smooth! Stocking up on filters and getting a coffee grinder here on Amazon(Cuisinart). If this one breaks down, I'm buying ANOTHER! I already know it will last at least a decade without malfunction unlike the other coffee fads out there!!!The coffee has always come through fabulous (of course if you buy fabulous coffee). I highly recommend this coffeemaker. It's such a great price now! I remember paying original price for this! Would make a great gift and now they have all these fun colors... Yay!
