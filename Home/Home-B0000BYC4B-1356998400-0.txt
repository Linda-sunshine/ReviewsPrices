review/summary: Perfect for after the seal is brokenreview/text: After you break the seal of a canning jar, it needs to be refrigerated if you aren't using the entire contents. You can always use the tin lids, but they corrode and erode quickly. These plastic caps are the perfect solution. They seal nicely, and the hassle of a two piece lid is a non-issue. If you can a lot of food, these are a must have.
