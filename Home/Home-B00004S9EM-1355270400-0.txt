review/summary: Should have had one of these years agoreview/text: My girlfriend and I recently decided to try out the Paleo diet. We love the idea of avoiding "processed foods", but it means a lot more work in the kitchen. I had never used on of these before, but it quickly became a kitchen centerpiece. This thing is a beast! We use it on a daily basis for processing veggies, nuts, and fruits. It purees dates in no time. It's also handy for kneading up her gluten free baking recipes. It's also very easy to clean. The feeder tube seems a bit small, but that's not a huge issue. It has probably already saved us a couple hours of work in the month we've had it.
