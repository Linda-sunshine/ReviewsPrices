review/summary: Overhyped itemreview/text: I made my purchase based on the great reviews that this juicer had on Amazon.com and yes, the price was a factor as well.I got mine about 2 years ago. Since the moment I got it I was not impressed. Unfortunately I didn't get too much use out of this juicer. I got discouraged from using it because it was just such a big deal to clean. The opening where the jar and the place where the juice flows to will not be completely tight and some juice will leak. But the biggest thing is this juices will let big pieces go through without getting the juice from them! which is such a waste! (it would happened especially with greens..)the pulp (and the big un juiced junks..)would still be very moist and it really feels like there is more liquid in there that should be going to my jar!Over all I'm not happy with it and I'v tried better, yes for the price it is not too bad but if you think about it you waste so much produce and energy to clean this thing that and extra $50/$100 would be worth it.
