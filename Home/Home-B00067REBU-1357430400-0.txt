review/summary: Great machinereview/text: As long as what you put into this is golden, you will get great bread. I got the Bread Machine book and love the Vienna Bread Recipe. It is is just experimentation with recipes to turn out good bread. I used a scale to measure my ingredients and write it down until I get the desired loaf.Great value.
