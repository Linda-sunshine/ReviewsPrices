review/summary: a wedding giftreview/text: After owning my own for over a year now and having used it for all sorts of things I LOVE IT!!!The price was lower than what I paid for my own and I got free shipping with it. We got it as a wedding gift and I have to add that the shipping was super fast!!! A+++ Wow Thank you for great service. I am awaiting my son telling me he got it for our niece. (Delivered in plenty of time for him to gift wrap it and be ready for the reception days from now.)
