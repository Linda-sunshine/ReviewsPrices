review/summary: great little workhorsereview/text: Love all the uses this has! We have a small kitchen and space is at a premium, but this is worth it. We've only had it for a little over a month now, but have already made carnitas, chicken breasts, bbq tofu strips, beans (dry to done in 20 min), quinoa, rice and greens. My husband is a vegetarian and this has really helped him have easy quick meal options.
