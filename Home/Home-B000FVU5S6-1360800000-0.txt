review/summary: Very, very nicereview/text: Was pleasantly surprised by these beautiful sheets especially that they are only 400 thread count. Have seen so many sheet sets that are described as 800,1000 TC etc. and these look and feel much better. I chose these because specifically did not want that &#34;sateen&#34; look or feel. It makes sheets feel cheap to me. These are thick and yet soft with that nice fine hotel feel. Chose the 'smoke blue' color and it's beautiful- a nice dusty blue. For $59 for a queen set could not ask or find nicer. These were for guest bedroom but want some for my bed now too. Great purchase.
