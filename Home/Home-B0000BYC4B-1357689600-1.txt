review/summary: don't look backreview/text: i usually don't like to advocate plastic where recyclable materials will do, but in this case, i think that's wrong. i really needed these for my fermented products - like sourdough and preserved lemons - where the product sort of eats into the metal rings. i highly recommend these. I'm probably not looking back - it's all plastic lids from now on..
