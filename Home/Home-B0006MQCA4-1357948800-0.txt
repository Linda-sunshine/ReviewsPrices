review/summary: No more bottled waterreview/text: Great price on Amazon and saving money by not purchasing bottled water. As many reviewers have noted, the PUR is much better than Brita. Initially I wasn't happy with how long it took the water to filter in this pitcher compared to the Brita pitcher that I previously purchased but after more thought I realized if the water is just running straight through it must not be filtering very well. The really nice feature of this filter is that by the time the water filters into the main pitcher it's already cold because the upper section holds a large amount. I would definitely recommend this pitcher.
