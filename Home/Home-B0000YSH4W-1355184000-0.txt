review/summary: I bought this book for my young teen granddaughter.review/text: This is the second time I have bought this book. The first time was for another granddaughter several years ago. I like to see what young teens are reading, so I read it before I gave it to her. It was very thought-provoking. When I saw it on this granddaughter's Christmas list, I knew I should get it for her. It is a Newbery award winner, so you can't go wrong.
