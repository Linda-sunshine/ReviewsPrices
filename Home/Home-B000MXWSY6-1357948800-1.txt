review/summary: Good Clockreview/text: I have to admit: It's a little weird to take a clock out of the box, plug it in, and have it set itself to the right time. Yet, that's precisely what this clock did. The alarm has a variable volume on it, so it can be turned way up to awaken deep sleepers, like my dearly beloved, who could sleep through a marching band passing his bedside, or turned down for those like me who awaken easily. I have not had need of the dual alarm function, but have no doubt it would be just fine.
