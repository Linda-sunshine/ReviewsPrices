review/summary: I love this Humidifierreview/text: Ahhh my sinuses thank you Honeywell! This thing does a great job of humidifying my whole house! I do have to fill it close to 2 times a day, but I am A'ok with that. I do it fill it once in the AM and once in the PM. I've been using about a month now and have only one small complaint. Its a little bit of a pain to fill. But for the volume of water it holds, its such a minor thing. I recommend this unit and would definitely buy it again.
