review/summary: Keurig B70 Platinum failurereview/text: About a year ago we purchased a Keurig Platinum Coffee maker for our home. We used it daily, and last month it stopped working properly.The problem seemed to be with the controls, and I suspected the computer chip was malfunctioning. This occurred on Saturday night, but I still felt compelled to call the number molded into the bottom of the unit immediately to see if there was anything I could do to fix the problem.I was surprised when my call was immediately answered and woman to whom I spoke seemed genuinely concerned with trying to solve the problem.She requested information, model and serial number, purchase date and store, and a brief description of the trouble I was encountering. After a brief pause while she conferred with someone(s) else, she returned to the line, gave me a return authorization number, and requested that I return the removable cup holder portion of the unit. When I asked her if I needed to send the entire coffee maker back to Keurig, she said no, only the brew cup part, but I would be responsible for the return postage ($5.00). She said that she would immediately have a new (updated and improved) Keurig Platinum coffee maker shipped to me and that it should arrive (UPS) within four days. It did. We have been using the new one now for 2 months with no problems. My wife is buying a compact model Keurig for her office.Way to go Keurig!!!
