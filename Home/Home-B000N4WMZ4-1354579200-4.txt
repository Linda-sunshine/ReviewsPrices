review/summary: Move over Le Expensive brand!review/text: I had been lusting after a famous brand of enameled cast iron cookware for years, and had my trigger finger on the checkout button more than once to pony up nearly $300 for a dutch oven. I decided to do some research and found a number of great cooking blogs and websites that rated Lodge cookware to be no different in functionality than Le Expensive brand. When I saw Amazon was selling this pretty blue guy for under fifty smackers, I pounced. The trigger finger couldn't hold out any longer. Momma needed a brand new pan! My only beef (besides the stuff going in this beauty) is that it was made in China. I wish Lodge would consider making all their cookware stateside.
