review/summary: Wonderful product.review/text: This is a great product. You can't beat cast iron. However, it is a bit too small for cooking a large pizza. THe pizza barely fits. If you can afford it, the larger size would be better for a large and larger pizza. BUt, I use this product for other baking tasks. My biscuits no longer come out brown to black on the bottom and medium color on the top. Food cooks evenly.
