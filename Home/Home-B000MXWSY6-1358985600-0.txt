review/summary: easy to use and wake toreview/text: If you are the type of person that an alarm normally about gives a stroke to, this alarm is great. It starts with a soft little double beep that increases slowly but steadily in volume and frequency until you turn it of, making for a much easier waking experience for light sleepers. It is also very easy to set. But it is very bright if you prefer your room pitch black. I cover my clock face at night to resolve this issue.
