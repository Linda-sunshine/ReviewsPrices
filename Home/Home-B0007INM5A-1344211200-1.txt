review/summary: works - but not for strong coffeereview/text: Let me preface this by saying that I know I am a coffee snob. I like dark roasted, full flavor coffee. The problem that I have with this filter is that it allows the water to pass through it too quickly (I tested it over my sink just to watch how the water flowed). In the coffee maker the water passes so quickly that it cannot possibly give you a full strength brew. It fits perfectly in the pod brewer and works the way it was designed to, just not quite to my liking. I have cut circles out of my regular coffee filters to fit inside the reusable eco pads and that slows the flow of the water enough to increase the strength of the brew and is at least drinkable. Still hard to brew a strong cup though since the pod just doesn't hold enough coffee. I can not even get one full coffee scoop into it, unless you tamp it down, which you shouldn't do because that causes the water to not want to flow through the pod at all and forces more water to drip around it resulting in an even weaker brew.So ultimately if you are not fussy about a strong brew, it does work and will ultimately save you a lot of money on buying the pre-packaged pods. However, if you were looking for a stronger brew than the pre-made pods make, I don't think that you will be happy.
