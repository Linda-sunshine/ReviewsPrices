review/summary: boils water almost instantlyreview/text: The thing works great, it boils water in like 15 seconds! But the power button seems a little faulty: you have to press it down far for it to turn on, and my other family members said they weren't able to turn it on (I don't think they pressed it far enough, although I don't think they said they pressed it hard). It says to completely empty the water after each use but holding the drain button does not seem to get all the water out so I just turn the whole machine upside-down over the sink (it weighs like 2lbs).As other reviews said on here, the Hotshot is not of quality like it was in past years so I'm hoping the power button doesn't become a serious issue. Overall its so far so good.
