review/summary: cuisinart electric pressure cookerreview/text: I purchased the Cuisinart electric pressure cooker (6Qt )at a retail big box store in February 2012.I have used it about three times in eight months. It is difficult to set the top in locked position, and now it will not let steam build up and keeps going to 'keep warm' mode. In addition, the heat core gets so hot, it will burn food. I read a lot of reviews on line that cite the same problems. I am surprised that Cuisinart has its name on such an inferior product. I am going to purchase a Kuhn Rikon cooker and return mine to the store. Sure glad I bought the warranty.
