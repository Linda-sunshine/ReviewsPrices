review/summary: Absolutely worthlessreview/text: You have to turn this product upside down to load beans and get the top off. This is very difficult and you have to unplug it to accomplish this. It grinds the coffee quite well but then when trying to get to the ground coffee you again have to unplug it and turn it upside down to pry off the top and ground coffee spills all over the counter - EVERYTIME!
