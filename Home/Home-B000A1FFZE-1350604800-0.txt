review/summary: Hamilton Beach toaster/ovenreview/text: I was excited to see a toaster and oven combination as my counter space is limited, however, I was disappointed when I got the unit.It is quite flimsy and tinny....the oven portion of the unit is too small to conveniently heat up even the smallest items and the toaster portion has a very tight spring so when the toast is done it flips up and ou with intensity...guess I am back so looking for a toaster/oven without the toaster and a bigger oven portion. I ordered this item from Amazon and it was delivered fast and in great condition.
