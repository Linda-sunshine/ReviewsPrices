review/summary: Great Dutch Oven!review/text: I bought this pot mainly to make no-knead bread (and it produced an amazing boule last weekend!), but I will be using it for so many other things. I already own a number of Le Creuset pots, including a large LC 7-qt. oven, but this Lodge oven can clearly hold its own. I also bought the 10-1/4&#34; Lodge cast iron skillet a few days ago at Home Goods and was delighted to discover that the Dutch oven lid fits the skillet perfectly. Lodge really makes a quality product. And what I love most? It's made right here in the good ole USA! For those of you with seasoning problems, you shouldn't use soap to clean it. Just wipe it out using hot water and a little elbow grease, then dry immediately. It also helps to use it - fry up some bacon on Sunday morning - there's nothing like a little bacon fat to keep it well seasoned.
