review/summary: Quick and easy.review/text: I love this kettle. It boils water much quicker than a pan on the stove. I'd say it takes about 1 1/2 minutes to boil cold water from my refrigerator. It holds the perfect amount of water for a few cups of tea. I also use it for my coffee press. It's also great when cooking, if you're needing hot water quickly. It has an auto shut-off once it reaches boiling, so all your water does not begin evaporating. The only thing that could make it any better, is if the power plug was magnetic for quick detachment. However, the plug included is not too hard to take off. Overall it is a fantastic product for the price.
