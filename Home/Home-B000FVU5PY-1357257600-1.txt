review/summary: Silky cotton of high qualityreview/text: Ordered maize color, it's a pale butter shade, pretty and not corn-like at all. Paid $50 for queen set so a good deal for this level of quality, and i didn't have to hunt around town looking for a comparable buy. Sturdy hemming & tight stitching, very happy with purchase. The fitted sheet should fit most pillowtop-type beds with no problems and after initial washing sheets feel great.
