review/summary: GREAT PRODUCT. DON'T LET THE PRICE DRIVE YOU AWAY.review/text: This is a great product. I have bought 2 other queen size air beds that did not last 5 months. This bed has been used on and off for over a year and is still in perfect condition. Inflates and deflates quickly and is very comfortable. Two adults can easily and comfortably sleep on it. Although it may be a bit pricy, its worth it in the end as opposed to buying something cheap, then having to replace it.
