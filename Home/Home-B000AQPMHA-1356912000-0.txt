review/summary: Like it enoughreview/text: My mother-in-law sent one of these to me because she had two. I admit I never read the instructions. However I found this unit easy to use and figured it out in less than a minute. I prefer using it for a cup of hot tea as I drink that much more often coffee, but what I was most surprised about was not needing kcups or those fancy cup things you put in there. I just used a regular coffee filter and my favorite blend. Viola! A perfect 10 oz cup of coffee in my favorite flavor. My husband and I like completely different blends and strengths so this little unit was perfect for us. I have no desire use the kcups but single serve custom coffee is great for my family coffee drinkers.If I had to purchase this myself I probably would not for this price. My previous solution to my coffee difference was a tiny coffee pot and I would brew about 16oz just for myself. This was $10 and has worked wonderfully.I also think the kcup prices are really good when compared to the price of the local coffee shops, however you have to like their blends and as picky as I am I would not utilize this.I have read that the ekocup works great for this machine but I have yet to buy it as the coffee filter technique works great.So a little gimiky but overall satisfied and will be great when I want to serve hot beverages to guests. It is quick to heat up with little noise and a good result.
