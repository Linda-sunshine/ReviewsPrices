review/summary: Great coffee makerreview/text: I was looking for a new coffee maker and had read reviews on all the drip coffee makers on Amazon. guess what? It seems that all the reviewers had bad things to say about every brand and model. Some coffee makers that looked like they had good ratings had some really anxiety-producing reviews about fire-safety. Can't have that. Other's talked about the bad taste that developed from the plastics that make up the guts of all drip makers. Eventually I gave up, none of the reviews satisfied me.So I stumbled on this coffee maker, and the reviews looked much better. I bit... and now I have a nice percolater that does the job well. It brews a pot of coffee in about the same amount of time it takes for a drip coffee maker. The coffee comes out piping hot and with a better flavor. I really like it.Some problems: cleaning. The bottom well where the tube rests is hard to get into to clean. Some of the reviewers talk about adding some dishwashing detergent to the pot and brewing that. Well, it works but not perfectly. Still, after perking a pot full of detergent the insides do look shiny bright and removes any lingering coffee smell. It just might need a little touchup cleaning by hand. Another issue is the coffee basket. Yes, you can brew coffee grounds directly in the basket, but I found that coffee grounds do collect in the coffee that way, plus the grounds tend to clog the basket itself. However, you can add a regular drip coffee filter by just cutting out a small hole in the middle (fold it in quarters and cut off the tip).OVerall, great coffee maker.
