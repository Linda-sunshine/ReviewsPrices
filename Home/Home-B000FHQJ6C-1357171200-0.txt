review/summary: I recommend!review/text: I have been extremely pleased with this Hamilton Beach juicer. I have been juicing on and off for over 30 years and very glad I selected this model. Great price and it does a very good job of extracting juice. Just like any juicer, the chore is cleaning. All of these components fit in to your dishwasher for easy cleaning, although it's not that difficult to clean if you have been accustomed to juicers. Favorite juice #1? Kale, Red Leaf Lettuce, Carrots, Apples, Grapes, Ginger and Peeled Lemon. Favorite No. 2: Carrots, Apples and Ginger. I use this juicer to juice one meal a day.I also use a regular blender to juice a breakfast smoothie of: Raspberries, Strawberries or Blueberries (whichever I can get fresh), 6 oz POM Juice, Activia, Juice of 1/2 Lemon, 1/2 Banana, crushed ice and 1 scoop Whey protein powder. I do this 5 days a week. Get on the Juice train today!
