review/summary: Great coffee makerreview/text: I bought one of these coffee makers several years ago. This was a replacement. It makes great, strong hot coffee. Like other reviewers have noticed, filling the water reservoir is located in an awkward place and sometimes you spill a little water. I don't actually use the programmable feature much as it doesn't take long to make a pot in the morning. The 1-4 cup option setting works well. I tried the gold permanent filter that comes with the coffee pot but don't like it as it does not take out all the sediment. I would recommend using paper filters instead. I have bought this unit for other people as a gift. Amazon's price on the unit is usually as good or better than others including Kohl's. I have seen it as cheap as $62 on Amazon, so if you aren't in a hurry to buy it keep checking the price every so often.
