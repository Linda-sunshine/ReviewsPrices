review/summary: Keurig B40 Elitereview/text: On Keurig's web site, this model Elite B40 is listed as having three cup sizes (6oz, 8oz, and 10oz) In all the advertisement, this model is listed as having two cup sizes, anywhere from 6 1/4oz to 9 1/4 oz even the box it came in said two sizes but Keurig upgraded this model to include three sizes and upon opening the box the newer model with three sizes was inside. This is great because I have a model B70 with five cup sizes and I like the 8oz setting. In the two size model, you get like 6 1/2oz and a 9 1/4 oz. Too strong or too weak. I prefer the 8oz. size. Shop closely on this one because the older models have two settings, the newer one three.
