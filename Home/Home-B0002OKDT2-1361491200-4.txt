review/summary: multi functions, good qualityreview/text: use it to make all kind of juice from vegs & fruits. It can even make noodles. would recommend to other peoples. Only thing I don't like is its cheap plastic shell. Mine even came with a small crack on it. plastic is fine, it should be durable.
