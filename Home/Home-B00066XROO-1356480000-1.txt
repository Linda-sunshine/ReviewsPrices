review/summary: My husband loves his new griddle!review/text: My husband has been wanting a griddle for a while, so after reading some of the other reviews I ordered this for him for Christmas. He opened it yesterday and has already used it 3 times! He really enjoys using it!But in case anyone else intends on ordering this as a gift for someone you should know that it is shipped in a box that shows pictures on the outside of what it is. Thank goodness my husband was at work when this thing was delivered or it would have ruined the surprise! haha
