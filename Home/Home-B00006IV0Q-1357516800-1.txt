review/summary: Nice Productreview/text: The 6 cup Presto fulfilled all of my needs. I had been using a 12 cup perc but my wife has to drink decaf after 3pm so now I make a 6 cup morning pot of high octane and then a second pot in the afternoon of decaf. You can't beat a perculated cup of coffee and this machine does not dissapoint. I can't speak to the reliability as I have only utilized for a couple of weeks.
