review/summary: Loving it!review/text: Mine doesn't taste like plastic at all. I use chai tea. Maybe it's your 'tea'. Some teas taste terrible no matter what you do to it. Also, I want the lid tight. I don't want it coming open when I pour hot water. Who would? And seriously sloshing out? I've never had that problem either. It's in the 'pouring'. You don't just tip it and dump water out. I can't believe the comments. No wonder products have to have a thousand 'warnings'. People can really be ignorant.
