review/summary: NIGHTMARE PRODCUT + CUSTOMER SERVICE!!review/text: The product arrived damaged. I thought the chip was so small it may work and I wouldn't need to return it. Wrong!! I put some carrots into it and started it. It sprayed juice all over my walls and counter.I contacted Amazon to have it replaced. They asked me to pack up the product, return it and they would send a replacement to the original shipping address (my office).Somehow, they tagged my office as a residential address and now FedEx can't deliver the product until Tuesday because they don't work Mondays.Basically I ordered and paid for a product on December 28, 2012 (two day delivery) and its now January 7th, 2013 and have not been able to get the product.
