review/summary: Lasted for three Yearsreview/text: I received mine as a Christmas present three years ago. My wife and I have used this at least twice a day since. I have never unpluged it and the only time it has been powered down is a few storms and when we moved. It currently started short cupping me and I called Keurig Customer service, they walked me through a few procedures and finally offered me a discount on a replacement. I jumped at the chance to own a new one, this baby rocks!!!!
