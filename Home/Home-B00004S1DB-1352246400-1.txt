review/summary: Keeps it HOTreview/text: I really like this coffee press. The glass ones get cold way too quickly. This one is great... especially for camping. I grind the beans coarse (as instructed) and still get a ground or two in my cup, but thats all part of the deal with a french press... I kinda like that! hahaha.... only way to brew coffee in my opinioy. I bought this one for my brother (but I had to try it first) as a gift, but I will most likely end up getting one for myself.
