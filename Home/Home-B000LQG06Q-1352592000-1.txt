review/summary: Great product if you have back pain.review/text: I have back pain and had it for months. I bought the memory foam to see if that would help with my back pain. I could tell the very next day that the pain was easing up.I absolutely love it. I sleep a lot better and I got it at a great price.After I received the memory foam I took it out of the box and it had a slight smell. After a couple of days the smell was gone and everything was fine.
