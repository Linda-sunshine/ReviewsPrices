review/summary: Great for an RVreview/text: I've had this vacuum for a couple of years and it's been great all around for cleaning up my cats fur, carpet cleaning, automobile carpets, etc. Great suction and durable. Probably get another one if it needs replacing. The drawbacks are that the dust compacts on the filter and requires a good laundering every time it's used for best performance. A bagged device would be preferable as the contents could be disposed of and the bag replaced for hygienic or sanitary purposes, especially if you are vacuuming up kitty dirt and flea eggs (yuck). Also, and like most vacuums, the crevice device is probably an inch and a half round, so it can't get into a LOT of crevices (like between car seats). But, it's probably the best handheld I've ever found all things considered.
