review/summary: Touchless Trash canreview/text: I love that this trash can is sturdy and cannot be broken into by our kitties. :-) My husband has taken a bit to get used to the touchless part of this item but now he's okay with it now that he knows not to wavy his hand in front of it quiet so wildly. He also really likes that you can push "open" and it'll stay open until you push "close". I love that when you take the bag out it doesn't get snagged and tear on me. :-)
