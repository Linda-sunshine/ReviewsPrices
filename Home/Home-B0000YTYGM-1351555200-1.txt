review/summary: The problems are true!review/text: The coffee this machine makes tastes great, and the thermal caraffe does keep it warm all day. But if you use a gold filter instead of paper, you WILL eventually end up with the coffee-all-over-the-counter-and-floor situation. My husband is so shell shocked that he puts the whole machine in the sink to brew, and I'm shopping for a new one now. It's too bad, too; Cuisinart is a great company. I really wish they could make this gold filter-compatible.
