review/summary: Problem SOLVED! Yay Amazon!!!!review/text: As many customers have noted, the plastic part in the motor part of the unit failed in my cuisinart blender. I purchased it 15 months ago and it had a 3 year warranty. I called Cuisinart and they would replace it with a $10 handling charge. They also said I could return it to where I purchased it, which was Amazon. I called Amazon and the person said "maybe, let me talk to my supervisor". Amazon not only accepted return but provided me with a free pickup shipping label and a new one sent out 1 day shipping. Cudos to Amazon! Perhaps my success is due to the many thousands of dolars I spend at Amazon and YMMV.Good job Amazon customer service! You picked up the ball that Cuisinart dropped. I only give it 5 stars due to 3 year warranty and Amazons actions.
