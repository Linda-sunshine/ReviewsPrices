review/summary: Big differencereview/text: Bought this for my son. He said he noticed a BIG difference in taste. Lives in a apartment, fit faucet without any issues. Went by other good reviews was glad I did. Price is very reasonable. This review includes faucet attachment also. I think faucet attachments are much simpler than the pitchers. No I do not have one because we have our own well which my son grew up drinking from. So he is pleased.
