review/summary: my every morning coffee ritualreview/text: Makes a great cup of coffee, and I dont waste any.The only downside is that it only brews one cup. It says it is like espresso, which isnt really true, even if you put the amount of coffee in that they suggest. I end up putting as much in as I'd put in a bodum for one cup, letting it sit upside down for 4 mins, then righting it and pressing into the cup.
