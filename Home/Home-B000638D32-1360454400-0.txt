review/summary: great everyday knife for a beginner cookreview/text: i bought this year's ago for mi mama and she loved it. i moved to a new apartment and the one thing i needed in my kitchen was this gloriousness of a knife. with that first knife, i am sorry to admit that i cut myself with reckless handling of the knife while cutting a large block of cheese in a see-saw motion. i unfortunately have that scar in the middle of my palm reminding me to be careful and respect knives. i do and always have, but i am not good with them. which means i need to get a quality knife for the instances when i do need one. i use it about 5 times a week total, which is a lot for me, so when i use it, it needs to work quickly and i wash it and put it away instantly. i dont want to see it out.this knife cuts well - green onions and small(er) block of cheese, even (which i do ever so carefully now or just buy pre-sliced queso).Victorinox makes quality products. I trust the name and so should you.
