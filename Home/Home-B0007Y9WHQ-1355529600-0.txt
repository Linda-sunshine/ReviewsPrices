review/summary: Best invention ever!review/text: I don't know about you but I get a little burnt out on spaghetti so I spiral up some zucchini for some low carb deliciousness. And it's works amazingly! You might need some kind of brush to clean the blades but it's well worth the buy if you like to eat your veggies!
