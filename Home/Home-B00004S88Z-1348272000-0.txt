review/summary: Like a Tank!review/text: The is a beautifully crafted piece of equipment. I chose the All American because of its great reviews, the industrial style no gasket design AND it's made in America. The pressure gauge makes it really easy to know what stage you're at in the process. I'm having a great time canning stock, soup, vegetables, and on and on. I've already been telling everyone I know they NEED one of these.
