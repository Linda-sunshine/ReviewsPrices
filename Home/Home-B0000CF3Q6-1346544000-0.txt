review/summary: Love it!review/text: I bought this and the 1 cup Bialetti. I followed the instructions and threw away the first 3 batches of coffee. I then got to enjoy my first cup made on the stove and it was fantastic! The 1 cup is small enough for me to have a late afternoon coffee and the 3 cup makes a triple shot espresso that I have in the morning. It is fast and easy! I like to lift the lid and watch the coffee come up! I am debating whether of not to get a larger Bialetti for use if I have guests. But that is another topic. This is worth the little money I spent and I know I will enjoy this for a long time.
