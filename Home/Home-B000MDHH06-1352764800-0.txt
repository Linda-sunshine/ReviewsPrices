review/summary: Obliterates anything and makes delicious juice.review/text: After longing for a Jack LaLanne Power Juicer for nearly my entire life, when it was time to purchase a juicer, this one stuck out instead, in regards to consumer reviews, and it did not disappoint.It is highly powerful! (No kidding - many times I would have to clean carrot pieces off the cupboards, so make sure to be quick with replacing the cover). It also gets the most amount of juice out of just about anything. LOVE IT.
