review/summary: Great Product!review/text: This is a great dehydrator. I mainly bought it for making jerky. I bought extra trays as well to dry more meat at one time. It takes less than six hours to dry beef jerky in this machine using seven trays! Expandable to 12 trays....you could literally dehydrate almost eight pounds of jerky at one time! The five trays it comes with are plenty for three pounds of meat.Buy a cheap scrub brush to clean the trays afterwards. Takes me about 15 min to clean all the trays. That is the only downside...but a brush will definitely make cleanup faster.I have used this at least once a week since I purchased it. It is definitely a quality product!
