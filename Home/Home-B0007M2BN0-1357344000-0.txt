review/summary: It works its wonder!review/text: It's very easy to use, just 7 minutes in microwave, you get 4 perfectly hard-boiled egg! No watching the water, guessing the time and worrying under/over- cooked or cracked eggs. A great invention!After having used it for 5 times, I got the exact formula for the perfect eggs: 4 eggs, 7 minutes in microwave, then set the boiler outside for 2 minutes. Then cool the eggs and peel them. The eggs come out perfectly with soft orange-colored yolks. And if you want to keep the eggs warm, just put them in the boiler, which doubles as an egg warmer.
