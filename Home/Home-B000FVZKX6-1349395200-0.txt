review/summary: quality sheetsreview/text: These sheets are made of high quality flannel, very soft but not overly fuzzy (which pills). I returned the sheets though...I ordered the sage green color and the sheets looked more washed-out-grey than green. Other than that they are great sheets at a great price.
