review/summary: Have had it roughly 2 yearsreview/text: I have used this vacuum in a studio, one bedroom and two bedroom; on low pile carpet, mid pile, cork and tile flooring. This is the best little worker that I've ever had.It's small, it feels cheap --yes, like a toy as someone else pointed out. But it does the job. I have a dog that is constantly shedding, so I used my vacuum more than most. Never have I been disappointed.It does wonders on carpet, okay on tile and not so good on cork. At this price, I don't fancifully expect it to function like a 500 dollar vacuum. However, one carpet it probably does do a comparable job.
