review/summary: Not Programmable, but a decent cup of joe.review/text: I first bought the Tassimo after doing about 10 hours of research (Yes, for a coffeemaker. No, I'm not kidding)on how often the Keurigs break. I loved the Tassimo, and have thought about bringing it to the office. But I switched to the Keurig because shortly after I bought the Tass, Keurig's marketing took over Walmart, and every single thing was for the Keurig.I got this one at a discount at Sam's because it said it was programmable. For most of us, when we buy a programmable coffee maker, we assume that when we set it to 7am, that we will have a hot carafe of coffee around 7:05. This is not so with the Keurig. The Keurig will turn itself on, and heat up the water, but will not brew the coffee for you. Now, since it only does one cup at a time, it only takes 45 seconds to brew. But, maybe I'm a traditionalist, and I really like being able to wake to the smell of coffee, and it's not doing that for me.Pros: It holds plenty of water, the version I bought comes with the MY K-cup thing that lets you use your own coffee or tea, and it does what it needs to do.Cons: Not totally programmable, doesn't brew a large size travel mug (close, but no cookie) and, really, isn't programmable. Did I mention that it's not programmable, and that can get irritating when you spent $120 on a "programmable" coffee maker.The other Con is what everyone has already told you: They break. The solution: buy the $10 protection plan from wherever you buy it, and keep the receipt. Whenever it breaks, or you think it's broken, just take it back and get a new one. I guess a bit of a Pro is that Keurig KNOWS they make crap, so they don't have a hassle about just replacing your machine. Not sure if that's a victory in life, but I'm taking it.
