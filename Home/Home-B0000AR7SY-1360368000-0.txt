review/summary: Good buy for the money, with some minor complaintsreview/text: Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with this grinder...the grind is even and it allows me to make delicious coffee. I do have a few complaints:1) The machine does not have an on/off switch...you turn it on by twisting a dial (a la those old-fashioned kitchen timers) and it turns off when the dial rotates back to the off position. The result of this is that you have to figure out the correct timer setting for the amount of coffee you need ground by trial-and-error. I've had the grinder for weeks and I still can't get it exactly right...sometimes I grind too much, sometimes I need to set the timer again. I get around this problem by just holding the timer right past the &#34;1&#34; on the dial and letting go when I've ground the right amount of coffee, but this is annoying. Why not just include and on/off switch?2) The grinder holds on to perhaps 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon of ground coffee without dropping it into the chamber, meaning you have to shake it and bang it and hit it to get all the coffee out of it. I'm not sure if this is just par for the course with burr grinders, but again its just kind of annoying.Overall as I said, I'm happy with this grinder and plan to keep it and keep using it, but buyers should be aware of these minor flaws.
