review/summary: Worked well, initially.review/text: Initially, it seemed to work well, but after a dozen or so bottles of wine the button to lift the cork began to function erratically. Sometimes it would work and other times it would not. I returned it and was given a refund. Now, I need to decide whether to replace it with the same thing or to try another brand. With 1800+ positive reviews, I can only surmise that my experience was a fluke. I may just order another of the same model.
