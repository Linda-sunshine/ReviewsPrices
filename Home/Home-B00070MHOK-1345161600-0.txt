review/summary: WOWreview/text: This product has really made a difference in my life! I know it sounds silly because it is just a steamer, however, the convenience of being able to SO QUICKLY remove wrinkles from my clothing is AWESOME! I've saved so much money on dry cleaning, as I do not iron, and used to send everything out to be pressed to remove wrinkles. This steamer is the easiest thing in the world to use. Fill it with water, plug it in, steam over the wrinkles, the clothing looks like it came from the cleaners, or better yet, brand new! I still get button down shirts pressed because you can't really replicate the pressed look, however, for everything else, this has been amazing. I recommend this to everything. It's one of the best things I own.
