review/summary: Bought 2review/text: I am now on Day 6 with this pillow. We got one for me and one for my husband. I will say, in previous reviews, i read to take off the pillow case and just use one of my own to make it not so hard. That was perfect advise. My husband had a first rough night with it, because he didn't switch out the pillow case. But after he did it was much better.I always have rough nights. My neck hurts. hips, and numbing in the arms. Surprisingly, this pillow addressed all of that I have been sleeping soundly ever since. I am actually impressed. I don't know how long this pillow will last, but if it gets too soft, i will just put on the pillow case that came with it. Even if it doesn't last for years, just one month of this pillow is well worth the amount we spent on it. And to think... I almost got two $90 &#34;my piilows&#34;. After reading those reviews, I chose these. I am very happy with my decision.
