review/summary: great story, terrible ending.review/text: this book has a great story line, but a terrible ending. I really wish the auther would hve either taken off the last paragraph or so, or added a few more chapters. also i found that the way that people were released was a bit disturbing, but the way that jonas's dad releasesd the newborn child was the most disturbing of all, especially how he lied about it. Good book, just skip the ending.
