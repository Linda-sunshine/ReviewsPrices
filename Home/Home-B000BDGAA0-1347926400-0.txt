review/summary: Micro Bead Pillowreview/text: This pillow came highly recommended from several people. After a pinched nerve, and the discovery of some bulging disk's in my neck, I decided I needed a good therapy pillow. Although I've not had any neck discomfort, I have found the pillow very uncomfortable to sleep on. I have given it a few weeks, but have moved on to another 'therapy' pillow that is designed differently. The micro bead pillow to me feels like a bag filled with sand and cement. As with everything, nothing works for everyone. I know there are those that this pillow is a perfect fit(my son and his wife are two of them), but this pillow is not for me.
