review/summary: pretty decent air cleaner, but loudreview/text: first, let me say that this thing performs just as you would expect and I do actually like the noise from this thing so I don't have to listen to the cat meow all freaking morning because he's locked in the basement for peeing all over the house. but anyway, this thing helps with keeping my allergies at a minimum when normally they are going crazy. I've had it around 3 months and am preparing to order another prefilter, since it recommends changing the pre-filter every 3 months.
