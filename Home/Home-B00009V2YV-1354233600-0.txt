review/summary: Solid, well builtreview/text: I had one of the old style weather radios, and it would drive you crazy, going off (very loud), for watches and warnings up to 60 miles away. This one can be programed to specific counties, as well as which alarm you want to hear(watches, warnings, advisories,etc.). If it's near your bed, you can select an alarm that's not so frightening, but still awaken you.My hometown in Eastern Ky was destroyed by an EF3 tornado, in an area where it was previously thought that strong tornadoes would not hit. BUY THIS ONE, ITS A GOOD ONE, BUT BUY ONE SOMEWHERE! It may well save your life.
