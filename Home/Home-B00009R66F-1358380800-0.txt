review/summary: Nice cleaner but upholstery/Hand tools dissapointreview/text: I purchased this model mostly because i have carpeted stairs in my home so i needed the hand tools. I love this machine for regular carpet cleaning but am very dissapointed in the upholstery/hand tools. The water sprays out from behing your hand tools in a wide path from way behind your hand tool and it sucks. You also get a handtool with a spinning brush that looks like a great item but as soon as you lay the brush on a surface to clean it stops spinning because the power running the brush is just to weak. On a bare cloor MAYBE? On carpet no way. I give this model a 5 for regular cleaning but a 1 for the handtool cleaning. If you dont need the handtools purchase the machine without them. Dont pay extra for this machine because of the handtools.
