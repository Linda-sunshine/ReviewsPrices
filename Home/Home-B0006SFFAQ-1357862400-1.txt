review/summary: Great Machinereview/text: I really love coffee, and I was sick of having a plastic coffee maker from Mr. Coffee. I wanted stainless steel goshdarnnit! So, I splurged and bought this. It makes a great cup of coffee, and there really is a taste difference between the coffee product from this and the mr. coffee. I really love it! The one complaint I have is that I really wish that they had a different way to put coffee in the machine. Although it's appearance is attractive, I wish that where you put the water wouldn't be so narrow, and I also wish that it was see through from the outside so I could know exactly the water level I'm putting in. Of course, a measuring cup can fix that, but for the lazy, glass would have been convenient ;). Otherwise, I definitely recommend the machine. There is a real depth to the coffee it makes, and I also think it keeps the coffee hotter and makes it faster than the other machine I owned.
