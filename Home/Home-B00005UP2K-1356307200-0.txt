review/summary: I like this brand but...review/text: Great mixer but what I didn't realise that the American electrics runs on 110 volts and the rest of the world has 240 volts. I had to buy a steep down converter... It works fine but there was no warning on amazon to say that the item was 110 volts... Silly me...
