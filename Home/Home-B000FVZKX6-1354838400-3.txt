review/summary: Love these sheetsreview/text: Me and my wife have had plenty of flannel sheets in the past but these are a lot thicker and softer. We love the way they feel and haven't had any problem with them wrinkling. Just don't leave in the dryer after it cuts off. These are the best flannel sheets we have ever had. They are thick and do sleep warm, so here in the south they will have to come off the bed as soon as spring comes.
