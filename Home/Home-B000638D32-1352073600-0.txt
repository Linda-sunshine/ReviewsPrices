review/summary: Worth the moneyreview/text: This knife came boxed and packaged well.I took 1 star off for sharpness and I could see how other people posted about breaking the tip off, You would have to try. Its not that thin in my opinion but thinner then my 15 year old Henckel I am replacing.I have not tried to resharpen yet but see no reason this should need more then once a week touch up (home use). I did have a little trouble with soft tomatoes on the factory sharpen. Feels fine in the grip wet or not.It does seem worth the cash I spent.
