review/summary: The Cap broke off by the heatreview/text: I bought two of this beautiful looking Capresso water kettle. The first one lasted almost an year and the cap's chrome or "shining thing" started to peel off and with green thing on it. The 2nd one I used for over a year and the plastic/metal connection between the cap and the kettle went brittle, must be from the heat, and broke. And the "chrome" top came off the plastic cap. Now I am boiling water without the chrome top and only the plastic cap. I suspect the plastic may contain BPA?I love the design and glass body. But why does the manufacturer use a better material for the cap and the connecting parts.I don't mind to pay more for a better made product. Now I see some competitors also come up with glass body kettle, but are they made by the similar manufacturers?Any one with a better glass kettle, please advise!
