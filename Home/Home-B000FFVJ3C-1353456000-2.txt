review/summary: Nesco FD-75PR 700-Watt Food Dehydratorreview/text: I use a food dryer a lot. The plastic on my old one was falling apart, so I purchased this new one. It works great, and the idea of the drying heat blowing down is a good one, but the electronics being on the top make it top-heavy and more awkward to use that then old one that had the heating unit & fan in the bottom. If it weren't for this, I would have rated this 5 stars.
