review/summary: Zero Changereview/text: I don't think much of this item. I used it in a very small, enclosed area and the humidity did not drop. It would work just as well were I to throw it off the second story balcony. Save your money, buy a better quality dehumidifier. I got what I paid for in this case. Thumbs down.
