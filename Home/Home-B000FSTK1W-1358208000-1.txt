review/summary: I'm a BIG 3M Fan!review/text: After re-tiling the shower the suction cup holders not longer adhered to my tiles UGH! After I got tired of cleaning around the bottles on the shower windowsill I had to find an answer. Enter the water proof 3M shower caddy! IF you follow the directions- clean and prep the surface then DO NOT add the caddy for about a day, you should be okay. If you rush it chances are it will fall. I was impatient round one and it crashed in the middle of the night. Round two I followed the directions and they have been up with lots of weight in them. They slip off easily for cleaning and the razor hook is a nice touch.
