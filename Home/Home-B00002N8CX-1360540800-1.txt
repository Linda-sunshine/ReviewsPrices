review/summary: best vacuum for hardwood floorsreview/text: i loaned this vacuum to my sister and she won't return it so i needed to get a new one. it picks up everything! it will work on carpet, but it's best for wood or tile floors. i shed a lot of hair, so it's perfect for that...it doesn't get clogged like traditional vacuums tend to. the only con is that the hose and attachments don't roll up or tuck away neatly, so you have to have some space to store it.
