review/summary: These sheets are fabulous!review/text: We recently purchased a large new mattress that is 14 inches deep so naturally, we needed new sheets. I read all the information I could regarding thread count (FYI, those sheets that claim to be 1000 to 1200 thread count are a total scam) and decided to take a chance on these. I'm glad we did! After the sheets arrived the very first thing I did was remove them from the packaging and throw them in wash. They are very stiff when you receive them. A few hours later, after I pulled them out of the dyer, I really got to inspect them. They are nice and think and have a satiny feeling to them. And they fit our King size 14" mattress very well. We like them so much we're going to by another set.
