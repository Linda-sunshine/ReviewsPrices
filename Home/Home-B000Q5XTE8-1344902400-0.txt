review/summary: Great chair - Great pricereview/text: I was ready to buy a chair locally because I was sick of mine. good thing I ordered online. This chair is great. It took 15 minutes to put together and is super comfy. My back is now nice and cool.No local chair in this price range came even close quality and comfort wise to this one.
