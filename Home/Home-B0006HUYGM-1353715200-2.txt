review/summary: Great little vacuumreview/text: This is a great little vacuum for the price. I use it on stairs, furniture, and in my car - places my other vacuum is too big or bulky to reach. The suction is pretty impressive for its size. The only complaint is that it sucks SO well that you have to empty the tiny compartment pretty often. The filter also seems like it holds onto a lot of dust and hair - it never seems totally clean when you empty it and put it back in. But overall, this was a great purchase.
