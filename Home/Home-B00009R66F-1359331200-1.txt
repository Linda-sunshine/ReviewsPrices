review/summary: Great Machine/Great Pricereview/text: I got this Hoover SteamVac carpet cleaner about one month ago as a replacement for an almost 4-yr. old Bissell. Though I was happy with my Bissell ( at least for the first 3 years of use) I noticed that the reviews for the Hoover SteamVac seemed a bit more positive-both on Amazon & on other sites I researched. The cleaner arrived within just a few days. It was well packaged and very easy to assemble. We have 3 inside dogs in our household so a carpet cleaner is as necessary to me as a vacuum! Since my Bissell hadn't been working well for a while I went to work on some problem areas on the carpets. In the month I've had my Hoover I've already used it 6-7 times. Was very impressed with cleaning power of the machine and as others have noted drying time seemed much shorter. The machine is lighter than the Bissell. I like having two separate tanks for the clean & dirty water. The Bissell system was eventually difficult to get really clean. Only drawbacks so far are: Hoover is louder during operation& as others have noted the dirty water container could use a handle of some kind-you have to have two hands to remove from the machine and carry to sink to dump. At this time I would definitely recommend to others- in fact I plan to purchase the same cleaner for my daughter.
