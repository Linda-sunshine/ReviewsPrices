review/summary: Effective, though louder than I thoughtreview/text: I have a pipe room where..well, you can imagine what I do there. This device more than effectively removes the smell and smoke from the room to a degree that's almost astounding: you can be one room over and not know that I'm enjoying a pipe.I'm trying it in different locations about the room in order to &#34;tone down&#34; how loud it is. I don't wish to overstate, its not that its obnoxious, its just not quiet. I would describe the volume as about that of a room fan on &#34;medium.&#34;For the price? Great. I'm very happy.
