review/summary: It worked until it started leakingreview/text: I was happy with my Aroma AWK-1155 - it heated up the water very quickly. Yes, it was noisy doing so, but I could handle that. I bought it because I wanted a metal kettle so I wouldn't have to worry about BPA leaching from the plastic, especially with repeated use boiling. I was using it at least 2-3 times/week and after 3 months I started to see water appearing on the stand under the pot after using it. It wasn't in a dangerous place, but any water accumulating under an electric item is not proper. It was too late to return it, but I would not buy another one & I cannot recommend this item for anyone else to purchase.
