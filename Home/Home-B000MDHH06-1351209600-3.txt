review/summary: Good juicerreview/text: This was my first juicer. Love the juice that it makes, fairly easy clean up. The only thing that irritates me is the stupid rubber stoppers on the bottom of the machine. They are there to keep the machine from moving when it is on, but they keep popping out of place and make the whole thing wobbly. I tried just taking them off but then the machine moves on the counter when it's on. Other than that, I've had it for years with no other issues.
