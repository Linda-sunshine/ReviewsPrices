review/summary: Great no nonsense panreview/text: I've been using this for about 6 months and it still looks and cooks like brand new (use it 3-4x per week). I was skeptical when I saw this recommended on cooks illustrated, mainly because of the gimmicky red dot in the center of the pan, but for the money I don't think it can be beat. It is somewhat lightweight, but it takes longer than you would expect to heat up, which shows how well it distributes and holds heat. I will buy another when (if?) this one wears out.
