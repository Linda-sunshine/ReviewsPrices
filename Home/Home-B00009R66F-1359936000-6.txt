review/summary: Excellent product for the moneyreview/text: This is similar to a Hoover SteamVac that I bought about fifteen years ago for much more money. If this lasts as long as the previous model that I owned, I'll be quite happy with the purchase. This is a very simple solution to the problem of cleaning carpets and its much less expensive and much more convenient than hiring a service to do the job. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because the unit is a bit clumsy and heavy.
