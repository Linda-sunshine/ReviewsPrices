review/summary: Great skillet!review/text: I've really enjoyed using this pot. I purchased it a year ago and it's still in perfect condition. I like being able to put it in the oven as well as use it on the stove top.My only complaint is that it is extremely heavy. If your arms are not strong, it can be difficult to take it in and out of the oven without burning yourself accidentally.
