review/summary: It's Finereview/text: It makes an OK pot of coffee and does it quickly. I have a little problem reading the measurement marks on the inside, wish it had a clear knob on top to see it percolating and I kind of wish it was insulated so I didn't have to keep it plugged in or transfer the coffee to another pot when done.Let me reiterate... it makes an OK, about mediocre cup of coffee. I've tried a few varieties of StarBucks as well as common brands such as Folgers and Chock Full... It is just OK. I'm not sure if it is better than an ADC maker for the extra effort involved.
