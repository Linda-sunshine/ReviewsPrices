review/summary: Worked untill the warranty expired then no more.review/text: I got this as a gift and it worked great for almost two years. then it went nuts, Filling the cup, not filling, sometimes over filling. I called customer service and they had me do some "cleaning" of the system with a paper clip, and still nothing. since it's out of warranty they won't replace it or fix it. They offered to sell me a new one at a $60 discount. No thanks! I can buy a regular coffee maker for less, that will last much longer. Not to mention save a lot of money not buying k-cups. If you chose to buy one of Keurig's products... Good Luck!
