review/summary: dutch ovenreview/text: I have used the Lodge emerald green 6q oven only once since the purchase. I used it to make no-knead bread. I coated it with very little oil as it is not recommended to heat it empty in the oven. The oil tends to stick and does not come off easily with the dish soap while cleaning. However, I used vinegar and baking soda to clean it and it was very easy. I am giving it 4 stars just because I have used it once. May be in future after a couple of more uses I may the edit the rating.
