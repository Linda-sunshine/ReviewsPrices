review/summary: Best cup of coffee everreview/text: I bought the aeropress a few months ago after it was recommended to me because of the smoothness of the coffee. I am trying to remove refined sugar from my diet and this was my kicker; sugar in my coffee each morning to be able to drink it down. The first cup was so smooth, no bite at all and I haven't missed the sugar since, amazing!
