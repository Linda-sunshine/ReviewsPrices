review/summary: Awesome, this can save your lifereview/text: I had an older Midland radio that worked great until someone turned the switch plug off that I had it plugged into and the batteries went dead and leaked. I decided to get a fancy Red Cross one with a crank, flashlight and rechargeable batteries... what a dumb-a I was. The radio I got was expensive and a piece of junk. Forget the crank, if my power is out or my home is damaged I don't want to be pumping on a crank for 90 seconds to listen to 5 minutes of radio... heck you will likely miss anything important... get some spare batteries and an LED flashlight in your emergency kit which is far better than those all-in-one things.This radio tells me what I need to know and then shuts off (ALERT and SAME features are great) with options to customize what kind of alerts you get (i.e. I don't need heat advisories, I know when it is hot out and didn't want to be awakened to tell me the obvious). I also don't want to hear the weekly test but I do like seeing the notice on the screen, this is the default setup for weekly tests. This radio is great and every house should have one along with an emergency kit/plan.Just make sure to check it once a week so it doesn't go dead and sit there until the battery leaks like I did (stupid me). Also, don't let the complicated things I wrote above worry you. The stock setup right out of the box is great just put batteries in, plug it, set the clock, select the right channel and you are golden.
