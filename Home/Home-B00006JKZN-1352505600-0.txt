review/summary: Cuisinart Waffle Maker.review/text: After a week and a half of using this waffle maker, I'm quite pleased. I just leave the selector set to 3, and have gotten nothing but perfect, delicious waffles every time. Takes a little experimentation to find the right amount of batter; I've found just shy of 1/2 cup is about right. Very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone.
