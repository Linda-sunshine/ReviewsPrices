review/summary: Convenience but a dead cup of coffeereview/text: I bought the Elite 40 from my local big box, and after about three months I have had zero problems with my coffee maker. Also I did have had business with Keurig's customer support, and they were terrific!I have bought lots and lots of different k-cup flavors these months but for me none of them delivered a desirable cup of coffee. Basically all are rather odorless across all brands & flavors I would conclude the taste is generally just a slight notch above instant--and does not even approach good brewed coffee. One marketer pulled a fast one on me, and actually packed freeze dried crystals in their k-cup! Sigh.I am now ending my Keurig quest, and I am shopping for an old style percolator pot hopefully in a more personal 2-cup size.
