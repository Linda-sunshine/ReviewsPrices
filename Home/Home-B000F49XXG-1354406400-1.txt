review/summary: Love itreview/text: I bought mine at Goodwill for $15. No instruction manual with my purchase, but after watching some You Tube videos on the subject, I was back to my college days as a barista. It does make a great, crave worthy cup of cappuccino. I add 1 tb of Sugar In The Raw, and steamed milk. I like the glass cup w/handle that comes with it, making it easy to feel the bottom; when it's too hot to touch, the milk is ready but not burnt, brilliant tip I picked up. It comes with a single and double hopper to switch out, with storage inside for either one while using the other, for single or double shot espresso. I fill mine with Britta pitcher filtered water only. I use whole milk and 1 tb medaglia d'oro grind per shot. Now go forth my child into barista bliss and glory.
