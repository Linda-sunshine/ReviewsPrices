review/summary: Great, Well-Made Pitcher!review/text: I bought two of these pitchers to hold iced tea, and I'm very pleased with them. They wash well in the dishwasher - the hermetic lid can even be washed on the top rack. The pouring spout is well designed and pours smoothly, and the lid is adjustable - with a turn of the top, it can go from sitting loosely to completely locked down. Best of all, the pitchers fit everywhere - in my cabinet when not in use and in the door of my refrigerator. Now for two things that don't bother me, but may bother someone: 1) the handle might be a bit small for someone with extra-large hands, and 2) you have to remove the lid to pour. That being said, I can highly recommend this pitcher!
