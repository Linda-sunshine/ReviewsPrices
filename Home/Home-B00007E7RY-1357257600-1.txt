review/summary: Very LOUD Air Cleanerreview/text: This air purifier does what it is supposed to do, but it is LOUD, even on the lowest air speed setting. On low, I placed this thing in my living room, and can still hear it in my bedroom with the door open. On medium, it is very loud. On high, it is almost as loud as a vacuum cleaner. I would say that low is the only tolerable speed to use this normally, and maybe turn it up to medium or high if you are cooking something that smells bad.
