review/summary: Good for the bedroom, or any-room as a nice alternative to traditional heatersreview/text: Heat rating is 1500, which is actually the same on the small silver lasko heater for $19.99.your paying for the design, which isn't a bad thing. my box arrived pretty beat up and the heater itself had small dent on the grill, but nothing life changing ;). I run it for about an hour before i go to bed to get my bedroom toasty, works nice!
