review/summary: Bought as a giftreview/text: I bought this for my son-in-law and he is very happy with the fact that it makes a consistently good cup of coffee. I have had one just like it for several years and love it! The Bunn people stand by their products. I know because I had a problem with the switch after owning this model for almost three years. They sent me a new one! You can't ask for better than that!!
