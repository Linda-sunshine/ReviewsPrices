review/summary: Don't waste your money on a keurig!review/text: My Keurig broke almost 2 years to the day! It would turn on and sound like it was going to heat up then the blue light on the water tank came on and stayed on. Turned on and off a few times, unplugged for a few hours then tried again. Called customer service and they basically said it is unrepairable and offered me another one for $70.00. Why would I want to spend another $70.00 on a product that does not last! I have a phillips coffee maker that I spent $20.00 on ten years ago that won't die! Now I'm back to using it. They need to stand by their machines and make the warranty last longer than 1 year. I spent 150.00 on the special edition and thought it would last much longer. Very very disappointed. I may be buying a Cuisinart next...they at least have a 3 year warranty!
