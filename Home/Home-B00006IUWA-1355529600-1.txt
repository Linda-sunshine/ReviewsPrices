review/summary: Jeanne, Las Vegas, NVreview/text: It pops all the kernals which I absolutely love! I originally bought it as I was tired of microwave popcorn that seemed to burn all the time no matter how I played around with the time I nuked it. Also, air poppers are so much better for you! I will starting experimenting with various popcorns and see how it does. All in all, I think it is a wonderful product for the price.
