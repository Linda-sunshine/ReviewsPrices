review/summary: I Love This Thing!review/text: After checking out the different types of coffee cup warmers that were out there, I decided to go with this one since I have a Mr.Coffee espresso maker that's served me well for a few years and it wasn't too expensive and had a good rating. And I'm very happy that I did. I'm used to my coffee getting cold pretty quick and having to put it in the microwave to get it warm again, sometimes even twice. So as soon I this arrived, I opened it up and made a new cup of coffee. After about 20 minutes or so of doing my thing and then reaching over to grab my coffee, I was immediately surprised by how hot it was. I even said h*** s***.
