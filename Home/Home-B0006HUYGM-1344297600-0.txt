review/summary: Eureka hand held vacuum - Love it!review/text: This little vacuum is just what I was looking for to clean my carpeted stairs. Stairs are very steep and narrow, walls on both sides, cannot use a large vacuum on them. This has lots of suction, a nice long power cord which reaches to the top, and is very lightweight. Also the crevice tool stores inside which is very convenient. You do need to clean the filter after each use, but I just use a small brush over the trash barrel and that works fine. I have other Eureka products, one of which is over twenty years old and a bit beat up, but still works great. It is an excellent brand for the money. I would highly recommend this product for stairs and small jobs.
