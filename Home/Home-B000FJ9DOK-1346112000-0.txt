review/summary: Perfect function and stylereview/text: Simply a great bottle that keeps (ice) water cold for hours. Perfect size to slide into a computer bag with NO need to worry about leaks. The compression gasket seal around the drinking spout allows for zero leakage. I like the rubber grip area around the outside of the bottle- it never feels like it is slipping out of my hand. The spout is like about the diameter of a penney and is easy to drink from. My only caveat is that I never send the bottle through the dishwasher and cannot attest to how it would stand up. I just figure it's easier to hand wash.
