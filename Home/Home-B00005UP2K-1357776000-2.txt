review/summary: love my kitchenaidreview/text: love this mixer. decided i needed a new one. have 2 others. 1 from the fifties. still works except for the 1st 2 speeds. wore them out. also have 1 from the 60's. it still runs like a charm. bowl is smaller so i decided i need a larger one for multiple batches. i wouldn't use anything else. they last forever. i also bought 1 for my daughter and she to uses it all the time. so do my grandchildren. 5 stars
