review/summary: The on/off switch is poorly constructed.review/text: Maybe you will be ok if you buy this in the store. I had mine shipped to me and the on/off switch was laying at the bottom of the box. The unit was well packaged but the on/off switch is way too flimsy. Buyers be very careful. I think I would have been better off buying an older juicer from the good old days when kitchen appliances didn't have mechanisms that look like they belong on children's toys.
