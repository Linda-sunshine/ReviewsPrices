review/summary: Best juicer ever!review/text: I started juicing about a month ago and could not believe how great I started to feel. I started off with a Breville and have been using it every day. It is a real pain to clean. I found myself dreading juicing because I dreaded the clean up.While checking out my recommended deals the other night this juicer popped up as a huge special. I ended up buying it for $149.00. All I can say is wow!Juicing uses up a lot of fruit and vegetables and can be very expensive. This juicer uses significantly less fruit than my Breville. Literally about half. The pulp it leaves behind is very dry. My typical juice is Spinach, Kale, 1/2 lemon(no peel), 1 Granny smith apple and 1 pear. It is tart and delicious. Within 5 minutes of drinking it, I get this burst of clarity in my sinuses and my head. It's absolutely amazing. I swear I haven't felt this way in years. My only bad experience with juicing involved beets. Yuck, unless you really love beets you probably won't like them juiced. (and I like beets)The other great thing about this juicer is that it is very quiet. You can still talk or hear the TV. The clean up is a snap compared to the Breville. It only took me a couple seconds to clean up.This is also a very nice looking product on the counter. Shiny and very heavy duty. You can tell by looking at it that it is top quality.You can also make pasta and nut butters with this machine. I will have to try that next!If you are currently a juicer, and are looking for a new machine, look no further. I had not wanted to spend hundreds on something I wasn't sure about. I just can't imagine anyone who starts juicing would ever stop. That being said, even if it's not the bargain price I got it at, invest in it anyway. You won't regret it.This juicer is the only way to go. I have never written a review before for anything. I feel so strongly about juicing now and this juicer in particular, I want to tell everyone!
