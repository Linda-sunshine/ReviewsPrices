review/summary: Great resultsreview/text: This dehydrator has allowed me to reduce the size of 3 apple boxes of produce to less than half of one apple box. I have dried tomatoes, apples and pears into chips. I have made strawberry-pineapple, pear, plum and applesauce fruit leather. This dehydrator is quick and efficient. I added six trays.The only issue I have is that it does not have a power switch. I just connected it to a power stip.
