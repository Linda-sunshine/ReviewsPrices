review/summary: Better than Rowenta but Has Flaws - Auto shutoff isn't greatreview/text: I bought this iron several years ago to replace a Rowenta. It was considerably cheaper than the Rowenta I was replacing. My Rowenta didn't get hot enough or make enough steam.This iron definitely makes steam. About a year after I got it, I pressed the steam button and so much steam came out that it burned my stomach through my t-shirt. I was ironing close to the edge of the ironing board but it wasn't hanging off.Just a couple of months ago, I started having a problem with it not being able to maintain it's heat level. It would heat up and beep that it was warm and then after I used it a couple of minutes, the level would start flashing like it does before it heats up. I felt the ironing board and it was just warm. I was using the cotton setting and it should have been uncomfortable to touch.I've always had a problem with it leaking water if I use it as it is heating up or really soon after it beeps that it is ready. Today, I had a problem with it cooling off and as a result, it leaked water instead of making steam. As I sat it down, the water dripped down my leg and blistered it.My other problem is with the auto shutoff. The handle is always warm while it is plugged in while the iron is turned off. It concerns me that it pulls enough power to keep the handle warm. Also, if it falls flat after the auto shutoff kicks in, the iron will turn back on. While it would turn off again before burning down the house but it would definitely scorch whatever it fell on.I'm now ordering a new iron and I don't think it will be this one again. Too bad. It had been a great sewing iron outside of these issues.
