review/summary: It's ok.review/text: It doesn't fit my espresso machine's espresso holder that well and it's hard to get the pressure right because this is so lightweight. I went to cash and Cary and bought a heavier, tear drop handled one like the coffee shops use and am much happier with that. Also, because of the alloy this is made of, it now has weird 'salt spots' from my dishwasher soap. It had some kind of weird reaction. It's still usable, but looks dirty forever.
