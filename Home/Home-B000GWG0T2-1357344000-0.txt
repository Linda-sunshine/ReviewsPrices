review/summary: The Bestest Nonstick Skilletreview/text: I've had this skillet for 2 years, It's flawless. True non stick tough interior that is a breeze to clean. Great cooking performance too. I like it so much I've decided to buy the 8&#34; and 12.5&#34; as well, they will replace skillets that don't perform as well. My only complaint, and that is a complaint that applies to most skillets, is that it doesn't have a cover available. I know skillets usually don't have covers but there are times when a cover is needed. I hope someone at T-fal reads this and becomes enlightened!
