review/summary: Juicer multipurposereview/text: We had a Juiceman Jr and saw this on sale. At first we thought of returning it but gave it a chance and we are glad we did. It juices slower than the juiceman but will also juice greens, something the juice man won't do. It is way easier to clean and we believe the juice tastes better.
