review/summary: Loving this in Germany!review/text: I currently live in Germany (I have dual voltage here) and I know German winters are no joke but one of my complaints here is that my coffee or tea gets cold really fast. I ordered 2 of these and absolutely love them. At first use, they were slow to heat up but after that, they work great. It so nice to pick up my mug and it's still warm...doesn't get overly hot and of course the heating is more when there's less in the cup but that gives you a "good and warm" to the last drop effect! Happy customer here!
