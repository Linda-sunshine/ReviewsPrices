review/summary: Excellent product for a dormreview/text: I got this mattress topper because the mattress in my dorm room is very hard and uncomfortable. However, this topper makes it not only tolerable, but incredibly comfy to sleep in. It is comparable to the bed that I have back at home, and that's saying a lot.I would definitely recommend this, but only if you like soft beds. Since everyone has different likes and needs, I feel that those who prefer a firmer bed might not like this topper. It is supportive, but it is not firm.Overall, I would definitely recommend this product to those who think that their bed is too hard.
