review/summary: Beautiful kettle but stopped working after less than a yearreview/text: While it still worked, it was wonderful. It was a thing of beauty and I loved seeing it on my counter and loved watching the water boil. However, less than a year later, it simply stopped working. I replaced it with a Hamilton Beach for half the price, and that one is still going strong two years later.
