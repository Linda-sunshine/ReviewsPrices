review/summary: Mr. Coffee DRX5 4-cup programmable coffeemakerreview/text: Coffeemaker is good, but the display can't be seen in the dark. It should have a LED display and to set the time of day is to easy. It can be accidently changed just by bumping the buttons. It needs a time set button to hold in to set the timelike the delay brew button.
