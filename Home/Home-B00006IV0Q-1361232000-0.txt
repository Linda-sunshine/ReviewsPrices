review/summary: Presto Coffee Makerreview/text: I love my new coffee maker. I bought it for work and everybody loves it. Coffee is not bitter at all and stays hot during the work shift. I use the same filters I used for the drip maker. Only thing I don't like was grounds on the last cup. But it's a minor problem as I use it everyday.
