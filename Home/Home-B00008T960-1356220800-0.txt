review/summary: Great for this baking novicereview/text: I do very little cooking and even less (i.e. no) baking. I did not even know a product like this existed. But I saw the Slipat as a lightning deal and all the positive reviews and decided to go for it. I mostly cook in a Cuisinart toaster oven, so the small-sized Slipat was perfect for me. Following the simple instructions, as well as tips offered by other reviewers, I made what I think was a nice batch of Christmas cookies. At least, they tasted good to me, and my friends claimed they liked them. Hopefully they weren't just being nice!If this novice was able to use the Slipat successfully, I'm sure those of you with more experience baking will get a great deal of use from it.
