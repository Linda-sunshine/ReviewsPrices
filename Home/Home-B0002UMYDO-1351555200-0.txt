review/summary: Amazon and or FedEx Servicereview/text: It is difficult to get the can opener to accept a can and the can doesn't turn so it can be opened...I might as well bought a manual can opener but did not since I have severe arthritis in my hands. I will try, very hard, NOT to buy from Amazon again your service is slow you did not respond to my e-mail timely unless this is it and delivery by FedEx is the worst. Your messages and theirs are different and there is no way the driver could not have delivered the package since the address was to a small retail store (friends of mine) in Valley WA and it is open all day long every day of the week. The driver said no one was there. Sorry but you have lost me as a customer.
