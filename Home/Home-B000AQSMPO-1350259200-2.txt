review/summary: CRIMINALS!!!review/text: One word to describe Keurig company......CRIMINALS!!!! I've purchased 2 brewers and it was great for the 1st year but after 2 years they are both broken. Both brewers were not abused. I only make 1 cup of joes a day. So I called their company and they say the can't do anything about it because they only have a 1 year warranty. The man on the phone said that best they can do is offer me another machine for 100 bucks. Seriously....I am not spending another $100 for your crappy machines since I spent over $300 on 2 machines. If you are looking for a brewer, don't bother with this company. They make low quality brewers that break after a few years. You are better off spending 30 bucks on a coffee maker that breaks after a few years THAN $150 for a Keurig brewer that don't last long and is made with cheap CRAP.
