review/summary: I love love love itreview/text: This is a very attractive looking percolator that just happens to make great coffee. I love the aroma that fills the air when it percolates. Only downside is merely my preference: It doesn't have the clear knob at the top of the percolator that allows you to see the coffee pumping up into the stem and going over the grounds. the reason percolated coffee is so much better than drip coffee is that it continually picks up the water in the pot to filter down through the grounds more than just the one time that drip coffee passes through the grounds. It pumps it up time and time until it is done. For a full 12 cup pot, it literally takes only 12 minutes to brew. People who live in areas with hard water will especially like percolated coffee because you will not have to put up with the calcium deposits that collect in the tubing of a drip machine, which significantly slows the brew time and make coffee taste harsh. I clean it out after every pot with soapy water and enjoy a great pot of percolated coffee every time. I just wipe the outside of it with a dry towel and it shines without any water spots and looks great on the counter.
