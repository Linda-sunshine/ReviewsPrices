review/summary: Makes some great coffeereview/text: I bought this in order to save my old glass Pyrex pot. We love percolator coffee. Since I am getting older I was afraid I would break it. Suprised with the quality of this pot. Nice heavy metal. So far it we have been really happy with the end result.
