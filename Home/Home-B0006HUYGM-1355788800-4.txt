review/summary: Clean dog hair off my couch like newreview/text: You can not imagine how many hairs a beagle dog will shed everyday. My chocolate brown corduroy couch were like covered by a layer of white ashes, and the dog hairs are like rooted on my couch, it was very hard to remove them. So I went online to search for a good hand vac, and I found this Eurika 71B, I bought it, I could not stand the dog hair on my couch and stain on my clothes, and got carried to my car, and my work chair. Well, this vacuum did not fail me, it did great job in cleaning my couch, it can be hairless like new again. The rich chocolate brown color show beautifully again. I can't tell you how happy I am with the job this vacuum did. I can't live without this vac any more.But every product has it perfect area of performance, as to vacuum on a car, it will do the job, but not very idea, it will need an outlet near by, you will need to held it by one hand, the other hand need to handle the hose, then it will be too heavy. As the couch job, I love it.
