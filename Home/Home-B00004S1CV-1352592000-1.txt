review/summary: Hot for hoursreview/text: This tumbler keeps my tea hot for hours and hours. Sometimes too long. Remember to leave the sipper off for a while if you don't want your mouth to burn like I don't. Cool to the touch on the outside. Perfect size for tea. Anything bigger would be too much for me. Seals are holding up well after a month of use. Would recommend.
