review/summary: Perfect for spicesreview/text: I bought this to replace a hand spice grinder and an older electric grinder of a different brand. I can't possibly be more happy with this grinder. I tested on all manner of soft and hard spices: long pepper, red pepper, whole cumin, fenugreek, and annatto. It ground them all to a fine powder with no problems.Long pepper in particular is a very hard spice, much harder than standard pepper, and I've had a lot of trouble grinding it properly in the past. It even broke one of my hand grinders, but this one ripped through it easily.
