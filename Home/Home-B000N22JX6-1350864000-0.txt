review/summary: small but works very wellreview/text: i got these friday and use them once friday night downstair in are living room and then again in are bedroom upstairs. in the livingroom it is open so you could feel them but nothing like in the bedroom. my wife and daugther us it in are middle room and it was like a steam room in there nice and warm. that room is the smallest in are house so i was like ok that works in a small room with the door close cool. so last night i used it in my bedroom and my daughters bedroom and there probable about 10ft by 12ft a good size and they work really well to hot on low. high which is 1500 watts has a thermostat. on low it doesn't it its stuck on max which is ok i just turn it off but man these things work. and i love the shut off timer
