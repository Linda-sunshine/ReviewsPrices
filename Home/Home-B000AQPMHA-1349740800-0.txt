review/summary: My daily brewreview/text: Looked at so many of these coffee makers before making up my mind on the Keurig.Instructions on use are very easy to follow and it was nice to get a free box of assorted coffees to try along with it. One review I read said it was noisy, I don't find it noisy at all. You do hear the water heating but no more than you would if you perk coffee. The machine doesn't take up as much room as I thought it might on the counter top and is easily kept clean and really easy to use. by the time I sort out my chocolate bar my coffee is ready.Checked the price on this Keurig at many stores and decided it was good for me to buy at Amazon where I have Prime act. nothing to carry from the store it was delivered to the door.
