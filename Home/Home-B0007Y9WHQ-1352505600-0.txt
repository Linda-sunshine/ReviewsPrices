review/summary: Great concept, poor materialsreview/text: I was so excited to find this product and use it for the first time. It gave me the most creative zucchini - right up until the handle broke off in my hands on the first use. Then to add insult to injury, AMAZON'S RETURN POLICY IS NOT, I REPEAT, NOT EASY. It wouldn't recognize my order, and there's no customer service email on the site. This could make a person stop ordering things from Amazon.
