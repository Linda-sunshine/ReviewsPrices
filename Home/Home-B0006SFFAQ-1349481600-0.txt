review/summary: Makes Great Coffeereview/text: Cons:The clock is so small it is unusable. This was a bummer for me because my previous one had a big bright clock which you could see from anywhere in the kitchen.The old-style toggle switch on the front is more tacky than design-y.It uses a carbon filter, but they are kind of expensive (I suggest using a filtered water pitcher)Pricey. I found a similar one at Costco for less money (around $40, here I paid about $70)Pros:Gets the water hot fast, and you can get a half a cup of coffee in less than a minute. The whole pot brews in maybe five. I've never timed it, but it's twice as fast as my last one.It has the "type 2" tall, funnel-like filters. This is more effective for extracting the flavor from the grounds.The caraffe is made of a nice glass that doesn't stain. I can just rinse it everyday and wash it rarely.Easy to take apart and clean.Has the gold-tone filter. What I like about this so much is if you run out of filters, you can still make coffee using just this.Four-hour off is MUCH better than my previous with two hours.It has a rather ingenuitive lid to the caraffe.
