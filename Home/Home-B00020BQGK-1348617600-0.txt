review/summary: Totally worth itreview/text: I've got this vacuum for about a month now. I live in an apartment, small room but because of old decoration and appliances, I have to clean very frequently to prevent pests. This vacuum is a big saver. It is not expensive, takes rather small area for storage (a big plus to me), easy to clean (not as easy as bag ones of course), and works at a relatively low noise level.Compared to several stick vacuums I've used before, this one has the highest performance-cost ratio. If you have limited budget and want to get the most, this is your choice.
