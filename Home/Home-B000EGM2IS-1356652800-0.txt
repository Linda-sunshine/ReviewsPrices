review/summary: Terrific alternative to microwavereview/text: Why use an entire large microwave oven to heat a single cup of water for tea or soup or such when you can do it in the same amount of time with less power and waste? This is the third HotShot I've had (my first was in my dorm at college) and the simple design and function make this thing last&#8230;well, not forever, but much longer than one would expect at this price.No, you cannot heat milk or soup or coffee or any liquid other than water. And you can't fit a tall mug under the dispenser spout. But other than that, it's great!
