review/summary: Have had this for 8 years for use in laundry roomreview/text: I have a laundry room in the center of the house and as anyone knows doing laundry creates dust! I decided to keep a straight suction smaller BAGGED (hate bagless) vacuum like this in the laundry room and it fits perfectly where I need it to because of its shape. It takes months for the bag to fill up and it doesn't seem to lose much suction at all or smell because I'm only really using it for clean dryer lint and to vacuum all around the laundry room when I'm finished doing laundry. Bag's aren't that expensive and are super easy to change....Nothing on this vacuum has failed as of yet, however, the switch to turn it off/on is on top and I've noticed recently that you have to push the switch a few times to turn it off/on before in works. I'm thinking the switch is going bad........But I paid 60 dollars for this 8 years ago and I have used it a lot here and there. If anyone has any recommendations about the switch, let me know. I'm not handy with things like that though unfortunately.
