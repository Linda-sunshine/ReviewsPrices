review/summary: BEST $80 I'VE EVER SPENT !!!!!review/text: Well, it's true. By far, the best $80 I've spent on amazon. It does exactly what i want; makes an extremely fast espresso, with excellent crema on the cheap !!!I use Lavazza Gran Crema Espresso Pods exclusively... but that's only because I bought one of those 150-pod mixer packs and Lavazza Gran Crema was my favorite.Maintenance is a breeze. Once it takes more than one minute to make an espresso, it's time for maintenance. All you have to do is clean the machine ! It's really easy. In addition to regular sponge/soap, you will need a fine needle to unclog the filter. Oddly enough, a 30gauge insulin needle works perfectly - as it fits through each hole. If not, a fine sewing needle will do the trick - enough to push out the the coffee that is clogging the holes. I've "descaled" it once since 2011, and just because the manual recommends it.Unfortunately, I can't comment on the frother because I never use it.Again, couldn't be happier with this machine.
