review/summary: Very nice mattress topper!review/text: I actually bought this to cut in half and make two dog beds for my senior dogs since I had trouble finding an orthopedic bed that actually had orthopedic foam. This stuff is really nice! I received it within days of ordering it, which really surprised me! I unrolled it and it started to fill out immediately. There was one spot that didn't fill out, but when I kind of stretched it, it plumped up. I put the mattress on the floor to let it plump and my dogs went to it immediately and I haven't been able to get them off of it (I had to chase them off to put a blanket over it). They all have arthritis and it must feel good to sleep on it, I sure can't get them off of it! I would rate this mattress topper as being somewhat soft or maybe medium, but I wouldn't hesitate to put one on my bed! It really conforms to your body and gives a lot of support. I'm very pleased with my purchase!
