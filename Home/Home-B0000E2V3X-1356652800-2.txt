review/summary: 18-3/16" Diameter Including Handles - Great Value!review/text: Pizza will be 14" in diameter. Lips and handles make the greatest diameter 18-3/16", which may be too large for some apartment-sized ovens. Some mixes are looking for 12" diameter pans; but the flour in the box easily can be augmented with all-purpose flour to fill a 14" pan.Lip is high-enough to make this a good griddle for breakfast pancakes, eggs, sauages. This pan is much easier to handle and clean-up than a 12" cast iron frying pan. Handles are part of the casting; there are no fasteners anywhere to trap dirt.I have about eight Lodge cast iron pans of different sizes. If you like cast iron and the color black, you and your grandchildren will enjoy any Lodge pan.Lodge is exceptional quality and exceptional value.
