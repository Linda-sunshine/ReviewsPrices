review/summary: good value - very loud and unstablereview/text: this is a goo unit for the price, however you can do better.Pros:- big mouth - can fit large items in it- high power engine - gets good juice- nice design, easy to cleanCons- too loud, my neighbors can hear me making a juice- not stable - you need 2 hands on this thing, otherwise it will fly off the deck - when powered on- my unit broke down after the second use, I had to get it fixed at my local shop.After one week I gave this one away to a friend and i bough another machine.I think you can get better units, more elegant ones and more silent ones.if you buy it keep it, if you want to buy one, look for some other options.D.
