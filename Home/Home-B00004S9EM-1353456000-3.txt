review/summary: The Best Food Processorreview/text: I have had this product for 2 years and I use it almost every day. This is the best food processor I've ever used. I mostly use the chopping blade and it does a great job chopping onions, garlic, carrots, celery, hot peppers, kale, etc. I also use it to make peanut butter and it does a great job. It is solid on the counter and doesn't wobble or walk, even with peanut butter. It is easy to clean and does well in the top rack of the dishwasher.
