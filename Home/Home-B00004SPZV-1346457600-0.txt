review/summary: As expectedreview/text: This oil sprayer does a good job. I like its size is just about right for holding in hand. The only complain is occasionally the oil sprayed is not all in mist, but with some oil streams. I may ask too much for this little gadget, after all oil is much more even on the pan bottom than poured in using spoon or bottle.
