review/summary: Great Grillreview/text: We were at our favorite French restaurant in Dallas and had asked how they cooked a dish. This met their description. I measured over the burners on my stove to determine if this grill would fit as some do and some don't. This one fit my stove. It has been getting a lot of use. I have yet to use the griddle side. Fish, beef, pork, potatoes, onions and it's all been good. I am very glad I bought this grill.
