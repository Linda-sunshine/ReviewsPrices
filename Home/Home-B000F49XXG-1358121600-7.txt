review/summary: Have only used the steamer - so far, so good !review/text: The machine has been easy enough to use, although I have only been using the steamer part since I got this product. After a fairly brief warm up time, the steamer heats up the milk very quickly. The froth is variable depending on the position / depth of the steaming nozzle. I've been satisfied so far !
