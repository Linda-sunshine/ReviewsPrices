review/summary: Hoover Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuum, Baggedreview/text: This is an excellent vacuum for the price. Has several stages of filters, and the manual describes cleaning and maint. for those. I checked the first stage after about 9 months of (weekly-) use, and found no dirt buildup whatsoever. Motor is vigorous, and picks up well. I have not tried any of the attachments. My only gripe would be that this vacuum uses Type Y bags. My previous vacuum - also a Hoover - used Type A. This is a necessity, as I have asthma and allergies. However, the Type Y bags are maybe1/3 to 1/2 the capacity of the Type A's, and so must be changed far more often. This means a little more work, but also, greater expense in the long run. My previous Hoover lasted 12-14 years! I have high hopes for this little guy, if not quite that high.
