review/summary: Missing Partsreview/text: Heater seems to work okay, but there was no remote contol or intruction manual in the box. I need the heater to heat a drafty room in my home, and just don't have the time to hassle with returning the item. I am disappointed with my purchase on this one. It does look nice though.
