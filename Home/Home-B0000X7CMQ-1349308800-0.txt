review/summary: Exactly what I wantedreview/text: I have no idea why this coffee maker gets any bad reviews. I do not have an asbestos-mouth and, therefore, can never drink coffee as hot as it is immediately after brewing. In other words, I find the temperature and the quality of the brew excellent - I do use the 1 tbsp coffee grounds to 5 oz water. I've had no occasion to test the insulation of the carafe, but I like that there's not a heated base to drain energy and to forget to turn off. I find the operation incredibly simple. I've had this product for two months and have NEVER had a problem with coffee running over. Another reviewer is correct that the inner basket has a front and back (FRONT labeled as such) and MUST be inserted correctly. Please note that a reusable #4 gold filter works wonderfully even though the fit isn't 100% perfect. Again, have been doing this daily for a full two months and have had no problems. Great product at a great price.
