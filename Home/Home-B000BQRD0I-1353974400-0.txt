review/summary: I was skeptical... but it's pretty good.review/text: The most important part of a steamer is the hose, it has to be light and flexible, and of enough length to be used comfortably. Thick rubber is just about the worst material they could have chosen for that... I thought. However upon using it, I noticed that the steam actually makes the rubber a lot softer and more flexible when it's flowing through it. Therefore, when it's working, it's actually a pretty nice machine.The steamer also started up pretty quickly, in a couple of minutes steam was flowing. I usually iron shirts right before I use them, so the quantity of water, though short (another reviewer said it only lasts 15 minutes) is fine for me.The metal pole where you're supposed to hang your clothes from is of a comfortable length.
