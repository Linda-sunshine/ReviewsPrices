review/summary: I'm a convertreview/text: After years of buying cheap teflon pans and then having to throw them out, I decided to give cast iron a try. I was intimidated at first because I didn't know much about cast iron except that it rusted. So, with yahoo's assistance (they posted a Mansome video, episode 23), I was pleasantly surprised that the seasoning/care/cleaning of cast iron was really easy.I bought the 6/5 in skillet pan, the 10 in lid, and the 10in skillet. After cooking on these for a couple of months now, these are my go to pans for any skillet cooking. Bacon tastes soooooo much better in these skillets. It's easier to cook eggs, fish, pork chops mainly because these heat better than the other pans. I am planning, budget permitting, on replacing all of my pans, griddles, and pots with Lodge cast iron.
