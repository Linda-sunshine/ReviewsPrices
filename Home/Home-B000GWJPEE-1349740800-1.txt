review/summary: A leaky messreview/text: I bought this product because I thought it was really cute, and the reviews seemed to be positive overall. However, my experience was not good. I followed all the instructions to a T and it worked nicely for about 3 days, then shortly afterward started malfunctioning. Every time I filled it up and turned it on water would flood out, and mist wouldn't come out. The only way I could get the mist to start coming out and the water to not leak out was to barely fill the tank and then fiddle around and move the top part so it was tilted to the side, which allowed the mist to flow out. I'm sorry to say I think this product is an example of something that pulls you in with its looks but fails to deliver on performance.
