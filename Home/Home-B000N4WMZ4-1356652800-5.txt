review/summary: The enamel bottom burns easilyreview/text: I've had my lodge dutch oven for about 2 years now (received as a gift). In the beginning, it was great. Le Creuset on a budget. But over time, the enamel wears on the base of the pot, causing food items to stick. By comparison, I also have two Staub cocottes which I have had zero issues with food items sticking.If you're looking for a dutch oven for the long haul, I would not recommend this. However, if you're satisfied with as short-term pot, this will do just fine.
