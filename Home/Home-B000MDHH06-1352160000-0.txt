review/summary: surprised my husband and my kids like it!review/text: I got it yesterday...made apple/carrot/celery juice last night, and apple/Asian pear/kale juice this morning. My husband was suspicious of the idea of buying a juicer; but he wasn't aware of how nice they are now. He pronounced it easy to use and clean. Just like the videos I watched on youtube, food can fly out the chute, but you just need to work fast. This morning I was so entertained I overfilled it, and the pitcher over-flowed. LOL. The kale was what flew back out of the food chute, so I need to work on a technique for that. Also, I noticed air is blowing out the hole from the machine into the pitcher, and I'm thinking that is warming up the juice. The fruit/veggies are going in cold but the juice coming out is cool. Definitely drinkable, but I think my kids would like it better if it was ice cold, so I'm trying to figure out a way to do that, maybe chill glasses while I'm juicing or maybe just work faster, I don't know. BTW, one of my children is enjoying the foam on the juice. A nice tip I read - start with a lot of sweetness to juice (with apples) and then gradually decrease it over 30 days so your taste buds can adjust to the veggies. Definitely a must with kids in the house. Lastly, I will comment on the manual...the recipes are adequate...it's just funny they converted everything to English measurements, but didn't change "capsicum" for "peppers" or "beetroot" for "beets" or "beef mince" for "ground beef." They do include a few recipes for alcohol-based drinks, some recipes to use the leftover pulp. The beef mince one was for a meatloaf using the pulp. So far, we are very happy with it.
