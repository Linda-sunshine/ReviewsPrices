review/summary: Great electric kettlereview/text: We have been using it for just over a week. It boils quickly (about 3 minutes)and love that it stays cool to the touch. Be aware you do need to pour slowly to keep the liquid in the center of the spout because it is a bit shallow.The only drawbacks:1) Max fill line is a bit hard to see inside the kettle, especially when it is wet.2) There is no sound to signify it is done, so you have to listen for the boiling sounds.
