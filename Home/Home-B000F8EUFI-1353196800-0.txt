review/summary: It's like a toy vacuum, except without the fun lights.review/text: Length:: 0:34 MinsSorry about the sound - this vacuum has a horrible screeching sound to it -- but I wanted it to be clear that the vacuum was on.This is the worst vacuum I have ever used. The little hand-held, battery operated Dirt Devil I used to clean out my first car was light years better. The vacuum does not pick anything up. Period. Not on hard wood and not on rugs. You have to see it to believe how bad it is. It blows things like cereal flakes and other crusty stuff around, and it just moves fuzzies around. I would never, ever, ever recommend this to anyone. I want to give it away to someone, but it's not worth anyone's time to pick up.I can't believe things like this are still even made.
