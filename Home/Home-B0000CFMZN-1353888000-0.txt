review/summary: A pox on Pyrexreview/text: If you expect to ever try to pour liquid from your measuring cup--this is NOT the cup you want. I made Jello-O and tried to pour it into separate bowls. No matter what or how I tried, the liquid just ran down the side of the cup. Jell-O everywhere, and I mean everywhere. Never had that problem with my old-style Pyrex cups. I have a Frigovere glass pitcher with same approximate diameter opening and glass thickness and it pours perfectly, neatly, so it's a design flaw. The Pyrex designers should have to spend eternity trying to pour successfully from their new design; and it would take eternity, because it simply can't be done. I was putting the brand-new cup in my donation box, when it occured to me that I would simply be passing on the FRUSTRATION. My new Pyrex measuring cup went in the trash. Caveat emptor.
