review/summary: Love this rice cooker!review/text: The Zojirushi rice cooker is perfect! It cooks perfect rice every time, very easy to use, nice thick bowl that is easy to clean, and is small enough for our kitchen. We accidentally left some rice on the keep warm setting over night and in the morning we still had perfect rice! Highly recommend it, well worth the price.
