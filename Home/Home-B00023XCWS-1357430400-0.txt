review/summary: Excellent tea kettlereview/text: This is an excellent electric tea kettle for the price. I was a little nervous purchasing it, given the reviews stating that there's a strong plastic taste and smell. When I received the kettle, there was a very strong plastic smell. I first washed the kettle with some dish soap, then boiled 2 kettles of water, per the instructions. Since then, the plastic smell is barely noticeable and haven't tasted it in my tea. I suppose it's possible that some people might be much more sensitive to the plastic smell, but for me, there are no issues.
