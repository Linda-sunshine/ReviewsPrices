review/summary: Keeps me a wakereview/text: I love this coffee maker because I use it to help me stay a wake when I surf the web. I love to surf the web all the time that I am at home. I recommend this product for people that surf the web all the time. I also use this coffee maker to make coffee for me when I have to get up early in the morning for work. I use the programable program on this coffee maker to start brewing the coffee about 30 minutes before I wake up:-)
