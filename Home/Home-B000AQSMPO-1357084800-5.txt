review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: Dear Fellow Consumers,I bought this model last spring. My husband and I loved it. I am a busy graduate student and mother and this was great to make fast coffee on the go; however, after less than a year the Keurig will not turn on... I can not get in to the machine to service it without risk of damaging it, so I had to replace it and wait until I have time to call the company. I replaced the Keurig with a traditional coffee maker, which I can program to brew the night before for quick coffee in the morning at 1/3 the price.I am extremely disappointed about this and it makes me wonder about the quality and usability of this brand.Sincerely,Elizabeth
