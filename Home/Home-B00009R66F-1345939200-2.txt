review/summary: Great for home usereview/text: This is a great product but does seem to only clean a smaller spot at a time. It covers maybe 6'x9' area while using the surge. Then you drain, refill and repeat as needed. It would take a long time to clean a large room thoroughly. We have two large dogs and a baby and really only needed to clean smaller areas, so this works great for us.It comes with a bottle of cleaner which would last for a good amount of time if you dont plan to clean large amounts.
