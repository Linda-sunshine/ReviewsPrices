review/summary: Mreview/text: People, Quartz infared heaters, heat the objects and walls in the room not the air directly and should not be set at your feet or where children or aninals can get to them. Place them on a ceramic tile on a table top so you don't over heat a wood table top. As the walls and furniture warm so does the room air.
