review/summary: Four stars for comfort, minus 2 stars for awful smellreview/text: I got this as a gift thinking it would be a perfect complement to a very firm mattress. I have to agree with the general consensus on the fantastic comfort this thing can provide. Once you get on top, you sink in and don't want to move. However, the deal breaker for me was the gawd awful toxic smell this thing emits. I'm pretty sure this foam is made with all sorts of unhealthy petrochemicals that make for a really soft comfortable foam on your skin but do a number on your lungs. And I'm talking about the burning sensation even after letting it air out for two weeks in a well ventilated room. Fresh out of the box is unbreathable.The only way I found to dissipate the smell was by leaving it outside on a patio for a month. Thankfully, the toxic smell has considerably diminished but the sunlight has degraded the foam so that it is not nearly as soft. It will no longer be used on a bed and will now be shredded and used as filler for a bean bag. Lesson learned, no foam is going on my bed without the all important sniff test before purchase.
