review/summary: The bestreview/text: I don't have the repeat what the 800+ reviewers have said about this knife. It keeps its sharpness well, has great balance, is very versatile, and very easy on the wallet. I use it for almost all my cutting in the kitchen. If you don't go comparing this with $200 knives, you'll be very satisfied.I prefer this over the Victorinox 7&#34; Santoku, which feels way too light for me. Also, I find that granton edges are overrated, so I wouldn't pay extra to have that feature.
