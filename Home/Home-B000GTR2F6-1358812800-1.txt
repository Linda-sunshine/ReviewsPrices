review/summary: Great... if you're a coffee drinkerreview/text: This was on sale at costco, and after hearing all my friends raving about theirs, I bought one. Now, I don't drink coffee, but I love tea and hot coco and I heard there was a nice variety of those for Keurig too... however this is only true if you're into artificial sweeteners (I am not). After owning it for a few months, here are my pros and cons:Pro:* water heats up fast* water comes out hot but not too hot (I know other people argue this point, but it's hot enough for me)* Different cup sizes* tall enough so when I'm lazy, I can use the water to make cup of noodles tooCon:* Pricey* Most fancy drinks are made with artificial sugars so this really cuts down on the variety factor* No filter so you have to buy water if yours tastes like death (like mine)If you drink coffee, you may be in love with this machine. If you don't and are okay with artificial sweeteners in your drinks than that's good too. If I hadn't of had the great buy at costco, there is no way I would have kept this overpriced water heater.
