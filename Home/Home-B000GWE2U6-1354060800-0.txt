review/summary: Over-rated and Over-heatedreview/text: We purchased the Hello Kitty version for our 5 year daughter in June 2012. I was very pleased with this product for the first couple of months. It was quiet and worked great, but in November 2012 I noticed that the motor was on, but no mist was coming out of the top. I couldn't figure out the cause of the problem, but after further inspection I realized that not only did it stop working but the water in the water chamber was boiling hot and I burned myself. So I stopped using it immediately. I'm hoping to get a refund from the manufacturer because obviously this is not a safe product and I do not feel comfortable with my daughter sleeping with it in her room. I'm glad it was me that got burned instead of her.
