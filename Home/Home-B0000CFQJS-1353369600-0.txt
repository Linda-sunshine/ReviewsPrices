review/summary: Does what it is supposed to doreview/text: I bought this because a review of the coffeemaker I was buying said that sometimes the paper filters collapse and grounds go down into the coffee. This product keeps that from happening, which is what I was looking for. Also, this product will save money in the long run since I would not have to keep buying paper filters.However, I don't like the taste of the coffee when using this basket as much as I like the coffee made with paper filters. That's why I gave it 3 out of 5 stars.
