review/summary: Meets expectationsreview/text: I have had this vacuum a few weeks and it has performed as well as I expected. We use it to vacuum the stairs, vacuum pet hair from the furniture and clean the cars. So far, it has performed extremely well. My kids have fun using it to vacuum up messes as well. Very handy!
