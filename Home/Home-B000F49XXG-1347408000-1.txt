review/summary: Not for espressos.. do not buyreview/text: I purchased this espresso maker after reading many reviews and seeing that at least 500 persons rated it with 5 stars. Big mistake i made. I followed all instructions and even waited the 30 minute preheat instruction that the manual said, used different brands of coffee, grounded coffee myself, and still no creme on my espresso. I re-read reviews, searched google and youtube to see what I am doing wrong and let me warn you: this machine does not make espressos, it makes a soupy mess as several reviews here have stated.I regret having bought this and unfortunately cannot return it since I live outside the US and returning it would cost me as much aas its price.
