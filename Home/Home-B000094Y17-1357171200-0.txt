review/summary: Convenient way to have fresh water - and to drink more of it.review/text: I have owned one of these big Britas for over a year and recently purchased this one for a friend for Christmas who lived in an apartment and had poor tasting water. After a couple weeks, she has told me she not only loves the taste of the water but finds herself drinking more of it at home.Her response was the same as mine initially - and the same as my opinion after a year of use. These are very convenient to have, hold a decent amount of water, and fit nicely in most fridge door slots for milk/juice.Things to note:-When full, the pitcher isn't that easy to hold as it gets heavy from the water and the handle design isn't very ergonomic. All the water weight puts strain on your wrist (probably not an issue for men, but some females have made this remark to me when using mine).-Lid isn't very secure. If you overfill the pitcher, water stays in the &#34;fill&#34; basin and can easily splash out when you tilt the pitcher to poor. The lid doesn't lock in, it simply slides on. It does slide on pretty snug, so its not loose or easily moving. But it come pop open water is still in the basin when you're pouring.Oh, and rule #1 for using a Brita: change the filter annually, not every 3 months. Unless you are some odd clean freak, these filters will give you great tasting water for at least a year. I changed my first one after 3 months, second one recently at 12 months of use and the water tasted great the whole time.
