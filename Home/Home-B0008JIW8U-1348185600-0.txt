review/summary: Much smaller than I thought!review/text: I just purchased this machine and am sending it back unused so I can't fairly rate it.My complaint is when I read "4 cup coffee maker" I assumed that meant 32 ounces. This is NOT. The carafe held 24 ounces of water (very full) when I tested it. That is much smaller than the 2 to-go cups my husband and I walk out the door with, and really, what's the point of leaving the house with a 1/2 cup of coffee?I was excited about it, it's just way too tiny. Would like some clarification that the "cups" that they are talking about are not actual 8 ounce cups.
