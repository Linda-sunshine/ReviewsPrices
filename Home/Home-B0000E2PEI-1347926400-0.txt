review/summary: Dont waste your moneyreview/text: Purchased this because i liked the look and when I received it was very happy. Very modern design. However if you are buying a scale to monitor weight loss/gain dont waste your time or money.....one day your 182, next day 194 next day 180....and these fluctuations can even happen in the same day, you step on the scae it will read one number, you step off and step back on again in an hour and there is a huge fluctutation from 182 to 192..10 lbs....never had a scale do this and it happens constantly, VERY unreliable and not worth the aggrevation
