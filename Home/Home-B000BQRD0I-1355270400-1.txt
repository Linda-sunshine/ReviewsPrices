review/summary: Loved it!review/text: Small, compact steamer. It heats up real fast.Like some other affordable steamers, it spews out a bit of water but nothing too much.I don't use the heat resistant pad thing. It's ugly and cheap-looking.Easy to use, once you get the hang of it a few times.Makes all my clothes crisp and new - actually motivates me to steam my clothes a bit more because I can't do a good iron job to save my life. Definitely dump out the water when you're done so the minerals don't clog up or else you're screwed for another steamer.
