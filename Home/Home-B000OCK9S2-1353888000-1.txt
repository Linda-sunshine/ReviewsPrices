review/summary: sleep like a babyreview/text: Had gotten use to sleeping with the air conditioner on during the summer and when the weather cooled and I did not use the air conditioner one night, I could not sleep. Came to realize I could only sleep with the sound of the air conditioner. Went on line to find an alternative to running an expensive air conditioner at night and found this. I liked that it provided a variety of sounds, so that I could find the one that would the best for me and even will record the air conditioner if I like. Nice, sleek design. Light enough that I can take it on a trip.
