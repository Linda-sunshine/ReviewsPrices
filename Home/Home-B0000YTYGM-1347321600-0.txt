review/summary: The carafe isn't strong enough to hold a full pot of coffee.review/text: Due to the weight of a full (hot) pot of coffee, the plastic top came off the stainless steel carafe while I was pouring a cup of coffee.As a result, the plastic handle broke at the bottom where it was attached to the stainless steel carafe. A full carafe of coffee should not cause the plastic top to dislodge.Also, as other other reviewers have written, it tends to overflow if the carafe isn't exactly in place while the coffee is brewing or if "the perfect" cone (reusable) coffee filter isn't used.
