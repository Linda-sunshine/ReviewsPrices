review/summary: Whoo Hoo!review/text: I got this for Christmas from my daughter (really my husband), and while I haven't owned it for a long time or used it a ton, I do really really like it! I've made a bunch of smoothies with it since I've gotten it and it does well. It's easy to grip and breaks the food down pretty quick. It's also really easy to clean. It disassembles with the push of a button and just clicks back in when cleaned.Later, I'll move on to &#34;harder&#34; items :-) If I find my review changes over time, I'll definitely update. Until then, it's great! And the pink color rocks!
