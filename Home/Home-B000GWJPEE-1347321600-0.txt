review/summary: Great little humidifier!review/text: The humidifier arrived on the expected delivery date. This little humidifier seems to do a great job although I have only had it for one day. It holds a lot of water, it allows you to determine the amount of mist it puts out, and it is quiet. I wanted the humidifier not only for the cool mist but as a 'white noise' too so it could be noisier for my purpose. There is a green light on the front that tells you when the humidifier is on, and that green light is annoying; I don't like extra light in my bedroom. But for parents this could be used a a nightlight. The machine ran all night and did not come close to using up all the water in the Reservoir (the setting was on medium). The machine is easy to fill with water, and it is easy to see the water level. It is of flimsy construction so we'll see how long it lasts.
