review/summary: Tricky to program; power outlet requires, well, power.review/text: When I turn something on I don't like to think about it too much. For instance, a digital Casio wristwatch is impossible to &#34;program&#34; (if you will) without the map from Hades instructions it comes with. This radio is a little like that. It seems to have a lot of features which I'll never use and seems overly complicated. Shouldn't every device be just like an ipod? :) I still have not received the Wednesday test warning that goes out from my local NOAA station.Also, it does require power. OH but this guy needs special power. I hope you weren't planning to have something plugged into that other outlet you're using with this. Because the radio won't get a signal when it's plugged in along with another device. OK, great for you HAM guy, you know all about radios and power and stuff. You called an electrician and got an extra receptacle just for this radio. You're amazing.
