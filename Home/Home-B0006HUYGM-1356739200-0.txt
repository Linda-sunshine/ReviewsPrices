review/summary: Works great on dog hair and dust!review/text: I have only owned this for a day but so far I love it! My husband got it for me per my request so I could clean the carpeted stairs. It's not so easy to keep clean with 2 shedding dogs and living in a very dusty area. This vacuum picked up so much hair and dirt it's gross!Some people said its heavy but i dont find it very heavy at all, if they say it is its because there is no pull to it like a normal vacuum, its manually operated.
