review/summary: Very Handyreview/text: I've used this coffeemaker for two months, and it's been great. Performance is consistent. All of the components work properly and as described. It cleans up easily enough, and makes a good cup of coffee.I've noticed that the manufacturer filter has become less easily cleaned, in that some residue sticks to it no matter what. I'm wondering how that will play out over time. As well, it would be nice if it had a drip-less feature, as I have to wait for it to completely stop dripping before I can remove the cup. Minor personal observations of an overall good product. I recommend it for someone who wants a quick cuppa to go, with little hassle.
