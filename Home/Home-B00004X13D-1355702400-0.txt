review/summary: Great basic waffle maker!review/text: My old waffle iron started sticking and we went months without waffles and just hade pancakes. Finally after reviewing all the waffle makers I could, I chose this one. It performed flawlessly on the first try. I have used it 2 days in a row and have not been disappointed!
