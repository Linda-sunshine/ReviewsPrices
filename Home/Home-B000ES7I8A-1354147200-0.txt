review/summary: great but the lid is plasticreview/text: I bought this after searching for a no plastic interior. I like the stainless steel, style and wide lid opening however the underside of the lid is plastic. I removed the strainer immediately. The water smelled of heated plastic after many heatings even though the boiling water does not touch it, the steam and heat does. So now I am using a metal saucer as a lid in its place. Because the saucer fits snuggly, the kettle does shut off automatically where other lids that I improvised from the kitchen did not. For health reasons I would NOT buy this kettle again. Easy to clean and fill. The pop open lid was great to use, if only it was not lined with plastic. I was willing to pay more for an all stainless steel, healthier product.
