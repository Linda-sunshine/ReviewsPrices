review/summary: T-fal pan Warpsreview/text: Warped 1st time we used it.Note that we did not shock it with cold water or otherwise mistreat it.Nice and slick surface but now it rocks on our induction stovetop so I don't think it's heating evenly.After waiting on the phone for 15 min. Customer service says you can send it back at your expense.Meanwhile, I imagine a replacement would warp as well?
