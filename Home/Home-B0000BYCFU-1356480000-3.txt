review/summary: my badreview/text: I bought the wrong size and want to help others that are new to pressure cookers. This one is way too big for a normal family of four unless you are into survival canning for a SHTF scenario. Totally my fault, and a four star rating is probably unfair, but that's what I'm going with.I bought this because I own my own business and work 10-12 hours a day, but need to get home and cook my family a hearty meal each night. Many times I want to cook a stew or pot roast but know it would be 8:00 pm by the time something like that was ready to eat. I thought a pressure cooker would help out the timeline a bit.I started browning the meat at 4:30; it's now 7:15 and I'm still trying to boil off all the excess liquid I had to put in to get this gigantic thing up to pressure.This is well made, quality cookware with easy to follow instructions, but it won't fit in a normal sink so you can wash it. If you're not cooking for 15-20 people and don't want to clean up the dinner dishes in the bathtub, buy a smaller one.It's 7:45, the stew is good, but I could have done this in a regular pot in the same time.
