review/summary: Took 3 weeks to deliver, so tightly wound you wouldn't fit a paperclipreview/text: Product is exactly as picture so I only blame myself for buying it. The links are so closely connected you couldn't properly fit a tie, much less a belt. It also took 3 weeks to come from China. At best this is a $.25 piece, if you purchase nothing but slim ties that you don't mind wrinkling. Perhaps I can stretch a cloth over it and turn it into a mini umbrella?
