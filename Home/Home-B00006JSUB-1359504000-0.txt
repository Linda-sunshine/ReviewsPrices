review/summary: Present for my daughterreview/text: I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present. I haven't personally used it, but I cook with nothing but cast iron all of the time. This one comes pre-seasoned. She says she loves it and uses it constantly, but that is hearsay. The pan itself it a good size and can accommodate four servings easily.
