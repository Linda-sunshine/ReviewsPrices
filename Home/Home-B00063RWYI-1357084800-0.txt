review/summary: Messyreview/text: This pot is very heavy, takes a lot of effort to lift (especially with a sore shoulder). Because of the spiked lid and porous interior, cleaning it is a chore and it blackened my spongeI recently discovered the joy of braising and thought a dutch oven would be more versatile than a brasier. My biggest gripe, this lid does not sit flushed on the pot so that both times I used the pot, (recipes had no more than 2 cups of liquid) the liquid 'steamed' out and left a mess all over my stove.I will use it because it was a gift and I appreciate the giver's good intention.
