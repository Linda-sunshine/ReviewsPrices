review/summary: Great alarm clockreview/text: I have had a Sony dream machine for 25 years. It was time to replace the one I had been using, and went back to a dream machine. The features are great, I can can the alarm forward or backwards (couldn't do that on the old one), and instead of using an expensive 9V battery, it uses the small coin sized batteries as a backup. The time comes preset, just set your time zone and your all set. You can change the brightness, and is bright enough during the day, and I can dim it at night so it is not too bright. The numbers are of good size, and the radio works fine, although I don't use it as an alarm, I like the buzzer feature better. Overall a god clock radio that should last me another 25 years.
