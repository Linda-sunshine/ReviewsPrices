review/summary: Cuisinart DLC-10S Proreview/text: Great product to own for fast and consistent food prep. Great overall experience with product. Highly recommend for the Home Chef or professional. My second Cuisinart DLC-10S Pro I've owned. Wouldn't buy anything else. Simple to operate and a snap to clean.
