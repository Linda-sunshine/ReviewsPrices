review/summary: Office Chair_Lorrelreview/text: Good solid chair, comfortable seat & back support, easy to put together. The major problem is the seat tilt back feature. It only goes back approximately 30 degrees. This feature was so badly designed that it actually goes FORWARD as much as it goes back? I bought this for home internet use when I'm sitting relaxed with the seat tilted back. A have a bad feeling some lawyer is behind this idea - "can't let them recline in their chair or they might fall back and sue."
