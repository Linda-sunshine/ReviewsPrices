review/summary: Tepid coffeereview/text: The first pot seemed ok at first, but the coffee cooled down quickly. I realized that I had not tightened the lid properly, so that was my fault. Same deal with the second brewing, though I was careful to tighten the cover and put the extra lid on right away. (Sort of annoying that the lid has two parts.) I used my instant-read thermometer to check the coffee temp as soon as brewing was done; sure enough, only 140 degrees (when optimal is 175). The thermos kept it at 140 for an hour. By the second hour the temp dropped to 135, and I had to heat my cup in the micro. The water does not get hot enough to brew the coffee well, so it tastes weak. One reviewer said that the coffee basket also heats up; as far as I can tell, that is not the case. This coffee is no better than what comes out of my old Cuisinart with the glass carafe; at least the hot plate gets it to a decent temp, even if brewing isn't optimal.The only thing I like about this machine is that the fill window has a red ball that clearly shows you the water level. For $90 you'd think there would be a lot more to like about it. I'm returning it.
