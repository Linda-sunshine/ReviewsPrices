review/summary: Defective plastic, silent customer servicereview/text: I got my aeropress three months ago and found it made good coffee. I like the individual serving idea. About two months later, the plastic on the inside of the cylinder started to break down, forming wrinkles on the inside of the vessel, looking lousy and causing me to wonder if it is or will begin leaching chemical compounds into my morning brew. I alerted the manufacturer to this via the email contact form on their website--twice--and heard nothing in return.So, despite the nifty concept and design, I have to rate this product poorly. In my case it has proven defective, and the company has declined to stand behind it.
