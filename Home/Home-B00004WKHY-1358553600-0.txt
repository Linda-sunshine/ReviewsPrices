review/summary: love it ...review/text: Re: Cuisinart DLC-2009CHB Prep 9-Cup Food Processor, Brushed StainlessWhat a treat to use this food processor! I finally replaced an old (10 years?) food processor that I used for years and found simple and reliable. I was worried I'd never find another one that was reliable and didn't have more bells and whistles than workability! Well, I must say I'm beyond impressed. I guess it's a bit like buying a good new car after driving your old one for a decade, LOL ... I've found this Cuisinart to be much quieter, less vibration, more power, and EASY to assemble and use. I immediately used it to prep for a raclette party -- lots of chopping all different textures and sizes of vegetables, fruits, and mushrooms. It handled all these beautifully in a flash. The seal is great, so no leaking of sauces so far. The only thing I can find that would be an improvement would be a built in area to store blades. That said, love the small footprint of this machine, so wouldn't that to be impacted with any extra storage space ...Love it!
