review/summary: Love this setreview/text: I used some of my Christmas money to purchase this set. I really like the riveted handles on the pots. I was also happy about the mulitiClad interior that was not just on the bottom but up the sides of the pan. The handles really do stay cool. I was a little skeptical about that until I tried them out. I cooked a fried egg on a low seating when my toast was done so was my egg. I was able to wash the pot with just a washcloth and did not have to scrub to get it clean after the egg. I love the looks and upkeep so far is simple. I would have to say this is the best set of pans I have ever owned.
