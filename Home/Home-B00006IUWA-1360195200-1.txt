review/summary: Finally found the right one!review/text: After a very poor experience with another hot air popper &#8212; so many kernels left unpopped, plus it &#34;walked&#34; around the kitchen counter while popping! &#8212; we thought our dreams of healthy popcorn were over...back to microwave, chemically-laden bags. But I decided to give it another try, and read reviews on various poppers. The Presto PopLite has been wonderful, and it pops almost every single kernel every time while staying put. The only complaint, and it's a small one, is it doesn't have an on-switch...it needs to be plugged/unplugged to power it.
