review/summary: Best knife!review/text: We have several expensive knives and as all knives they eventually get dull. Since we've got this knife, almost all the knives except the occasional paring knife when this is too big for the job, all we use is the Victorinox knife. This knife doesn't look as pretty as all the other fancy knives, but the grip is well thought out and I really appreciate that it still grips even if your hands are gooey. Makes the knife much safe. This is the longest knife we've had stay sharp despite regular use. If it weren't so good for so many uses I would look for smaller versions of the knife for other uses but honestly we don't need them! Besides, this is the knife that the folks on America's Test Kitchen uses. What other endorsement do you need?
