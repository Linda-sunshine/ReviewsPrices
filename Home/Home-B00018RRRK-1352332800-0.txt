review/summary: GARBAGE!review/text: I have just replaced this unit for the 3rd time...to be honest I don't know why I still put up with such a piece of junk. I have not had one of these units last more than 12 months before they become so clogged that you can't even clean them. The users manual says to "clean regularly" but the unit is not designed to be clean in such a way that it would be in any way helpful to the longevity of the unit. I am known for taking very good care of my "tools" but this unit makes it impossible. On my first unit the plastic material that the hopper is made out of actually broke loose and WAS GROUND INTO MY COFFEE GROUNDS. I didn't realize it until my coffee tasted terrible. So I inspected the grinder and found a large chunk of the hopper neck (where it threads into the lower portion of the grinder) had broken off while it was grinding coffee.I have had the same "general" issues with this grinder on two (and going on three) occasions. The only reason I am giving a third chance is because they FINALLY replaced it for free. I had to buy the second one out of pocket even after I sent Cuisinart photos of the damage, thus they get low marks in the customer support role as well.
