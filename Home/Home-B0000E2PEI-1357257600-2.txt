review/summary: On a &#34;scale&#34; of 1-5review/text: Pardon the pun. This scale is great, especially since it keeps telling me I weigh less, which for the record is accurate and not any sort of glitch with the product.If you like a scale that will tell you how much you weigh when you step on it, get this scale! I'm glad I did.
