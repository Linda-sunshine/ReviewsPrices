review/summary: Warm food !review/text: Our 6yr daughter used to leave half her lunch because it did not taste good to her when cold ... ever since we have started using this foogo food jar, she has been cleaning up her food at school. Thank you, foogo ! She tells us the food is almost as warm as she typically eats food at home (her lunch break is 4 hrs after her lunch is packed at home).
