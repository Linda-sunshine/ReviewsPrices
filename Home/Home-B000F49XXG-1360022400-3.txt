review/summary: Pump has no power!!!!review/text: Just got the De'Longhi EC155 Bar pump Espresso maker for Chrismas, used it one month and the pump stopped working. I had a steam driven espresso maker before that needed replaced after 3 years of daily use. After reading the reviews I decided to upgrade to a pump driven espresso maker.It seems the pressure is not sufficient to make a cup of strong espresso, also the instructions are a little ridiculous and I quote the user manual : &#34;turn the selector knob to the heating position at least 15 minutes before making the coffee making sure the filter holder is attached....... Wait for half an hour, then make the coffee as described in the following chapter.&#34; Do people really wait 45 minutes to make their coffee, I can go to Starbucks if I have this kind of time to prepare my coffee early in the morning?Also the espresso filters (small and large) are to small to handle a good amount of coffee for 2 espresso cups with sufficient strength.I would not recommend this espresso maker to anybody !!!
