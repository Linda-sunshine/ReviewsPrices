review/summary: Powerful!review/text: So worth the price! It is affordable yet powerful. The attachment to reach hard to get to places has a storage compartment on the vacuum itself. It also has a spot for you to wind up the cord. This makes for easy storage. The cord is really long, I can plug it into the outlet in the garage and still reach the other end of the car. Perfect!
