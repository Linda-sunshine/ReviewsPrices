review/summary: It is very good productreview/text: I have taken this filtration pitcher for filtering tap water before drinking. I actually feel difference in taste of the water. Though there is a small problem, the lid of the pitcher is not tight and one has to handle it carefully so as not to spill water. It filters water very quickly. And it was delivered to us on time. Totally worth the money. Overall it is a great product.
