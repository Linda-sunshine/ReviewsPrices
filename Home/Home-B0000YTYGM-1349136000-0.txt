review/summary: Best Coffe Maker I have Usedreview/text: I have had this for 4 days now and can't believe how great a cup of coffee this thing makes it really is tremendous. I am also amazed at how quickly it brews as well. As far as spilling not an issue just make sure the basket is shut tight and your lid is closed properly. I highly recommend this product I have had many coffee makers but this is the best by far.
