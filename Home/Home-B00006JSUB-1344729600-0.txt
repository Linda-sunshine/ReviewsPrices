review/summary: It's cast-iron with 2 handlesreview/text: I bought 2 different sizes of this, the 10 and 1/4" and the 12", both are very sturdy and have given me no problems. I have 2 complaints, 1 they are very heavy thus hard to pour and 2, they are a pain to clean with a sponge. 1, the handle on the front does a nice job of making this easier. 2, bought the proper tools for cleaning and this wasn't an issue.
