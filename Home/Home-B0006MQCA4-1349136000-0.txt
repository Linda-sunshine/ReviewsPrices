review/summary: Wish it had more capacity...review/text: This has been one of my better purchases. I used to own a Brita water filter that I had to take out and pour the water for each glass. The design was poor because water would leak out the top all the time while pouring a glass. Because of this I decided to try one of these with a tap.The pros:-It is lightweight and easy to move around when empty (both for cleaning and refilling)-The filters have lasted quite some time even with two people drinking on a daily basis-The water tastes way better than our tap water-Keeping this full of water in the fridge actually makes the fridge run more efficiently, go green :)-No need to take it out and pour the water for each glassThe cons:-I wish it was bigger, I suppose I could buy a second one
