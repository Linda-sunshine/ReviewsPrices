review/summary: Great Home Immersion Blenderreview/text: I can't believe I've been living all these years without this thing. It is now an absolute staple in my small kitchen. It saves me so much time making soups because I can puree them directly in the pan; no more transferring batches back and forth to your food processor. I find it has amazing power for a small home blender too. It runs fast and will emulsify sauces quickly. Cleaning the blender is incredibly simple too. The bottom snaps off in one piece that you can either run through the dishwasher or simply rinse out and let dry. Of course, as with all Cuisinart appliances, the range of available colors doesn't hurt one bit. But at least in this blender's case, it's performance proves it's more than just a pretty face.
