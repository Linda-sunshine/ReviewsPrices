review/summary: is this supposed to be for your neck?review/text: This pillow is WAY too hard and high to be a neck pillow. You'll end up with neck problems after using it. However, I do like to prop my calves up on in when lying down. It has great support and doesn't sink/flatten. BUT FOR YOUR HEAD AND NECK?!?! NO WAY!
