review/summary: Dimmer is EXTREMELY BRIGHT! (High & Low Setting)review/text: The features on this clock are nice, particularly the variety of sounds it offers. But, the dimmer feature on this clock is terrible. First night going to bed, the blue light literally lit up the entire room. Immediately changed it to the &#34;low&#34; setting and it didn't make it any better. It was still bright! With the extreme brightness and the funky blue used it made it very difficult to read the time on the clock. Try again Conair!
