review/summary: Not impressedreview/text: Bought this with the idea of brew and go ... Well lid is not made for travel , leaked everywhere on my white work blouse. We would have sent it right back however tossed the box too soon. Also cup cannot be put in dishwasher as there is now water between the 2 metal layers in cup. I don't recommend this product! I got it as an in the meantime while waiting to get a Keurig - guess you get what ya pay for !
