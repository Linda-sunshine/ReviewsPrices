review/summary: Saved $100 plus over K-cupsreview/text: I owned a Black and Decker Brew 'n Go for over 15 years. To replace it, I had purchased the more expensive K-cup coffee maker and a case of K-cups with a total cost around $150. When I brought it home I had buyer's remorse and so I started looking for a one cup coffee maker to replace the one that broke. I am thrilled with this product and its mug. I love being able to use regular ground coffee and just rinse out the filter after each use. It make a nice hot cup of coffee with no waste. The mug is designed to fit in the car cup holders which is a great improvement over my old ones. For the money and convenience, this product cannot be beat.
