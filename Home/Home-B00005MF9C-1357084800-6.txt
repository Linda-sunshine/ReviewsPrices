review/summary: No longer any quality conrol for this productreview/text: I bought the Black & Decker Brew n Go about two years ago and was very happy with it.Towards the end when you pushed the switch down to start the brewing cycle it would pop back up. I ordered a new one and when i received it the upper lid was not connected to the inner lid so that when you lifed it up the inner lid would not lift with it . The part that held the two lids together was broken. I contacted Amazon and they sent me another one and told me to send back the defective one. I received the replacement right away. When i tried to heat some water to cleane out the machine as the instructions said the switch to start the heating process would not stay down at all and poped up as soon as you took your finger off it. So i received two new brew N go cofee makers and both of them were defective. I dont understand how a brand new appliance could leave the factory and it does not even work. What ever happened to quality control. After two defective brewers i did not want to chance a third so i requested a refunc. Very disapointed with this product.
