review/summary: Caught on Firereview/text: We purchased the Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew Central Jan, 2011. First, let me say that until this week, this is the best coffee pot I've ever owned. Coffee was hot, flavorful and tasted better than anything we've made before. I loved this coffee pot!Fast Forward to Oct, 2012. We've use it every morning, but not all day. It makes one pot a day with no problems.However, this week we really got a wake up when in the middle of brewing it started popping, smoking, hissing and sounding/smelling like an electrical fire. Obviously we unplugged it and everything stopped, but in looking on line this appears to be a common problem with this unit.I just got off the phone with Cuisinart and they are sending out another one at no charge and they are covering the shipping. They want me to send them back the cord at my cost, which won't be much. But obviously this is a common enough problem that they know it's in the cord. As a long time Cuisinart customer, I'm disappointed not only in the life of this unit, but also that there isn't a recall of some sort on these coffee makers. It's obviously a common problem.In terms of if I'd ever purchase another one, it's a toss up. When it worked, it was the best for it's price range and we loved it. But obviously it has some fatal flaws that can crop up at any time. It's certainly a different way to wake up without caffeine in the morning!We purchased the unit at Amazon and love Amazon, so no problems there. But buyer beware, this looks like a common, un-addressed problem from the manufacturer. At the suggestion of another reviewer with the same problem, I've contacted the Consumer Products Safety Commission (1-800-698-2772). This could really cause a fire and hurt someone and should be recalled.
