review/summary: Great Knife at a Great Price!review/text: II only thought I had ever had a sharp knife before this one came along. Cooks Illustrated recommended this one as a best buy and they are so right. Just be aware even though it is an 8 inch knife it is much longer overall than any other 8 inch knife I have and may not fit in your drawer as mine would not, so you may want to consider the bladesafe by victorinox as well.
