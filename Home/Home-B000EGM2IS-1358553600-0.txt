review/summary: Too Short for General Usereview/text: This seemed like a great, simple solution for my elderly mom, but when I received it, I found out that it's is too small for just about every coffee cup in her house! I also tried placing a Cup-of-Noodles under it, and it just barely fits if you slide it in. f you don't carefully slide the Cup-of-Noodles out, the edge of the cup will catch on it.
