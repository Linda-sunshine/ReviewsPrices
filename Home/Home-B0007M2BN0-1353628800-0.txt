review/summary: I succumbed to kitchen gadget disease.review/text: This is easy to use and does what is described. Easy to clean. Super hot when you first pull it out, so be careful- not for young children to be using. If you don't mind it taking up shelf space then I would go ahead and purchase it, but if you are at all cramped on space skip this.
