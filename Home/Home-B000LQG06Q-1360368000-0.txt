review/summary: Perfect for a full size hard futon mattressreview/text: I am using my sofa bed mattress on my bed frame. The mattress was horrible, hard and uncomfortable i thought i was done for, as i dont have money to purchase a new mattress right now.I invested in this mattress topper and i am so happy i did:It is soft and sturdy and the new smell, mint, was so nice i was upset when it disappeared.The topper completely softened up the mattress, now i feel so comfortable i really dont want to leave my bed in the morning. The memory foam is nice and durable and although it looks flimsy it isnt, as long as you dont take scissors to it or get rough with it. I have a mattress cover i put over both the mattress and topper, it is a zippered cover so it hold everything in place.This is a temporary fix for me eventually i will buy a new mattress but i will still keep and use this topper!!
