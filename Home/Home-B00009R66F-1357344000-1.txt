review/summary: Cleaned my carpets better than the professional carpet cleaners. Cheaper too!review/text: This carpet cleaner cleaned my carpets better than the professional carpet cleaners I had hired previously. The steam cleaner cost less than one visit from the &#34;pros&#34;. It sucked up more excess water than the pros as well, leaving my carpets dry enough to walk on immediately afterward and totally dry in a few hours.
