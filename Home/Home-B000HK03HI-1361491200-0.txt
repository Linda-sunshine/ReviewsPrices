review/summary: Nice Can Openerreview/text: I was in the market for a new can opener for a long time. I was looking at electric openers and none of them, in my opinion, were worth buying. Originally I began looking at manual openers just to replace the cheap, junk one that I was using. I feel fortunate to have found this Zyliss before wasting money on an electric opener. This Zyliss is stylish, doesn't waste counter space, and is nearly effortless to use. I can't ever imagine buying an electric can opener now. The colors are nice too.
