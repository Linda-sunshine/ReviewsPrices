review/summary: TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICEreview/text: Do not purchase this item!I purchased this item less then 2 months ago and only used it approx 10 times. At first it made very good bread but the past two uses the bread maker did not function properly. The "Kneading Bar" (used to mix the dough) started spinning as fast as a blender. The bar is supposed to turn much slower.When I attempted to use the Panansonic customer service website it was down, not a good start but I proceeded to call the 1-800 number. Immediately it was clear that I was speaking to someone overseas. I could barely interpret what the representative was saying.I was told my unit was covered by the Panasonic 1 year warranty and all I had to do was write a note describing in detail the problem with the unit. Then, I was to box the unit up, enclose the letter and a copy of my receipt, haul it down to UPS, Pay to ship it to the nearest PANASONIC service center (over 500 miles away). Then I was too fax PANASONIC my receipt and they would be happy to reimburse my expenses for shipment (not insurance) by rebate (Thanks alot). The product would be returned in 6-8 weeks!I really wanted the unit replaced; after all, it was only a month and a half old, it was defective and it was used 8 times before it broke. I was told this was not an option and "They were giving me a CONCESSION" by paying for the shipping. Also I was put on hold by my customer service representative for over twenty minutes while she supposedly consulted a supervisor!It is obvious that PANASONIC has absolutely no regard for customer service and DOES NOT stand behind their products. I would suggest NEVER to buy ANYTHING PANSONIC AGAIN!
