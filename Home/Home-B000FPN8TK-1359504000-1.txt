review/summary: Great.review/text: Love this teapot for loose teas. Strainer at the bottom does come loose at times. Assuming from the heat of the nearly boiling water. Two months in use. Will have to determine how long it will last. I see no where to buy replacement of the strainer. May have to buy a whole new teapot.
