review/summary: Best carpet steam cleaner.review/text: I had the Hoover Steam Vac that was the model before this one for 14 years. It really does the job, as I have 2 dogs, a husband, and light carpets. Bought this one and I am very pleased, It looks like it is made even better than the last one. Some of the hoses can be a little confusing unless you read the manual, but then it's easy.
