review/summary: somthing wrongreview/text: I bought the same model about seven years ago - no problem at all. But not very happy with the second one. It takes a long time to turn itself off. In my view - because between the net and the body it has a distance about 2mm. I don't know about a standart - probably the second one is normal.
