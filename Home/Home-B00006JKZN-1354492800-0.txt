review/summary: So Reliable!!review/text: My first purchase of this product was so many years ago I cannot even count them! Unfortunately, "old reliable" was damaged during a recent move to a new home. This product made great waffles with every use and with any kind of batter. Naturally, I was happy to see it was still in production and I ordered another post haste! This is truly a classic appliance!
