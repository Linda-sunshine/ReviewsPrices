review/summary: Works great, slight rattlereview/text: My apartment's relative humidity rivals the Sahara Desert in the winter and wrecks havoc on my nasal passage. I used to run a single room ultrasonic humidifer, but there were so many drawbacks that you won't experience with this type of unit.It's a little deceptive, but the unit actually holds 3 gallons of water at a time (2x1.5 gallon containers), not 9, which is the maximum it can output in a day. You can pretty much go all day on low without refilling. The higher the fan, the more often you're refilling. Refilling means the unit is working, and they're large enough that it's not constantly wasting my time like my old 1-liter humidifier. The tops of the water tanks are not flat, so it is a little precarious to screw on the caps of a full tank. I can fully imagine it being difficult for a frail person. If you can carry a jug of milk with one hand, you'll be fine.The low fan speed is quiet enough for most people to sleep to, and you can definitely hear the TV over it. I need to crank the TV up if the unit is blowing on high, but it's not outrageous. The unit sometimes does rattle or vibrate, but a poke or two straightens it out. Light sleepers might find it to be too much noise--not the case for me.I don't understand the people complaining about making a mess on the floor. It's such a simple contraption. It's literally blowing air over water. That's it. I've moved the unit around pretty roughly and no water has sploshed out. You might get a few water drip while changing, but that's purely out of carelessness.
