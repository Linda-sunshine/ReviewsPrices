review/summary: Super Satisfied So Far!review/text: I got the Empire Red almost 3 months ago. It's gorgeous with intense and eye-catching color, very classy and high quality looking. It's solidly built, being heavier, wider, and more stable than my previous cheaper blender. I haven't had any problems with it rocking or moving around the counter. It's been super easy to take apart and clean, which was a blender chore before. The pitcher is shatter, scratch, and stain resistant, which I've had the opportunity to appreciate. I haven't had any issues with leaks like some other buyers have mentioned. The 5 speeds Stir, Chop, Mix, Puree, Liquefy and 2 modes Pulse, Crush Ice cover a variety of needs. So far I've used mine for milk shakes, smoothies with frozen fruit and/or crushed ice (my refrigerator crushes ice; I haven't tried full-size intact ice cubes in this), soups, and salsa. It comes with a pretty thorough instruction booklet that includes a speed control guide for commonly used ingredients, 2 pages of blender usage tips, and a few recipes. I'm in love with this blender right now and hope I will continue to be for many years to come.The author of this review received a free sample of the product.
