review/summary: the best, easiest, fastest cup of coffee you'll ever havereview/text: I have been using Bialetti for ever, I mean it this coffee maker has ben used in my family for generations (we are Italian) and I can say with almost 100% accuracy that every household in Italy has at least one of these.It is the simplest coffee maker to operate, it comes in three sturdy, easy to clean pieces. You 1) put the water in the bottom part, 2)insert the metal filter, 3) put the coffee in the metal filter, 4) screw the top on, and it is ready to put on your stove! It will take 3-4 minutes for the coffee to be ready. EASY, I repeat EASY and above all it really makes DELICIOUS coffee. To clean it, you simply unscrew the pieces, dump out the used coffee grind, and rinse (NO soap), just water, and it is ready to go again!TIPS: 1) For the first use, just brew water, this will ensure that all passages are clear and ready for your first cup of coffee. 2) When you clean it, make sure to rinse out coffee grind residue from the little rubber gasket that sits at the bottom of the top part of the coffee maker, this will help the coffee brew better and faster. The gasket usually lasts me a couple of years, and they are easily purchased from Amazon when you need new ones, they are quite inexpensive!I currently have 4 Bialettis, you newer know when you are going to need more coffee!
