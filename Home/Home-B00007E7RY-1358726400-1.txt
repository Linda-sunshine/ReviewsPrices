review/summary: Really moves the airreview/text: Reviews are correct, Awesome air purifier. Yes, the high speed is loud, and I use it only if I want to clean the air quickly while I am in another room/downstairs. Box says it will clean the air 5 times in one hour on high speed. That's pretty good, folks. But relax - running it on low speed is not unpleasant at all, certainly not too loud or annoying. Glad I bought it.
