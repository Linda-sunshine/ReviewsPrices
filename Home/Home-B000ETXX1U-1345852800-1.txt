review/summary: Very Comfortablereview/text: I have had this Insta-Bed for about nine months and I love it so much that I searched through my Amazon purchases, which are many, just to write a review. I have terrible back problems and have a Temperpedic Supreme Cloud mattress at home so sleeping on anything else is a scary thought. This Insta-Bed has put my mind at ease about the comfort of sleeping away from home. I take it everytime I travel and am visiting people because even if they have their own air mattress or bed for me to sleep on, many times it is just too uncomfortable. I LOVE, LOVE this air mattress and wanted to take the time to let people know. My husband and I have slept on it together and with our combined weight of almost 400 pounds it is still comfortable.
