review/summary: Works Greatreview/text: I have now made about a dozen loaves and it works great. I followed the advice of other reviewers and only used recipes from the Betty Crocker Bread Machine cookbook, not the one that came with it. I've done regular bread and pumpkin bread (quick bread version). The sides eventually come clean during the knead cycle with regular bread. With the quick bread, the recipe directions say to scrape the sides after 2 minutes and this must be done.
