review/summary: Nice but makes rather large cookiesreview/text: I couldn't decide between purchasing small or medium sized scoop and opted for the medium. I was so surprised how large the cookies came out. They were like Monster cookies, much much too large. The product itself is sturdy and nicely made and will work well for making meatballs or other items, but medium is not a good size for cookies, chose the small size. Still good quality and good price.
