review/summary: Good size compact unitreview/text: Works well, has 2 attachments. We use for at conventions/shows for the table cloths & banners. Put that and a bottle of water in together and ship it to location. We pull it out, plug it in and in a about a minute or two we are steaming with the best of them. There are bigger and better steamers, but for the price and 2-day prime this was and is perfect. Good solid top screw that is tight and clear fill level window to see how much water is in the tank.
