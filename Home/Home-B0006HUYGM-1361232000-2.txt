review/summary: A little workhorsereview/text: I bought this product because I have a German shepherd whose sleep place is my sofa. Even though I keep the sofa covered, his shedding would find its way to the sofa fabric. This vacuum works marvelously well, not perfect, but great. I would buy this product again.
