review/summary: have had it about 3 weeks and LOVE IT.review/text: my old coffee maker was just too big for me. i live alone and in a studio apartment so i truly only needed a small coffee maker...wanted a Keurig. i did. BUT after reading reviews and actually getting my hands on one of those PLASTIC $120 or more machine...i coudnt believe how cheap it was. people are dumb. it might be good but for that price...very least put some chrome on that thing...anyway....researched and this cute little ole maker caught my eye. read the reviews and instantly got it.ive used it every single day and actually quite often for more than coffee..read the reviews here and gotta say the people who had difficulty with this machine should not be allowed on or near a computer. stupid easy and the coffee is amazing. i havent had one single prob. if it lasts a year ill truly be happy....but this thing has allready paid for itsself.i have a kettle, a water boiler, and gotta say this thing meets my needs more than anything.came packaged great, works awesome, and its fast.totally recommend. excellent.UPDATE: just ordered another one as backup. love this machine. makes ramen and oatmeal like nobodys buisness. coffee is awesome and tea coudnt be simpler. best thing ive bought in forever.
