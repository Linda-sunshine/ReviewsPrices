review/summary: We love this pan!review/text: It's a big, sturdy, natural pan and we love it! It's a great alternative to non-stick pans that are coated in chemicals. Just wipe clean and heat the pan before using and the heating kills all the germs. Wipe with a little oil and it prevents it from rusting. GREAT pan that we will pass down to our kids.
