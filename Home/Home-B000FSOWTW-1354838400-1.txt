review/summary: Great wine bottle opener!review/text: Very easy/quck to use. Just press a button, and the automatc corkscrew winds into the cork, and then pulls it back out with no effort on our part. And the chilling bucket worked like a charm in keeping our whites cold! I would DEFINITELY recommend this product to friends and family!
