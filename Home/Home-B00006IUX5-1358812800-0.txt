review/summary: works below expectationsreview/text: Have only had the grinder for a few weeks and there is definitely some issues. First of all there is not a tight seal from the lid and the rest of the appliance, so when you pull the lid out it will always spill coffee grounds on your counter. Also, was using it the other day and it froze up mid-grind and quit grinding for a few seconds, definitely not a good sign. Im not sure if mine is just defective or the product as a whole is just low quality but I am not satisfied.
