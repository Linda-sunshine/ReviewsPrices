review/summary: It's a Home-Owner's Mustreview/text: Got carpets? Then you will need this SteamVac Carpet Cleaner. It's a great price compared to having strange professionals arrive at your home and take over cleaning the carpets while you sit huddled in a tiled or hardwood area. Anytime you need to deep clean a portion of your carpets to the entire house, this machine is easy to use and helpful. I absolutely am not good at following directions, but the instructions are not hard and the illustrations make it so that you will learn how to fill, empty, etc. in little time. I've had no leaks because I've followed the directions to latch in the containers when full. I suggest that when you are finished using it, you leave the parts so that it can air-dry (don't latch it up while still wet). Then, when dry place the parts together for storage. Also, the front guard panel can be removed by simply using a hand screw driver and taking it off. If you don't take it off and clean between the front panel and the machine, you will end up with trapped wet carpet fibers that like to mold. I take my machine apart, put the pieces outside, and spray them all down with a hose. Let the sun dry it out or place it in your garage, etc. on newspaper to air dry, and then store.
