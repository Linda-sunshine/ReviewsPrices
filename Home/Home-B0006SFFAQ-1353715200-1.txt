review/summary: Nice,simple coffeemakerreview/text: This is the third time I have purchased this model. They give out after about two years,and I am very conscientious about the required periodic de-scaling cleaning. Other than that,the machine works fine,and I do use it every day. My only complaint (other than the short life of the machine) is that it is impossible to see the water level reading tucked away inside the corner of the fill area. The only way to know how much water has been used is to make sure one reads the glass carafe markings. Decent flavor by the way.
