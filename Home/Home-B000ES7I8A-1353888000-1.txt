review/summary: Heats Water QUICKreview/text: I am a massage therapist. I put water in it before I go into session. I come out of the massage room, wash my hands, turn it on, and wait for my client to get dressed and come out. By the time they walk out of the room the water is hot and I have them a cup of hot tea!
