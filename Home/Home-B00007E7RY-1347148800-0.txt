review/summary: Great purifierreview/text: It works well. We live in a small apartment with downstairs neighbors that smoke and have cats. Our house often fills with second hand smoke and occasionally kitty litter smell. We let this run for about half an hour every evening and it does a great job of getting rid of the smells.It's a simple contraption, and seems to do the job well. We like the fact that it is a Pure HEPA purifier. Just be warned that this is not a silent purifier. You'll definitely know if it's running in the same room as you.
