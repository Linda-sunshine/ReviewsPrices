review/summary: great big waffles, nice small waffle ironreview/text: The waffles this turns out use almost twice as much batter as our old square waffle iron. They are very good, well cooked but not crispy/brittle. The iron itself seems small and sleek. So far it seems easy to keep clean and works perfectly (just about a month of steady use).
