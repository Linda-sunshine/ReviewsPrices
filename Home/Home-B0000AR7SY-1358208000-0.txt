review/summary: Gets a lot of usereview/text: After a few years of use, there's a crack in the lid of mine, but it still grinds coffee quite well. If you get one, you might want to invest in a makeup brush to help clean out the coffee grounds that can accumulate in the unit without having to get it wet.
