review/summary: EASE OF CLEANreview/text: My husband purchased a Bissel carpet cleaner to replace my 5 year old Hoover scrubber. I tried it, and complained about it every time I used it. I finally bought my self another Hoover and again found it easy to use. The Hoover shampoo tank is easy to fill(nice wide opening), does not turn upside down as it attaches to the machine, dirty tank quickly unhooks and can be easily rinsed out - all reasons I've found in preferring this home scrubber over the Bissel. My previous Hoover gave up the ghost after 5 years of not only cleaning my 6 room carpeted main home, but a 3 bedroom rental property, a 7 room carpeted 2nd home, and an occasional loan out to my 2 daughters. In its 5 years it did a lot of great cleaning!!!
