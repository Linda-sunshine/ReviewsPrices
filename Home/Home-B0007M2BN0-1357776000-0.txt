review/summary: Love it!review/text: I love this! I have a 1300 watt microwave oven. To hard boil 4 large eggs, I set it for 6 minutes and 30 seconds; I think there may be enough 'play' in this that I could do 7 minutes, especially if I use extra large/jumbo eggs rather than large eggs.After I started the microwave, I was called out of the room and forgot about them for about half an hour. I was concerned the eggs would be hard to peel since I didn't immerse them into cold water immediately after cooking. Well, it didn't matter. They were PERFECT and peeled like a dream. I repeated this with the same wonderful results.This is a wonderful energy and time saver! And the price is good value, in my opinion. I have only had it for a few days, so I can't comment on long term use, but may soon have a chance to report on heavy use in a short amount of time. Easter will be easier this year!
