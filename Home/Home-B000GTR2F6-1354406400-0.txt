review/summary: Dont waist your time or $$review/text: My in-laws got me this machine as a new house warming gift. I was so excited!! Then it only worked for 3 days. They took it back to costco and ordered me another one (same maching) here on Amazon. Got the Keurig B70 Platinum Brewing System on Friday, and today is Sunday and it will not brew a cup. It is like the water is not getting pushed threw to the 'down spout'. Same problem as the last machine that only lasted 3 days as well. I totally thought i had to be a fluke! But i will not be getting the same machine for a 3rd time. Sad, without coffee!!!
