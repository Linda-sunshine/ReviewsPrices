review/summary: The Best customer servicereview/text: Let me start by saying I haven't had the best luck with my Keurig Coffee Maker. When I first received it the hinge on the lid to the water reservoir was broken. Within two months of having it the system refused to Prime w/o having to constantly take the reservoir on and off. So you may ask why I give it 5 stars... Well each time I had an issue I called customer service and didn't received a run-a-round phone call or extensive "trouble shooting" hoops to jump through. Each time it was a simple "I'm sorry, let me send you out the replacement to fix the issue". No shipping was charged and I received the new items in about 1 week after the call.I've been very happy with the convenience of the unit and I think I end up saving money since I make one cup at a time instead of whole pots which sometimes get wasted depending on my coffee mood for that day.
