review/summary: Not for Root Vegetablesreview/text: I am extremely disappointed in this product and if I didn't throw out the box, I would return it. For years I have been using a Rosle slicer (that has NEVER been sharpened but works on all vegetables even after all these years). However the Rosle slicer only slices. I wanted this specifically to julienne raw carrots, raw beets and to make french fries. The root vegetable would get stuck about half way through slicing. To the point that I had to take a chefs knife to remove the vegetable without trying to hurt myself. I tried this with both blades. Since I don't need a slicer, I cannot comment on the slicer (though I was surprised that there is no adjustable knob for thickness).
