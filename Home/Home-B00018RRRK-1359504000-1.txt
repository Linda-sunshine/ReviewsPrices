review/summary: Grinds beans to perfectionreview/text: I really love this burr grinder. We started grinding our beans instead of buying pre-ground a few years ago and have never looked back. Makes such a difference in your coffee. This one does a great job of getting the beans ground evenly and is a great value for the money. One problem we had was that the numbers started to wear off fairly quickly -- we're probably just going to paint new ones on with a fine brush, but it is kind of annoying.
