review/summary: Not dependable at allreview/text: i have had this product for 6m now and for a $100 i expect much more. it leaks, very loud and the bottom screw connected to the blade always needs to be tightener. it's sad bc i wish i would of returned it when one problem started happening but i thought kitchaid has a good name and didn't dare to think anything else would happen.so def i do not recommended this products.
