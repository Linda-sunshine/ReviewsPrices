review/summary: travel-size!review/text: Very nice electric kettle at a great price. At 1 liter, it is smaller than most kettles, making it more 'portable.' (I am a tea drinker. I don't like using the hotel room coffeemaker for tea so I bring my own kettle.)It has a power cord which detaches from the kettle. It doesn't have a base plate.
