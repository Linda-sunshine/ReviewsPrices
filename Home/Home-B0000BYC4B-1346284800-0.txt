review/summary: handy for carrying anything around in mason jars.review/text: I use these to transport iced coffee every day. I use a 1 QT jar, fill it with cubes and brew my coffee over them, then I stuff a straw inside and cap it with these. Some reviewers have said they're not liquid-tight-sealed but I've shaken the jar around with sugar to mix it, and it doesn't drip for the most part. I probably wouldn't trust it lying on its side in a bag, but it keeps most of the liquid sealed in :)
