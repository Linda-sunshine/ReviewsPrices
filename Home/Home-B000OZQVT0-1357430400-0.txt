review/summary: Great Atmospherereview/text: I have used this product for so long I can't remember when I started. I have three ventless fireplaces in which I burn this fuel, one is a beautiful mahogany fireplace with hand carved ornamentation. I have found that if I burn aPaine's incense cone along with the Real Flame fuel, I not only have the warmth and beauty of a fire that actually crackles but the smell of red cedar, balsam fir, or pinon pine to create a truely great atmosphere any time I want.One of my fireplaces is in my bedroom, and I love to lay in my bed at night and read while I have a fire going. To me the cost is worth every penny for all the joy it brings to me, my family and friends. I have also found that this brand is better to my liking than any other, so I use Real Flame exclusively.Since my home does not have wood-burning fireplaces, this is the best possible substitute, and unlike an electric fireplace, actually has a real flame. I highly recommend Real Flame gel fuel.
