review/summary: Fast Fun Delicious Coffeereview/text: It's very fast and easy to make a cup of coffee with this thing. It takes 5 seconds to clean and put away. The coffee is very clean tasting. The coffee tastes very smooth and not bitter. You're going to need to use good quality water with this because the taste of burnt bitter coffee will not be covering up your bad water.I only with that I could drink coffee all day and all night long, because the coffee this thing produces tastes so good. But I am rather caffieeeeene sensitive and can only handle a cup in the first half of the day.Look up the Inverted method of making the coffee using the aeropress.Pros:Great tasting CoffeeYou can make coffee in less than a minute.Very easy to cleanFun to useCustomize your brew by adjusting steep time and water temperature, water to grounds ratios.Makes an extra strong coffee concentrate that can be topped off with more hot water, drank straight like espresso, topped off with milk, poured over ice.Cons:You need to make your own hot water. (microwave, electric kettle, or stovetop)Not great if you need more than 2 cups at a time. (it's a single serve system)
