review/summary: Nice to Be Prepared!review/text: This is a must have for everyone. It will let you set county specific alerts so it does not sound false alarms. You can also turn certain alarms off if your not worried about certain disasters in your area. Also lets you turn off the alarm for watches. Highly recommended. Allows you to listen to the weather channel broadcast and am/fm radio for news during the storm. Plugs into 120ac and battery backup. Keep extra batteries on hand.
