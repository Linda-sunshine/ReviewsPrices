review/summary: Just Like Grandmareview/text: I've recently started cooking with cast iron with a kitchen remodel to inspire me. I remember my grandmother always used cast iron, and her cooking was amazing. After just a few dishes in my new dutch oven, I realize why. Things brown so evenly and so easily. Clean up is next to nothing. I made the best pot roast I've ever made with this dutch oven. I highly recommend it.
