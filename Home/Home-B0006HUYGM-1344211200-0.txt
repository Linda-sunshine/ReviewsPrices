review/summary: Love itreview/text: Was looking to pick this up almost two years ago, but the wife preferred a cordless model. That cheap junk lasted almost 1.5 years before the battery no longer held a charge. After seeing the Eureka was still available, she agreed to try it and now loves it. Great power, flexible, and easy to maintain.Terrific product - highly recommend.
