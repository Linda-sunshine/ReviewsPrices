review/summary: JUST GET A TRIGGER SPRAY BOTTLE AT the 99c STOREreview/text: JUST BUY A SQUEEZE TRIGGER BOTTLE FROM THE DOLLAR STORE. 10x less expensive, easy to unclog, don't have to pump, don't have to hassle with depressurizing or learning alchemy and trade secrets to prevent/unclog clogs.I've had about 3 Misto's of different size and make and they all seem to work great for maybe 6 months before refusing to spray anything other that water/alcohol/vinegar.I've tried all the tricks of the trade to fix them when it happens but they never seem to work for me. My last one I depressurized the canister after every use after turning the bottle upside down and spraying the remaining oil out of the pump. Didn't work as now I'm stuck with another useless oil mister I spent $10 (or more) for.Washing it in whatever solution doesn't get them to spray oil again. The first one I used olive oil in, so when someone told me to use a thinner oil, I went with plain vegetable oil, but it still happened. I've tried cleaning it with hot water, vinegar, soap detergent, alcohol --you name it, I tried it.After over 2 years of going through these things, I'm tired of wasting the money on them. My suggestion is to JUST BUY A SQUEEZE TRIGGER BOTTLE FROM THE DOLLAR STORE with a mist option. You have to squeeze a trigger every time, but it's no worse than having to PUMP THE STUPID BOTTLE all the time and spending ten friggin bucks only to die when you bought it to cut back on the cost and waste of buying PAM and whatnot.
