review/summary: Good Sleepingreview/text: I was looking for a replacement for our worn out, shredding, mattress pad when I came across this one. I read a ton of the reviews and decided to buy it for us. It works well and doesn't make us sweat uncontrollably like some of the rubber back ones do. I haven't washed it yet but when I do I will post again. Overall an excellent purchase and works just like it was meant to.
