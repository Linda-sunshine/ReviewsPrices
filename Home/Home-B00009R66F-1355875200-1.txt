review/summary: Hoover StamVac Carpet Cleanerreview/text: Had a similar product, the Bissell. They are the same size and pretty much the same product. Was tired of having to take apart the Bissell because the little plastic hose kept clogging. The Hoover has worked well and cleaned the carpet. You have to go over dirty spots in more than one cleaning or scrub them out first. A commercial machine might work better, but they are also a hassle and don't leave the carpet as dry as this machine. I was surprised that even going over and over traffic areas it dried so fast due to good water suction. Because it is easy to use, if I see a traffic area needing attention, I don't leave it until a major shampoo is needed. I get out the Hoover, go over the area before going to bed, and in the morning it is clean and dry. No longer is it a major weekend project to clean the carpet.
