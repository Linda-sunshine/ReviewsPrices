review/summary: Not like the other Adorable units...review/text: So I have had the pig in my daughter's room for nearly 2 years, running most of the winter and when she's been sick...no complaints. I clean it with vinegar, soap and water. It's elevated as it states it should be, but on plastic so there's no warping of wood. I don't have a &#34;hygrometer&#34; or whatever, but I can tell a difference in her room vs the rest of our condo. So, when my sinuses started to go haywire, I ordered the penguin for my bedroom. NOWHERE in the description did it say the penguin needed DAILY emptying/refilling, only on the instructions inside the box. Who has time for that when you're a stay-at-home mom? But i decided to give it a shot anyway. And like the pig, I elevated the penguin on plastic. Good thing, cuz this sucker LEAKS like nobody's business. The only positive is that I noticed a difference in the moisture level in my room...no more bloody mucus (eew). I am returning for the owl.I researched about all these silly small room humidifiers, none are perfect. But I'd rather pay 40 bucks for something that I don't need filters for, that I don't need to clean every day, and that I only use in the dead of winter or while sick, than spend 200 for a fancy machine that will sit in the closet. My condo has a humidifier as part of our heating/cooling system, these Adorable humidifiers just provide a little extra.
