review/summary: Worth the wait!review/text: Well after some waiting I finally got this yesterday, and put it quickly to the test!, bought it originally to do zucchini spaghetti, didn't had any so i quickly peal two potatoes and did some spiral potatoes, well let me tell you this little machine is tough and sharp! you'll cut a finger! if you are that dumb! because its almost dumb proof, it even has a handle and everything so you don't touch the blades, so no problem there, I ordered mine used, it already came built so i just started doing the spirals, its so easy to use even a 5 year can use it (do not let you five year use it), did the spirals in 5 minutes, cooked them in 10, eat them in 5 its that easy, i rinsed it and towel dried it, put it back in the box for temporarily storage.No complaints here! The plastic does feel flimsy, but not as flimsy as other reviews, I'm a big man with big hands, and nothing happens, unless you are a giant who doesn't know how to measure their own strength, don't worry, IT WILL HOLD UP TO THE TASK AT HAND, it will also hold up if you are not and inmate in prison trying to peel millions of onions for everyone!Would definitely recommended and even buy it as a present !
