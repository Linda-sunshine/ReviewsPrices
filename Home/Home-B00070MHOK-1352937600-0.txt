review/summary: Decent Steamerreview/text: I read the reviews and head this was a good product. After receiving the steamer, I quickly put it to the test, as I had a few wrinkled items I needed to steam. The steamer did work quickly, however, it was not that great at getting the wrinkles out. So it a decent product, but it's better for a quick steam rather than a really wrinkled item.
