review/summary: Not the "old" pyrex qualityreview/text: Less than six months after buying the 1C measuring cup, ALL of the red measuring guides were gone. They just slowly kept getting lighter and lighter until they couldn't be read any longer. Furthermore, if you want accuracy, forget this. As another reviewer stated, it's more like 7/8ths than 1C. Terrible quality.
