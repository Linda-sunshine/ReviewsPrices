review/summary: Clock runs fastreview/text: I have owned this clock that I purchased from Amazon for 14 months now, and from the beginning the clock time has run fast, and the clock will not let me re-set the time, since the clock is self-setting, so it is supposed to arrive reading the correct time, which it did within one minute. By now the time on this clock reads 12 minutes faster than the actual time, and it keeps getting further ahead the longer I own it. There are buttons on the top of the clock where it says "clock" with two buttons next to it marked "+" and "-", appearing as if the time is adjustable, but the buttons are inoperable; they do nothing when pressed. If I need to set the alarm, I must take the time difference into account. I have never before seen an electric clock not keep correct time. This clock is definitely a loser on that account! The unit works otherwise, except for keeping correct time.
