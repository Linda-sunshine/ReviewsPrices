review/summary: Divine comfort!review/text: These are the softest, coziest sheets I have ever owned. I have had these for approximatly 3 months now and they are still very plush and soft to the touch. I do not have any problem with washing and drying, just use cold water and permapress drying cycle they come out of the dryer with almost no wrinkles. There is absoloutly no piling and moderate to small amount of lint in the dryer. These sheets are better than any flannel I have ever purchased and will only buy these. I did get them on sale so that was a bonus as well. I wish that they came in Twin as I would love to get a pair for my mom but alas they do not and I am not sure about the other ones with this name. When I did my research the &#34;Velvet Flannel Pinzon&#34; was rated in the top 5 best sheets. Would highly recommend these sheets and would by from Amazon.
