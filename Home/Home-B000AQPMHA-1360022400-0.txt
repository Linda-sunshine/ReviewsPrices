review/summary: The coffee you brew is only as strong as the K-Cup varietyreview/text: These machines are wonderful! Yes, the K-Cups are not cheap, but if you compare it to the fact that a lot of coffee gets dumped into the sink when breakfast is finished, they are actually a great value. My wife and I enjoy a cup each in the morning, and she takes an additional cup in a thermal mug for her trip to work. We like a full-bodied cup of coffee, and even the so called strong blends are weak to us. Starbucks is the way to go. Buy it by the case at BJ's or Costco and stop whining! And read the instructions: from time to time, you will have to run some white vinegar through it, depending on the mineral content of your water. We use the filtered water from the 'fridge dispenser and are very happy with the result.How anyone drinks that Mr. Coffee or similar swill is beyond me. This machine brews a REAL CUP OF JOE!
