review/summary: It oh so subtly but persistently leaksreview/text: I have had the Thermos Nissan 16-ounce stainless backpack bottle for three months now.Pros: keeps my coffee warm; does not alter the taste of the coffee; is attractive; sipping mechanism works nicely; the one-piece flip-up lid is well designed for drinking and is more convenient than the traditional two piece with the cup.Cons: it leaks! (into bag, onto carpet, down my arm, on my clothes); after drinking without any noticeable leakage, liquid secretly escapes and drips down the side and forms a ring on the bottom; does not keep coffee as warm as my other Thermos Nissan 16-Ounce Stainless-Steel Insulated Bottle.Honestly I don't know why I have kept this so long with all the leaks!Maybe because I found ways to reduce the leaking, such as if I filled it well below the full line, but even then it leaked a small amount onto my friend's carpet - I see that stain every time I visit him.I also thought if I screwed the lid on first and then closed the top it did not leak, which helps, but then it was put on it's side and leaked in the tote bag all over the groceries. What kind of a back pack bottle is this?I think I just can't bare the waste of throwing it away.
