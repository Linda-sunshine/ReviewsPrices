review/summary: I turn it on and the kernels fling out...review/text: It does a good job, but I have to hold the thing tilted back the whole time or the kernels just fling right out into the bowl the second I turn it on before they get the chance to pop. Aside from that, it does the job. I'm just using regular yellow kernels that worked fine with my old air popper before it broke.
