review/summary: Nice inexpensive alternativereview/text: So it costs about $5 for a aerosol can at many stores. For me these last about 3-4 months. Not sure how long this guy last quite yet. But i know it's not the same. I obviously dont get 1oz of oil in a aerosol can.It does however need to be pumped often. Which is easy and does not require you to open up the bottle or anything. Very simple. I use less oil then if I were to just pour a little in the pan. I like the item. I bought one for myself and one for my best friend. I paid $9.50 on Sept 12, 2012
