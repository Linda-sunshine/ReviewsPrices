review/summary: Can't live without a mini steamer - this is a good one!review/text: I am surprised by how many people don't own a steamer or aren't even aware something like this is available for purchase. This is a must-have if you wear a lot of dry-clean only clothes but like to extend the wear of your clothing between cleanings. I even use this steamer to steam my curtains and bedding. It's small enough to throw in my overnight bag or travel with. Be careful, the water gets very hot and will &#34;bubble out&#34;/spill hot water on you or your garment if you overfill. TIP - don't fill it all the way up to the &#34;max&#34; line. That's too full. Fill it an inch below that line to avoid water coming out. Love this thing!
