review/summary: Makes great wafflesreview/text: My wife and I love well cooked waffles made from scratch. Simply put they are perfect!!! We have a large waffle iron from our wedding gifts 49 years ago, which is heavy and makes very large waffles. This one has just the right size, so we split the waffle while a second one is cooking, which we then split as well. Thus they are always warm and yummy.
