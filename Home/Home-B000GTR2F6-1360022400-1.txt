review/summary: Good taste but...review/text: First of all, make sure you get the Platinum PLUS machine. It doesn't cost much more, and it has a rinse button. This ad seems to be for the plain Platinum machine but I don't see Plus on Amazon anywhere so something is weird.The coffee that comes out of this machine tastes really good, but I hate the machine itself. It is so SLOW. I'd rather just drive to Dunkin Donuts. The water trickles out in a slow drip, which causes maximal splash-back all over the machine. Even when I just want hot water it droooools out so slow. And the controls are hard to remember, I'm always press press pressing to try to get the right size cup of water. I wish I got a different model, maybe not the Keurig brand, but still using the K-Cups.
