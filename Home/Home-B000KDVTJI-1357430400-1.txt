review/summary: Unacceptablereview/text: We purchased this water kettle to replace an old plastic version that had stopped shutting off when the water boiled. Like so many others, I wanted to get away from plastic for something we use so often to heat water. Initially it appeared well built and heated water quickly with no impact on the taste of the water. Everything was great. Well, 8 months in, the kettle stopped turning off when the water boiled. Unacceptable. That is the reason for 1 star. There were other minor points of concern. The joint between the plastic base and the metal had started to corrode. I can't say if it would fail but it looked bad. Finally, the highly polished finish shows every mark or smudge. sadly, in less than a year, i purchased another kettle.
