review/summary: Disappointed.review/text: Very noisy and the vibrations make it necessary to hold the cups in place. It has been 3 weeks and still can't produce any crema on the surface even when using the recommended Lavazza eze pods. I changed many different brands and still not crema. The frother works much better than expected at this price.
