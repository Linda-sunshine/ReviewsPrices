review/summary: Great, of coursereview/text: as always, Lodge is a great iron skillet product, love to use this for tortillas. I never use soap for washing, just water, ensure its dry and a light coat of oil, if I have a stubborn something sticking, I soak a little, rinse, then wash with a salt paste scrub, rinse, dry, light coat of oil, no rust, follow the instructions and you will never get rust.
