review/summary: The hose needs improvementreview/text: This vacumn has good suction. The problems are that the hose is too short, it comes off while you are using it, it is cumbersome and stiff. You have to work it out of the suction hole to use the hose. So far, I think the vacumn is worth it's money, but Hoover needs to work on the hose. Some simple adjustments would make it a much better machine.
