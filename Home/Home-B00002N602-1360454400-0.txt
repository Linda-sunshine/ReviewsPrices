review/summary: A GREAT pressure cooker - only one complaint.review/text: This is a really excellent item....but the little rubber safety button (to release pressure if something gets clogged) isn't as good as it could be. Every now and then, it releases the steam so no pressure can build up. If I jiggle it, to get it to set, it generally falls down into the kettle. At that point, I have to remove the lid, and fish the button out of whatever is in there -- easy if it's broccoli, but more of a problem if it's bean soup. I realize that this is my fault for not checking it each time, but with my old one (not nearly as good, overall) I never had to think about it. Remember, this is a GREAT pressure cooker -- I'm just kvetching.
