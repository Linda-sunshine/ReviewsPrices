review/summary: Works like a charmreview/text: Bought this a couple of months ago to help on those nights when my son is sick. So far after several months I haven't had any problems with the unit. Its great that they have so many different choices of animal designs to compliment your child's room. Probably the only quirk with this unit that I can find is that there is a handle on the top of the water tank but it says not to carry the water tank with the handle when the tank is full. So what is the point of having the handle on the tank?
