review/summary: Wonderful productreview/text: I purchased this Dehydrator primarily to make healthy dog treats...couldn't be any happier! Previous comments were made that the dryer element was nosy..Mine has just a faint fan sound and I have left it in my kitchen while using and forgot that it is even on.Definitely recommend.Can hardly wait to &#34;experiment&#34; with it.
