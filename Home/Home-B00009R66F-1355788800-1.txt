review/summary: Great Value for the Price!review/text: I was looking for a carpet cleaner and had originally decided on a different Hoover product, but when this one showed up as a Lightning Deal, I decided to get it because it was half the price of the one I originally picked plus the added bonus on not having to go out on Black Friday to get the other one.Pros-Easy Setup and Clean Up. The tanks come off easy and there are no small crevices and corners in the dirty water tank for dirt to get stuck in. Dirty water tank only took a few rinses to get clean.Excellent suction- I cleaned a hallway and a 20X20 room and by the time a finished, the first half of the carpet I cleaned was already dry. It is also nice that you have full vision of the dirty tank when cleaning and can tell when you are no longer sucking up water from a section of carpetCarpets were clean and all stains were gone. I have a toddler running around and all the messes that come with him so our carpet gets abused.Easily Maneuverable. The machine is narrow and at first I thought it meant it would take longer to clean the carpets. However, the cleaner changes path easily like a vacuum cleaner and is excellent in tight spaces and under furniture.Tanks hold a lot. I was able to clean around 450 sq ft of space with one tank. I had previously used rented machines to clean carpets and remember filling the tank 2-3 times for the same amount of space.Cons-Really, I can only think of one. The cord is short. When cleaning a 20X20 room, I had to move the plug in to finish the room. I will probably pick up an extension cord to use the next time.Overall, this is an excellent machine for the price I paid. Would have given it 5 stars, but the short cord annoys me since I have an open floor plan.
