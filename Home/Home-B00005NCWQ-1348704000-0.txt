review/summary: coffee is on!review/text: The Farberware Yosemite percolator makes enjoying a cup of coffee quick and easy! The coffee itself isn't ready for a few minutes but the aroma of the perking coffee is nothing short of wonderful. It is a nice way to start MN. mornings. The percolator is easy to clean, and is retro cool enough to sit on the stove when not in use!
