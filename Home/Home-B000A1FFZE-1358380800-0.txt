review/summary: Compact, but BURNS every time!review/text: We bought this toaster oven a few weeks ago. It is compact and quality, but the toast burns every time we use it. Even if I have the dial set to the lowest toaster setting, I find myself needing to manually cancel the toasting because the bread is so dark. We have gone through a lot of burnt toast the past couple weeks!
