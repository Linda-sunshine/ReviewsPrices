review/summary: Great Iron!review/text: I purchased this iron to replace a rowenta. I was tired of the constant problems with items melting on the sole plate and water leakage. I have been so impressed by this little B&D model. It is quick to warm up, has a digital read screen and does a great job. I would recommend this iron to everyone. One design feature is that I wish the steam buttons were reversed. It is a little awkward to push the buttons but other than that it really is great. I spent a couple hundred dollars on my last 2 rowentas, what a waste of money...I could have easily purchased several of these irons for the half the cost!
