review/summary: Excellent Skilletreview/text: As I have been switching over to all cast iron cookware, I have purchased products from several manufacturers. Lodge is simply the best I have found.The skillet is smooth and well balanced. This time I used the pan with only a simple cleaning. I usually just go ahead and re-season them anyway. Turns out, Lodge truly is ready for use. I had no trouble with sticking and it cleaned up quick and easy. (Then I seasoned it again anyway. I just can't help myself! lol!)Well made and ready for use. What more do you want? Well, I, for one, wish they made more different styles so I could stick to their product line alone.The Lodge stuff costs a bit more, but it is worth it.
