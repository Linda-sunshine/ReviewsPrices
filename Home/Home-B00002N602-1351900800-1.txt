review/summary: Replaced a 30+ year old Prestoreview/text: Works like a champ. The old one's stem had worn, and the matching jiggle weight on top as well, so it didn't maintain as much pressure it should. I think we got our money's worth out of he old one, and the new one looks better. We could have fixed the old one, but by the time we replaced the old seals and pressure regulator we could just buy a new one. We passed the old one down to my son in case he wants to fool with it.
