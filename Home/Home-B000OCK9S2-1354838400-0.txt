review/summary: Helps My Little Girl Sleepreview/text: This is the ONLY sound machine I have found with normal-sounding white noise. It has a variety of sound options, but I have used the white noise to help my daughter sleep since she was around 4 months old. It's great for apartment living, keeps the sounds of neighbors and people outside from waking her up. The only thing I don't like is that it's very easy to set the alarm by accident, so sometimes it goes off in the middle of the day/night and confuses me. The volume is adjustable, which is a step up over a lot of sound machines.
