review/summary: Great deep cleanerreview/text: I've been using a hand-me-down Bissel steamvac for a few years in our home, and it's done a decent job for us. However, dry time was at least 6-8 hours, and it never quite seemed to 'really' get the carpets clean.I picked this up because I was attracted to the separate tanks (one clean, one dirty), the hand tools, and the price. And the reviews!The two tanks are great. I love that there isn't a bladder in this machine. That being said, I have also run into the problem other reviewers have posted, where the dirty tank gets full faster than the clean one empties. It's usually a matter of a few square feet of carpeting (5 minutes or so?) between the dirty tank filling and the clean tank needing a refill. It's not a deal breaker for me and even though I'll use the cleaner a lot compared to some (at least once every 2 months, with some spot cleaning as needed in between), I still think it's only a minor flaw.The hand tools (stair tool in particular) work well. However, it was a bit tricky to get the clean solution to flow to the tool the first time I used it. After removing and replacing the dirty tank, removing and replacing the clean solution connector, and placing my hand over the mouth of the stair tool (priming the pump) a couple of times, I finally got it working. I'm not sure if I just didn't plug the clean solution tube in enough or not, but I got it working and my stairs look great.It is a bit heavy, however, not as heavy as my old Bissel machine. The length of the power cord is long enough for the rooms that I clean (standard living room and stairs). I am happy with my purchase and look forward to quite a few years of use of this machine.
