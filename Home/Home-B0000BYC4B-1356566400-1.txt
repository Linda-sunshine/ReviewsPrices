review/summary: glass is betterreview/text: Glass is so much better for our health than plastic (not to mention better looking), so I use mason jars for storage of refrigerated leftovers as well as pantry snacks. I find these lids easier to screw onto a jar than the metal lid and ring type. Not for use with canning.
