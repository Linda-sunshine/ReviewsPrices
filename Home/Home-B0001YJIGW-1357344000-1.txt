review/summary: Better Bath Deep Water Bath DOES MAKE MY BATH BETTERreview/text: I love the Better Bath Deep Water Bath. I have a very deep tub but the overflow drain is placed lower then I would prefer, not allowing the tub to fill to the level I prefer. There are some lower star ratings for this product stating that the suction cups do no hold or slip. I have not had this problem at all and actually have left it in my tub over the overflow drain since I got it and it has not fallen at all.Great product to solve a simple problem. Works great!!
