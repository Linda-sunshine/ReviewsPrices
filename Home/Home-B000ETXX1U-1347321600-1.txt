review/summary: not as comfortable as it looksreview/text: The bed was very comfortable. Loved the height of the bed and how easy it was to inflate and deflate. But when 2 adults would sleep on it we would tend to roll to the middle of the bed making it somewhat uncomfortable. Tried to inflate it more and deflate it on different occasions and still would roll to the middle of the bed. We ended up returning it. The bed we ordered was a queen bed. A single or double might not have that problem. Maybe it was just the one that we ended up with that had the problem but wasn't willing to try another one.
