review/summary: Best Hand-held vacuum I've ever hadreview/text: I have been looking for a hand-held vacuum for several years. I needed to replace my old one which was in the process of dying. I wanted an electric not a battery-operated hand-held so I could get maximum power. This one is terrific. The beater-bar head is built in and a hose for tight corners is attached, so need to change parts out. Now, if it lasts for years it will be absolutely perfect. (I've only had it for about a month.) Great price, too.
