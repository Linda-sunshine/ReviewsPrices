review/summary: not quiet at all - even on the slowest speedreview/text: After reading all of the posted reviews on this product, I decided to give this unit a try. My husband was looking for a smaller unit that he could take to his office at his work. However, once he set it up and turned it on, he got several complaints right away about the noise. His office is approximately 8 feet X 10 feet. He brought it home and I tried it in our home office that is about 10 feet X 12 feet. I also thought that the purifier was too noisy. Finally we decided to try it in a bigger room that was 17 feet X 34 feet and it was still too noisy. So that was three strikes and we returned the unit. This was all at the slowest speed. There was no reason for us to try the medium and highest speeds. We tried to get it to work in 3 different rooms, but when its gotta go, its gotta go. We have other purifiers that are much, much, much quieter even at their higher speeds. So back to the drawing board we go. On the plus side, it is really nice sized unit.
