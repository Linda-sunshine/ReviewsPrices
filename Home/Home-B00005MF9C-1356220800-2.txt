review/summary: Great for tea tooreview/text: I'm a tea drinker because I absolutely cannot stand coffee. It is hard to find a single cup tea brewer so I decided to try this instead of paying much more for the automatic tea brewers--I've used regular coffee makers for this purpose also.As a tea drinker, but not a highly discriminating one in terms of brewing tea, this works wonderfully for a cup of tea on the go or if I want to cozy up on the couch and read.The brewing basket fits a teabag and also fits loose tea. You do have to be careful with loose tea as sometimes bits of it floats into your cup. I have some fine mesh cloth that I make little pouches out of for the tea and then generally tie it shut with a string or even a paperclip. You need to experiment a bit to see how much loose tea or how many bags you need to make the tea to your liking. It is a quick and easy way to make a cuppa to run out the door with. When I am not in a hurry I do the warm the teapot bit, boiling water on the stove, loose tea etc. But in the morning I'm often not up to brewing a proper cuppa tea!Also, I never let anyone else in the family sully my personal tea brewers like this with coffee! I can taste the coffee residue and absolutely cannot stand it!!!
