review/summary: Pulling Corks Without Strain or Pain.review/text: The Oster electric bottle opener I bought at Amazon.com works exactly as advertised. The combination of the attached foil cutter, and a fully charged battery, makes quick cork removal effortless and you don't wind up with shredded cork in the bottle. There's no need for a battery recharge unless your party lasts more than a week. And if that's the case, perhaps you should buy two. It also makes a great Xmas gift for your party-hearty friends.
