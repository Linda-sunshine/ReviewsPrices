review/summary: love itreview/text: I use my espresso maker every single day and I just love it. You have to keep an eye on it and catch the coffee right after it's made so that it doesn't start boiling and get ruined, but that's easy to do (and after a few times, you'll actually HEAR a change in the steam and know when to take it off the burner).
