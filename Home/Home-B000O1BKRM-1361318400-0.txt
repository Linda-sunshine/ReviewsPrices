review/summary: well, it works...review/text: So yes, it makes ice cubes. Real cubes, mind you, not those silly rounded things. No, no, these have four proper sides and sharp corners.Truth be told, you will impress your friends even if you're not a professional mixologist, provided you use these. Your average interesting cocktail has the chance to be elevated to something perhaps more with these cubes, so use this power wisely.The downside to these trays is that getting the cubes out can be a bit of a pain. Those with weak fingers or hands need not apply. But, since you're probably making your living as some swanky NYC mixologist, no doubt your hands have become burly with all that muddling you've been doing.
