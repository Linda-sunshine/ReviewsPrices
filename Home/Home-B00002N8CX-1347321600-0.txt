review/summary: great for the pricereview/text: I got this great little vacuum for my tile floors at our lake cabin. It meets all my needs. The power is great to pick up the sand, food, dog hair etc. from our family each and every day ! The rotating head is great to get into the odd shaped areas. The power cord is long enough so I don't have to be messing with the cord. It isn't good for the carpet but I didn't get it for that ( except maybe the stairs which is great because of it's light weight ).This is well worth it's price. Order extra bags tho......some people said they found them at WalMart, but I didn't.
