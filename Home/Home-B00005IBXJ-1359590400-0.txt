review/summary: Changed my life.review/text: The pizzazz is THE way to cook a frozen pizza. Takes all the guess work out of it. No more opening the oven every 2 minutes to check on it. With the pizzazz you can even check the crispiness of the crust. Want it crispier? Just turn off the top heating element and use only the bottom for a couple extra minutes before serving. OMG I love the pizzazz! Great gift for the single man, college kids, or anyone!
