review/summary: Very Nice Reliable Ironreview/text: WOOOOW!! 1,550 reviews, that is amazing just for an iron. I have had this iron for a couple of years now and wanted to post a review just for fun. I have liked it alot, is still working just fine without any problems. Steam still works great and nothing has broken off it. I recommend it to anybody, it is not too heavy nor too light, very well balanced in weight and if this one dies on me i would definitely buy the same one again.
