review/summary: Excellent cookware - heats quicklyreview/text: I did a lot of research because I was seriously considering purchasing that more expensive well-known A**clad brand and found many reviews here stating that this set was comparable to that set. I'm very happy that I went with this set. Lighter on the pocketbook and I couldn't be more pleased. These are great quality pans, not too heavy but definitely not lightweights, and they heat up quickly (don't forget to heat your pans and do the water droplet test to make sure it's hot enough for your oil, then add your oil and let that heat up a bit before adding food. Never any problems with food sticking if you do this). I used these for the first time on Thanksgiving and it was great! I'll definitely be purchasing the 12 inch skillet and the casserole pan with lid to complete my set.
