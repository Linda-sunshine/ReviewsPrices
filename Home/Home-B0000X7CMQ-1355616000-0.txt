review/summary: Mornings are back on track!review/text: Read a bunch of reviews on different coffee makers with a thermal pot and I thought this one was the one to give a whirl. I am not disappointed in the least.Coffee is hot and perfectly tasty every morning! So what you can't use the carafe to feed the water into the hopper. I haven't used a carafe to dump water in any coffee maker I've had in the last decade. Kinda glad my hand doesn't fit on the inside of the carafe for cleaning as it will only tempt me to use a scrubby. Its a little loud at the end of the brewing cycle making burping/gurgle noises, but that's what you get when you're sleeping next to the kitchen.
