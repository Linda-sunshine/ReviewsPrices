review/summary: Consistant Results. Easy to clean / no stickreview/text: Combined with glass lid (Amazon suggested lid making my getting a good fit an easy process), this produces consitand results on foods that I would otherwise grill. I cook on a old Jenn Aire 2 bunrer electric range with a downdraft which I absolutely hate. But this pan and lid produces awesome results after enduring the several minutes it takes for the burner to heat up. See my review of the lid fo more detail.Cleaning tip. After remove food, move pan to cool burner, pour about half ounce of water in pan, scrape all remaining food loose with metal spatula, remove water and most grime with one r 2 circular wipes with 2-3 sheets of paper towel (not touching pan with yourfingers so that you do not get burned, 1-2 circularwipes with clean paper towel to remove all rime and &#34;polish&#34; te pan. As necessary, add about teaspoon of olive oil or equvilent to pan and rub into pan surface with paper towel (clean rag would be better) in order to keep pan &#34;seasoned&#34;.
