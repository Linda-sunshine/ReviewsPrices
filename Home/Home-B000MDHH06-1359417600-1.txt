review/summary: This is wonderfulreview/text: I debated and debated, went back and forth, and finally took the plunge and bought this... I do NOT regret it. It is awesome, easy to clean, makes about 2 cups of juice at a time. Has a good selection of recipes in the book that comes with it and I am using it almost daily. Money well spent. Doesn't take up too much room on the counter and the juice is simply delicious and very healthy. I am very glad I purchased, highly recommend and Amazon's price is awesome, let alone the service and delivery time.
