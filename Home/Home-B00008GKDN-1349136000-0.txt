review/summary: Nice griddle for making Dosaireview/text: Actually in my perspective it is suppose to get 4 stars because it is little smaller than I expected but gave it 5 stars as it works great. My doctor suggested that cooking with Iron utensils is better than taking Iron supplements and more over I was looking for an additional pan to make Dosai (South Indian Crepe) to supplement my current work horse pan, which I got from India.I generally use this griddle for making Dosai's and omelets, both come out really good. I expected that it would take few days for the griddle to get seasoned but it started to make good Dosai's on day one after few tries. As per the instructions, I don't use soap to clean, just hot water and wipe it dry, apply oil and store it.I would highly recommend this Lodge Griddle for any one looking for a perfect Dosai pan. Now I'm thinking of buying few more Lodge logic products.
