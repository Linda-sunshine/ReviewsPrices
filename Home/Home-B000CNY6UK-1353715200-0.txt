review/summary: Best coffee everreview/text: This thing is simple to use and makes wonderful espresso. Just fill with water to the line (inside), put in funnel, fresh grind beans and fill funnel, screw together and heat on medium flame. Have to put it off center as it is smaller than the flame circle from the smallest burner on my Wolf otherwise the handle gets hot. Once coffee starts to come out of the chimney turn off the flame and wait a bit until it is done. Serve. Remember, the 6 cups means espresso cups, not regular cups or mugs. Only small issue is that for company you will have to wait a bit before making a second batch. For that I use my French press.
