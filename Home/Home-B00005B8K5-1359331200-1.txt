review/summary: Pyrex storage 10-piece setreview/text: Again, I was so disappointed in the shipping of this product. The one quart bowl had a chip taken out of it on the rim of the bowl. Again, this bowl had to be damaged before it was mailed, because there was no broken glass in the paper that it was wrapped it. Why, someone would ship it in the condition it was in. I didn't mail the package back, it would be more trouble than it was worth. i just threw the bowl out. But I know I won't order any other glass products.
