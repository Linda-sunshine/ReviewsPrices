review/summary: Works Great-----UPDATE-- not so goodreview/text: I have a 1700sf home, and it humidifies the whole house on low!! I have to shut it down every other day as the moisture collects in the window frames. Best humidier ever owned!WORKED GREAT AT FIRST- Now the filter keeps drying up and it runs without working even though there is water in it.....
