review/summary: Another temporary solution...review/text: This product was a decent performer for about a year. I cleaned it each time after refilling it and only occasionally had problems with the oil streaming, but generally never had a problem with clogging. When the sprayer finally stopped working I noticed the plastic pump section on the cap that inserts into the spray mechanism had started to separate at the bottom. I tried epoxying the broken section together, but this did not seem to fix the problem with the unit not pressurizing.I have looked online for other products but most of them seem to use the same pump mechanism so I suspect they will have the same problem after year as well.
