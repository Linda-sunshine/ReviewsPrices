review/summary: Not such a great dealreview/text: It's cheap but it doesn't pick up well at all on bare floors. The edge cleaning is poor. My 20 year-old Sharp was better by far. There's no good way to recoil the cord so it's left half-dangling. Carpet pick up is better but again edges get the short shrift.
