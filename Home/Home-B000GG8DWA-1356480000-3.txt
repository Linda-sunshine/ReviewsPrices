review/summary: Toasty!review/text: I love this heater. The only &#34;problem&#34; I had is initially, I thought it was broken because when you turn it on to one of the two heat settings, the unit is absolutely silent. I think for some situations that could be a drawback - I personally wouldn't feel comfortable having this on to heat a bedroom.because I'd hate to risk leaving the house with it on. That's just paranoia, it may have nothing to do with the safety of this particular product. I use this in the bathroom only and it works great to warm a room of that size for a small period of time. It heats quickly. And, unlike other heater units I've purchased, this one doesn't seem to trip the circuit.It's a great unit all the way around!
