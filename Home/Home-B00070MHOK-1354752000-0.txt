review/summary: You clicked on this, buy itreview/text: For the price this is a fantastic product. Whether you travel with it or use it in your home, this product is well worth its price. We use it at our company for trade shows we attend to remove wrinkles from our fabric materials there (tablecloth and 10'x10' banner). This product works great at removing both creases and finer wrinkles typically in 1-2 passes. The slower you go on each pass, the more effective it is. Fill to the fill line, plug it in, wait about 2 minutes, and you are ready to go. Typically the water lasts for about 10-12 minutes of use, and it has a few attachments that help remove wrinkles even better. Just be sure to empty all water when done using (and keep the lid off to let any excess moisture evaporate before screwing on lid). Also, handle is very ergonomic and makes this product even easier to use. HIGHLY recommended.
