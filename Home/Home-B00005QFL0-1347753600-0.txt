review/summary: Good While It Lasted (12 uses)review/text: Did a lot of comparing before I bought the Panasonic to replace our last bread machine which lasted about ten years. Finally settled on the Panasonic because of the great reviews. What the reviews don't focus on is that there is a real weak link with this machine. At the bottom of the pan holder there is a ceramic part that holds the heating element in place. That part broke after using the machine about a dozen times and just after the machine was out of warranty. The part costs just under five dollars -problem is I've been unable to find the part. I've read that Panasonic knows this part breaks with some frequentcy so why is the part hard to find?I think if more people actually looked in the bottom of the cavity they would probably see the part was cracked or completely broken through. For this reason, I can't recommend this product.
