review/summary: Grinds espresso perfectly!review/text: I bought this grinder along with my new home espresso machine after reading many reviews that talked about the importance of having a fine enough grind in order to get &#34;perfect&#34; espresso shots. I did test the fine grind of this grinder against the grind of my basic (no settings) coffee grinder and I found that it really does make a difference. So now this will take care of all my coffee grinding needs (espresso and drip coffee) and the other one has been cleaned out and reassigned the job of grinding whole spices. =) Do be careful with the lid and bean holder. I found out the hard way that if dropped on granite, the lid will crack. I super glued the halves back together and it works fine. I must not be the only one who's done that because they did include an order form for replacement parts (including the lid) in the box. =)
