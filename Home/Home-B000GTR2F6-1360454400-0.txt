review/summary: Nice.review/text: I've had this machine for 5 months.I really love this machine. Makes great coffee and I love the different cup size options. My one issue is that if the add water icon on the little screen has been flashing for a while till I fill it, when I do fill it the screen goes blank and won't allow me to do anything. Turning the machine off doesn't work in fixing the issue. The only way to get it to work is unplugging the machine and replugging and switching it on. Annoying. Aside from this, I do believe it is a great product and I would definitely recommend it.
