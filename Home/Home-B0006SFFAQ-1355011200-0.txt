review/summary: nice productreview/text: I've had my DCC-1200 for almost 3 years now, We love it. It makes exceptionally good coffee and we love the timer feature. We've had many different coffee maker and this by far produces the best coffee of anything we ever owned. We are addicted to Tim Horton coffee and we would buy 3 or 4 large coffees from them every day. Now we just buy the beans and make equally good if not better coffee in the home .... I would recommend this !
