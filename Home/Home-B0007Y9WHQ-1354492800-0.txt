review/summary: flimsy and bulkyreview/text: i have not had much use of it. Got it on friend's recomendation but it is so much easier to just use your reagular peeler, slicer and a simple knife. This is a toy for your kitchen. If you have nothing else to do with your time, go ahead and play with your food. I am too busy. This one is getting recycled as a gift to someone else.
