review/summary: Smelly and Ineffectivereview/text: The first thing I noticed was how the item was packaged. No product information or instructions, just the item all wrapped up in plastic.Second thing I noticed was the smell. It has a chemical like smell that lingers.I decided to give it a go anyhow. We slept on it for a week and I think my back and neck hurt more than ever before. Definitely didn't improve my sleep experience.I'm not sure why other people are giving it such high reviews. I think you could buy yourself an egg crate for 1/4 the price and get the same results.I don't recommend this product.
