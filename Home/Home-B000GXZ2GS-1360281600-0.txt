review/summary: Different strokes for different folksreview/text: If you are a fan of the "bright" coffee you find a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, you'll love this press. If you are looking for a single shot espresso maker that won't cost you a bundle, this is a GREAT option.Personally, though, I prefer a darker, richer taste to my coffee. I drink my coffee black, the darker roast the better. I want coffee so strong I can practically cut it with a knife. I have experimented with several different beans, grinds, water temperatures, and the shots that come out time and time again are so bright and acidic, they make my teeth ache. I'm sure if you are a milk and sugar person, they taste fine. I found that for making a just cup of regular old coffee, this press doesn't really taste that much different than what you get for a $3 plastic coffee cone you can sit on top of your cup and pour hot water over.So, just know what kind of coffee you like. If you like Coffee Bean and Illy, you'll love it. If you're a Petes/Starbucks kind of person, probably not the one for you.
