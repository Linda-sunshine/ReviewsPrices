review/summary: Mandolinereview/text: Works pretty good. Easy to clean. A bunch of parts to keep track of so if you're cramped for storage this may not be appropriate for your kitchen.There seems to be no way to sharpen the blade so I won't be putting it in the dishwasher and when it gets dull, I guess I'll be throwing it away. Scary sharp now though.
