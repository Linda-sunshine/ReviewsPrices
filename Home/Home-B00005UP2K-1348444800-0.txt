review/summary: Just Greatreview/text: I bought this for my 11 year old niece who is "almost" a professional baker. She is 12 now and this machine is like a painter's brush to a canvas. Yea of course she was home schooled and and working in the kitchen was part of her up bringing. DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT? Never had any bad issues with this after 300 wonderful cakes.
