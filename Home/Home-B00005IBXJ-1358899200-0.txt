review/summary: For the size, a great oven!review/text: This for the size is a great little oven. You'd be amazed at what one can cook, not just a frozen pizza. For instance, this year my normal gas range broke down the week of Thanksgiving. Try getting a repairman out there during a holiday week like that! So, I bought one of these, and managed to cook the turkey, the stuffing, bake yams for each family member and friend that came over (had 8 including myself this year) and even managed to do a pecan pie! It was amazing!This Christmas I used it for the ham, and I am thinking of baking all the birthday cakes for family members with this as well.Get this oven!
