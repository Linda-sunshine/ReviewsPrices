review/summary: Reasonable Air Purifierreview/text: I bought this Air Purifier because my mom had the same brand an loved it. It has 3 setting(low/med/high), you can tell it moves the air by feeling it, which is good, it is fairly loud but not tht bad if using when sleeping(drowns out other noises) - wish it had a quieter setting, there is also a bright blue light display around the dial - I like a dark room at night when sleeping - however getting used to(the health benefits outweigh the bright light - plus I can cover it up with something if needed, for the price it's a great buy, I bought an even more expensive one that cost about 3 times as much(believe this does just as good as job, plus can buy 2 more if wanted), cleaning the filter is easy compared to my other one and it;s half the size(the replacement filter cost is also reasonable, it moves just as much air as my other one, also like my other one the air coming out feels cooler - which is nice in the summer, however can cover up with a bigger blanket in the winter if needed)...for the price, the health benefits - definately a good buy, gave it 4 stars instead of 5 since I believe that there's still room for some improvements. May buy another one later, maybe by then a new and improved model with be out! The light is kind of nice at night so I don't trip over it, one good thing!
