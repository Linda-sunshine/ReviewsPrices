review/summary: Great mattress for college dorms.review/text: I bought this for my freshman year of college to put over the traditionally uncomfortable dorm mattresses. It works great and the ventilation holes really do their job. The two inches was the perfect margin of cushion and provides support while being comfortable. Some complained about the smell after opening the box, but that goes away after a few days and really has a nice mint-chocolate hue to it! Great mattress topper if you're looking for one to put in a college dorm.
