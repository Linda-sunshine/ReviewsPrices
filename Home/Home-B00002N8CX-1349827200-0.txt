review/summary: 20 Year Experience with Mighty Mitesreview/text: I've been using the Mighty Mites for 20 years. I found my first one at Walmart and it lasted me 13 years until the taping up of the hose expired. I bought about 3 other bagless brands including a Dyson canister. What a disappointment. They were too heavy and stuff got stuck in the wand and I couldn't take it out.I bought this one about 3 years ago and I love the light weight and the flexibility of shortening the wand to clean corners. I live in a 3 story house, no carpet, all wooden floors and Italian porcelain tile. Aside from that I'm a plant collector with 6 cats so this picks up little dead leaves, soil, as well as cat hair in seconds.My honest opinion,this is the best vacuum for the price and for regular flooring. Do not get it for a full carpeted house. You will be extremely disappointed.BTW, the Dyson canister is sitting in the spare bathroom just to vacuum the area where the kitties finish using the litter. The Dyson is so heavy and cumbersome I only use it for this bathroom and one area rug. That's it.
