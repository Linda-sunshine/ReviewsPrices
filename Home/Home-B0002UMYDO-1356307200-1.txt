review/summary: worked beautifully for 2 monthsreview/text: bought it.. loved it. Husband used it and now it will not work correctly. Have taken it apart and it appears that nothing is wrong until, of course, you go to use it and the blade jambs between the metal cog. Pulled the blade out and worked for couple times and not not working again. Not the blade this time. Just stops and has to be reset...takes 10 X to open the can.Crap! thought I bought a good one.
