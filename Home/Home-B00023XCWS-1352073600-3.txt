review/summary: Here's how to get rid of the plastic smellreview/text: I was looking for a relatively low wattage electric kettle to boil one or two cups at a time. This kettle works quite well for that as other reviewers have mentioned.Like others mentioned, mine came with a plastic smell that was unpleasant. I tried two things to get rid of the smell. First, I opened the kettle up and put it outside for about 24 hours. This had no impact on the smell. I thought I would try "cooking" the smell out by running a few potfuls of water through it. As I did so, I noticed that the smell was strongest when the kettle was hot. This makes sense as the heat would be the very thing to raise the vapor pressure of any volatiles. So I decided to try just keeping the pot hot. For about two days, anytime I was near the kettle, I would heat up a full pot of the water and then open the lid once the water was boiled (and the kettle was turned off). I would then leave the kettle sitting with a pot full of hot water until the next time I was in the kitchen. Then, I dumped the "contaminated" water out and did the same thing. After doing this about 10-12 times, the smell was negligible after boiling water.To recap:1.) Use the kettle to bring a full pot of water to a boil.2.) After it shuts off, open the lid to let steam escape.3.) Let the water cool to near room temperature.4.) Dump the room temperature water5.) Repeat this process until the water doesn't smell (about 12 times).6.) Reward yourself with a lovely cup of tea, coffee or hot chocolate.
