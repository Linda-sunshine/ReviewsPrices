review/summary: Shredded labels in the foodreview/text: I chose this product based on internet claims (not on Amazon) that it is fast. Its speed is normal, like any $10 can opener. I should have heeded the warnings of other reviewers about paper in the food. I have yet to open a can without destroying the label and as often as not, I have to pick out pieces of paper before using the contents.The fold away magnet is nice, but not necessary. Sometimes, the cutter doesn't engage on the first try. I would suggest that you buy something else.
