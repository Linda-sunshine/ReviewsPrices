review/summary: since when is a cup of coffee 5 ouncesreview/text: Didn t even get to percolate a cup of coffee . I didn t realize that a cup is not a cup. I would think that purchasing a coffee brewer that say s it makes 6 cups in my book it would be 48 ounces of coffee. This pot makes 6 5ounce s of coffee which is barely enough for 2 good mugs . I m sure the coffee would come out great so i ll switch up to the 12 cup brewer which i guess will brew 60 ounces . thank you
