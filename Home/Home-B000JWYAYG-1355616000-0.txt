review/summary: Not worth the pricereview/text: These sheets are stiff after washing 10 -12 times. The fitted sheet is short and narrow, I can't pull the corners over the mattress corners by 3 or more inches at each corner. Most of my sheets have a fitted sheets and have ample room in the corners so it is not my mattress. I think they sold it as a queen but it was a standard fitted. Not a good seller to me.
