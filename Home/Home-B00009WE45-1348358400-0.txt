review/summary: A reliable workhorsereview/text: I just bought a third one of these.The first one I got in 2006. It's downstairs with my big grill, and doesn't get used much. It's bent, it's dirty, it's got Silicon where I sealed the probe back to the body after breaking it off. I have to press the button a few times to turn it on and off. But hey - it's 6 years old!!My second one just crapped out after 3 1/2 years. But I used it almost every day in the kitchen, and I'm not shy about getting it wet or sticking it in the oven for a minute where it doesn't belong. I've left it out in the rain and melted a bit of it here and there.Your mileage may vary. I'm going for another one and we'll see if the quality has changed.Some have complained about the response time. I don't get that. There's no such thing as instant readout, except with a IR thermometer such asHDE Temperature Gun Infrared Thermometer w/ Laser Sight(which is also very handy for measuring pan temps - 700 degrees for the best Carne Asada).I feel lucky that I haven't had to dink around trying different models to get the right one. This thermometer has just always worked for great for me.
