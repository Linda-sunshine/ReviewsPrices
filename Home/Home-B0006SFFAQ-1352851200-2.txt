review/summary: Broke after a year and serial number scratched offreview/text: The coffee maker is great when it works. After little under a year it just stopped working. The lights turned on, but the pumps and hot plate never turned on. I tried cleaning it every which way, but that did nothing. Turns out this is a common problem.However, from reading on the internet, Cusineart is good on their manufacturer's warranty, so I tried finding the serial number. Turns out it was scratched off. Great....
