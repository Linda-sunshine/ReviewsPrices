review/summary: Brita filters work great for removing chlorine taste from waterreview/text: II bought two Brita filtering pitchers after moving to Sacramento, where the city water tastes like an over-chlorinated public swimming pool. BLECH! One taste, and I was out the door to go buy water filtering pitchers. I purchased Brita on the recommendation of friends.The filter works wonderfully well in removing the horrible chlorine flavor from the water. Met my needs perfectly. Five stars for the taste of the water.I have not had any problems with charcoal granules leaking from the filter into my water, so I would guess that Brita has addressed that issue.The lid on this pitcher fits snugly, and I have no issues with the design.My other pitcher is aBrita Grand Water Filter Pitcher, White, and while it has a larger capacity, the design is just terrible.I would recommend the Brita Slim with no reservations whatsoever. However, keep in mind that it is a smaller pitcher than the Grand.
