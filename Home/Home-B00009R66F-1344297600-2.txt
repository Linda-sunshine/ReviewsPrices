review/summary: Works Wellreview/text: I am very happy with how the carpet cleaner worked. It was easy to use and clean afterwards, and judging by the color of the water I emptied, it did a good job. I used the power clean function on high traffic areas and that helped a lot. The only drawback I can think of is you might want a machine with larger water containers if you're cleaning carpets in a large home/room. It gets a little tiresome filling and emptying the water containers. If you have average sized rooms, this one will work fine.
