review/summary: aliens talk through itreview/text: I own tons of sound machines, maybe 8 or 9. Most that claim to be loud are not. This is by far the loudest sound machine I could find. I live in a town-home and have loud neighbors and zero privacy, you can hear people peeing the walls are so thin. I keep this running 24-7 so we have privacy and don't have to listen to others. This is so loud on max volume that I can easily hear it downstairs with all upstairs doors closed, through the ceiling. The one problem is that it makes crazy noises. It sounds like aliens are trying to communicate through it sometimes. I keep it on the white noise setting and while you hear that "fan like" noise, you also hear some talking. It sounds like some man keeps saying "mountain top" over and over again and it drives me nuts so I have to use two additional ones at night so I don't hear it. The two other sound machines are higher end ones and don't have a loop but they are not loud and don't drown out the neighbors. All three together work great at night, and the one works great during the day. Now if I had to use just this to sleep it would fail big time cause it just makes too much weird noise, but if you need something really loud to give you privacy then this is it. It also turns on and off on its own, and randomly the alarm will go off or the radio will come on. But all in all nothing is as loud. I used to use a stereo with a white noise cd but it only last six months with 24-7 use, this has been going strong for well over a year. If you dont want a loud one the best one on amazon is the S-550-05 Sound Therapy System from Sound Oasis; I own two of them and they work great.
