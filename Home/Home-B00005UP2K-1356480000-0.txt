review/summary: DON'T BUY ONE! Poorly-made garbage.review/text: I just laid my THIRD KitchenAid mixer to rest last night after the gears gave out while I was whipping cream for Christmas dinner. It was a good thing I have a hand mixer and had the extra pint of whipping cream so I could avoid serving gear-flavored cream to my guests.My first KitchenAid mixer was a basic white unit. It went away solely because I changed my kitchen and wanted something that matched. That unit occasionally leaked oil but I knew when it did it and worked around it. I made bread a couple times and put chocolate chips in the bowl once and didn't like the noise it made. Otherwise no real abuse.The second unit was a sort of gun metal color. Same motor, same capacity. It leaked oil from day one. After 4 years of not wanting to make cookies and not being able to make meringue because egg whites don't whip well with petroleum mixed in, I bought a new one.Third unit came home, I immediately adjusted the beater so it didn't contact the bowl and even went so far as to check to make sure the kitchen outlet was wired properly. The hardest this one has worked was making banana bread. I observed NO out of the ordinary noises for a KitchenAid mixer. I made cookies last weekend and pumpkin pies for the holiday. It's never mashed potatoes or made bread. I have several friends with KitchenAid mixers and they ALL have issues with them. The mixers are garbage.Anybody who purchases a KitchenAid mixer is a fool who will soon be parted from their money. You'll do yourself a favor if you buy a different brand or save your pennies for a REAL commercial-grade mixer.
