review/summary: One smooth can opener!review/text: I bought this can opener five months ago, and so far, I couldn't be more pleased. It works beautifully. It grips the can firmly and does its thing, with the magnet holding onto the top so I never have to fish through the can contents to pull it out. It handles many different sizes of cans without a hitch. It also is very sleek - takes up just a little bit of countertop space and looks great. Very satisfied with this purchase.
