review/summary: Thing of beautyreview/text: Why couldnt they add a darn On/Off switch?Other than that, a piece of perfection when it comes to popcorn makers. So much nicer than the stove-top crank popcorn makers which leave you with oily popcorn.I never knew that you could eat an entire bowl of popcorn and not have any grease on your hands at all!
