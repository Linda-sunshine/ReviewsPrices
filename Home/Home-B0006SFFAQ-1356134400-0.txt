review/summary: Design flawreview/text: This coffeemaker makes great coffee but I hate that the reservoir isn't viewable from outside. Instead you have to stand directly over the reservoir to see the water level. There are plastic &#34;stair steps&#34; inside the reservoir numbered 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. It's hard to see exactly which spot the water comes up to. And if you want to brew an odd number of cups, it's even harder to guess where to fill it to.Other than that, it's perfect.
