review/summary: Love it!review/text: I did manage to cut the tip of my finger on the bottom "plate" just below the coil when I was initially cleaning it (after reading about the strong "plastic" taste). However, this works really, really well.For those complaining about the sound/loudness...that's the sound of excited water molecules. They *need* to get excited in order to boil.
