review/summary: Great price for a great pressure canner!review/text: The Presto Cooker Canner is great! I know there are several others out there far more expensive, but for home canning - this one was easy to use and worked great! I can salmon, trout and venison. I have canned salsa and spaghetti sauce in the oven and a boiler in the past, but will be trying the Presto for that soon. I have no doubts it will work well! It's a huge time saver as a cooker also - which was secondary to the reason I bought it, but what a bonus!
