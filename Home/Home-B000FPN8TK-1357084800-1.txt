review/summary: Very Pleasedreview/text: I have always planned on using loose tea leaves instead of tea bags, and the Adagio Teapot allowed me to do so. I find myself drinking even more tea than before, mainly because I can fill it up so easily and get at least 2 good size mugs out of it, with a little bit more. It's extremely easy to clean and maintain, and I couldnt be any happier with it! Anyone who loves tea, or would like to start drinking more, get yourself the 32-Ounce Teapot, because you can never have too much tea!
