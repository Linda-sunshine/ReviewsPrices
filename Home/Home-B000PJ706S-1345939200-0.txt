review/summary: Stopped workingreview/text: I received this kettle as a gift, at Christmastime. I'm the only person who uses it, so it doesn't get much use. I probably used it once a week. By May, the automatic switch (off) was no longer working. This may seem like a small thing - one would think you could just stand near the kettle and watch it - but, for whatever reason, the pot will no longer boil water fully. It comes nearly to the boiling point, then it stops, then...minutes later, it will start again, then it stops, (repeat cycle over and over).If I walked away, or if I had children, this would be very dangerous. I can no longer get boiling water from the kettle, just "very hot water". It's a shame, because I liked the kettle. I did not experience the chemical smell/taste products that others experienced and I am very concerned with such things, so I was on the lookout.The kettle looks great and I love that it's clear, but now it's useless.
