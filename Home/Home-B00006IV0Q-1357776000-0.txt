review/summary: Hot coffee, but...review/text: It arrived in great time. The coffee tastes about the same as with the drip (Mr Coffee) that we have, but now the coffee is always hot. The Mr. Coffee warmer plate was never consistent at keeping the coffee hot. I do have to say it takes more time to fill the drip basket with coffee and the filters it comes with are a pain to use.
