review/summary: Great for making coffeereview/text: We bought this to filter our coffee water. The pitcher is slim and fits nicely in the refridgerator. The one issue is the lid does not fit tightly and if it is tipped too much, it falls off, spilling water all over the place. I place it in the sink with a slow drip of water which fills the container easily.
