review/summary: I couldn't be happier.review/text: The short and nasty: as a graduate of the school of Starbucks back when pulling a perfect shot was a skill and an art, I have high expectations for espresso. Obviously, I need a thick crema and I want to see a dark heart. This machine has consistently given me perfect pulls from the first shot. I often marvel at the beautiful separation of the espresso while it's pouring and savor the final shot... whether I'm making a straight espresso or a homemade iced caramel macchiato. Seriously. If you're going to get this machine, get clear shot glasses. You're going to love watching this thing work.Now, the only draw back is its squat design. I literally have to tip my 1oz shot glasses to get them under the portafilter. Yeah, I could remove the stainless steel bottom for an extra inch... so, that's a possible solution to that problem. With regards to the wand issue that others have mentioned, that it is too short and too close to the counter, I just put the machine on a little stand that gives me extra space. Again, I don't know how they expect anyone to use the steam wand on a flat counter, but there are options.Final verdict, the price and quality of shot are worth negotiating the short design. You won't be upset.
