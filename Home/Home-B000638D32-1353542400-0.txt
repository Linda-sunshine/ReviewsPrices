review/summary: Great knife, still cuts like it's newreview/text: After going through 5 different chef's knives over the past 6 years, this has by far been the best. It cuts like butter. It has stayed sharp longer than my &#34;they'll never go dull&#34; expensive knives did. It isn't dishwasher recommended, but washing it down after every use by hand isn't that hard. The handle grip is a hard plastic, but it feels sturdy. One of the things I hate about my old knives was that the tang went all the way through the handle and the handle didn't always line up perfectly with it. This knife doesn't have that problem.
