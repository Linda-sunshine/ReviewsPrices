review/summary: first new alarm clock in 20+ yearsreview/text: The alarm clock I have had for over 20 years finally died, may it rest in peace. So, I had to get a new one. After looking at them for days I finally just picked one. I didn't want to miss work due to my not buying a new one. I was suprised to find that when I plugged it in for the first time it had the correct time (date and day) all ready set. Even the Time zone (eastern) was correct. I figured out how the alarms work and I am happy so far. One problem I have with it is the size and brightness of the display. The numbers are at least an inch and a half is size. When it's next to your bed only a few feet from your face they will look massive. If your eye site is not so good then they should work great for you. The other problem is the brightness of the display. It does have three settings that lets you adjust it. If it didn't let me change it I would be sending it back as the brightest setting is way beyond my tolerance. I like my bedroom as dark as possible. I set it at the lowest setting as possible. I think I can get use to it but it still seems bright even when set at lowest setting. This could just be me. The receiver is good. I can get a radio station my old clock could not. The channel indicator does not light up. I like that as it keeps it from adding to the overall brightness of the display.I have never had one that self adjust for daylgiht savings. I am a little concerend that it will mess up so I will just have to wait until spring to find out.
