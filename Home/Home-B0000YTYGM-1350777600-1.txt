review/summary: Works okreview/text: This is a good solid coffee maker. I've had mine for about a year now.Pro:Makes pretty damn good coffeeCon:- Carafe handle broke in under a year, seal broke as well. But this was all under warranty. Kind of a hassle to replace, but, whatever.- The screw on lid has to be on just right or it will leak. Something is weird about this, it's easy to mis-thread it.- I really don't like the loud five beeps when the coffee is ready. Trust me, if I want my coffee, I'm going to have it. You don't have to beep at me annoyingly. There really should be a way to turn this off.
