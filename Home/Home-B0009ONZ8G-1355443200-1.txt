review/summary: Died within a yearreview/text: I had this vacuum for only one year before it completely died. Long before that, it did a subpar job picking up dirt. As I would run the vacuum I would feel little bits of dirt hitting my ankles (ewww). It also constantly had breaking belts that required replacement. I would never buy this vacuum again.
