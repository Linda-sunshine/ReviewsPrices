review/summary: It's very, very tough to get the cubes outreview/text: It is very difficult to get the ice cubes out of the tray, especially the corner cubes. I don't know if they stick to the trays or if suction is causing the problem, but you'll need a lot of hand strength to wrestle them out. For me it takes three steps: (1) Twist the trays to break some of the seal, (2) Push the back of each cube section with my thumb to get the cubes part of the way out, (3) Use my fingers and pull the cubes the rest of the way out.After going through all that my finger tips are frozen and I've touched each cube. I suppose I could use gloves or soak the tray in hot water to try to loosen up the cubes, but who wants to go through all that.Each time I use them I'm quickly reminded what an awful pain they are, literally. I would not buy them again and I would not recommend these trays to a friend.
