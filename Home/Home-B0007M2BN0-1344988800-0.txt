review/summary: What NOT to do, maybereview/text: I, too, am very pleased with this gadget but after using it 3 times in a row (4 eggs in the tray in the space of 45 minutes) my microwave blew out. It is an old microwave and has served us well for 20+ years (!) so I am not blaming it on this egg cooker but I would advise not using it in such quick succession...give it a chance to cool down. I was just soooooo happy to finally get some eggs cooked beautifully, no shells sticking and perfect texture (15 mins for 4 hard boiled) that I got carried away. When I get my new microwave tomorrow I will be less rambunctious.
