review/summary: Tea Drinkerreview/text: I love tea. I need tea. So I got this so I could take tea with me in the morning. Positives - it keeps the tea hot which is the main goal. I mean real hot. Sometimes I can't drink out of this at least for an hour later. Cons - the lid sometimes gives me problems and if not screwed on the right way it will spill out the sides. I always hold it upside down to test it before throwing it in my bag. Also, I wish this was slightly bigger than 12 ounces, as you can't fill it all the way to the top or it will spill out the sip lid. I use tea bags in this and it works great.
