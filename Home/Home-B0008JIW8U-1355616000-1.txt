review/summary: One little defect caused total failurereview/text: I have bought Mr. Coffee coffeemakers for years without a problem so this took me by surprise. The decanter lid was too small for the decanter and sunk into the decanter. This meant that the knob on the decanter lid that pushes up the brew basket so that the brewed coffee drips into the decanter was too low. So the coffee stayed in the brew basket instead of dripping into the decanter. I had my old coffeemaker that had stopped working after over 3 years so I pried off the lids of the old and new decanters and swapped them. Now my new coffeemaker works just fine. If I didn't have the old decanter lid, I would have had to send the whole thing back because the problem with the decanter lid is essentially total failure of the coffeemaker. I gave it 4 stars because I like the coffeemaker so much but if this were the first time I ever bought one, I would have given it one star.
