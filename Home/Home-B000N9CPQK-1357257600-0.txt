review/summary: Noisy!!!!review/text: I purchased this air purifier because I found that even though I clean consistently, there is alot of dust in my apartment. Maybe I live in an old building? Anyway, I cannot comment on how clean my air is, since I just purchased this thing. However, I will say that this machine is pretty loud on the lowest setting. Also, it seems that idea of the purifier is that is sucks in air, and shoots it out. The air it shoots out is pretty cold. I decided to place this in my kitchen, and my place feels like it colder in the kitchen than in any other room; beware. The information guide advises to keep the air purifier on 24/7 for best results. I left it on through the night on the lowest setting and I feel like its quite noisy. I have decided that I would leave the it on, on the hightest setting, when I leave for work, and change it to low when I get back. At night, I will shut it off.
