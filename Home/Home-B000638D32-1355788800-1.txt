review/summary: Fantastic knifereview/text: I had no idea how dull my old Farberware knives were until I bought this knife. I got in based on the recommendation from America's Test Kitchen, but I still had my doubts about such a relatively cheap knife. It's incredibly sharp and seems to be holding up well. The best knife you can get at this price.
