review/summary: Best single cup coffee maker too bad is not automatic.review/text: I bought the Aeropress because the reviews were so good. Took me about three tries to make a good cup of coffee. It makes the best coffee.I even ran out of filters and ended up cutting my own from other coffee maker filters.The ONLY problem I have with this coffee maker is that I am too lazy to make coffee "handcrafted" in the morning upon awaken. Otherwise it is excellent.You can even take it with you camping or traveling.
