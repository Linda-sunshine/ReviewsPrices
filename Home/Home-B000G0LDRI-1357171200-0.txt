review/summary: Very satisfied with the humidifier.review/text: We purchased this product to humidify the lower level of our home, especially when using our fireplace heatalator in the winter. The humidifier easily raised the humidity level from 26% to 50% in several hours and maintains the humidity level around 40% when running the fireplace heatalator. The controls are very straight-forward and easy to use. We espeically like the three-way, variable fan (low, med, high - a little loud when on high) that allows us to control humidity output, along with the automatic humidistat that turns the unit off when reaching the preset humidity level. The two water tanks (about 1.5 gallons) are very easy to remove, fill and replace. Removing and cleaning the filter is very easy - soak in sink filled with clean water for 10 minutes and replace. We also like the that the humidifier is compact compared to the old bulky box-size humidifier we used to have. Overall, we like this product alot.
