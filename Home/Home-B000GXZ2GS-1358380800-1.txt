review/summary: smooooth and rich coffeereview/text: Makes the smoothiest and richest coffee! I'm very picky with my coffee and this definitely beats other &#34;fancier&#34; coffee makers, like the french press. After getting used to using it, I made myself the best cup of coffee I've ever had. My only complaint is that the press itself is cheapy looking, since it's made out of plastic. It also resembles something from a high school science lab. But don't judge a book by it's cover and get this if you want really good coffee. Clean up is so simple. You can watch youtube videos on how to use this.
