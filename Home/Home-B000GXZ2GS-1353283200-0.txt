review/summary: as good as it gets for even the most demanding coffee drinkersreview/text: this is amazing.i'm an organic whole bean drinker that uses a french press and coffee grinder, and i air seal my beans when not in use.that said, i thought for $30 i'd check this out. who knows. well, now i know. it is amazing.with my coffee press i got the best cup of jo in my life...i make it just to my taste. however, i will admit there was a bit of acid left even in the most mild organic blends. the price i pay for liking it super strong.problem solved. this device, by pressure running the water through the grounds, gets rid of most acid, but retains the flavor. i have now replaced my coffee press with coffee made per instructions through the aeropress...just as rich, acid bite gone. amazing.this is now part of my coffee making life. great invention!
