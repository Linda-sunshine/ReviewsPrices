review/summary: realityreview/text: the carpet cleaner works well except if you do not have the recovery tank on properly it will not pick up the waste water.i tried numerous times to put the top of the recovery tank, on to no avail,after numerous attempts i got it on,but its very hard to have it on properly so the machine will work. cordially russ
