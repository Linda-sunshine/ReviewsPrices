review/summary: No problems herereview/text: I felt compelled to write a review based on all of the bad reviews. I own this product and have gifted it because I like it so much. I have not had issues with the processor breaking, the teeth on the attachment wearing down etc. To the person chopping cheese in the plastic processor attachment, well that isn't what this is supposed to be used for, no wonder it broke. I would highly recommend this product, I use it weekly. PS I have a culinary degree and find this tool just as good as the professional tools I have had the opportunity to use at a much better price point.
