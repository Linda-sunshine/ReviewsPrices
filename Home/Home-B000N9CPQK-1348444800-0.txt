review/summary: Okay Air Purifier, Not What I Expectedreview/text: Being my first air purifier I went in with unknown expectations. After one week of use I have to say I am truly happy with the purchase overall. The purifier is placed in my basement office where most of my time is spent. I've never had any complaints about smell or air quality before buying this purifier, however now that I have it running on medium 24/7 I am already noticing the results. The air just feels better to breathe now.I have experimented with the ionizer on and off and haven't yet noticed any difference. I definitely need more time to understand long term benefits, though I'm surprised by the already noticeable effects.One thing I am a little disappointed with is the filters that come with this unit. While the product description states a washable pre-filter and a permanent HEPA filter the documentation that came with the unit paints a different picture. Received in the box were 4 pre-filters (3 month recommended life) and 2 HEPA filters (6 month recommended life) both with very clear "Non-Cleanable" labels. While I appreciate the manufacturer providing a year of free filters if I had wanted a purifier requiring replacement filters I would have purchased one that specifically stated such.Despite the limited life-span of the air purifier (I will likely buy a new PERMANENT purifier of a different brand once these filters are expended)I have to say I am impressed with the perceived improvement in air quality. All in all for the money spent I'm happy with the results and will be purchasing another air purifier with a cleanable filter for other rooms in the house.
