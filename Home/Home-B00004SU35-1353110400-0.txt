review/summary: WhirlyPoP... real popcorn... easily...review/text: I love popcorn and quit bag popcorn long ago. WhirlyPop beats it hands down for taste and it just takes a couple minutes once you get a system. Nothing bad to say... the bad reviewers must be capable of breaking an anvil. Use it gently and correctly (read directions and review tips) and it will last for years, as mine has (second one in ten years).I have no connection with the company... I support reliable cooking gear. EnjoyOh, try white and yellow popcorn... there is a difference. I use a mix mostly.
