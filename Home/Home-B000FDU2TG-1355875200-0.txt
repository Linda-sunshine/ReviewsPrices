review/summary: Reliable work horsereview/text: This has made a lot of smoothies in the last 9 months during my wifes pregnancy. We made fruit smoothies every day for her with ice and vitamins and fresh fruit. We have a super healthy baby, and a healthy mum which we both put down to, at least in part, me getting up every morning and making the smoothies. This has been so easy to use and clean and reliable. Also makes great frozen margaritas!!!
