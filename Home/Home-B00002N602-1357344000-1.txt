review/summary: Bad designreview/text: Had high hopes from the other reviews but disappointed. The pot handles are weak and I'm sure will break in time&#8230;The pot handle has one screw holding it to the pot and has come loose every time I've used it&#8230;.It will eventuallybreak and then what? And I'm not buying or eating off of any cookware &#34;made in China&#34;
