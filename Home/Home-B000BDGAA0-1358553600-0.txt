review/summary: Nice Pillow-Did not meet my needreview/text: I had hopes that this pillow would decrease neck pain at night. It did not. The beads are packed too tight so the pillow does not change shape easily so I can get the support I need for the neck area. Both edges of the pillow are about the same height so flipping it over does not lower the head. Difficult to get a cradle hole for the head. The first pillow I received had a hole and those micro beads escaped over a large area and was difficult to clean up. There was no problems with exchanges, got replacement right away but had to take it to UPS to send back and print a return ticket as well.Its a nice pillow (material quality) if you have no sleep issues but don't expect it to fix any sleep problems.
