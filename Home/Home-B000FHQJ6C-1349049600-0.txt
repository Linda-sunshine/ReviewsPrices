review/summary: Great juicer - One flaw!review/text: I bought this juicer based on reviews from this venue. I was very happy with it but after about two weeks I noticed pulp being ejected from the vent port. Initially, I thought I hadn't attached the pulp collector properly but every time I juiced, I realized pulp was still coming through the vent. I was disappointed because this was my second juicer I purchased after sending another one (Omega) back. Ultimately, I just took it down to the local thrift store and gave it to them to sell as my time to return it was over. I've since purchased the Breville juicer and although the cost was pretty high, I feel it was worth every cent...what a great juicer. Don't get me wrong: the Hamilton Beach is a wonderful juicer and very reasonable priced, easy to clean and assemble. If they would correct to pulp ejection problem, it would be a best buy!
