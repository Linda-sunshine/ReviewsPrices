review/summary: Richest and "cleanest" cup of coffee I've ever madereview/text: I've roasted my own coffee for the past ten years and brewed it nearly every way possible. I purchased this product because I thought it might be a good way to make a decent cup of coffee while hiking/camping. For the hikers/backpackers in a serious Leave No Trace area where you have to pack out your coffee grounds (hint: Philmont - Boy Scouts)a french press mug is not a good option because it's too difficult/messy to clean out the grounds. But, in the AeroPress, all the grounds pop out in a compressed little hockey puck. What I didn't expect was the quality of the coffee that this thing could make. It' as good as French Press without any sediment. It's incredible! If you like coffee, you need one of these.
