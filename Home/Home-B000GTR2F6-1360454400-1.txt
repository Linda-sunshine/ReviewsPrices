review/summary: Great.... for 2 1/2 yearsreview/text: I loved our B70 model till it broke down. The water was pumping to the back but not releasing from there. We did all trouble shooting recommended by Kuerig customer service. At the end, her reslove was to offer me a new one at a discounted price of $119. We bought it for $150. Now that im left with a bunch of kcups, I have to get another k-cup coffee maker priced minimally at $100. Definitely not getting a Kuerig.
