review/summary: I DO RECOMMEND THIS VERY FAST!review/text: I HAVE THIS AND I DO RECOMMEND THIS IF YOUR STRAPPED FOR TIME, ITS VERY FAST AND DOES THE JOB, HOWEVER IF YOU WANT MORE OF THE JUICE FROM THE GREENS THIS IS NOT FOR YOU, I USUALLY PUT MY GREENS SPINACH AND KALE IN THE BLENDER WITH LITTLE WATER THEN MIX THE TWO. THIS THING IS SO EASY TO CLEAN UP, THE BIG DOWNSIDE ON THIS IS THE PLASTIC PART ON TOP ITS HARD TO KEEP CLEAN. ALWAYS LOOKS DIRTY ALL THE OTHER PARTS IS VERY EASY TO CLEAN. FASTEST JUICER OUT THERE. AND TASTE SO GOOD!! I ALSO DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY PUT THE POWER CORD TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE JUICER, HOWEVER OVERALL I DO LOVE THIS COMPARED TO MY OLD JACK LENNARD JUICER!
