review/summary: Does what it says it does!review/text: Purchased this along with the hoover platinum pet plus solution to steam our carpets. We have Jack Russell Terriers that occasionally have accidents in the house, & this steam cleaner works great to clean up their pee. One comment I do have, unrelated to the steamer itself, is that the hoover platinum pet plus cleaning solution does not work as well as a homemade mixture of hydrogen peroxide, baking soda & hand soap (a recipe can be found with a simple Google search). The homemade mixture leaves absolutely no smell whatsoever & spots tend to resurface less than with the hoover platinum pet plus solution. I would highly recommend this steam machine for anyone with kids and or pets!!
