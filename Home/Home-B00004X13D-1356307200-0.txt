review/summary: Makes the Waffles you would get at a dinerreview/text: I like this little waffle iron and have to admit, I have used it to make a Omelet or two and it wasn't that bad. I have to say though, unless you are a real lover of Belgian Waffles or have a family or multiple people to make some for, eating this after awhile gets a bit tiring and though it takes less than 3-5 minutes to make, it sometimes seems longer when you are in a rush to work.
