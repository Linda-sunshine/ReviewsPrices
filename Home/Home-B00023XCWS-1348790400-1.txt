review/summary: Would you like some water with your plastic?review/text: This kettle is made entirely out of plastic. So you are essentially boiling your water in plastic. They say not to put plastic in the microwave, so my guess is you probably shouldn't boil your water in plastic, either. The reason the water tastes like plastic is because it's chock full of the stuff! Better to stick with a stainless steel kettle and have peace of mind about your health.
