review/summary: Nice Wokreview/text: quality and finish excellent. Description indicated that it was a stainless steel WoK but did not indicate whether it is induction compatible. This unit will work fine with a standard cooktop but not an induction type. I purchased it because I thought that it would work. No complaints, it is a nice wok anyway.
