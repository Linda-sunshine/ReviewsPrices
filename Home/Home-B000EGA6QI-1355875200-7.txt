review/summary: Over a year now...review/text: I have had this little blender for over a year, and it is so handy. I use it all the time. It does a great job in soups and sauces. It is so much easier than transferring hot stuff into the processor. I picked mine up before all the cool colors were introduced, but I am totally happy with my chrome version.
