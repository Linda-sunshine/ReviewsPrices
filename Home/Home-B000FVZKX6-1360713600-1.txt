review/summary: awesome buyreview/text: I have owed many flannel sheets sets over the last 15 years (bought at Macys). They always had a lot of fluff collect at the bottom of the bed and in the dryer (which I expect and am fine with). I know other reviewers said they same about these but I used white vinegar when I washed them and I had practically no fluff in the dryer or at the bottom of my bed. They are by far the best flannel sheets I have every owned and I consider myself somewhat of an expert on flannel sheets.
