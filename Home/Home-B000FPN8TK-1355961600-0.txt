review/summary: Must have if you're a loose-leaf tea drinkerreview/text: I have seen the Ingenuitea Teapot before, but never knew if it was worth it. Recently, I traveled to Taiwan where they are serious about their tea drinking. One person whose opinion on tea I highly respect always uses this pot to make a quick cup of tea (when he didn't feel like breaking out the whole tea set and doing the more traditional tea ritual).Anyways, when I got back, I ordered this teapot and I love it. I love the flexibility of it because I can make western-style tea (throw some Earl Grey in there, steep, pour into the cup), or the more Chinese style where you pour water over whole leaves several times.What never cease to amaze me is the precision with which the flow stops and doesn't drip after. Also, being dishwasher safe (just pop the lid off) makes it really easy to clean. Great product.
