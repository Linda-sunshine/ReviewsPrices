review/summary: Worked great...twicereview/text: I was very impressed with this vacuum the first two times I used it. The suction was very powerful and easily picked up pet hair from my car. Initially, my only complaint was that its a little wide to use as a car vac but it still manages. The third time I plugged it in and turned it on and the motor sounded all high pitched and made a whizzing sound, the suction was drastically reduced. I checked the filter to make sure nothing was clogging it but didn't see anything. It still works but just not very well.
