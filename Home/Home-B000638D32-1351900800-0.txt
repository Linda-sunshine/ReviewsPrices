review/summary: Dangerous in the Wrong Handsreview/text: What an excellent knife! The blade is very sharp as delivered and thick enough for good feel and should stand up to future sharpenings. Not as thick as a $200 knife. As I understand it, this is a stamped blade - not forged. But it feels and acts like a good knife.While preparing only my second meal with this knife, before I knew it I had sliced through about half my finger nail and a quarter of my finger. Fortunately, not such a deep cut that I discovered the bone cutting ability of the Victorinox, but enough to attest to its facility with meat. I'm sure a top end Wusthoff would've taken off the whole finger, but I am more than satisfied with the performance of this blade. Especially at this price!
