review/summary: This Vacuum is amazing.review/text: 10/19/2012 My hoover steam vac with power surge came in the mail today. I opened it up put it together, boiled some hot water and got to work. It took me 3 hours to finish my carpet because i wanted to make sure every stain was up and clean. This vacuum cleaner got my carpet, smelling so good, and looking so clean. I was so happy with this product. I have a two year old and she has put all types of spills all over my living room and dining room carpet I am talking about everything from food stains like spaghetti sauce, juice spills, and even potty training stains. Before i got this vacuum, i was not able to get them up by myself to the point where i was comfortable and the stains just built up to the point where i was just like forget it I tried to get up as much as i could, but it would still leave a stain. This vacuum cleaner has given me a new start. I can really tell the difference in how clean my carpet was before and after. I wish i would have taken how dirty my carpet was before compared to now.Pros: Easy to usenot heavy, like others have said on hereit is a work out if you have heavy stuck on stains in your carpet.it really gets up messes that have set indries very quicklyVacuum cord is very longVery easy to assemble, alot of people said you need to hear a snap when putting on the power surge, i did not hear a snap and mines works fineWorth every pennyCons: There is no steam, you have to make your own steam, by boiling hot waterThe dirty water tank fills up very quickly so you will have to dump out the water multiple times while using this productThe clean water reservoir does not hold a lot of water eitherYou will have to go really, really, really slow on the tough stainsYou will also have to go over the stains, multiple times.I really like this product and i see why it has had so many positive reviews.
