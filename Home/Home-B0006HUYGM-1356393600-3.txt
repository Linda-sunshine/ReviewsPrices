review/summary: It worksreview/text: Great for pet hair. Very good power. It's weight will take a little getting used to. On furniture with looser fabric, the vacuum power sucks in the fabric thereby stopping the roller. Hence, one must tip the unit up or back in order to prevent this. On carpet it's just fine.
