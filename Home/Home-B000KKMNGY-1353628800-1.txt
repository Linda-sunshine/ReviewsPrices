review/summary: Great idea on paper but doesn't work when put to the testreview/text: Make sure you measure your cabinet. Most standard sized cabinets above the counter will not fit it unless you use a wire cutter. It will fit in under the counter cabinets but you can't put stuff that is too heavy because metal will bend. It looks great in the picture but really isn't practical to use.
