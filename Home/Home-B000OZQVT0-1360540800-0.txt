review/summary: Good Productreview/text: This product has a very nice orange flame and crackles nicely like a real fire. I have found that if you shake the can really well, you'll get a longer burn time. The average seems to be about 2 to 2 and a half hours per can. Some have complained of the smell but I think it is very negligible....when you first open it there is an odor. When it burns I really can't smell it. The only reason I give it 3 stars is the burn time....wish it were longer.
