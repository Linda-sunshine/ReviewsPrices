review/summary: Difficult to operatereview/text: I am still trying to understand this product. I does not really fix the vegetables that I try to work with. Maybe for the time being I don't know how to work it but I will continue trying. The problem I really have with it is that it is made out of plastic and it's not as sturdy as some other products that were made out of metal that did not work either. OK, maybe I am picky but to charge thirty some dollars for something that difficult to work and made out of plastic&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;
