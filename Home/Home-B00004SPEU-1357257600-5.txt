review/summary: Grinds Coffee Beans Well But Has No Cord Storagereview/text: I bought this coffee grinder to replace my old one which finally died after many years of use. This model grinds cofee beans acceptably and to the fineness that I desired. As with all grinders of this type, it is noisy during use, but I expected that. I like this style of grinder because it is compact and stores in a cupboard without taking up much room. The only design flaw that I don't like is that it has no device to store the electric cord when not in use. The cord must be manually tied (to itself or with a twist-tie) or be allowed to flop around freely in the cupoard during storage. My previous two grinders of this style had a built-in design to store the cord (grinder #1 had a base around which the cord was wrapped around the body of the grinder; grinder #1 had a spring-loaded base which retracted the cord into the grinder). Unfortunately, I could not find a reasonably priced grinder with cord storage when was was looking for a new grinder. For functionality, I would buy this grinder again (I still have it today), but I would prefer one with a cord-storage design if I could find one instead in a similar price range.
