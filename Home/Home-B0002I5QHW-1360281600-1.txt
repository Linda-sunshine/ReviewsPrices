review/summary: I'm not being overly harshreview/text: Worked for about a dozen uses, then stopped being able to cut through sirloin steaks sliced thinly. Meat became so blocked as to be pulverized into high grade pink slime with sodium nitrates/nitrites leaking into the bin and backward onto the floor. Had to cut what wasn't pulverized by hand.
