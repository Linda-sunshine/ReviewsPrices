review/summary: We dig this little regular grind single cup coffee makerreview/text: This economical unit, makes a terrific cup of coffee without the use of a pods or pre filled cups and that in and of itself will allow this to be very economical and allow you to choose the strength and brand which suits you and caters to your budget. The first one we had lasted for over 6 years until the prong which lifts up the head which transports the hot water to fill the brewing chamber worn down. We also use the Melitta Type 1 filters which we get from Amazon, as stores are virtually not carrying the Type 1's as so many people have the pod or cup brewing systems. We love it, hope you will to.
