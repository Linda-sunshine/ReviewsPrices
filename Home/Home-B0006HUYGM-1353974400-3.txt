review/summary: Good for doing stairsreview/text: This works well for doing a carpeted stairway. The carpet beater bar is quite aggressive and it sucks up a lot of dirt. i don't use it much on other parts of the carpet because you have to be kneel on your knees to use it. The crevice attachment is nice. Since the dirt reservoir is small, it needs to be emptied often. The dust tends to stick to the filter and is hard to shake off. Fortunately the filter is washable. So after I have emptied it I usually wash it. It does take a few hours to dry, so I only wash when I won't need it again until the next day.
