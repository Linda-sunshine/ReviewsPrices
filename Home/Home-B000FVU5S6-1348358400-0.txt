review/summary: Good sheets, mediocre dyereview/text: These are nice sheets, but after one night of sleeping on them, one of the pillowcases is already stained! I know that acne products with benzoyl peroxide can leave bleach stains, but I hadn't used my overnight face cream, and I had showered over 12 hours earlier. I'm not sure what happened, but I have to conclude that the dye on these sheets is just not of the highest quality, or not properly set. There were small bleached streaks on the sheets when I washed them after taking them out of the package. I really like the quality of the sheets, I'm just disappointed that they're not going to stay nice. Also, they tend to wrinkle.One other thing. I got these sheets in "Blush" thinking that they'd be light pink, but they're actually kind of a light peach color. Those ones didn't have problems with staining, but the "Mint" color, while being a nice light green, did stain.
