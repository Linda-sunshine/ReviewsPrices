review/summary: broke quicklyreview/text: I bought this vacuum for about $50 a year ago and it broke in about 8 months.If I try to use the vacuum, it spits dust out of the exhaust and all over the place. it does the complete opposite of what it's supposed to do now. instead of picking up dirt, it just spreads it... horrible. You really do get when you pay for.
