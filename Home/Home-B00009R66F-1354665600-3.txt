review/summary: its an ok buyreview/text: it does a great job cleaning, but it is all plastic and really unstable. after 6 month (i use it almost every day though, with two puppys and a toddler) the handle broke and it took a while to get hover to replace it (they wanted to argue about the warranty).i would buy it again because it cleans awesome and you cant beat the price
