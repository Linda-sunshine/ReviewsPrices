review/summary: It is great, just a little smaller than I thought.review/text: I just received this item, got to test it out and was very pleased. It is extremely accurate and compact which is great. It is a little smaller than I thought it would be, but am still pleased none the less. I ordered a second one as a gift to a friend and would recommend this to anyone interested in a compact easy to carry scale.
