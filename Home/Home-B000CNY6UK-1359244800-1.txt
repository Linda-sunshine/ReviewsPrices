review/summary: Maybe size matters...review/text: I purchased the 6-cup "espresso maker." The bottom chamber consistently filled with coffee as well grounds. Discolored quickly ... aluminum is highly reactive to almost everything... Read another review with recommendation the 1-3 cup stovetop espresso maker performs better and I will give it a try. Returned the 6800 Moka Expresss. Need morning coffee so currently using a little Indian pot, stainless steel, and other than the required 15-minute wait for the filtered coffee... it is interesting coffee... It is tasty...
