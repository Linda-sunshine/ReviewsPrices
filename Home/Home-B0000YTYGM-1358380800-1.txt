review/summary: Fantasticreview/text: I have used a thermal carafe in the past at other places and I wanted to try one for myself. The problem is that so many thermal carafes only come in a 10 cup. I wanted a 12 cup coffee pot which is hard to find. I was so glad to see that Cuisinart makes a 12-cup Thermal Programmable Coffeemaker. It keeps the coffee hot for a longer period of time without burning the coffee. The plate the carafe sits on never gets hot because it is not heated which is not needed because the thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot, therefore you can set the timer for coffee in the morning and never have to turn it off unless you need to change the time the pot comes on in the morning. Just fill with water and coffee at night and you are finished. I love the Thermal Coffeemaker. Also you never have to worry about breaking the carafe since it is not glass. I would highly recommend this Coffeemaker to everyone.
