review/summary: Effective but Very difficult to clean *BLACK MOLD*review/text: We bought our humidifier a little over a year ago. It is quiet, cute and effective. However despite our best effort to follow the manual recommendations for cleaning and maintenance, Black Mold is an issue. I can not clean the black mold from inside the tank, It is impossible to get it go away. I can no longer use our humidifier until I can figure out how to get the mold out, for fear of making our children sick. I will likely replace it with a different humidifier.
