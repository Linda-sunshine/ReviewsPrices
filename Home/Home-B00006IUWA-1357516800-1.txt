review/summary: Hmmm, popcorn a little stale...review/text: I don't remember the popcorn being stale when we used these as a kid (I am 43 now). Maybe my memory doesn't serve me correct as popcorn was popcorn back then and was happy to have it! We use the high quality Orville Reddenbacher kernels and the popcorn is quite stale...the popper is fun though and our son enjoys watching the popcorn pop!
