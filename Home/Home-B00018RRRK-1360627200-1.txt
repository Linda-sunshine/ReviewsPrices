review/summary: Great grinderreview/text: I find this grinder to be very good. The different adjustments are great for grinding to different sizes. It has a lot of power and looks sleek. I guess the only complaint is that i wish it was silent :) haha along with a silent vacuum. I really do love this grinder and have owned it for about 2 years now.
