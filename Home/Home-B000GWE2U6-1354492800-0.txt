review/summary: Adorable + humidity = this productreview/text: I use this lovely humidifier in my dorm room during the winter. It has a small footprint so it easily fits on my bureau. It has a nice long cord, too. It's easy to refill and has a good water capacity so it runs for many hours on one fill. The mist is fine and effective. Great product for a great price.It's also visually pleasing, especially fun for college students. :) My roommate has the monkey design and we both love our humidifiers!
