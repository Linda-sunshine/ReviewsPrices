review/summary: A noisy machinereview/text: The breadmaker was chosen after trying other companies' products over the years and reading that this was the best rated. We have so far used it twice. The instructions are clear and the finished products ( a white loaf and a brown loaf) have been very good. However, it takes much longer than other breadmakers we have used, up to an hour longer. But more notable is the noise. It is extremely noisy as it prepares the dough. It sounds as if the internal container is not properly set resulting in quite disturbing sounds. Perhaps it will mute with age.
