review/summary: It's actually too hotreview/text: I bought this to set my metal thermos on, hoping it would stay warm even longer. It does that pretty well, but it actually gets hotter than I want. I wish there were a setting on this, power level one, two, three, something like that.Don't get me wrong, it works (hence the four stars), but getting coffee very hot for a long time ruins the taste.
