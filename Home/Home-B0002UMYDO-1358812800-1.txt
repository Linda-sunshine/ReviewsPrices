review/summary: Better than any other electric can openerreview/text: I gave this 4 stars. It is well built, sturdy and easy to clean. The only reason it got 4 stars rather than 5 is that the lid edges are sharp and dangerous, which is inherent to this type of opener, I would suppose. If only they could figure out how to roll the edges of the lid like some safety hand held openers. I really got this for my 94 year young father so he could open cans when I am not home. It works well. It is easy to get cans started on this opener and It has a strong motor. I would buy this product again. It does everything it is supposed to do.
