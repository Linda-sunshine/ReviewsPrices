review/summary: It's good but the display was horrible.review/text: The knives themselves are fine. The block is of real wood and smells of read wood which I like. However, when I got package and I opened it...the knives weren't in a real box. It was a plain cardboard box with the block in bubble wrap and the knives in another plain cardboard box, wrapped in plastic. It's rather embarrassing giving that to someone for Christmas. Shipping was decent.
