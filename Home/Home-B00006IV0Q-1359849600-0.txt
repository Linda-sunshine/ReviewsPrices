review/summary: Great!!review/text: I purchased this because I love the look of yesteryear when things were designed to be elegant and functional. I am not a big coffee drinker, but many of my guests are.. so I needed something functional, that didn't take up much space and looked nice as well.This was the perfect combo!I get many compliments on the taste of the coffee -- and it's very fast!! Makes the coffee nice and hot, but not boiling.I do use the little disc filters available at my local grocery store since I can't always find coarse-grind coffee (which is what is recommended for percolators).The only thing I wish were different was that it had a glass bubble on top.. as watching the coffee perk is one of the "perks" (excuse the pun) of this type of coffee maker. However, most percolators on the market with the glass bubbles do not hold up well and the bubble are really plastic rather than glass.... so I'd much rather the classic black knob than some faulty pot with a cheap plastic bubble that may taint the taste of the coffee.This is an excellent product for a great price!!
