review/summary: Great for freezer jam or sending a cup of milk to school/workreview/text: Much easier to deal with than traditional two piece jar lids. Convenient for topping freezer jam. And ideal for sending a perfect cup of milk to work/school. Not a perfect air proof vacuum seal, but still good enough. Definitely fulfill the intent for which they were made. Cheaper and easier to get at your local grocery store, but after knee surgery I'm not driving and Amazon delivery is fabulous!
