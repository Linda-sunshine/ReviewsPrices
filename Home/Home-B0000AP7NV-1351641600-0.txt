review/summary: Good Value.review/text: Small, fashionable, & reliable pitcher. Perfect use for a single person on a budget. The filtered water you get from Brita is par as expensive bottle-water brands you buy at the store. The only minor annoyance is a frequent speck of carbon here and there between pitcher refills. The carbon specks tend to sink to the bottom of the pitcher. I find myself rinsing out the pitcher every few refills to remove them annoying little carbon specks. My Brita pitcher saves me $25. monthly compared to buying those little bottles of water at the store. Brita costs less than Pur water systems.Pros: Small, Fashionable, & reliable pitcher. Perfect for single people on a budget (Save up to $25. monthly).Cons: Frequent carbon specks that like to mingle at the bottom of the pitcher.
