review/summary: Nice HOT water!review/text: So far, this has been a great electric kettle. The water is nice and HOT. I use it every night. The only thing I miss on this unit is the fill level. Not a deal breaker but it would be nice if it had some marks on the inside to know how many cups you are making. I think I undershot it a few times.
