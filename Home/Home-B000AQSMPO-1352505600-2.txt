review/summary: Beware of your rebatereview/text: Keurig coffee makers, while popular, are not the best due to not using high quality inner workings, etc. That being said, when you buy one, Keurig will do their level best not to honor your rebate. I sent in all required parts of the rebate request, and they denied it anyway. They are dishonest, and they sell an inferior product compared to others. I will tell anyone who will listen what a pathetic company Keurig is.
