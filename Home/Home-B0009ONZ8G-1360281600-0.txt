review/summary: Hoover Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuum Baggedreview/text: Great vacuum for the price. Covers a wide area. Good suction. Tubes are plastic, so you have to stretch them out to get them to stay. On/off switch is down low on top of the bag cover. Electric cord is down towards the bottom, so you have to wrap it up around the top cord rung to prevent it from going under the vacuum.
