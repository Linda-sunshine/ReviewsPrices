review/summary: Good productreview/text: The water that comes out of this filter tastes very good. My only concern is that the first filter lasted just over a month. The filters are supposed to last about two months and since I live alone it is what I was expecting. Truth be told, Amazon gave me a discount on an order of four replacement filters and it came to one free one.
