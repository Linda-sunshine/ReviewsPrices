review/summary: Best coffee I've ever had, by a long shotreview/text: I bought myself the Aeropress a few days ago from a local coffee roaster, and I already know that this is the best coffee I'll ever drink. I can be a bit of a snob about drinks and I have a very discerning palate, and I've had some good coffee from some very good coffee shops. French press, pourover, moka pot, Turkish style--you name it, I've tried it. Pourover's generally been my favorite method because it really brings out the unique characteristics of each bean. But the Aeropress is something I haven't tried till now, and now I'm just asking myself why I didn't try it sooner. For my first brew I used the directions that came with the Aeropress, and it gave me a smoother cup of java that I thought was even possible. But I like a little bit of bite to my cup, so I've been experimenting with all sorts of alternative techniques. There's a ton of variables you can adjust with the Aeropress, so I think it's safe to say I'll have fun tweaking and perfecting my brew for a long time to come.As for the product itself: it's simple, it seems durable, very easy to clean. Doesn't win any style points, but even though it doesn't have the sex appeal of a French press or a glass pourover cone, the coffee it makes is incomparable.
