review/summary: Didn't come with calibration weight??review/text: I'm not quite sure if it doesn't come with a 500 gram calibration weight or if I just didnt get one..kind of sucks because without it being calibrated it really doesn't work...the things awesome..super small nice and accurate if you put something heavy on it but because its not calibrated I really cant measure out .1 or .2 grams of a substance because it just doesn't register...500g calibration weights are kindof expensive too. :(
