review/summary: Spoiled Christmas Griddle Giftreview/text: I have no idea how good this griddle is. I do know it was not shipped in a box, it just had a label slapped on the griddle box. The person I was going to give it to as a gift saw it. Thanks a lot, Amazon! DUH!!!!CHRISTMAS = GIFTS = SURPRISES (surprises are the general nature Christmas gifts)I would think any item bought the week before Christmas MIGHT BE a gift and it MIGHT BE appropriate to disguise it in...a brown box, no?!?! (shaking my head...)
