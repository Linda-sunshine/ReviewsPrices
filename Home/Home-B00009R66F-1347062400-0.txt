review/summary: Worth the moneyreview/text: This machine did really well on the sad-looking carpet that came with the apartment I'm renting. I would more than occasionally grumble that the carpet just needed to be thrown out because it was matted and filthy. It also looks like it is the standard cheap cream-colored carpet that comes with rentals, and that stuff has a short shelf life anyway. After spending the day cleaning with this machine, the carpet doesn't look new, but it looks pretty darn good. The matted crunchy sections are much improved and this machine took an amazing (but gross) amount of dirt out of the floor. So, I would say that this machine works very well, especially considering that it costs less than hiring a carpet cleaning service too!Now, for nitpicks. It is easy to make a mistake running this thing. For example, if the lid isn't clipped onto the waste water tank properly, the machine works but won't suck up any of the dirty water from the floor. It is also possible to run the machine with the clean water tank installed not quite all the way, which also causes problems. It would be nice if the machine had some kind of indicator (like a warning light) that said whether or not everything is clipped together properly. I am guessing from the other reviewers complaining about 'leaks' and the unit 'just stopped working' that this happens a lot.
