review/summary: Disappointingreview/text: I bought some of these today at a local store. They leak. I had bought them for 1/2 gallon sized jars to store home made coconut milk, along with buying quart sized jars to store home made broth, and the tiny "jelly" sized jars that I thought my daughter could take home made yogurt and other things to school in when needing individual sized jar. Well, put my coconut milk in tonight and went to get the container out of the fridge and had to shake it and coconut milk spilled out. Seems like they should come with a food safe "washer" like a thermos lid does, in order to make the lid seal better. I guess these jars/lids might be ok if you are using them to store hardware items like nails. But having so much air leaking in, I don't even want to store dry food goods in them since it would let air in and go stale. So disappointing. I don't even know if I can return these to the store, now that they are "used". I bought the plastic lids rather than using the metal ones, since the metal contains BPA. So not an option to switch back to the metal. I guess it's back to the drawing board with trying to find glass storage that doesn't also cost an arm and a leg.
