review/summary: Clean look, but rusty inside -- Not 100% stainless (Fasteners are steel - will rust)review/text: it is stainless, but needs you to wash/dry and maintain waterfree. Otherwise, spots, light rust appears. May not be 18/10 as it should have been - manufacturer take note, improve quality.
