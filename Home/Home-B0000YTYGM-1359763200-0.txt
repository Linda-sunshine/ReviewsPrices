review/summary: Good coffee not worth the mess it makes other timesreview/text: I've had this machine for just over a year. Had the carafe lid and filter basket replaced by Cuisinart once. Then had the whole machine replaced later, with an expense for shipping. Still having the same issue: the filter basket fills faster than it empties, creating an overflow that spills coffee and grounds on counter and floor. Not every time, but often enough to tell me to give up on this machine. I grind beans at a medium setting and/or use store-bought preground, so this should not be happening. A post to Cuisinart's Facebook page last year yielded zero response, even as Customer Service paid attention to the ones before and after it. I quit.
