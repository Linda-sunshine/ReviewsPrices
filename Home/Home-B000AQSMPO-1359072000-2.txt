review/summary: And we thought we had good coffee before we got this!review/text: We got this as a Christmas present and we have always used a regular coffee brewer. I have to tell you that this machine has changed the way we drink coffee. Because we can have a single cup of coffee in the middle of the day or in the evening without the mess and making a larger pot we are enjoying our coffee more often.We also now like our coffee stronger as the Keurig seems to make a stronger cup of coffee without the bitterness that we were experiencing with our other coffee pots. We are having fun trying different blends of coffee and trying out the different flavors. There are a lot of good ones out there.We got the special edition of the Keurig B60 that has the 60 ounce water tank and we like the extra capacity. We are using distilled water in our Keurig and we have found that we like the middle sized brewed cup for the flavor. Like I said, this brewer has changed the way we drink and enjoy coffee and we love it. It was a great gift. We rate it at 5 stars and recommend it to you.
