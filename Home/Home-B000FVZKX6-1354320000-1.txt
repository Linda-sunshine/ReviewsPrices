review/summary: wichita, ksreview/text: I was a little hesitant in ordering as they looked quite heavy and I feared they'd be too hot, but even w/our temperatures going from 20s to 40s at night they have been comfortable. They are very good quality, tightly woven. Velvet is a good description. On the initial washing/drying, the lint filter was very full, but the second was about half and there has been no pilling so far while using.
