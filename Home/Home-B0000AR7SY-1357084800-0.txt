review/summary: Best valuereview/text: I've read some reviews saying that it makes a mess (some coffee grinds do spill out), static issues, coffee stuck in the chute. Not to discount these issues but they are not a big deal. It take an entire hopper full to make even enough grinds to have to do any cleanup. I haven't had any static issues. And you can't beat the ability to fine-tune the grind. Compared to my fathers more expensive Bodum unit I would definitely recommend the Capresso 560.
