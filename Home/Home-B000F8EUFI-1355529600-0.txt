review/summary: SUCKS LIKE A DEVIL, COSTS A DEALreview/text: OK, I read all the rave reviews about the cannister sucking up masses of totally invisible dust and HOW did it ever find that much? So--the $ was great so I ordered it.The first time i used it, it sucked an entire canister of dust out of three large area rugs. SCARY.It is a pain in the butt to clean the canister after EVERY use and I worrry that it is 'shredding' the wool right off of my old rugs. (They are e bay good deals but 100% wool.)I AGREE with all the other reviewers: WHERE DOES ALL THE DIRT COME FROM?Know what I think?I think it REALLY came from Hell and the devil puts all that dust in there just to FREAK US OUT!Ha!Good sucking 2 U!I'll keep using it unless my rugs start going BALD. As I said, SCARY!Will update my review if that starts happening.Aloha!
