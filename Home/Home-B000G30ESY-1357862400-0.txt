review/summary: Still Blowing Me Away!review/text: This Rice Cooker is spendy, but amazing. I used to make my rice in a pot and couldn't see the point in spending the extra $$ on this tool, but after just a few days I realized how silly I'd been for so long. You throw the stuff in, push start, listen to a jingle and then get perfect fluffy rice every time! It also keeps it warm, without burning it for hours and hours.I'd buy again for sure!
