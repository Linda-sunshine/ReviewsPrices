review/summary: Does the jobreview/text: Does what it's supposed to do. I use this often and am glad I bought it. If I had a bigger room I would have opted for a wide, cushy glider that's easy to fall asleep on, but with limited space this was a great option. After four months I haven't had any problems with squeaking, and at 8 months pregnant it was pretty easy to put together. I do wish it were easier to fall asleep in, but if you're tired enough you'll find a couple padded blankets thrown over the back and a blanket over the lap with baby will be enough to fall asleep for a little while. Best of luck with your choice!
