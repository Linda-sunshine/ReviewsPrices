review/summary: We're Perking Nowreview/text: I bought this to replace my broken Faberware electric perk. The Presto was $15.00 cheaper and well reviewed so I gave it a shot. I loved my Faberware coffee in it's prime. The Presto has a lot to live up to. It does not dissapoint. Coffee is piping hot and robust. It keeps the coffee hot without burning it. Indicator light when ready, a nice touch. Pot seems solid and is pleasing to the eye. Love the long stem. If you are serious about a great cup of coffee, the Presto will deliver.
