review/summary: great juicer for the pricereview/text: I received this juicer as a gift on christmas. I was skeptical at first because of a few bad reviews concerning the food caught in the pour spout. So far I haven't had problems with that. I wash all the pieces right after I make juice and use a baby bottle brush to clean all the pieces. I use the nipple cleaner end of the brush to clean the spout that is "hard to clean". It works just fine. The motor is very good and the pulp is not too wet. It's very easy to pull apart, clean, and put it back together. The only thing that is an issue for me is the pulp trap is internal and I prefer it on the outside. The blade is strong and sharp, but the screen seems somewhat flimsy. It's shape is a bit awkward so it could take up a bit of space. Besides that i think it's a great buy for the price.
