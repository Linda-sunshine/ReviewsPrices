review/summary: A truly better product!review/text: There are so many alarm clocks, but this one stands out: TWO alarms can be set (we first need to wake up the kids and then ourselves again later). The operation is sooo easy, it's unbelievable how far Sony went to make it really quick and simple. The alarm sound is pleasant yet well audible and the radio as an alarm is great anyway. Clear recommendation.
