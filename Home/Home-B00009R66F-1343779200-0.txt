review/summary: Absolutely the worst piece of junkreview/text: I am super disappointed with the Hoover. First use, the spin brushes broke and after awhile, the water stopped sucking, leaving the dirty water tank EMPTY and the carpet dry. After getting replacement brushes from Hoover, THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN. Brushes broke while vacuuming. Do not buy this piece of junk. Wasted $100 and caused me many headaches. Furthermore, the vacuum is horrible at sucking and will stop using water after 1 use. Would NOT recommend!
