review/summary: very happy with itreview/text: As mentioned in other reviews, it displays Military time. I'm not experiencing flaking teflon but I've just started using it. I've cooked brown rice and steel cut oats and they come out perfect. I used the porridge setting with a 2.5-1 ratio of water to oats and for the brown rice I used the line in the bowl and the brown rice setting. The line in the bowl is the water level you fill it to, with the rice added to the bowl...I think.It does take longer than cooking it on the stove, but you don't have to baby-sit it. You just set it and forget it.
