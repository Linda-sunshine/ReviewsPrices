review/summary: Awesome little rice cookerreview/text: I bought this to replace my little Panasonic fuzzy logic rice cooker because this has a brown rice setting. I was found to have prediabetes and gave up white rice.I agree with all other reviewers about the features -- how well it cooks, the timer feature, its size and so on.My most positive opinion of this rice cooker is that it makes the BEST steel cut oatmeal when used on the porridge setting. I disagree with the manufacturers water/oats ratio. I use almost 4:1 ratio. Use all water and the timer and wake up to hot oatmeal. If you have the time to wait, you can make it with water and milk and it is oh, so creamy!For me, the small size is great.Bought it when it was a Gold Box deal and saved $$$$$$
