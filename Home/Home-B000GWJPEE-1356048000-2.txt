review/summary: mehreview/text: I bought one of these for my son (a red dragon version) and it's great. I love it. This Hello Kitty one though is rubbish. Sometimes we turn it on and it works, sometimes it doesn't and when it doesn't it makes this really loud whirring sound that wakes up the baby (and anyone in either of the rooms next to hers). It's done this since we got, we should have sent it back but never got around to it in time.
