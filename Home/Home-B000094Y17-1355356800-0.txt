review/summary: Put a lid on itreview/text: After reading many of the negative reviews, I decided to purchase this pitcher anyways. My girlfriend and I have been looking to upgrade to a larger filter. We both drink a lot of water each day and our slim filter just wasn't enough for us. There is no problem with slim, but it was simply too small for our needs.As most of you have seen by now, these larger pitchers seem to have a problem with the cover falling off. I have yet to see a problem with that. My slim pitcher never had this problem either. However, if for some reason it does, I would see no problem with placing a small piece of tape to prevent it from falling off.However, I am quite surprised that so many people would rate a product so poorly just because of a simple flaw. The filter does what it is built to do. I am saddened that people cannot simply remember to place their hand on the cover when pouring water out.Overall, this product is wonderful and I will continue using it with common sense.
