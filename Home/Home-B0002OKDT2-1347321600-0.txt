review/summary: I Love this Juicer!review/text: I used to have a Champion juicer, I thought it made great juice. The Omega J8005 blows it out of the water! The Omega makes great juice with low rpm, and can easily juice leafy greens.It's really easy to clean, and that makes it easier to make more juice. No-one will use a machine for long if it's a pain to clean. The Omega J8005 is super easy to assemble, use, take apart, and clean. I juice two or three times a day now.The only downside (if one can call it that), is that the items to be juiced need to be cut. But the ease of using the juicer, and knowing I am getting a high quality juice, negates the few minutes it takes to slice whatever it is I will be juicing.I only gave it four stars because of the need to slice what the items to be juiced, and because if the slices are not small enough the masticator seems to bend down from the machine a bit. I used to worry it was not attached to the juicer well enough, but if the items are sliced small enough, the juicer has no issue.The Omega J8005 is quiet, easy to use, make great juice, and is easy to clean. It doesn't get any better than that!Overall, I highly recommend this juicer!
