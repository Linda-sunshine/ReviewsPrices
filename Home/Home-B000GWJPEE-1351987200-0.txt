review/summary: Great at first...review/text: I bought this humidifier based on all of the great reviews. And for the first couple months, the humidifier worked great. Now unfortunately the red light continues to come on and the mist does not spray out. Apparently you have to exchange it within about a month of purchase, so I cannot exchange it. I don't know if I'd really recommend this or not since mine doesn't really work now.
