review/summary: Easy to usereview/text: I already love this juicer! It is super easy to use, as well as juicing every last drop out of whatever I put in the juicer. Carrots seem to be the most difficult - however if you slice them thinner, they will go through no problem. I timed the cleanup from when I stopped the juicer to when all was clean including the counter - 3.5 minutes. Whether or not you use a bag in the rinds catcher matters not as well. Just toss it in the trash and rinse out the container. I hope it lasts forever!!
