review/summary: Wonderfulreview/text: This is my first and will be my only pressure cooker, I've had it for over a month. I choose the 21 quart because I have recently started canning and wanted to graduate from jams and jellies to vegetables and stews. I am very proud of the jars I have created with my 921. On to everyday cooking, my first meal was a whole chicken, very little seasoning, not including the heat up and depressurizing time, it cooked in 20 min with 2 cups of water and it was delicious, total time maybe 45 mins. I've made spare ribs, cooked dried beans in minutes vs. hours. In my opinion, I have made the best cheesecake (cheesecake factory - watch out). The 6 wing nuts do need to be evenly tightened, and the 921 can be heavy and somewhat awkward to wash. I feel the pros far out weigh the cons. There is no rubber gasket that will deteriorate or need to be re-ordered. SAFETY FIRST!!! Read the manual, any questions, read it again. Anything heated up and under pressure deserves the upmost of respect. Because of the very minute cons and my new love of cooking and of course eating, I purchased the 910. Sorry, I lied in the beginning, I now have 2 pressure cookers. I want to cook like a chef every night.
