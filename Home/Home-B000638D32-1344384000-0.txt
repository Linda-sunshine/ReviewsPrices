review/summary: Only knife you needreview/text: With the exception of maybe a bread knife, this knife is really the only one you need. I love this knife so much that I got rid of my entire knife block. The edge stays very sharp, and I get nervous just touching my finger to it. Looking down the knife the edge is almost invisible. I get a lot of use out of this knife and the edge is still razor sharp.Make sure you get a good sharpening steel too and learn how to use it. Take care of this knife!
