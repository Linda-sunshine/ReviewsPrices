review/summary: Descale Message Won't Go Awayreview/text: I've had my Keurig for about 3 years. I loved the ease of making coffee and being able to change flavors. But for the past year all I see is the Descale message. I have tried everything to descale this machine. The message goes away for about a few cups then it's back again. When the message is showing, the machine will go through cycles where it only brews a 1/4 cup. So I have to "rebrew" to try to get a full cup. Then it will be stuck on a certain cup size and won't allow a selection. Other times it brews fine. But that message never goes away. From speaking with other owners, this is a common issue with the brewer. I purchased at Bed, Bath & Beyond, but I think it's beyond the timeframe to try to return. Time to start looking for another brewing system.
