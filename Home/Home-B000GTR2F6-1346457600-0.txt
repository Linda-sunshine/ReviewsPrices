review/summary: On my 4th Keurigreview/text: This is my 4th Keurig B70. Sounds as though I love them. Wrong. 3 stopped working within the warranty period and they were replaced by Keurig. No. 4 died this morning. It is out of warranty. The same thing happened to our daughter and son-in-law. They have had one replaced and the second one died 1 1/2 mos. after warranty. Keurig offered them a new brewer at 50% off retail. They opted to go with another brand. I am going back to a regular brewer. Good Bye Keurig. It is great while it works. Just hold your breath.
