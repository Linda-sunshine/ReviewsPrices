review/summary: Get it!review/text: This is my first cast iron Dutch oven. It really does make a difference in infusing flavors. Clean up was a breeze, though I admit I was a bit skeptical as I was browning the beef cubes for the stew. This was affordable, compared to some other brands, and the quality was great. I don't regret this purchase at all!
