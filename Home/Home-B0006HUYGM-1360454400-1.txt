review/summary: Great vacuumreview/text: This thing is awesome, it has a lot of suction and the fact that you can turn on just the suction, or the suction and the brushes is great. It comes with an attachment that lets you get into those tight spots, and the cord wraps nicely around the base. The filter is easy to remove and easy to clean as well. My one gripe is that the hose is a bit short, but for the size of the vacuum, that's expected. I would prefer this over a cordless one any day.
