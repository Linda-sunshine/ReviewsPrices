review/summary: You can't go wrong with this coffee makerreview/text: I had a previous version of this model before, and it lasted roughly 6 years. And considering how much I used it, I thought that was an excellent life span. I didn't have to think twice before buying this one to replace it. And I love that it's available in colors now! The only catch is that the box says &#34;Adjustable strength control&#34; I'm not sure what that refers to except that it has a button for when you're making 4 or less cups of coffee. The instruction manual doesn't say anything about that (strength control) function.
