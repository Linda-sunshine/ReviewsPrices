review/summary: Wow! Just what I was looking for!!review/text: I read other reviews on this coffeemaker and ultimately deciding to take matters in to my own hands, so I ordered it. I've been using it for over a week now and I have NOT ONE bad thing to say! Perfect. Just Perfect for my needs. What is funny is that I replaced my $179 broken Kuerig with this...Works just as great in my opinion and saves me money too because I'm not a heavy coffee drinker anyways! Great Product and highly recommended! (Writing this review while drinking a cup of coffee from it!)
