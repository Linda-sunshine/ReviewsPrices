review/summary: Dust everywherereview/text: I have used burr grinders for a number of years with many of the same complaints as others, especially the relatively short life span of the devices. However, the most egregious problem is the static electricity that it generated when I grind coffee. The result is that grounds cling to both the inside and outside of the grounds receptacle. The grounds even migrate to the outside of the unit itself.
