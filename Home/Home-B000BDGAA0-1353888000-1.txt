review/summary: Not for everyone, just takes getting use too.review/text: The more you use it, the softer it gets which is GOOD! You should use a larger pillow case as well so it can expand. I must admit, I do not get anymore migraines from sleeping on a pillow that is bad support for my neck and spine. This is very good if you get migraines. You just have to break it in, and it gets softer.
