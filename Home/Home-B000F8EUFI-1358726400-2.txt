review/summary: Really Sucks...review/text: I live in a studio apartment exactly the size of a 1 car garage. The floor is tile and sheet vinyl except one large area rug. This cute little mini vac does an excellent job, even picking up leaves that have fallen off my plants. The cord is plenty long and the canister easy to remove and empty. The only reason that I did not give this vacuum 5 stars is the hose. It works well but is very short. I tried to vacuum out my window tracks (standard height) but the hose was a bit short even with attachments. Over all a good vacuum for a small area.
