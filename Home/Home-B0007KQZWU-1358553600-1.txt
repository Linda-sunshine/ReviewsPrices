review/summary: A real Winnerreview/text: I was very pleased with the product. It takes less heat to boil water and less heat to saute and cook veggies and meat. The finishes are beautiful and it is easy to clean. The lids fit perfectly. The handles stay cool on the stove and the pots andhem pans have a good weight to them. I would recommmend these to any serious cook.
