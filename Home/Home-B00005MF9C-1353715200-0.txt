review/summary: Solid coffee makerreview/text: I am the only coffee drinker in the house. This is ideal for my one cup morning coffee. Its easy and makes a great cup of joe. I like the reusable filter and the solid cup construction. This is the 2nd unit that I've owned because the first one died on me. I called black & decker and they replaced the unit after my explanation. They wanted to charge shipping on the replacement, but I was able to talk them out of it. Overall, I'm very pleased with this product.
