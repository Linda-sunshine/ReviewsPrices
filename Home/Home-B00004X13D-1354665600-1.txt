review/summary: LOVE itreview/text: I love, love, LOVE this waffle maker! It's very reasonably priced and works GREAT. (Be sure you wait for the steam to die down before you open it, or the batter will want to stick to the plates.) It works beautifully, and we've used it at LEAST once a week since we bought it. I couldn't be happier!
