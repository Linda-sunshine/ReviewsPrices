review/summary: Lodge Color Dutch Oven, Island Spice Red, 6-Quartreview/text: Great pot. Lid fit securely. I was worried because the reviews were mixed, but mine arrived fast and in great shape. Have used it already a few times and has performed flawlessly. No chips, cracks, or stains. Its heavy and should be hand washed, but it is easy to clean. I have yet to have any food stuck to the bottom. Let the pot heat properly and never cool it too fast(put under cold water when hot) and this thing should last a long time.Would definitely recommend and would buy another Lodge product with no hesitation.
