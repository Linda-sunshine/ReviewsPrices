review/summary: Worked for my purposereview/text: I have an old grand piano that gets extremely cranky if it dries out and I am living in the Southwest. I didn't want to have to fill it every day so I put it on low/low setting and positioned the output to go under the piano. I can get two or three days out of a fill and I definitely notice a benefit in the rest of the house as there is no static when walking on the carpet. Make sure to invest in some sort of biocide as the bacteria has started eating holes in the wicking material and it gets smelly.
