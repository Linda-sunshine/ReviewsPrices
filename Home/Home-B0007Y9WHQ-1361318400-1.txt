review/summary: It's worth it!review/text: Don't let the "it's plastic" dissuade you from getting this. I was quite surprised to find that it's sturdy and the blades can handle hard vegetables. Now, all I want to do is "spiralize" all veggies. I'm giving it a 4 star rating because, who knows? it may break in 5 years, so I'm leaving room for the uncertain. Nevertheless, I'm glad I got it and recomend it.
