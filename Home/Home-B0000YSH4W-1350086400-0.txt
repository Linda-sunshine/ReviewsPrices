review/summary: The Giverreview/text: The Giver was a novel study book for my 6th grader son. I enjoyed the book very much as I had to read it and discuss it with my son, as he had so many questions about the society and it's inhabitants. My son is now grateful to live in a place where he actually can choose and decide for himself, make mistakes and learn from them. I applaud Jonas for having had the courage to take baby Gabriel away before he got"released". What a brave Jonas! I also enjoyed Gathering Blue and Messenger. I am now reading Son. I recommend parents to read this awesome book. ( will there someday be a movie based on the Giver, Lowrey?)
