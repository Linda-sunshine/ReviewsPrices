review/summary: Third One in About 15 Yearsreview/text: I would say on average these last about 5 years (used at least twice per day). For a product at this price I call that a rock solid performer. In addition, the grind is perfect and customizable. Just figure out how many seconds is your 'perfect' grind and your good to go. I like a coarser grind for the french press and my wife likes the more thorough espresso grind. No complaints from either of us. We've used it a few times for spices and it was fine but this is our main battle grinder and it never disappoints. I would also add it's slightly less messy than the others - I've used a variety of different grinders at friends and family's houses.
