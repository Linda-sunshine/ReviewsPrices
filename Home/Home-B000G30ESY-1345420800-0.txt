review/summary: Just what I was looking for! :)review/text: Im currently deployed in Afgahistan and was looking for a small, durable rice cooker/warmer to make whie rice. The size is perfect cause all I need is enough for myself and 1 other friend. It keeps the rice fresh and the timmer fuction is perfect.All I do is add the rice and water and set it before I wake up so that I have fresh rice for breakfast(I'm a type of person that can eat rice for every meal). The only thing I didnt like was the melody it plays and how loud the beepings are. I live in a tent with other people, and we have diffrent sleeping times, so it would be nice if there was an opition for silent mode. But hey, its not like everyones in my type of situation.I would recommend this to any bachelor or student.
