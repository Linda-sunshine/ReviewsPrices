review/summary: SUPER LOUD!review/text: I purchased this because my old twin bell clock broke; the buzzer alarm is quiet, but the radio one (volume is adjustable) is extremely loud!!! I'm a heavy sleeper and anti-morning person, but this clock manages to get the job done every morning (: Sometimes I have to be careful that I don't set the alarm too loud; I'm a college student living in a dorm, and this morning the alarm woke me up (I jumped and nearly fell out of bed) and both of my roommates! It's a little larger than I had envisioned, but it's understandable, since it's a radio also.
