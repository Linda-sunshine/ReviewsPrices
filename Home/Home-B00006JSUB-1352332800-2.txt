review/summary: great choice for my first cast iron skilletreview/text: After researching different cast iron skillets, I decided this one had the best reviews at the best price. I'm really glad I bought it! Even after the second time using it, my scrambled eggs came out great and everything scraped off the pan really easily. I followed the directions and wiped with a paper towel, reheated and applied a thin coat of vegetable oil. I recently purchased a $3 cleaning brush from the store to get a better clean. Otherwise, super easy to take care of.In terms of the size, this is definitely a big pan. It's good for making large meals (more than 2 people), baking large quantities of bread, medium sized pizza, etc. I just cook for me and my partner, so this actually turned out to be a bit larger than what I need on a daily basis, but it's still handy to have when we make pork cutlets or things that need more space. I also plan on purchasing the 10" to use everyday and have the 12" for larger meals. It is quite heavy, so if you have arthritis or joint problems, this could be a challenge- go for a smaller one. The 10" should still be sufficient to cook most meals.Overall, this is a must-have if you only rely on cast iron and are cooking for more than just yourself. I'll definitely be expanding my Lodge collection!
