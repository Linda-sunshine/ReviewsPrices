review/summary: Fantastic!review/text: Larger than expected... holds a jumbo bottle (or two regular size shampoo/conditioner bottles) on EACH side, a bar of soap in the middle and even has a hook for a razor. Very easy to hang and that sucker stays put! After a couple of months using the first, I bought two more for the other showers in the house. A great buy and a great product!
