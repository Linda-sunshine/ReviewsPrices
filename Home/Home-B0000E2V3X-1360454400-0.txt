review/summary: Very Nice Cast Ironreview/text: I wasn't sure what to expect when ordering the Pizza Pan. I was so surprised when I removed it from the box. WOW reaction!! It is large and looks to be beautifully made. I immediately washed it with warm water and a scrubber. Dried it well and reseasoned it in the oven using lard lightly rubbed on with a paper towel. I am not sure where I am going to store it but am sure glad I ordered it and cannot wait to make a pizza or bisquits on it. Thanks Lodge, this is a keeper.
