review/summary: Very happyreview/text: I am in love!! I am an owner of a Dyson. We have 2 sets of stairs that are nearly impossible to vacuum with the Dyson.The stairs have looked lousy for a while. I just used this Eureka and I can't believe what good suction it has. For the price this handheld is incredible. It does get somewhat heavy. It is also perfect for vacuuming around the baseboards.It also sucked the dust off of the baseboards. I am thrilled
