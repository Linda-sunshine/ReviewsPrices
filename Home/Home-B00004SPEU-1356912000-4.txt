review/summary: Good grinderreview/text: I already had one of these, and I needed one for work, so I bought a second one. $20 is a pretty good price for this grinder, I've had the first one for several years now and it's still running strong. Easy to clean. I put the beans in the plastic lid first, then I attach the body to the lid while it's upside-down. This is to make it easier to attach the two, otherwise, it you put the beans in the body first, you have to jiggle it to get the beans out of the way of the lid when attaching it. I know that probably made no sense at all.
