review/summary: Not worth the money!review/text: I had very high hopes for this product and was let down miserably. I feel very little difference. My comfort level has not changed. I don't believe it is 2in thick either. I saw a 4 in thick memory foam topper at Walmart for nearly the same price. A few dollars less in fact! Save your money!
