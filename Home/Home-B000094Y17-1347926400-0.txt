review/summary: It is BIG and bulky. Watch out; you will spill the water!review/text: I got this as we recently moved to a new house and our RO system has not been installed yet. I despise bottled water so I decide to get a Brita pitcher. Well, I did not think how big this is when I bought it. It is really BIG and takes a lot of space in the fridge. Also, it is tall so I can only put it on the top shelf. Now the problem is that when the pitcher is full, it is quite heavy so you need to be careful when you are taking it out of the fridge as you can easily spill the water. Maybe I should think it is my arm strengthening tool!As for the quality of the water, it gets the job done; it tastes much better than the water out of the faucet.But, I will definitely go back to the RO system for its convenience and ease of use. It is expensive but it is worth the money as I can have good tasting, clean water without creating more landfills.
