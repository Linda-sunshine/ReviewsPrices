review/summary: Three Months Of Use - Three Mattresses - Same Resultsreview/text: Purchased the Wenzel mattress and returned two times. Used it for for two relatives (n=2) who had to sleep on this product when they unexpectedly had to vacate their residence (and live with us). They are not heavy people. The mattress is a great concept, but it loses approximately 25% of air every night. Consequently, we had to add air before bedtime each and every day. By 8:00 AM every morning, the mattress was considerably softer (less air) than the night before. Within two nights, the air was half way depleted in each and every unit. Returned the mattress twice for replacements and had the same problem with each one. Every time, customer service was very helpful, but it became a pain to ship defective units back to the manufacturer.We didn't have the same issue of the mattress feeling "cold" as some other reviewers note. The third and final mattress found a home in a local dumpster as we could not give it to a homeless shelter due to the air leaking issue. Perhaps we got a bad production run?We finally purchased an air mattress from LL Bean and didn't have an issue.The Wenzel mattress grips the floor well (does not slip) and accommodates a queen mattress protector and queen sheets well. If it held air for longer than a night, it would be great. Unfortunately, it's not and we do not recommend purchase having owned three units.There is a reason this is currently being sold as the deal of the day on Woot.com (Amazon's worse of the worse graveyard).
