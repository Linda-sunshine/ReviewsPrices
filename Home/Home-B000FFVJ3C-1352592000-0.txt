review/summary: waste of electricity and timereview/text: After days of drying the herbs they were not dry. The product to me is a waste of time and electricity. After storing the product in air tight containers I ended up throwing most of them out because of a light mold,hence not dry. Herbs you do better putting them in a paper bag faster, easier and less expensive.Nesco FD-75PR 700-Watt Food Dehydrator
