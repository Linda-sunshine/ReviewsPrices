review/summary: Very nice, but I had one problemreview/text: This is a very nice set. However, I had a pot that didn't sit down flat. It wobbled. When I contacted Cuisinart they said I'd have to ship it in and pay for the shipping myself. Wish they'd have an option making it easier on me so I don't have to pay $20 shipping a factory defective heavy pot when I've already paid over $200 for the set.
