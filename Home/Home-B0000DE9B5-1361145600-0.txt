review/summary: Looks nice but the lid doesnt fitreview/text: Looks nice. I like the square shaped base. However, the lid does not fit. It's supposed to increase in diameter when twisted so that the rubber seal will push tightly around the mouth, but even at the widest setting it doesnt come close to fitting properly. So the lid is basically useless except for keeping bugs out.
