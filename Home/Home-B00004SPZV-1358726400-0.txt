review/summary: Perfect controlreview/text: The Misto Gourmet Olive Oil Sprayer allows you to evenly distribute oils on breads with the control that is lacked when you are simply drizzling or pouring it. It also works well for coating skillets before cooking and allows conscientious consumption. Be aware that the spray comes out a little spattery. Remember that this is a hand pump and you must place the sprayer directly on the counter when pumping. I like this product much better than prepacked spray oils. Terrific investment!
