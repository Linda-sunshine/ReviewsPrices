review/summary: Comfortable to hold, could be stronger.review/text: I have small hands but this fits comfortably and is not to heavy for a long job. The first thing I did was steam my drapes, which have been wrinkled from day one. I wish the steamer were more powerful; sometimes it did not seem as if any steam was coming out, and I had to go over some spots more than once. Actually lightly pressing the steamer to the drapes is what finally got the job done.I also used it on my bathtub and shower curtain. It got some gross stuff at the bottom of the tub loosened up so I could get it up-nothing else has been able to get it off.
