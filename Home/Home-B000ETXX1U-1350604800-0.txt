review/summary: Superior Comfortreview/text: For an airbed to provide the level of comfort this bed gives and the quality of construction and built-in pump this one is a sure winner.Using an airbed as a permanent replacement of the standard matress setup is my goal and so far I've only needed to add air once and surprisingly it's extremely easy to get out of the bed without falling out of it.
