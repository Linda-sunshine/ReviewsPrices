review/summary: Fast and reliablereview/text: We've had this kettle for 6 years now and it's still going strong. During the colder months I use it daily to make tea or other hot beverages. I had a little water deposit build up from where we used to live, and just boiled it with a solution of vinegar and water and it disappeared after that and never came back with our new location's water. Yes it's not as good looking as a nice stainless one, but I'm not planning on getting a new one until this puppy dies. It's a great price and I think we paid ~$20 originally for it, so now it's an ever better deal.
