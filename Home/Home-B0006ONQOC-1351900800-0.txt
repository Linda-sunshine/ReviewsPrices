review/summary: It's okayreview/text: I have two freezers. Neither of them are cold enough to completly freeze the freezer bowl. Luckily, I have a spare fridge in my basement we start up for family gatherings at holidays etc. and I turned it very cold to freeze the freezer bowl. I have made ice cream twice now. Both times it failed the first time and I had to refridgerate the ice cream mixture while I re-froze the freezer bowl. Next time I'll try to keep it in the extra cold freezer for a few days before I try it. I love the ice cream once it's made. If you buy this product, good luck.
