review/summary: I like it, but I'm not a juicing kind of girl.....review/text: The clean up is pretty easy, it's a powerful juicer....Well at least it sounds like it. I've juiced whole apples, carrots, pomegranates, romaine lettuce.... I like juicing with it, but I don't do it often, I don't like throwing away pulp and I've yet to learn how to make crackers out of it. Debating if I should give it away, it looks so pretty on my counter and I like using it to juice things like dandelion greens yuck! lol
