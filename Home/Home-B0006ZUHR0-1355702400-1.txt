review/summary: Great iron for the price!review/text: Bought this iron last week after reading the thousands of positive reviews, and fell in love with it in the first use itself!!! In fact I am now looking forward to my ironing sessions! Black & Decker designers have obviously thought well and built a wonderful product. The iron looks great and works greater! Some minor improvements in design could be that the temperature setting always defaults at 1 when we plug the iron in (Which is for Acrylic - Lowest temperature) and then we have to get to the desired temperature by multiple pressings of the temperature setting button (which of course is very quick to do). Since most of us use cottons, they could have put the default temperature setting at 6 (Or maybe even 5). I did not see any issues with the water tank cover that was pointed out in some earlier reviews. The stainless steel sole plate is of good quality and glides smoothly through the fabric. With the water tank full, the iron weighs slightly on the heavier side, but that does not feel uncomfortable at all. I feel the slightly heavy weight gives a better ironing quality and you don't have to make multiple passes to remove tough wrinkles. I also love the steam burst functionality this iron has. Overall a great product and highly recommend anyone wanting to buy a new iron.
