review/summary: What I think of my new presto skilletreview/text: My husband ordered this item for me as a Christmas Present. I used it once to made lst bacon, then home fries andlastly eggs. I like it and was so happy to only dirty one pan. However, I think he should have gotten a smaller size as we are a family of two. But I really think I will like using this skillet.....
