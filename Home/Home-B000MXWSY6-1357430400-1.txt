review/summary: nice and inexpensivereview/text: Inexpensive and nice. Like the feature of having dual alarms as well as that it keeps the right time after a power outage (which we have frequently!). I like the radio alarm. The ONLY issue I would say is worth mentioning is that the light is quite bright. Being a chronic insomniac, the light is an issue. I block the screen with a pillow, otherwise, it does tend to light up the room too much for me. So if you are sensitive to light during sleep, just beware before purchasing.
