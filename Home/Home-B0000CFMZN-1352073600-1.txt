review/summary: buyer bewarereview/text: After I received this 1 QT pyrex measuring cup, I foolishly did not use it right away.Months later, when I finally did use it, I discovered there was something wrong with the pouring-spout-part. It is extra small and does not allow for pouring!Imagine my surprise when I tried to fill up another container with the contents of the Pyrex measuring cup. Instead of being able to pour into the other jar, it ended up all over the counter.Literally.Since Amazon will not allow for returns, I will contact Pyrex directly.But really? How did they screw up such a simple thing?Compared to my older measuring cups, this was a waste of time and money.
