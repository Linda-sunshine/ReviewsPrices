review/summary: Pretty but Uselessreview/text: I bought this scale based on all the great reviews it was getting. I failed to read the bad ones, and here I am writing one now. At first, I thought I was going nuts because it was showing that I had gained 5 lbs over one weekend. Everyone cheats in their diet- but not to cause a 5lb weight gain, especially when you are active. So I decided to check my weight daily - and again, it was a 2-5lb difference every day. This morning, I decided to get on and off several times and see if there's a difference. I went from losing 2 lbs, to gaining 5 lbs, to losing 4 lbs all in the matter of 5 minutes. The readings aren't accurate from one minute to the next, and I should trust it weekly? I will be finding a way to return this product, becuase it's useless.
