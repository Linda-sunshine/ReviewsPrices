review/summary: Cup @ a time coffee maker!review/text: This is my 3rd coffee maker that I've bought in 18 yrs. & enjoyed using it every day. The taste it perks is not only fresh but healthy. I use the older filter because it has the blend of it rather than a new filter taste.Yes the filter last for a very long time.I don't care for the mug;I'd rather use a ceramic cup.The filter holder I made the hole a little wider so the water won't back up in the filter which causes the coffee grounds to spill into the cup.I'm enjoying a cup right now as I write yhis review.
