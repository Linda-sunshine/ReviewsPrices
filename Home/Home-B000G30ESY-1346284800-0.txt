review/summary: Great cooker just like Japanreview/text: I have been to Japan many times. The secret to authentic white or Japanese white rice is quality rice and as my Japanese friend says "you must wash your rice at least 6 -7 times before you cook it".Now here is the secret. Put the rice in the bowl and fill half full with fresh water then swish round a few seconds with very clean hands.You will see the water turns the color of milk! pour off milky colored water and repeat at least 5-6 more times till water runs mostly clear.You will see you will get much nicer and more authentic rice.So enjoy.
