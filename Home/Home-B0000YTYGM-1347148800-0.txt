review/summary: brewer thermosreview/text: This unit is quite different from any other I have owned. All of my other coffee brewers apply heat to the pot for as long as I wanted coffee. By the last cup of the pot my coffee was over heated and rattie. This unit depends on insulation to keep the coffee hot and doesn't keep applying heat to the pot. My last cup from the pot tastes as good as the first. I do, however, have to pop the last cup or cups in the microwave, but the coffee is still good.
