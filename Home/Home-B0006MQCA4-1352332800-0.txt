review/summary: Very Satisfied Over the Yearsreview/text: I've owned this water system for 4 years and I'm very satisfied with the performance. I drink 46oz each day and find that the filter lasts about 6 months at that rate. The yearly upkeep is around $14 so it's a great value compared to other units. I have not had any problems with the spout or the construction of the item and would reccommend it to anyone that needs a filtration system that doesn't already have one on their fridge. I would definately purchase this item again if mine ever broke.
