review/summary: great product! go paleo!review/text: great for making zucchini noodles. takes 3 seconds and very easy clean up. haven't much used the other blades yet but am really happy i bought it! i mostly just rinse when i'm done with it, but have put it in the dish washer a couple times. would certainly recommend this! also makes great cucumber noodles. :)
