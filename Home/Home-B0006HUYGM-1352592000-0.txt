review/summary: Working great, worth the price.review/text: I bought this a few months ago, and it has worked extremely well cleaning pet hair and regular dust and dirt. It works especially well on the couch, but we actually used it in place of a vacuum for awhile, which I don't recommend since it's so small, but it was effective. Very powerful for the size. It is a little heavy if you have to lift it (like to run it along the seat cushions of the couch) but not terribly so. Definitely a good pick.
