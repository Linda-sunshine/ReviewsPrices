review/summary: Works, but Slowly.review/text: After about a week I can safely say that the kettle works quite well. It is very easy to use, automatically shuts off when the water boils, and allows for easy pouring. My only complaint is that it is slower than other kettles I have used. However, the kettle still heats a good deal faster than my stove. When filled to the top line, it takes about three minutes to boil, which is not bad, but keeps me waiting longer than I would like. Overall, it is not top-of-the-line, but certainly good for the price.
