review/summary: Small and accurate.review/text: I bought this scale for weighing hops, chemicals, and other small items for home brewing beer. For the price, this little scale is perfect. It's nice having precise amounts when brewing and this scale serves that purpose. Having the accuracy of 1/10 of a gram on this scale is great. The scale is ultra compact and seems pretty durable. Very happy with it.
