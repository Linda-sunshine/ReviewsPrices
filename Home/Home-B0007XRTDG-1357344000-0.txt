review/summary: Great skillet!review/text: I love this skilet. I'm not sure if it's because it's a skillet or the brand but I use it all the time. It's easily stored a big thing with me. I do notice that the skrews holding the handles and base together come loose alot,(thus the 4 stars) however, it never deters me from using the skillet. I would purchase another one.
