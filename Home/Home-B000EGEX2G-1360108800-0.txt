review/summary: Nice glider for daily usereview/text: I've owned and used this glider for a little over a year. It was easy to put together even when very pregnant. It has been comfortable for a basic cushioned glider and ottoman set. The pouches on side have been handy for keeping burp cloths and favorite bedtime stories close by. We haven't experienced any squeaks or other annoying noises developing with use. It still glides quietly after a year of daily use. I do notice that the bottom cushion isn't very thick which can be hard on the bum after sitting extended duration for feeding/rocking/reading. The bottom cushion will probably need to be replaced if we plan to continue use with another child.
