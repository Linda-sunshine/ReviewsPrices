review/summary: Great for a couple of monthsreview/text: I bought this vacuum cleaner because of the high ratings and great price. It worked wonderfully at first, but soon began to lose steam. I took it in for repairs (which cost about the same as buying it originally). Since then its been okay, but not great.
