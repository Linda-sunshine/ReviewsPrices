review/summary: Office Harmonyreview/text: The office where I work has a "coffee club" which means for a set monthly price you get generic watered down coffee. Nope, that is not going to work. So in a workers revolt, a Keurig B60 Special Edition was purchased.To say that I love this machine is an understatement. Easy setup, ease of use, automatic shut off which make the safety team happy, 48-ounce removable water reservoir holds up to eight cups of water which is no problem because the "water club" and filtered water is literally two steps away. It is true, we seem to have a "club" for everything.The three size options work perfectly for our group. This way you can have the coffee as strong (or weak) as you would like. No more arguing over who used too many grounds and who will now be up all night because decaf is not an option. Really, you would think grown adults could learn to compromise.Finally, one less thing to complain about and now our conversations can move onto the more important things like - pens. No really, it is amazing how fussy people can be about writing instruments.Huh, maybe decaf would be a better option.
