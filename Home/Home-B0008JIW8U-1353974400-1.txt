review/summary: Poor coffee, smaller than advertised capacityreview/text: I bought this coffee maker to replace a Melitta 4 cup coffee maker that had literally worn out; the filter and lid were falling apart. What a disappointment this coffee maker is. The capacity is listed as 4 cups. I understand that's meant to be 6 oz cups, not 8 oz cups, but it doesn't even make that much coffee. My old 4 cup coffee maker made enough coffee for 2 12 oz mugs. This one makes a total of 2.5 8 oz cups, which isn't even enough for 2 mugs of coffee. Plus the quality of the coffee was poor. I'd been using a cone-shaped filter. This is the basket type and the flavor and strength is much weaker. The result, I just bought a larger Melitta coffee makerMelitta 46894 10-Cup Thermal Coffeemaker. I know from past experience, that I will be able to depend on the Melitta. This was a waste of money.
