review/summary: Value at it's bestreview/text: I've been using this Expresso Maker for two (2) years now at least four (4) times a week and so far it's been problem free (need to consider that in my country energy service is not 100% reliable. it's easy to use, makes a strong expresso (that's how i like it). easy to clean. best you can get for your buck. i am buying a second one for my mother's house.
