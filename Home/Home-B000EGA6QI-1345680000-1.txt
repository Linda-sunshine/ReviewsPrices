review/summary: Handy - I've used mine over a year now.review/text: I've had this gadget for over a year now, and I love it. While I don't use it every day, or necessarily every week, it has been a wonderful kitchen tool. I have a TINY kitchen and I love to cook, so this doubles as my blender and juicer (if you like the fiber in your juice, which personally, I do), and takes up no kitchen space to speak of. It is good for making blended soups, purees, sauces and such. I do chop things up before adding, probably more than I would for a regular blender, but it's not strenuous. Its only fail has been mayonnaise, but I was only attempting to make a small amount -- I think a larger amount would work, so long as the user has a way to pour the oil in sloooowly. (You'd have to stabilize the cup or whatever you were making mayo in, use one hand to operate the SmartStick, and the other to pour the oil. Or get a friend to pour the oil...)This is supremely easy to clean! I put water/soapy water into a mug, and run the SmartStick in it, changing the water at least once. Then I UNPLUG it before wiping the blade gently for any residues.One of my best minor investments, ever.
