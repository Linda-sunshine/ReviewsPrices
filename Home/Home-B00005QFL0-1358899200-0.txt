review/summary: Panasonic SD-YD250 Bread Makerreview/text: I am very happy with this bread maker. I had a Panasonic several years ago. Then I bought a different brand and never liked it as well, so I have been happy to replace it with this new SD-YD250 model Panasonic. I would recommend this bread maker to anyone, looking for an inexpensive bread maker.
