review/summary: Analogreview/text: Interfaces, dials, knobs are very classical and analog, but I like it.Pros:- A backup battery keeps all the settings and clocks even if it's unplugged.- Clock display is big and easy to read at night.Cons:- Radio quality is mediocre; a bit choppy signal reception, old fashioned tuner, and low quality speaker- This can be made more compact. I don't have much complaint about the size though, it's bulkier than what it can do.
