review/summary: Best ice crusher out there!review/text: I did a lot of research before i bought this blender. I had a KitchenAid before (from 2002 or thereabouts) and it was pretty good. I have used an Oster (good but not great) and a Waring (basically worthless). I was on a mission to make Frappuccinos, and I wanted a blender that could handle ice properly - I think that is the test of a blender. Finally, after watching some very useful product-comparison videos and reading a lot of consumer reviews here and there, I took the plunge and bought this (in beautiful Cinnamon Gloss).I have used it two or three times a day for the three + months since I got it and I have one word for it - awesome! It handles ice just wonderfully and I have been able to create a delicious, easy 45-calorie frappuccino recipe. Those home-made frappuccinos got me through the hideous heat of this summer.The feature that sets this apart is the Ice Crush button that basically stops and starts the machine - mimicking what I used to do with lesser blenders, to get the ice cubes to meet the blades instead of sitting atop them as they whir around. The base is heavy and holds the blender in place, although there is a lot of power to the Ice Crush function. A friend saw this in action and was just amazed.It is very easy to clean and of course it is KitchenAid beautiful.In short, one of my fav and best purchases. Not a bit of regret.
