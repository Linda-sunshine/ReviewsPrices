review/summary: Works like gangbustersreview/text: One of my relatives had one of these things and I thought they were a gimmick. Finally convinced to get one, I use it just about every day from making Pizzas (usually home made crust), quesadillas, french toast, egg rolls, buiscits, pigs in blanket. I also have started using it to reheat food as Im beginning to question the safety of using the Microwave. Excellent product, highly recommend!
