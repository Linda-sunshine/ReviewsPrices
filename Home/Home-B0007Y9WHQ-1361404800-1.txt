review/summary: Amazingreview/text: so easy to use, cleans up really fast, wash right away and there are no stains. I love it for zoodles - zucchini made into long thin ropes - perfect in place of pasta!! hardly any waste at all - just the seeds in the middle which you can throw in the pan or give it to the dogs as a treat :-)
