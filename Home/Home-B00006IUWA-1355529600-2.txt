review/summary: What could go wrong?review/text: What could go wrong with an appliance that's just a heating element and a fan? Well, Presto has found a way.I got maybe 15 pops out of one I bought a year ago. I replaced it - identical model, fool that I am, but it was the only affordable popper on Amazon - and it got only one pop. I had to make it on the stove the old-fashioned way that nightThe popper I replaced about a year ago had worked about five years. It was a Presto, too. But one night it got over-enthusiastic and jumped off the kitchen counter. Shattered the lid, it did.We really like air-popped popcorn. Eat it maybe once a month. I guess I'll try a Discount Tommy's popper next. As for the Presto company: Watch me disappear - PRESTO!!!
