review/summary: It's a Steal for the pricereview/text: It's not perfect, like some said, it does pop the toasts in the air when taken out mid toasting, but once it happens u be careful the next time and for the price, it's awesome. Does everything u need a toaster/oven to do! I'd recommend a friend to get it.
