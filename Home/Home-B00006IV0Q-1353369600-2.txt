review/summary: Love It!review/text: I love this percolator. I think that it makes a superb cup of coffee. I prefer it to the drip type coffee makers. I have both now and I really think the percolator coffee tastes better. The only thing I do not like is that the water level makers are on the inside of the pot. It's hard to see. I wish they would have marked it on the outside but other then that, I am very satisfied. And I bought it through Amazon Warehouse Deals for less then $30 bucks!
