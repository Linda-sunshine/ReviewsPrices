review/summary: Cord issuereview/text: Plugged it in to do some pre-boil to get rid of the plastic smell (I expected a couple of boils would get rid of the smell). I plugged it in again for the second boil and could not get the switch to go on. Manipulated the cord and the switch finally came on but moving the pot caused the switch to go off again. I am 250 pounds and I have the strenth to push a cord on but it did not make a difference. I have to gently massage the connection to get it to work. Returning! Ordering a Hamilton Beach Ensemble Cord Free Pouring Kettle instead. Twice the price but a 5 star review. Glad I order from Amazon.
