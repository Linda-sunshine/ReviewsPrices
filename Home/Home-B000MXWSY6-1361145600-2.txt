review/summary: Great Alarm clockreview/text: This thing gets great radio reception in a place where I've always had a hard time picking up a signal. It also has an excellent button interface that makes it extremely easy and intuitive to set both alarms. It also features an internal battery so you can unplug it and move it across the house, or the power can go out for a couple of hours and you don't have to re-set it. For a simple radio alarm clock I can't imagine how it could get much better.
