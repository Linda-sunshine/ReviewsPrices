review/summary: Boils Water Faster than a Stove-top Kettlereview/text: For some reason, I don't think I'd ever seen one of these used until I moved to the UK for four months to stay with my GF. When I found out I could boil water for tea and food in half the time compared to using a stove-top kettle, I knew I had to introduce the electric kettle to my tea-drinking, water-boiling family in the US.My grandmother's a pretty stuck-in-her-ways person and has used a stove-top kettle her entire life. When I told her about electric kettles, she disregarded how great I said they were, but when I received this item and actually showed her how quick it boils water - she stopped using the stove-top kettle and started using this.This item works great, is good quality, and has lasted for over three months of daily use, multiple times a day!Here's a tip: when boiling veggies, put a little bit of water in your pot and boil on the stove, while boiling a full kettle of water in this item. By the time this item is done boiling the water inside it, the water in the pot will be boiling too. Pour boiling electric kettle water into pot and - VOILA - you have a full pot of boiling water on the stove in less than half the time of boiling it all on the stove at once.
