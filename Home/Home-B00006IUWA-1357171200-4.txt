review/summary: A lot of unpopped Kernelsreview/text: Part of me says, &#34;what did you expect for $20.00?&#34; Another part says the 2 tablespoons of unpopped kernels that I had after a 1/4 c of kernels was put into the machine doesn't make this a very effective popping tool. A little deeper popping well would have done the trick, I think. There's got to be a better product out there for the popcorn enthusiast.
