review/summary: Handy Little Gadget!review/text: This is actually a replacement...I'd had one for about 10 years that I used more often than I realized until it broke. It gets used for the obvious chopping, making sauces, dressings, dips and spreads from leftovers. It's size makes it handier to use and clean than the blender.
