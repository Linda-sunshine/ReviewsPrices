review/summary: Great for eggs and pancakesreview/text: First off this item is heavy, there is nothing cheap about it so just be careful not to drop it on your foot or the floor for that matter. As far as cooking goes I find it great for fried eggs, pancakes and even a quick burgher. It heats up quickly and stays hot so remember that when grabbing the handle even after it's been off the burner for a while. It also cleans up nicely which of course is important. The first time you use this item be sure to follow the enclosed instructions referring to using a drop of oil before cooking. Actually make sure you use a few drops, make that "quite a few drops" or you'll be scraping your stuck egg off the griddle like someone I know. "Pre-seasoned" or not I use spray oil every time I use this item just to make sure I don't have any sticking problems. So aside from my first attempt at cooking an egg (yes it was me) I really do like this griddle very much and have no problem recommending it to anyone. Just remember, heavy, hot, and use some oil and I'm sure you'll come to enjoy this griddle as much as I do.
