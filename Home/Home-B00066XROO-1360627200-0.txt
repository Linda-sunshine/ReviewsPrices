review/summary: Uneven heating and lost non-stick propertyreview/text: We just threw away this griddle after using it about 3 years. The fact it lasted three years may mean I should rate it higher, but throughout that time it heated unevenly and gradually lost its non-stick property. Cooking spray became a requirement for use, and it takes a lot of spray to cover the surface of this thing. Like other reviewers note, pancakes cook quicker around the edges than in the middle. Going to try a different brand, I wonder if I'll continue pouring the batter for the middle pancake first...
