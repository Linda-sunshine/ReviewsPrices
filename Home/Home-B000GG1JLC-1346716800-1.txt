review/summary: It is okay but cheap madereview/text: I should know, you get what you bought for. I was getting it for dad ties at first. I was thinking "come on, all his ties are expensive and heavy , it will not be able to hold on plastic, that is why he had wooden hanger orginally " I got him walnut hanger . I only bought it to use my belts hanging , mistake it fall or almost broken plastic hanger. It is really weak. if anything you planning hang , is like 5lb or at least--- don't think about it. It only can hold up lite feather scarf if not too much (roomy) . I really want use belts because I have a lot of them so trick is to put about 5 of them once at a time. Make sure it is not "rocking the boat to fall" then I put other belt on seperated hanger (lighter belt) It is all about balance.Be sure you don't use bigger or heavier belt on it. For example, WWC BELT is probably made out of Metal, don't hang it up on that one. It is only meant for simple tasks. Want heavy items hanging? Try wooden hanger --it may be pricey but try walnut finished hanger or metal hanger.
