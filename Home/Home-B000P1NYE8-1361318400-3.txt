review/summary: I bought this as a Christmas gift.review/text: I purchased this scale as a gift, so I don't really know a lot about it. I did open the package to test it out for accuracy, and they were dead on! They seemed well made, and the price can't be beat. My brother was happy with it and that's all that matters. He told me they are still working fine. I will probably be purchasing more of these for friends in the near future.I would recommend these to anyone looking for an affordable scale!
