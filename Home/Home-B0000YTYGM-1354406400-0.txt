review/summary: I would not reccomend this coffee maker.review/text: I liked the styling of this cofee maker but have given it a low rating due to the consistency of the coffee it brews. A couple of times when I have programmed a time to brew automatically it seems not to heat the water hot enough and it ends up brewing weak coffee. Other times it seems to work ok but not consitently. I would have expected a better quality product from Cuisinart.I would not reccomend this coffee maker.
