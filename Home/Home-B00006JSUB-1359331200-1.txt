review/summary: Lodge 12&#34; reviewreview/text: I often cook ground beef type meals in bulk and freeze for later use. This 12&#34; skillet is perfect for 2 pounds of 80/20. I will purchase a larger one soon as I prefer to cook 3-4lbs at a time. I find this 12&#34; size is perfect for a homemade pineapple upside down cake, no sugar overflow and cake rises just to the top.
