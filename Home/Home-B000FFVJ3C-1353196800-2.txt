review/summary: Well done dehydratorreview/text: This Nesco Dehydrator is pretty good. It works well, operates quietly, and produces pretty consistent results.PROS:Comes with 5 trays, and some nice added accessories like the &#34;fruit roll up&#34; tray, and a solid recipe bookIt works well, and is quiet.Nice adjustable temp guide.CONS:Fruit has to be relatively small to actually dry well without getting hard or crunchy on the outside. (half inch pieces, not really meant for a chunk or slice of dried fruit, unless I have no idea what I'm doing!)Takes a solid amount of time to dry anything, a bit more than some others do.Overall, I am moderately happy with this unit. If you are planning on drying fruit or veggies on a very regular basis, you may want to look into a slightly higher end model
