review/summary: Blade dulls- as with any brandreview/text: This product works great, convenient and does what it should. I considered upgraded brands that may have a few more features but that didn't make sense as you will need to replace when the blade dulls, as with any of them.Glad it's not a big investment; great value for what it does. I hate chopping onions so it's worth it's weight in gold and more importantly, worth the space it takes up in the kitchen, which is precious!
