review/summary: Awesome! Saved me $$$!review/text: I was on the cusp of buying a whole new knife set because they were getting dull and not holding an edge. Plus it was taking way too much time to sharpen them myself manually. So I thought, let me try this ting out. For the price, you can't go wrong. It basically reconditioned all of my consumer-grade chef/cooking knives and steak knives. They are now razor sharp and holding up quite well needing re-sharpening once or twice a year. (That is with regular steeling/honing too keep the edge strait).
