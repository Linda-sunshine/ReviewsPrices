review/summary: Rustyreview/text: I did not use this skillet immediately when I go it. I've actually only used it twice. After the second use, when I washed it out, it has begun to rust really badly. Now the item says that it was pre-seasoned so I didn't put the oil in it and put it in the oven. I want to know if there's something that I'm missing. If not, I REALLY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. I also gave special care not to use soap when washing it, which is what most say you're not supposed to do.
