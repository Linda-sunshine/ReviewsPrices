review/summary: Worked great for a year. Then became fire hazard.review/text: I really really loved this egg cooker. I love having a hard-boiled egg in the morning, but cooking eggs the conventional way takes too long for a weekday morning (I live at altitude). I found the directed cooking times to be too short, but with trial and error, the eggs came out perfectly. Until I noticed that the edge of the cooker started sparking. I normally put the egg in and let it cook and finish getting ready. When I came into the kitchen, I could smell burned plastic, and noticed a scorched area on the edge of the cooker. I threw it away immediately, as I was concerned that it would start a fire in my microwave. Now I am undecided if I should get another one. It did last a year, but I'm not sure I really want to keep buying a new one every year.
