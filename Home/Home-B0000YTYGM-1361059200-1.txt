review/summary: Generally, it is a great product after you figure out its little quirks.review/text: Simple design. Love the thermal carafe.MUST use the cone shaped filters. Not listed on manufacturer's instructions and determined after 2 attempts with other filters we had which caused an overflow on the cupboard and floor. In a consumer blog, one person actually put the coffee maker in the sink so he did not have to babysit the coffee maker.
