review/summary: Great at first, then downhill quickly. Now useless.review/text: I ordered this about two years ago to use around the house - mostly to pull the cat hair off from the furniture and stairs. It worked well enough at first, especially on the stairs. For furniture it wasn't all that great.The fatal flaw is the "filters" - some aren't made well at all, so dust and hair is sucked through the seam between the plastic/rubber part and the mesh filter itself. This dust gets everywhere inside the unit, clogging the motor, switch, you name it. The other day I took it apart because the switch was so caked with dust that I couldn't physically slide it back and forth anymore. Then, stupid me wasn't too careful with the tiny pieces in the switch, so I need a replacement. Which I'm not having much luck finding.Even on a good day the filter clogs quickly and the brush barely spins at all. I was hoping this little thing would be on par with the cheap Eureka Boss we've had for about 15 years that we bought refurbished from Big Lots for next to nothing, but apparently not. Knowing what I know now, I'd pass.
