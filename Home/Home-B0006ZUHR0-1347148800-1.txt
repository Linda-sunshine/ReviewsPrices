review/summary: Despite minor issues best iron ever (IMHO)review/text: I absolutely love this iron. At first i was sceptical about owning a digital iron. Didn't think it was gonna work good on the preprogrammed settings. But with all the wonderful reviews i decided to go ahead and try it out. I was immediately wowed, so much so that i bought another one for my business. I now have one for home use and work use and neither irons have burned any item of clothing and that says alot. the faceplate of the irons still look like they did when newly purchased, despite having an average 15 employees using six days a week to iron uniforms. One of the iron fell a couple of times and since then it's been leaking water. The most disconcerting aspect of this is most of the water comes through the round ball area where the wire/cable/electrical cord protudes out of the top back area. This worries me as i can't help thinking of water and electricity mixing. It also leaks at the bottom. So now we mostly use this iron without the steam feature. Still the clothing comes out looking great. I would definitely recommend and buy again and again. After owning this you really don't want to look else where for another iron.
