review/summary: KitchenAid is the bestreview/text: I have decorated cakes for years, and always used my faithful KitchenAid 5-qt. I reluctantly gave it to my daughter so she'd have a good mixer, and upgraded to this one because of the larger capacity. KitchenAid is the BEST--never a disappointment.
