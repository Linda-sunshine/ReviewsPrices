review/summary: I like the trashcan, but it can act up at timesreview/text: We've been using this trashcan for the last year and a half. It has worked pretty well for most of the time and guest enjoy playing with it. There are times when, as has been reported, it can act up. One time, changing batteries fixed it, but I think that the last time, I just removed the batteries for about a minute and allowed it to "reboot". I'd try this before throwing it away. The other issue is that it can get moldy under the lid, but that is just because it is a moist humid environment. I'd probably still buy again.
