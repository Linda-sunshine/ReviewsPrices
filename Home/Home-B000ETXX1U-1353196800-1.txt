review/summary: Save your money, look elsewherereview/text: Bought this mattress for extra sleeping space for the upcoming holiday season, and upon first inflation, the mattress won't hold air. Filled it, left it over night, and it was half empty by morning. Read their remarks about "stretching" and needing to add air after it stretches. Filled it again, and 6 hours later is was a third deflated again. Totally useless. I saw the overall 4 out of 5 star rating and figured it had to be good, but my experience reads like all of the 1 star reviews. Won't hold air. No obvious leaking points. We debated a futon or this air mattress, and figured we'd be better off just getting the air mattress. We should have just gotten a futon.
