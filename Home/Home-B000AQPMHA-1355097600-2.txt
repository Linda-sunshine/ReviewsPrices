review/summary: I am so happy with my Keurig, even after using it every day for all occasions!review/text: Perfect for two, or a crowd. It's fast enough to handle it all. About the K-cup filter basket for using your own coffee: You must have the container to put the filter in, and replace the one that holds the store bought K-cups which comes with the Keurig. Without this, water will splash out and make a mess! Then don't forget to replace the holder for the ready made cups when you use them. I works perfectly if done correctly.
