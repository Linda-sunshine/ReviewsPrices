review/summary: AWESOME!review/text: The vacuum is awesome. The suction is real, pulling things that is within inches from it. SO strong..just watch out for your fringe on your area rugs. It is SUPER short, so don't be surprised if your kid claims it theirs and starts pitching in!! My daughter loves using this vacuum while I use a different one upstairs, and she's 6.
