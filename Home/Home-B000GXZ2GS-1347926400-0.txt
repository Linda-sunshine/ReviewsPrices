review/summary: Great little contraptionreview/text: I think that this is a great alternative to bulky espresso machines. I must warn readers though, I'm not a coffee connoisseur. I do like espresso drinks and can easily use this every day to make a latte in just a few minutes. I use our Nespreso milk frother with it and they make a great combination. This Aeropress has a super small footprint takes up the same space as a pint glass in our cupboard. It's easy to use and easy to clean and makes decent coffee. I would definitely recommend giving it a try.
