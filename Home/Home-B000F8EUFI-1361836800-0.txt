review/summary: Light and easy to cleanreview/text: I was prepared for this to be an &#34;ok&#34; product, but I actually really like it. It cleans up dust and dog/cat hair well off our wood floors and carpet. It is also light weight and easy for me to maneuver. I had a more expensive product specifically for pets and it was a major problem, especially to clean. This is really easy to clean. My only issue is that it builds static and I have been zapped a couple times. I would still buy it again though, especially for the price.
