review/summary: Broke after using it twice after owning it for 9 monthsreview/text: I only used this juicer a few times. It made a large mess and all the "good stuff" does not get added to the juice. I hear the bullet is way easier to clean and all parts of the fruit and veggies that are healthy are added to the juice.And...I recently tried using this juicer and it broke down after owning it less than a year. It has a year long warranty, but it will be such a pain to figure out how to return/exchange it.
