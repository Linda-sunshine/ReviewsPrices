review/summary: Great juicer for the pricereview/text: It is the first juicer we bought. The trick is to push the vegetables and fruits really slow- otherwise you get a lots of pulp. Cleaning is relatively easy, except for the strainer basket. Overall I am pretty happy with the purchase- we use it every morning.
