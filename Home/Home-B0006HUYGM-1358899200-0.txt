review/summary: Small and powerfulreview/text: Overall an excellent vacuum. It seems to be as powerful as many upright vacuums but occupies much less space. This would be small enough to keep in almost any trunk, which is especially convenient for those with dogs or kids. The hose comes with a narrow attachment to reach in those tight spaces. The vacuum itself can simply suck or add in the rotary brush to do a more thorough cleaning on carpets or upholstery. I really put it to the test after a trip to the beach, and the vacuum did the job by picking up every grain of sand I could find and then some.
