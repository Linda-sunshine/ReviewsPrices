review/summary: Great little machinereview/text: This dehydrator is so easy to use and to clean. The trays are ample to hold the product that you are dehydrating. Takes up little counter space. The heating is evenly distributed throughout the entire tray assembly. One feature that I would like to see and that my 1970 dehydrator has on it is an inline switch on the power cord, so the unit can be turned off/on without unplugging from the wall if you want to check the progress of what you are dehydrating. If my idea of the inline switch is used, I would like compensation!!
