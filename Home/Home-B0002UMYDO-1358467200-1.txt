review/summary: West Bend can openerreview/text: We had tried a few different manuel can opener's that work well but for a very short time . Started looking for something that my wife could use that she would not struggle with. Took a look at reviews of different electic can openers and found a review on thsi opener that was very helpful. Almost all the other Electric opener worked well but would not handle large cans or when the blades became dull or bent , you had to throw away a opener that ran fine because you can not replace the blades.This one you can and it holds some heavy heavy cans.
