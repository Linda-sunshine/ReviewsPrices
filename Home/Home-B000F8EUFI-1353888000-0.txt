review/summary: absolutely amazing!! Get this!review/text: I love this vacuum. We have two dogs who shed everywhere. We use this vacuum on carpet and the wood floor. it doesn't scratch the floor or furniture. it's easy to assemble and clean. we do clean out the filter each time..the dust flies around a bit, but we do this outdoors and as low to inside the garbage can as possible. It works for us!!
