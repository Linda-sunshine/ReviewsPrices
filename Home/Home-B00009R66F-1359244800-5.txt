review/summary: Does the job for a good price!review/text: I have used this frequently and my friend has used it frequently as well. It has held up well over for almost 2 years through my vigorous cleaning, as well as traveling and use at my friend's hosue. The only real problem I have found is the attachment for upholstery cleaning leaked the last time I used it. Since I was on a cleaning spree in the wee hours of the morning and the furniture was my last event of my spree, I may have connected something incorrectly--the jury is out until I look at it again. My back does go out somewhat when cleaning the stairs, since you have to bend to clean them, etc., but I'm not sure how that can be improved. The flat thing they send to clean out the nozzle should have a place on the machine so it is attached well and it needs to be marked &#34;do not throw away.&#34; Somewhere this item was lost and I need it. Overall, I recommend this product and if this one breaks down, I will buy another.
