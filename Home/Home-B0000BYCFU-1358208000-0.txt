review/summary: First time canner and I have no complaintsreview/text: This past summer was the first year I delved into canning. After doing quite a bit of research, I finally settled on this pressure canner as something economical that wouldn't break me if I decided I didn't want to can in the future. As a complete novice, I had no problems following the instructions for the canner and did both pressure canning and water bath canning with it.I also have a glass-top stove and was a bit worried about it not being able to get hot enough to keep up the pressure but found that was not an issue at all. It's probably a bit easier to regulate the pressure on a gas-top stove, but I found that if I turned the heat down to medium-high a few lbs below my desired pressure, it would maintain the pressure I wanted. The only thing I would caution for those with a glass-top stove is to be very careful when moving it, as you could easily scratch the surface of your cook top.I'm looking forward to doing even more canning next summer!
