review/summary: Best Thermal Pot coffee maker I've used.review/text: Two months ago I bought the CuisinartDTC-975 unit to replace my 7 year old Seaco unit that I loved. They both have similar features. I bought it along with a universal permanent cone filter. The first pot brewed perfect, very hot and the flavor was very impressive. The filter was a pain to clean. At least it was for me. Anyway, I decide to scrap it and use the paper filters that came with the unit. The coffee with those enclosed filters tasted terrible, like something I never experienced before, and I'm old enough to remember where I was when Kennedy was shot.So not having any &#8220;store bought&#8221; paper cone filters yet I started to use my old round paper filters with a fold here and there as I place them in the lid and haven't an accident yet. Coffee tastes great. It&#8217;s much hotter that my old $200.00 Seaco and stays impressively hot for 4 hours. It looks like Cuisinart utilizes a gravity fed ball bearing valve inside the lid to eliminate the heat from escaping. This design does however make it difficult to get the last cup out. I just open the lid, and pour the last cup out. This is a very easy process and a small price to pay for a pot that keeps coffee hot, hot, hot for a very long time.Even if the Seaco pot was still available (and I loved it), I would not go back after using the Cuisinart DTC-975BKN Thermal 12-Cup.
