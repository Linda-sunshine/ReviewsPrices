review/summary: Don't really need cordless anymorereview/text: With a 20 FT. cord, who needs cordless anymore? I can carry it to almost anywhere in the house and to the car. There is no worrying about re-chargeable batteries. It has strong suction and it's easy to carry. I wish it was a little quieter and I wish the hose with the attachment was right handed. The pick-up end is stored on the right side but the hose originates from the left. If you're left handed, you may like it more. Overall, I can say goodbye to re-chargeable dust busters.
