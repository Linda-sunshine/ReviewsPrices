review/summary: great chopper, smaller than I expectedreview/text: This little chopper will puree food in no time which is great! It is smaller than I had anticipated. I don't really think it holds 3 cups, more like 2 so keep that in mind. I use it for making baby food so the size is OK, I wouldn't want to make anything in bulk with it, though.
