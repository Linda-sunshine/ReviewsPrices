review/summary: Great!review/text: I also got the dutch oven set from Logic and I'm very happy with everything. I found that the pre-seasoning is starting to flake off in tiny bits, which I'm a little wary of. I would have preferred to season it myself, personally, and skip the flaking of the factory seasoning. I don't notice any taste and it's very little at a time, but still I don't like the idea of it in my food.Otherwise, I really like the cast iron. It is good quality and heats up fast, stays hot, and heats very evenly. The pre-seasoning allows me to use very little oil on it but still be non-stick. I use my stuff in the oven and on the stove top, and maybe in the summer I can use it on the barbecue too!
