review/summary: Just What I Wantedreview/text: I wanted to be able to eat a big bowl of popcorn, without all the oil and calories. This popcorn maker is great. I put in three tablespoons of kernels, plug in the machine, and in two to three minutes I have a huge bowl of a low fat snack to munch on! At the end of the popping cycle the few remaining kernels go a little crazy whirling about, but it's no big deal. For the price of the machine, cost of the kernels, and the low calorie benefit- it's a smart choice. Mine now has a spot on the kitchen counter!
