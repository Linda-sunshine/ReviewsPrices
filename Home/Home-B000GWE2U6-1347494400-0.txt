review/summary: do not buy-rusted within a monthreview/text: After using this for about a month the spring corroded, turned the water a horrid shade of yellow and stained all the plastic the same color. It is past my return date according to Amazon. Too bad because my daughter loved her hello kitty humidifier; try to explain to a 4 year old why I am not going to buy another one :(9/23/12 Contacted crane, they shipped a new cap for the tank to me.
