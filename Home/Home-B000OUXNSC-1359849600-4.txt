review/summary: Stayed on bedreview/text: We have a 16&#34; mattress and this pad stayed on our bed nicely, unlike our previous pad. We have washed the pad twice and put on gentle dry cycle because of the other reviews. We did not have a problems with melting or burning. Our previous pad fell apart after multiple washes and we paid double for it. Overall, I would recommend this since it is thick and fits a mattress real nice with no pulling or lifting up thoughout the night.
