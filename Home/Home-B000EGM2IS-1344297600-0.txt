review/summary: nothing else like it!review/text: These don't seem to be in stores anymore. This is an awesome, must-have counter-top appliance. It is perfect for hot chocolate and hot teas, and you don't have to wait for a kettle. It takes seconds to get REALLY hot water. I had an older one and gave it to a friend. Then I missed mine and had to get another one.
