review/summary: fog greaserreview/text: This grill is truly meant for outdoor use mainly, I cooked bacon and burgers and fog and grease were all over everything. your best bet is for breakfast only light foods like eggs and hasbrown work best. I am very disappointed, this grill burns in the worst way dont buy.
