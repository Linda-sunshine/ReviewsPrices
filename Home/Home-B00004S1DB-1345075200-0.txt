review/summary: Vacuum?review/text: This is an OK product, but description is plainly false. It makes good coffee, but where is the "vacuum" described? The top fits very loosely and only keeps the coffee warm for an hour, not "two or three hours." When I think of "vacuum" I think of a vacuum-sealed thermos bottle, for example, and I don't think I'm alone. I wouldn't mind this if they would just not say it's something that it is plainly NOT. That's why I bought it (for the "vacuum"), so I guess I really should return it, but at this price, why bother? Do you think they know this? I guess it's worth the price, but someome should change the advertisement--it's plainly not a "vacuum" anything! Truth in advertising is certainly dead.
