review/summary: Surface is not non-stickreview/text: I wanted a non-stick surface to prepare dumplings, eggs and what not and I wanted something safe to prepare them in. I zeroed in on enamel coated surface after realizing that plain cast iron surfaces would need time to season/become non-stick and stainless steel was ruled out. I followed the instructions and heated this pan with oil in it. My pan cake stuck a bit the first time. After gently washing it with soapy water I tried eggs and the eggs just wouldn't leave the surface. Had to return it. I bought a plain cast iron pan as a replacement. It will take time to season but at-least I can use a steel spatula on a non-enameled surface.
