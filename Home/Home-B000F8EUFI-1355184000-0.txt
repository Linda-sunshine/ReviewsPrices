review/summary: Compact but noisyreview/text: It's light and compact so good for small one bedroom apartment. It's noisy but many vacuums are. Don't have to buy filter bags just dump the dirt out of the built in canaster into plastic bags to throw out. It's dusty and messy to dump it so go outside to do it. Easy assembly.
