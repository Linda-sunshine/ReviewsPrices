review/summary: Boiled eggs almost a cinch!review/text: I've always enjoyed soft and hard boiled eggs but they've always been a bit tricky or labor intensive. You've all been there, hard-boiled are soft or soft-boiled are hard. The water takes forever to boil and you turn away and presto it's out of control. I've even used special thermometers for preparation. Until I broke it. This microwave egg boiler takes a lot of the guesswork out. I have found that paying attention to the egg size and number of eggs can make a difference in the outcome. I can't soft boil a large egg the same length of time as a extra large. So pay attention to the manufacturer guidelines. Be careful too about picking it up or removing the top; it's hot. All in all a very useful device.
