review/summary: Awesome cast-iron cookwarereview/text: There's a reason why top chefs prefer cast iron for cooking something like pancakes. When well used and cared for, cast iron is way better than any non-stick pan could be. Not to mention the heat retention and even cooking, and you can cook pancakes without any sticking.I've made crepes, lentil cakes and pancakes on this, and they've come out perfect every time. However, you *must* care for your cast iron cookware. For one, never ever ever put your cast iron griddle in the dishwasher. And never use soap to clean your griddle. Just hot water and a stiff brush and you're done. Dry it off immediately and rub a light coating of vegetable oil (I use sesame seed oil) all over the griddle to protect it from rust.I've found the factory seasoning inadequate and so sometimes the first few batches of food will wind up sticking to the pan. However, with regular use, it will soon develop a smooth finish that no non-stick can match, and no worries about the ill effects of non-stick coatings flaking off into your food.
