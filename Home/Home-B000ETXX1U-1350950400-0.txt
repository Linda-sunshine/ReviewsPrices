review/summary: Does not hold the airreview/text: I bought the bed for a girls weekend in Port Ludlow!It filled up so nicely-but in the morning it was really low on air.We re-filled it for a second try and when my girlfriend who slept on it woke up the next morning shewas in the middle of the bed half way to the ground.I have a call into Wenzel so I am going to try to return it and get another one, I will post again once I am done with that process-fingers crossed.
