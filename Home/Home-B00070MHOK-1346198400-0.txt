review/summary: Another positive reviewreview/text: I'm a professional photographer. I set up at pageants and do portraits for the winners. I use a travel studio set up and my backdrops get terribly wrinkled. This steamer travels pretty well and makes my backdrops look great. Be warned, there is no start/stop switch and if you travel with it there is no cover for the spout so make sure it is empty and fairly dry before packing up.I've also used this on most of my dress shirts/pants and it does the job well. Overall I'm very pleased with the purchase and I bet you will be to.
