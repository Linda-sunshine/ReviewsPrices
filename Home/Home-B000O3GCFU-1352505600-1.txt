review/summary: Insulated food containerreview/text: I ordered this Thermos Foogo Leak Proof jar to allow my daughter to take a hot lunch to school. She is a very picky eater. I fill it with hot water from a tea kettle and let it sit for 5 minutes before I put the food in. It does keep the food warm for several hours until she has lunch. It was even slightly warm when she got home from school. I use it for pasta but intend to try it on other types of food. It is dishwasher safe (top rack) but the directions say to wash by hand if you can. I would recommend this to others. It does the trick for the kids who don't have a microwave at school.
