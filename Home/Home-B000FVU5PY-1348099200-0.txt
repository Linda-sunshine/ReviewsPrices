review/summary: GREAT sheetsreview/text: I bought some REALLY expensive sheets last year. Got em on sale. Well I loved the sheets so much I thought I would never replace them until they got a few stains, tears, etc. Didn't think I could find sheets comparable without dropping a fortune. SO I went on the hunt for good sheets on Amazon. Saw these, was not optimistic because the price was so low...but the sheets are in fact great. They are not thin, good sturdy material. They breathe well. They make up nicely, no need to iron or anything. They wash well. I just love them. I never knew what a HUGE difference nice sheets make....but it is definitely worth investing in. Oh and I have a queen, but it has a pillow top so MOST queen sheets won't stretch over the whole mattress. I end up having to use those hook things...these sheets have deep pockets so they go over the mattress and topper nicely.
