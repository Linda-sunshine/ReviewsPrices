review/summary: Foul Odor and Not Reliablereview/text: Like others mine arrived with a strong chemical odor. I bought this, in part, because i wanted to avoid boiling water in plastic. So much for avoiding chemicals. The odor dissipated with time but six months later there is still a faint odor. Looks better than most and boils water quickly but started to malfunction after several months. Turns itself off before the water is fully boiling then turns itself back on several minutes later. The water gets hot now, never boiling. Comes on all by itself so we have to leave it unplugged. Between the smell and malfunctions not reccomended.
