review/summary: Tall and comfyreview/text: We bought this airbed specifically to use while staying at a relative's house a few months after my total knee replacement. I needed something high enough so that my knee would not be stressed or injured while rising (Impossible to stand up from a floor position due to the knee surgery) and this mattress worked perfectly! We have had it for about 6 months and our adult children slept on it many times during the holidays and loved it. Fast and easy to inflate and deflate.
