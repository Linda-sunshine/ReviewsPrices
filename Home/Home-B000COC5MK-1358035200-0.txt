review/summary: Works great, but dont expect it to lastreview/text: I received this product as a gift 2 Christmases ago. It worked great for about a year or so. Opening bottles with it is such a breeze and the price is great as well. Compared to other units like the Rabbit, this is much cheaper and easier to use.Most of the time using it is out of the blue you want to have wine with company or with your dinner, so charging it for each use is a bit inconvenient. However you can leave it on the stand 24/7 to keep it charged when you need it. After over a year of owning it, the power got significantly less to where at around 1.5 years it would not even hold enough charge to open 1 bottle when taken off of the stand. Since there is no way to plug it in directly to the unit (aka charge while in use) the unit was effectively dead at this point.I still give it 3/5 because it is very useful and I think most people wouldn't mind so much paying another $20 after 1.5 years for a replacement. However, there is room for improvement, if they just made the charger plug into the unit, you could use it while charging, which would eliminate the battery dying over the years and also give you the ability to use it "on the fly" even if it was uncharged at the time of necessity.
