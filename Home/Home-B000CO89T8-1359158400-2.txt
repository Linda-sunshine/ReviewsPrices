review/summary: Not hot enough for mereview/text: i bought this item through a retail store, and i'm rather disappointed in that the warmer does not keep beverages hot enough for my liking. A pipng hot beverage, fresh from the microwave, will soon be just "warm" for the duration of the drink. Not "hot". If that's what you like, this is the baby for you! IF you like your drinks hot, you will probably be like the many users who reviewed it herein, and find it a little lacking. IF i had paid full price, i would have probably returned it. I may experiment with some metal mugs (rather than ceramic) to see if this helps, but based on other reviews, not too hopeful...
