review/summary: Wanted to love it bt couldn't -constantly needs cleaning!review/text: Chose this one because of reviews. The grinder was good but cleaning this unit is soooo time consuming...And if you do not clean it daily, you will have old stale grounds getting into your next batch of ground coffee. You have to take it all apart remove the grinder part and there is lots of coffee grinds stuck in there. The brush that comes with it to clean is just silly, does nothing. Tapping it as per instructions does a very limited job. So many grounds are stuck inside the machine that you waste a lot of coffee each time you grind. Also the bowl that holds the coffee beans was hard to align after several times of removal...which meant it was going to break or chip in short time. Just sooooo much effort!
