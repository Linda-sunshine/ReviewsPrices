review/summary: Good item but not perfectreview/text: Bought this for a gift for my girlfriend. She loves how easy it is to use,only complaint is the mesh in the basket in place of a filter wasnt installed properly, and I do not see it lasting very long. It was shifted too far over so one side of the rectangle isnt sealed.The mug isnt the best travel mug in the world either, but won't argue for the price. Make it into that mug, pour into another. Boom- problem solved
