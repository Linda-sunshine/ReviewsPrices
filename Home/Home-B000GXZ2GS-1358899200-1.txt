review/summary: Yummo!review/text: This is an initial review, I will put up an update down the road on durability and such.I am currently sipping my third cup of coffee with my Aeropress, and I have to say, quite impressed. I spent a lot of time buying our last coffee maker, researching ones that bring the water to the perfect temp (even adjusted for high altitude), the best grinders, etc etc. So I thought I had done fairly well for our budget and could make a decent cup of joe.Enter Aeropress. I drank my first cup and with every sip was saying &#34;WOW, this is a good!&#34;.I love a plain simple latte, but frankly I didn't want to spend gobs of money on a good espresso machine and have another accessory on our counter. WIth the aerobie and a milk frother, I am making a pretty decent latte and it all tucks away in the cabinet.There are a lot of parts and tools with the aeropress, so I am still trying to figure out the best way to store it, probably the only downside. It takes a few attempts before you get a nice flow down in the process, but now it goes smoothly and a quick rinse of everything and your done (less time then it took for my coffee maker).So, the hype is real, this thing really works. Now will see how long it lasts!
