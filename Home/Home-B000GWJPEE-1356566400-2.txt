review/summary: Sometimes Crane humidifers are hit or missreview/text: This is the 4th Crane humidifier I've purchased. The first, a frog, stopped producing mist a few months after purchase (seems to be a common problem with the frog based upon other reviews). The second and third, an elephant and dragon, are still going strong after 3 and 2.5 years, respectively. The fourth, which is the Hello Kitty, started to have problems after a few months. The motor started making a very loud noice, the base became very hot and the mist slowed considerably. Crane's response has been fantastic. They are going to replace. Will send an update when the replacement arrives and has had some use.
