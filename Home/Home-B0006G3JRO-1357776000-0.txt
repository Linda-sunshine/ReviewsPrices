review/summary: Has made my life easierreview/text: I bought this before xmas and I used a food processor before to make my cookie crust. This was so convienent to use to crush the cookies and I didn't have to haul out the processor and the cleanup was easy. Have also use to make shake, scrambles eggs etc... It's so handy to have in the kitchen and love all the attachments.
