review/summary: Ohhh That Smellreview/text: As someone else commented it has a scent to it from the natural materials used to procue it. The smell isn't gone yet after 3 months so I purchased a mite proof matress cover to try and seal it. Cuts down the scent about 50%. Using a lot of Fabreez Linen Scent spray. Also the little plugs from the holes punched in the foam for air circulation keep showing up alot. Not all were removed during manufacture.
