review/summary: Love this pot, especially for the pricereview/text: I have a smaller Le Creuset dutch oven, which I dearly love. But for occasional big batches of chili or roasts I wanted a really big pot. This one is fantastic, and the price is unbeatable. The color is deep and it looks great sitting out on my stove, it is oven safe to high temps, and it cleans up like a dream. This is a great alternative to the fancy french brand that gives you great results.
