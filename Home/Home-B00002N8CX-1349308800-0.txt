review/summary: I'm a guy and I love this vacuum.review/text: I got this as a Hanukkah gift (no Jewish jokes, I asked for a vacuum) to use for my house with all wood/some tile floors that collect schmutz like you wouldn't believe. It's a hilf having this thing around! It's so small and powerful enough to keep up with all the god damn cat hair. Oy vey, that fakucta cat hair. It's not too loud either. I mean it's not as quiet as that schlimazel Alan Colmes when he's rolling over for that plyoot Hannity, but it doesn't hurt my ears like some of the other vacuums do. Anyhow, now I can tanz around the house without wearing those schmattes for slippers all the time. I give this nine out of ten matzoth balls.
