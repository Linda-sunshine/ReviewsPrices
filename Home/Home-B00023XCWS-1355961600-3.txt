review/summary: Just call me Ma Kettle!review/text: First I got an expensive Capresso glass kettle. Talk about an obnoxious plastic smell! The company said it would go away if you bathed the plastic part in lemon juice, but all the lemon juice did was sour me on that brand and model. Then I tried a Bodum, but within a few months the heating element had corroded. So I got one of these. After almost 2 years, it still works great, neither I nor my coworkers noticed any smell. And the heating element is still shiny. So I came in to order a second one for use in another space, and thought I'd let you know this was the best (and least expensive!) of the three I have used. Works perfectly for the coffee and tea! Highly recommended by me.
