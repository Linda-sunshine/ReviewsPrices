review/summary: Great for setting baked goods on fire.review/text: "Hey, that's a good idea" I said to myself as I shopped for a toaster-oven. But neither the toaster nor the oven do the job very well. I just came back from throwing this into the dumpster. I would give it to a thrift store, but I wouldn't want someone else to be burdened with it.
