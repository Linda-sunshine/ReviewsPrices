review/summary: Proctor Silex E160BY Fresh Grind Coffee Grinderreview/text: The unit is preposterous. Its power cord is only 6&#34; long, way too short to reach any electrical outlet. You literally have to plug it into an extension cord to use it. Now I know why it's so inexpensive- it's useless. Stay away from this product.
