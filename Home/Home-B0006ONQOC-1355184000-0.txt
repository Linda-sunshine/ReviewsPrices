review/summary: Does the jobreview/text: I love this ice cream maker. It's fast and does a great job. It's certainly not the 'authentic' route of other traditional ice cream makers, but then it also doesn't have the mess! No salt and ice to buy. Just leave the tub in your freezer after every use and it's ready when you need it.
