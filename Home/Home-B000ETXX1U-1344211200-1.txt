review/summary: Do Not Buy This Air Bedreview/text: I had this bed for less than a year and within 9-10 months there was a problem. The center of the bed on top had expanded to form a huge bubble. I could not sleep on the bed comfortably because of this bubble. I had used numerous air beds over the years but this one gave out too soon. I had one before that lasted several years before the air bubble thing happened. I don't know what brand of air bed to buy that doesn't do the bubble stuff but I won't buy until I know this won't happen again.
