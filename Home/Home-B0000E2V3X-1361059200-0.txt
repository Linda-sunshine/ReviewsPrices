review/summary: Outstanding Pizza Panreview/text: I use it to make traditional crust pizza and the crust always has come out just right.I do use a non stick cookig spray before I put the dough on and make my pizza on the pizza pan while I pre heat the oven to 425F/450F and I bake for about 20min.I have done it this way for thin crust and thick crust and I was satisfied with both.I usually make my own dough but I have also tried Pillsbury Pizza Dough and it turned out fine, but I like mine better and it is a lot cheaper to make my ownA lot of the people that have reviewed this pizza pan say that they cut the pizza on the pan and I think that is ok but I don't do this because I think my pizza cutter will get dull and it would be hard to re-sharpen.I so far have not burned the crust on any of the pizzas that I have made, so clean up has always been very easy.
