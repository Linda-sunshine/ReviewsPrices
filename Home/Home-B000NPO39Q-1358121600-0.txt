review/summary: For Nativityreview/text: I like this angel, it looks nice and is well made (the base and pole screw tightly into the angel). For some reason, it doesn't seem to be 100% cohesive with the rest of the nativity I have (stars, nativity, & shepherds so far) - but part of that might be that I'm just not used to seeing it. I do like increasing my collection and I will continue to set up this angel, and possibly the other if I get that as well.
