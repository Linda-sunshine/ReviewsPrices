review/summary: Best travel mug for tea yetreview/text: This mini thermos travel mug is convenient and versatile. As other reviewers have stated, it's very convenient to be able to brew my tea on the go and not worry about spilling, though you do have to be careful that the screw top is properly seated. I've had minor spills a few times from the top not closing properly. It keeps the tea hotter than other travel mugs because of being closed, and unlike other mugs, if the top is properly fastened it won't spill even if it gets knocked over. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that it doesn't actually hold 12 ounces- more like 10. Still, a great find if you love to travel with tea or know someone who does.
