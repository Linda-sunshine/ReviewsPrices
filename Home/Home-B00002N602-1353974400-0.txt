review/summary: Presto poor quality.review/text: Used this pressure cooker and thought it was what I expected. On the third use I noticed a hole in the top were the over pressure plug should be , it fell out . Unable to find, so it's useless untill I order a new part. Yes it was hand washed . Checked bottom of unit and guess what.? Another product made in China! Thanks Presto.
