review/summary: great for brewing and for smokingreview/text: Our two main uses for this thermoment are brewing and smoking. The clip that comes with the probe is great for clipping on the side of your brew kettle to make sure you're maintaining proper temps. The probe has help up quite well through several batches of smoking as well and comes perfectly clean afterwards. We've only had the thermometer for a few weeks so I can't attest to durability. My fingers are crossed that this one lasts longer than the previous brand we had. Just be gentle with the cord!
