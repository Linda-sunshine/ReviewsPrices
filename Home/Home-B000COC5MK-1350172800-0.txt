review/summary: Purchased a second onereview/text: We had one of these bottle openers and used it extensively. Eventually the internal gears stripped. We then purchased a different, "fancier", more expensive bottle opener. It barely had enough power to remove corks (with a full charge) and it didn't last a year. So we purchased this opener again and it works as great as the first one we had. Lots of power, holds a charge very well, and looks stylish. This opener is the best opener that we have owned! An excellent purchase!
