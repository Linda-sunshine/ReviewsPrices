review/summary: Great coffee. One minor flaw.review/text: I have had this coffeemaker (Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew Central 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker)for nearly two years. I decided to get the newer one even though the older one still works fine. I like the appearance of this newer one and the ability to set the temperature of the warmer and control the time for the shut-off. (I think all coffee has a burned taste after a short while on the warmer so the 30 minutes and lower temperature is great.) One small problem with this newer one - it's much more difficult to see the amount of water you have poured into the coffeemaker. There was a small window on the older model that let you easily see the amount of water. I almost never make a full pot of coffee so I regularly checked to see that I have put the right amount for the coffee I am adding. Other than that, I love it and it does make much better coffee than all the other coffeemakers I have owned.
