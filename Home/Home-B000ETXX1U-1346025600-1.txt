review/summary: Not a Wenzel!review/text: I just received my package. I purchased it directly from amazon, not another seller and it wasn't a Wenzel. It was a generic brand. I have seen this complaint in a few other reviews. Buyers should be aware that if you are paying extra because of the brand name, you may not get what you paid for. It is extremely disappointing that one can not depend on a company to be honest and upfront anymore. I am returning it and will think twice about buying anything from Amazon again.
