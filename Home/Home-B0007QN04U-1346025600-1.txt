review/summary: I love this mixer!review/text: I received my mixer before the estimated deliver date and I just love using it. I have had no problems. It is very friendly user. I have been wanting a standmixer for some time. I researched other mixers but got the most positive reviews for the KitchenAid KP26MICPM Professional 600 Series 6 quart Stand Mixer. I had priced the KitchenAid Artisan and could have gotten it from other places what I paid for the Professional on Amazon.com.
