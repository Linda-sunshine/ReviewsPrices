review/summary: 5 Stars at Heartreview/text: I had to give four stars, for one reason and one reason alone: The cup/mug that comes with it (for some reason) when you wash it, (somehow) water gets inside on the cup (between the metal lining & plastic cup itself) and when you shake it, you can distinctively hear the water swash around, even when you shake violently, its hard to get the caught water out. Despite that however (very minor in my opinion) the Machine itself is WONDERFUL and EXTREMELY usefu, I like using my own coffee mug anyways....The coffee make is great and quickly makes a great cup of coffee. Here are a few tips, that (when considering to purchase I read, that I found a solution to.....)1.) Don't fill up water to &#34;max line&#34; fill up a little below the line.2.) I use bottle water when filling (Sink water has minerals and whatnot, and I think it taste better with bottle water than sink water.3.) After coffee maker is done producing coffee, lift up the top of coffee maker and leave open (let air dry) until ready to use again.4.) Using &#34;Melitta Cone Coffee Filters No 1&#34; is essential for me. (Just provides easy clean up and guarantees no grains fall through. Again No 1 type filters. Its not needed with this maker, but I highly recommend it.5.) When done, all I do is take out &#34;Filter basket and &#34;Permanent filter&#34; (11 & 12 in manual) and just rinse & shake well -Thats it!I've been using maker frequently and love it, again, I would have given it 5 starts but the mug is apart of the entire sale and so &#34;that's how the cookie crumbles&#34; -as they say. Great for individual household use, -meaning 1 or two people in household drink coffee, if more, then get a coffee maker with a coffee pot...Very easy to use, easy clean up and quick. 5 Starts at Heart!
