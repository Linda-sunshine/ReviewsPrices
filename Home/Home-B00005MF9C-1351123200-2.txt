review/summary: Average quality & performance.review/text: the Black & Decker "Brew-n-Go" single cup coffee maker performs acceptably, brewing one cup of coffee.I've already purchased 3 of these units over the past 10 years. The items that wear out, in order in which they occurred are as follows:First unit: power on switch was faulty out of the box.First unit replacement: power on switch eventually wore out.Second unit: "lifetime" coffee filter mesh fabric separated from plastic.This unit: "lifetime" coffee filter mesh fabric has already separated from one of the edges after 2 weeks.I enjoy my coffee hot/fresh and intend to purchase another single cup coffee maker but it probably won't be another B & D single cup coffee maker because of this poor quality issue. I could call the company and complain but when I did so some years back with the first unit which had the faulty power switch the reaction I got was that I was trying to gouge a "free" unit for my trouble. They eventually sent me a replacement but not until I'd spent an hour on the phone. Too much grief for a $20 coffee maker.Lastly, this experience does not reflect on Amazon. The unit was purchased & delivered easily, promptly and, unlike Black & Decker, with no problems through the Amazon.com web site.
