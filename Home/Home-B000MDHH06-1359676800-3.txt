review/summary: Great Juicerreview/text: I had owned a previous juicer in the past and it was so hard to use that I stopped juicing. I decided to try this one. I love it. It is fast, easy to use, easy to clean, easy to put together and take apart. Really great. Back to juicing everyday. I have not had any issues at all so far.
