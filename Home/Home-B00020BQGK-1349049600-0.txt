review/summary: Excellent till it lastedreview/text: This stick vac lasted me only for 11 months but did an excellent job on laminate floors and area rugs. One swipe and the dust and small particles were gone.I should have been a little more careful when using it under the beds and sofa. The power nozzle would get stuck in the legs and I guess I was not gentle enough while using it. The part where the stick body attaches to the power nozzle broke. Sad...I could attach them using duck tape but will lose the swivel action.Have ordered the Hoover Linx cordless, hopefully that one last longer.
