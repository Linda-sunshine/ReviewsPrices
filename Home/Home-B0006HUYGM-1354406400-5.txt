review/summary: A real champreview/text: This little vac is powerful and will not disappoint in that regard. It's build quality is good as is its fit and finish. You will read that some say it's a bit heavy, and that of course is relative, but I agree it's got some weight to it. It's a trade-off: the lighter hand vacs I have could not do near what this Eureka does daily. A wall mount would be a great accessory for this but alas, no sign of one.
