review/summary: Wore out after a year of hard usereview/text: Good machine, we are on our second right now. After making three or four espressos a day for a year the pump was not working very well. We replaced it with a new one and are happy again.*************** Update 11/26/2012Well after the pump on the second one started to go out I ended up buying something a little more expensive. I currently live overseas and wanted something that was 220v. I ordered a Didiesse Frog from ToroCafe.com and cannot believe the difference. I hope I have not misinformed too many people with my previous review. Spending 40 cents an ESE pad for all the espressos I made with the last too machines seems like a waste now. I am even reordering brands I did not care for before to get a fresh taste given the difference the Frog makes.I paid less than 200 euro including DHL delivery. In the United States I see some are going for $500. I imagine there are cheaper ways to get one. Just make sure you buy the proper voltage. I read some reviews about it not being reliable which made me apprehensive to order one, but essentially every piece of the machine is easily replaceable.
