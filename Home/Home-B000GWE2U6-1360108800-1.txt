review/summary: very good humidifierreview/text: I have gone thru so many humidifiers living up at high altitude in the rockies with 2 small children. They are usually either chincy and dont last or just way to big ugly and bulky for our small house. This one on the other hand works great, is soothingly quiet, and IT'S CUTE in the bedroom and seconds as a decoration. We love it
