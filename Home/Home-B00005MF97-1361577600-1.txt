review/summary: I have another very good review about itreview/text: I have another review about this item in which I gave it 4 or 5 stars; I wanted to update but didn't know how.Anyways, I loved loved loved this item. I used it to chop onions (my biggest fear) and used it to make tabbouleh, hummus, and baba ghannoush. I literally used it every single day and loved it so much.I am giving it 2 stars now cause it stopped working after one year. So, I'm returning the item and will write to the company to inform them.I'm really disappointed.
