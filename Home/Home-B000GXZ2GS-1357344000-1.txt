review/summary: This was an excellent present ideareview/text: I got this for my husband who is forever looking to improve the coffee experience, and he loved it. It is a bit labor-intensive, so we have not made an every-day performance out of it, but the taste is interesting and different. Excellent for iced drinks. We also found it convenient to make a small concentrated pot for large company to dilute with water and / or ice (I can see all coffee fans fainting at the sight of this...). It has now been over a year, but if I remember correctly there is a decent number of paper filters included with the AeroPress, so no need to buy an extra pack right away. We also bought a stainless steel filter, saw no need for it and returned it.
