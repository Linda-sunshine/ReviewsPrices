review/summary: Great juicer!review/text: This was my first try with a juicer. I have been using a Vitamix to make my morning drinks, but sometimes I prefer a bit thinner drink so I thought I'd try out a juicer. I originally thought about Breville's top of the line, but this one had such great reviews I thought I'd give it a chance. It was very easy to assemble. I was amazed at how quiet it was when I turned it on. I guess I'm used to the roar of the Vitamix. The fruit and veggies went through very easily and quickly. I got a good amount of juice and the pulp was fairly dry. The only downside was that it took me a few minutes to clean the screen afterwards. Maybe, I'll get better with practice. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a juicer that's in an excellent price range and works very well.
