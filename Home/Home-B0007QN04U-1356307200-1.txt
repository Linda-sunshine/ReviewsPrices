review/summary: Durablereview/text: I have used this mixer for years! It's a work horse! I have used it for many types of foods including cakes, cookies and stiff breads. It performs superbly even with heavy bread doughs. I can quickly mix double batches of brad dough in the large mixing bowl. I bought a second steel bowl for convenience. The second bowl helps to separate wet & dry ingeredients. I highly recommend this mixer!
