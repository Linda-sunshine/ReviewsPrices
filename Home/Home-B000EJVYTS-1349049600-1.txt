review/summary: Wastecan a Waste of Moneyreview/text: Like others on here the one I purchased worked for about two months. At that point it started acting up - opening for no reason, not opening when needed, buttons not functioning, etc. And it is not exactly easy to return a trashcan. I truly feel I have been ripped off, am truly unhappy, and am disappointed that Amazon has not been helpful with their return policy on this. No bueno!
