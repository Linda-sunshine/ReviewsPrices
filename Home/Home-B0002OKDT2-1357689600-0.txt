review/summary: Great product with some limitationsreview/text: This is a very powerful juicer. I've tried other centrifugal juicers, e.g. jack lalane and juiceman pro and even the J8006 masticating juicer (which is very similar to this model)I originally bought the J8006 however the price of this one was much more favorable so I returned and ordered this one. Both have the same motor, difference seems to be the auger material and the warrantee (oh yea, and the price!)I tried the pasta extraction which was really fun to do. I just fed small balls of dough into the machine and it spits out home made pasta. Do not feed dough at once otherwise the motor will give stall out temporarily. Also, after making a small amount the auger really heats up to the point where I saw steam coming out from the end. Partially cooking my pasta! However when the dough heated up, it came out very smoothly.ProsLeafy greens juice remarkably - I've tried kale, wheat grass, cilantro, parsley, spinach - all great and come out bone dryVery powerfulmulti-functionalquietsingle gear, slow extraction for higher nutritional contentConsMushy fruits are awful as they clog the filter and come out in the juiceHard veggies like carrots are ok but do not come out very dry.The feed tube is quite small so you have to cut up all your fruits and veggies first.Not very easy to clean, you need to take many pieces apartHeavy and awkwardly shapedOverall, this is a powerful machine but buyer beware, there are a few things you need to know before getting a masticating juicer. Centrifugal is much better for a quick carrot, ginger, apple, beet concoction. However this serves a different purpose. Knowing this fact, I think this is a great machine and deserves 4 stars.
