review/summary: bought 2 of these and haven't had any problemsreview/text: I purchased 2 of these trash cans to replace another brand of touchless cans. We use one for trash and the other for recycle. These are narrow enough to sit side-by-side in our kitchen without taking up too much space, but big enough to hold a regular sized trash bag. They are good quality, and would look nice in a modern or traditional home. I love not having to use hands to open a trash, yet still having it covered, since our trash cans are kept out, not in a cupboard. When you have messy hands and/or trash. Yes, you could use the old step-open cans, but these are fun, and significantly higher quality
