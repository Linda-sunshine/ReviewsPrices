review/summary: Solved the coffee grounds issue!review/text: I bought this coffee maker on the quantity of buyers that gave fairly positive reviews and kept the apparatus in spite of the issue of coffee grounds getting all over the place. And that is sure true! But I fooled around with #2 filters and regular small pot filters and came up with a solution as the filter basket really just needs a cover. I tear a #2 filter apart and put one piece over the coffee grounds forming a cap. Voila! The grounds are contained inside the filter basket and the coffee maker a pleasure to use. When I run out of #2's I'll cut up some of the other filters to fit. I also have a 4" silicone pour spout that fits most cups that makes pouring water into the container much easier. It may seem like a lot of messing around to make it work but it was worth it. I like the fact that it is smaller than most coffee makers and takes up less space on the counter. Now if the space would be taller for a larger mug, it would be perfect.
