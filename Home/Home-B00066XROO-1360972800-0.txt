review/summary: large surface heats evenlyreview/text: The tilt-and-drain feature is really easy and intuitive to use (hard to describe here). The cooktop is big enough for at least eight 4&#34; pancakes at a time. The surface heats evenly abd is slick enough to make turning the pancakes easy. The packaging was better than usual: There was styrofoam packing, but the cut-outs minimized the amount of it.
