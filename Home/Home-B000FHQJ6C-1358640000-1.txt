review/summary: Defective from box.review/text: I purchased this, but it was defective from the box. The on/off switch fell off and down inside the machine the first time I touched it. I read the reviews and saw that others had the same problem, but decided to risk it. Amazon customer service is awesome and I received my full refund very quickly. Beware this machine.
