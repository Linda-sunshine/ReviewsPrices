review/summary: Unhappy!review/text: I have had this breadmaker for about 6 weeks now and haven't been able to make one satisfactory loaf of whole wheat bread yet. The loaves are small. The measurements . are too exacting. You are encouraged to weigh yourIngredients which is ridiculous. And some of the measurements are for sixteenths. I am sorry I bought this machine. I have to figure out what to do now. It is too late to return it I think. I will certainly not get anotherBreadmaker through the mail. Too much trouble to return it. Please don't buy this machine. I don't understand why it has gotten good reviews. I will try to call Panasonic and get some help.
