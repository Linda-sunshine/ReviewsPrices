review/summary: Recommendreview/text: I ordered this because Cuisinart is a name that I have purchased several product from over the years and the quality is always great. This doesn't disappoint. Great for soup, sauce and my daughter tells me for making small portions of whipped potatoes. No need to pull out the hand mixer or the big mixer. This does the trick and clean up is easy. The end easily comes off for quick clean up. It came with the nice measuring cup, which I haven't used yet.
