review/summary: Good price and perfect for small apartmentsreview/text: I bought the Mighty Mite about a year ago and have been very pleased. On the plus side, it has very strong suction and enough nozzle variety to get the job done. It is light weight and easy to store. It is perfect for small apartment living. Minor negatives is that the light weight accordion hose sometimes kinks and because the vac is light weight, it will may tip about when you are moving around with it. There is no beater brush, but the brush on the nozzle and the great suction make up for it. For what you pay, it is a very good purchase.
