review/summary: A beautiful knife at a great pricereview/text: This knife is a beauty. We use a ceramic sharpener with it to keep it sharp. The Fibrox handle stays true to it's name by not losing its grip even when wet. However, be forewarned that you shouldn't put this in your dishwasher, as mentioned in the instruction manual, as it'll leave water spots on the handle and will make your blade less sharp. This knife was highly recommended by Cook's Illustrated magazine and it hasn't disappointed us.
