review/summary: Pretty convenient, and space saving!review/text: I love that this slim version doesn't waste too much space in the refrigerator. Have used brita pitchers for years, currently using the ultramax, but going back to this space saver soon. All in all, this is a great product and i get about 3 to 4 glasses out of one pitcher not bad. Wish the filters either lasted longer or cost a bit less though. I really do believe the water tastes some how cleaner or better...but that could just be because it's always cold...Overall, very good product.
