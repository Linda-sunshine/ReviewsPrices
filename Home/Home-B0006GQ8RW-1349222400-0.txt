review/summary: What I needed. Lower price than the store. And you don't have to go to the store.review/text: This was a great way to get a low cost on the Brita Filters for my Pitcher. I like that I needed a few things, added the filters, and recieved free shipping. These filters last about 2-3 months each, and make my horrible water taste great. The price I paid for the filters was lower than that at the store, and with the free shipping for buying other needed things, I'm happy with the purchase. Why go to the store and pay more when the store can come to you and you pay less. Love it!
