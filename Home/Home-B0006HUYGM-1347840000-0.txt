review/summary: One of the BEST items I've purchased.review/text: I never thought I would be so ecstatic about a hand-held vacuum, but let me tell you, this is one of the best purchases I've ever made. Yes, it is a little heavy for a hand-held vacuum, but I'm willing to overlook that for the suction and value this thing provides. I have a small white dog, and an olive green couch. I have used multiple vacuums on the couch to remove her fur and nothing has worked as well as this one. It's easy to clean, the suction is great and the rollers pull up the hair easily. Two swipes over a spot at MOST (95% of the time 1 swipe will do) and all the hair has been removed.If you're looking for a hand-held vacuum that has serious suction power, and isn't going to need recharged every five minutes, look no further. Probably the best $40 I've spent this year.
