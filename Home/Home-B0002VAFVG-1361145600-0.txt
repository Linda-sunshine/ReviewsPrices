review/summary: Like this alotreview/text: The Breville is great!I had a Big Boss Juicer last year. It was mechanically the same type of juicer. The pricing and plastic enclosure made the Boss Juicer seem like an entry level product. It easily stained although it was cleaned immediately. Its hard to evenly compare the 2 products, since I've only had the Breville for a short amount of time. So far I have no complaints.The Boss Juicer started to ware down after about 6 months, but I paid $59.99 for it. I expect the Breville to last longer. There is no comparison in the quality and craft of the individual stainless steel parts of the Breville. It easily snaps together and always looks brand new after cleaning.It seems like the Breville is easier to clean than other juicers reading several reviews. It takes a fraction of the time to clean vs. my old juicer. There isn't much scrubbing involved!The other overwhelmingly positive attribute is the Breville's speed and efficiency. WAY MORE juice comes out of my cucumbers and apples compared to my old juicer. I feel like I'm getting more bang for my buck everytime I juice.Note:The first Breville I ordered had a defective "mesh filter" (here is a picture [...]. I don't think this is an on going problem as other people haven't complained about it, but its something to be aware of. After my 3rd time juicing I heard a pop. Opened up the juicer and discovered that the thin metal mesh broke. Amazon immediately exchanged the Breville. Its been working fine the past month.I think its worth the investment if you are looking to upgrade from an entry level juicer. If you are a first time juicer and plan to use it daily, this is still a great product.
