review/summary: Exactly what I expectedreview/text: This tie rack/organizer was exactly what I was hoping for, which is the reason I gave it 5 stars. There's not much to it, but it's exactly as pictured and advertised. Usually, I get an uneasy feeling about simple purchases like these because, not matter how simple an item may appear, it usually won't work as expected, or comes other than advertised.It comes in 2 parts and snapped easily together, and works well, and saves me headaches from trying to balance my ties on my coat hooks or wire shelving.Great price for it too!
