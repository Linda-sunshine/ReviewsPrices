review/summary: Good toolreview/text: This a must-have tool for every kitchen. It's easy to wash, and it makes cooking anything on a cookie sheet so much easier. The only complaint I'd have is that it picks up grease from whatever you cook on it and feels quite greasy after a while. Other than that, it's easy to use and quite handy.
