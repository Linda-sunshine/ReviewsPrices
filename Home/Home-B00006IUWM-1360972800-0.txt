review/summary: Made my $200 sharpening stone obsoletereview/text: I sharpen knives. I've sharpened a lot of different kinds of knives using a lot of different products. I have gone through dozens and dozens of those hand-held sharpeners, I've used automated sharpeners before (most of which will destroy your knife, truth be told) and I have even taken the time to learn how to use sharpening stones and hone blades myself. I sharpen everyone's knives in my entire apartment complex, I'm known for it. I even shave with a straight-razor, and sharpen that regularly as well. This machine humbles me. I wish I could tell you it cost a couple thousand, which is a lot of money, but it's worth it. Nope. For less than thirty bucks this machine has utterly disgraced me. It'll put an edge on a $5 knife so even and so fine that you could slice through an over-ripe tomato without losing a drop of liquid. I've done it. It requires absolutely no training to use. The knives you hone will go months before their next sharpening, and I cook a lot. I have spent so much time, so much effort learning how to maintain knives and a $30 machine can do it just as well, but five times faster. I just... how... I mean... dammit Presto.
