review/summary: Ummm...Goodreview/text: I wanted a coffee cup that I could put into my briefcase and take to work that wouldn't leak and would be hot when I got to my destination.This is perfect. It doesn't leak when tossed into a shoulder bag, and keeps the liquid hot for hours.I bought the 12 oz cup because I don't drink that much coffee at one time. It's good for one cup of coffee upon arrival or while traveling to work or wherever.The bottle is very well made. Nice to hold. Cool to the touch eveh after the hot coffee has been in it for serveral hours. Slim enough to fit into my briefcase and I can lay it on its side without a drop spilling.I don't drink tea so I can't say anything about the tea infuser. But from the look of it, it will probably work just fine.It is a great product and I would buy another in a heartbeat if needed.Steve
