review/summary: Best value in coffee cremereview/text: The coffee is excellent if you like espresso or black but foamy americano. I am very satisfied with this machine--very good value. Actually makes better coffee than the expensive machines in my opinion. Easy to use. But, I do not use the milk steamer--these are always messy anyway. I hope this machine lasts.A tip--make sure your cup is hot because the water temperature is not too hot to avoid burning the coffee. Also, do not squeeze the grounds to hard unless you really like very strong flavor.
