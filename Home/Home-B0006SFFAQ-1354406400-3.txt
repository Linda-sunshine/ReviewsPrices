review/summary: Great price, classic coffee maker...review/text: Purchased this because of the great price and past experiences with this model (current unit still working perfectly). I figured since I've already owned 2 of these, might as well grab a spare. I would highly recommend this model and is better than the stainless model as it's super easy to clean an keep clean.
