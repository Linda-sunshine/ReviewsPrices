review/summary: A Coffee Lovers Dream Potreview/text: I drink a pot of coffee a day. With than being said I was looking for a replacement for my 10 year old drip maker w/ stainless steel decanter. I never buy glass because that is where the manufacturers scam comes in. They build cheap glass pots so they break often so you need to keep buying them. I am a collector of antique coffee pots made from GE dating back to the early 1900's. I broke out one of my Perculators I had from the 1950's to make some coffee until I could buy a new drip pot and discovered the taste of the coffee was so much better from the Perculator so I decided to look into a more modern peculator to buy. I was reading the reviews on this pot and I bought it. I absolutely love it. It brews a great cup of coffee and then keeps it piping hot right down to the last cup. The price is right too. Drip makers and those awful Kcup brewers can hold a candle to this pot.
