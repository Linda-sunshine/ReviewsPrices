review/summary: Perfect first juicerreview/text: I bought the J8004 at the recommendation of a good friend who has been juicing for years. She used to use a centrifugal juicer, but it didn't do the greens she wanted. I admit that it took me a couple of months to take it out of the box, because I was afraid to use it, but once I did, I've been juicing daily, and absolutely love it. I don't really see any cons to this juicer, because I did my research ahead of time and knew what to expect. The cutting of the produce before inserting into the chute is actually therapeutic. I imagine I am chopping away at all of my health issues. The fact that it's slow is no big deal, because that means I get a larger juice yield with very dry pulp extracted, and I get better quality juice because it's not heated in any way. Amazed at the 10 year warranty. When I go to buy a juicer again, I'll likely purchase an 8005 or 06, but I don't expect to have to for quite a while.
