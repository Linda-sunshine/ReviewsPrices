review/summary: Pocket Scalereview/text: The item arrived on time, packeged good, like new, and works good. It is a good price for this item. I saved at least $10.00. The only thing was that the batteries were dead. So I had to replace them. No problem though. It only takes 2 AAA batteries. Just make sure you give it a few seconds to weigh something out.
