review/summary: Waaay better than my cheap little dirt devilreview/text: I'd purchased a crappy little handheld vac by dirt devil, and the thing had no suction at all (or comparatively little), so my review is based off my previous experience with a product that was laughable at picking anything up. Basically the suction on this thing doesn't suck, the cord is nice and long and coils up nicely at it's base. The detachable nozzle for tight spots is a plus, with a handy dandy nozzle attachment which conveniently has a place of storage in it's rear. The thing is loud, but it does it's job so I'm willing to put up with an otherwise mild irritation. I'll be updating this review after I've given it a go for a few months to see how well the thing lasts. I'm in a VERY sandy/dusty area. I'll pretty much be using it every day. So hopefully it will hold up. But so far a solid little fellow that does what you excepted a handheld vacuum to do.
