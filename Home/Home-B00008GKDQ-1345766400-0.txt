review/summary: Grill/griddlereview/text: Amazon finally matched walmarts online price, or maybe they were napping. Never the less I bought this product for steaks and shrimp, scallops and pancakes. WOW, my neighbor now knows just how GREAT a cook I am. What beautiful crosshatch marks on the boneless ribeye steaks, and the scallops and shrimp were perfect!!! Lodge Logic is THE KING!!! BE VERY careful with certain seasonings, they tend to burn and produce nasty smoke unless you have ventilation to the outdoors. Eg; Kansas City steak seasonings!
