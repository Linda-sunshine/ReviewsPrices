review/summary: A little Awkwardreview/text: It works fine but is a little awkward to fill the containers -- the containers are difficult to fill, as they tend to tip easily while filling. I also have a Holmes humidifier which is much easier to deal with. They do not sell that humidifier anymore so went with the Honeywell.
