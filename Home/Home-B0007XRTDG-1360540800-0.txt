review/summary: Presto 06852 16-Inch Electric Skillet with Glass Coverreview/text: We love this skillet! I've read reviews that caused me to wonder if I wanted this, or not, but my experience is that it has excellent temperature control, from very low temps all the way to frying potatoes and browning meat on the outside before doing the regular cooking of it.The nonstick coating seems very durable, and although the temperature control is partially beneath a handle on the end of the skillet, it is easily visible as I cook.The skillet is easy to clean, as it can be entirely submerged once the controller is removed.We like how large this skillet is, and that we can see through the glass cover, and although the cover does steam up, it continuously runs down and back into the skillet.I certainly recommend this skillet for anyone who needs a large cooking area.
