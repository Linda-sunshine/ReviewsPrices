review/summary: Sleep like a Prince / Princessreview/text: I read all the reviews and was pondering the 1200 thread count Egyptian cotton sheets or this one. Previous reviewers were right, these are the softest sheets ever... feels like butter. Normally (during winter) with my last sheets when you initially get into bed the sheets are cold and takes a few minutes for your body temperature to heat them up. With these sheets I noticed is nice and toasty warm when you get into the bed. I have a California King padded mattress that measures 15 inches high and the fitted sheet fit all the way around the bottom edges perfectly with a small amount of extra slack. After a wash/dry these sheets will most likely shrink so should still fit well. I think these sheets will probably fit up to a 17 inch high mattress. Anyone giving this product a bad review (unless defective product) is cray cray.
