review/summary: wonderful popcorn popperreview/text: Makes popcorn incredibly fast and pops all the kernels. Put the oil in first on high heat, then dump in a measured amount of popcorn. In a few seconds it starts popping and all pops at once. One-third the time of microwave popcorn and twice as much. Turn the crank very slow while popping. I love this thing.
