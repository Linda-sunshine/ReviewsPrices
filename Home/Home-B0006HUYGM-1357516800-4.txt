review/summary: great for cat hairreview/text: I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas to help clean up the pet hair from his two cats. So far, it has been absolutely great at getting into all the small places. He has actually stopped using his regular vacuum and uses this little vac to clean his entire room. REALLY good suction. The only slight set-back is that it is a little bit heavy. Totally worth it though.
