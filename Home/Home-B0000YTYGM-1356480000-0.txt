review/summary: Basket hinge breaks - Defective designreview/text: First off - if I didn't love the way the coffee carafe kept the coffee hot without burning, I would've given it one star. If the coffee maker didn't have this design flaw - I would've given it four or five stars...As others have noted, you have to remember to make there's no coffee in the carafe before adding water and brewing. Also important to keep ball valve on cover clean on the pot and filter.My complaint is that the hinge design is defective. Our first pot broke at the top hinge the first year we had it. I thought it was a manufacturing defect and contacted Cuisinart and they replaced it without question. Five years later, the replacement coffee maker broke in the same spot. Called Cuisinart again and it was out of warranty, so there was nothing they could do. I asked if they sold just the base unit without the $48 stainless steel carafe or even replacement parts and they did not.Unfortunately the stainless steel carafe only works in the DTC-975. The price is now about $100, less than the $150 it was when we bought it. Years before the advent of stainless steel carafes, if the glass carafe broke, you threw it out and spent another $45 for a new coffee maker or $10 for a new carafe.I'm having a hard time shelling out another $100 for a coffee maker - If it hadn't happened broke in the exact same spot I would consider it...
