review/summary: Good unitreview/text: I use it mostly for tea, not coffie. I bought the use your own coffie attachment, works good, but seems the mount of tea I use for one cup, I can make a whole pot the traditional way. I use the k-cups for tea and hot coca and they work fine, but very pricey. All in all nit a bad machine. Can be programed to come on before you wake up and shut down by itself. that way all you have to do is worry about the water level
