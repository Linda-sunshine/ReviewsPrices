review/summary: Worth itreview/text: Pros:GlassMade in ItalyFits in the fridge doorCons:Lid must be removed to pour. A few times people have tried to pour with the lid on and it hasn't ended well.The space between the handle and container is pretty narrow. By doing this It fit's nicely in the door and doesn'ttake too much space. By doing this I can't wrap my hands all the way around the handle...Over all I'm happy with it.
