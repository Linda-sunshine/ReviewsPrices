review/summary: my new favorite thingreview/text: love love love airpopped corn and gave away my popper years ago when moving. i don'th ave a microwave, but when I did I used plain corn in a paper lunch bag.this popper is great, easy, and does the job well and quickly. YUM - with a spray of Trader Joe's olive oil spray and a good sprinkle of sea salt, I am a happy girl who is still watching her weight but loves to chomp on crunchy salty snacks.
