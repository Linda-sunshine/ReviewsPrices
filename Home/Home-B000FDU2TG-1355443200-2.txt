review/summary: Love KitchenAid, but what's with the jar!review/text: I don't know if I got a flawed machine or what, but I've never had trouble before with this blender. But the jar/bowl doesn't fit tight and vibrates something awful. The last one I had was a glass jar. Wondering if that's what makes the difference.
