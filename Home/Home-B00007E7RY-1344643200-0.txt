review/summary: Just as advertisedreview/text: It took less than 5 minutes to set up the 2 purifiers I ordered. I turned them on and it is now a week later with no problems. Don't you love how they want you to review a product when you first get it before you even know whether it is going to work out? If something goes wrong I will do another written review. Be careful to purchase the correct filters to keep the performance you bought this for. A cheaper prefilter is out there that will not remove odors, etc.
