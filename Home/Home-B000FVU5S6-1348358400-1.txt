review/summary: I've suffered no abrasionsreview/text: These sheets are on my bed right now, and in fact I just crawled out of there after a comfortable night's sleep. I've read the complaints about these sheets being 'scratchy' and I suppose that I understand, at least to a degree. But being a commoner, I'm unaccustomed to the pillowy softness and silky delights enjoyed by the slumbering elite. I don't know how much thrashing about the wealthy do, but I've thus far detected no bed sores from sandwiching myself between these sheets. Had I paid $200 for them, perhaps I'd expect the comforts of a traditional harem tent. But I didn't pay $200. Depending on the jurisdiction, a night at Motel 6 would likely cost me more than $50, and these sheets provide no less comfort than I would enjoy at such a fine inn.In other words, I do not expect million dollar performance from dollar item. These are not the softest sheets available, but their cost is commensurate with their performance. I actually enjoy the crispness of the sheets, what others have called 'scratchy.' Depending on your socioeconomic class, you may be disappointed with these sheets. I, however, am not disappointed. A very solid 4 stars.
