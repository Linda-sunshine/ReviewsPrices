review/summary: Heavy bit goodreview/text: This thing weighs a ton. My wife wont use it. But it distributes heat well and has a good cook surface. Make sure you season it well or its a pain to clean. Try not to use soap on this b/c its iron and the oils from cooking prevent it from rusting. If you do use soap, dry thoroughly and wipe with vegetable oil. Dont worry when you heat the thing up, the heat will kill any or all germs that you think are growing on it.
