review/summary: By far the best sheets I have ever slept in period.......review/text: I have had flannel sheets before but man, the first week and they are already pilling. Not these. I will never use another kind of sheets on my bed again. I almost bought some of those supposed (Egyptian Cotton) sheets but finally figured out that they are not Cotton at all but micro fiber polyester junk. So I took the bite and got these instead as they have incredible reviews. You will not be disappointed. I sleep like a baby in these sheets. Very Very nice stuff.
