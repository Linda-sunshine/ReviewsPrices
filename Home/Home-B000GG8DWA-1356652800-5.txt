review/summary: heat output is limitedreview/text: Nice product, quality is good. Output is adequate but limited. We use it for nightime heating source for a 28 ft travel trailer. Not enough heat output when it is under 40 deg.F outside. Thought about returning it but decided to keep it based on quality/price.
