review/summary: Love it for baking!review/text: I love this product for baking. I never have to worry about baked goods sticking to the pan or parchment. I even use this mat for baking chicken, veggies, or toasting bread. I think it is very easy to clean as well. At first I was concerned about the product because it seemed to have a slightly greasy residue after I washed it, but I found out that the texture is normal for the product.
