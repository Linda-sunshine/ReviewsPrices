review/summary: nothing like a ginsureview/text: its true. they can cut through just about anything. even my husband loves them. he used them to help put on half of our addition on our house for anything that needed cutting. l love them. i bought these for my son for christmas. i was just telling him about them because he wanted knives but didnt think i would ever find them again but here they were. so excited. they are in my opinion the best knife i even used in the household kitchen. i dont cook professionally so i dont know that end. but i love them.
