review/summary: Exactly as promisedreview/text: I read reviews before purchasing and decided to go with the All American pressure canner because of the fact that it doesn't have a rubber gasket to replace and uses a weighted pressure gauge. I have now canned 5 batches of vegetables using it as a pressure canner and also canned a batch of pepper relish using it as a water bath canner. It is easy to use and works exactly as described in owners manual. I have had no problems whatsoever. This is a very heavy duty piece of equipment and looks like it will last for years. Lifting it has not been a problem for me as it is only ~ 20 lbs empty and there is never a reason to lift it when it is full. I do get my husband to help when screwing on the lid because it's helpful to have an extra set of hands for this step. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and the fact that the pressure canner is made in the U.S. is an added bonus. I highly recommend it!
