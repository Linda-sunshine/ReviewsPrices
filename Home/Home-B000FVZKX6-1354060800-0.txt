review/summary: Pinzon sheetsreview/text: These flannel sheets are by far the nicest we have ever had. The color matched up great. The only reason I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 rating is after drying I noticed excessive lint build up in the dryer. As I have just purchased these I'm not sure how they will hold up. They are so soft I could sleep in these year round.
