review/summary: No Standard Weights and Measures in Chinareview/text: First of all, it doesn't look like this picture. The &#34;pot&#34; is essentiallya light bulb with a belly. I don't know what &#34;a cup&#34; is in China, or Japan or in France, but in the good ole US of A, its EIGHT OUNCES, so a &#34;4-Cup&#34; coffemaker better be delivering 32 ounces! This one takes in 20 ounces and delivers about 19 after boiling. So, if you were buying this to handle your morning 24oz mug, forget it! The only satisfaction I got out of this was stomping on it to fit into my trash can.
