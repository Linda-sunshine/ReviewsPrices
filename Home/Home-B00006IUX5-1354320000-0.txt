review/summary: Cheap and dirtyreview/text: I bought this product 10 months ago and I am replacing it with another brand.Things I like: I only need it to grind coffee and it works for that. It is very inexpensive.Things I do not like: The grind is uneven. At the bottom of the jar the grind it is very fine but it stays course on the top so it is difficult to judge. The most annoying thing about the grinder is that the tab to turn it on is not fixed so keeps popping off. The grinder has lots of grooves that collect coffee and so it is impossible to keep clean.
