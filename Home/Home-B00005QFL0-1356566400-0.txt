review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I had such high hopes for this machine. I had a very similar Panasonic for years that never failed to produce wonderful bread. This one delivered a baked clump of ingredients each time I tried. Had to send it back to Amazon (who promptly credited my account)--thank you Amazon.
