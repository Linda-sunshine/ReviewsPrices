review/summary: Great productreview/text: Does an excellent job on our carpets. The machine does feel a bit cheap compared to our last shampooer which was a Bissel. This Hoover definitely performs better than the Bissel, I just hope it lasts. We are having the same leaking problem I see others are having. It leaks badly only when we use the hand attachment. I have read from other reviewers that I may have not assembled it properly. I'm going to do what has been recommended to see if that fixes the leak. I will update at that time.
