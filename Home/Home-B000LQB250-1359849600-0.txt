review/summary: Really excellent!review/text: A big improvement in my sleeping comfort! Adds a bit of height, so be aware of that, but comfortable and easy to care for. Also be aware that after initially opening this, it needs to ventilated for 24 hours to get rid of the strong smell from the factory as well as to regain it's loft. These are minor matters, as it is so comfortable!
