review/summary: Makes coffee shop quality coffeereview/text: This percolator makes coffee shop quality coffee. No more buying cheap plastic coffee makers that make muted off tasting coffee! I can finally make a cup of coffee as good as starbucks or dunkin donuts. I saw a lot of negative reviews on this coffee pot about the top breaking, so I ordered an extra glass top (about $5.00 includes shipping) in case this one breaks. This is the only percolator I have found where the lid does not flip forwards and dump hot coffee and grains all over your hand while trying to pour a cup of coffee. The lid on this puppy snaps in nice and tight!
