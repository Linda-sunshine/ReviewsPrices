review/summary: Surprisingly useful!review/text: I bought this one for my mother because I love mine so! I bought it after my huge and ancient yard sale find of a food processor broke (okay fine, I put walnut shells in it. DON'T JUDGE ME). Anyway, I figured this one would be too small to be useful but I had a gift card to Belk and this one was on sale. I have been so pleased with the performance of such a small appliance!Also, I have found this one to be much more useful than my old beast, because it is great for small tasks, which is all I ever do anyway. Not to mention the increased cabinet space. Definitely an appliance I would recommend!
