review/summary: fun designreview/text: I definitely love the design. However, since I bought both the teardrop humidifier of Crane and the Frog I can compare both and I find the frog noisier than the teardrop. The frog stands in my kid's bedroom and the humming does not seem to bother them, however I know it would annoy me. I am thinking of returning this one in favor of another teardrop design. Besides that it is a good product with a good output of humidity, easy to fill and keep clean.
