review/summary: WOW!review/text: I can't believe I waited all this time to buy this. Not only does it cost less to use regular popcorn you are not adding all the fat and who knows what else that those bags contain. If you desire the real taste of butter it even melts it for you. The only draw back I could find was getting the salt to stick, but using a small amount of butter or flavored oil solves the problem.I would purchase this over and again, needless to say, I'm sold on this air popper.
