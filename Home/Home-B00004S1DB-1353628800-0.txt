review/summary: excessive coffee groundsreview/text: The main gripe I have about this coffee press is that it allows a lot of coffee grounds to escape into the brewed coffee when depressing the press. Not sure why this happens. The two nice things about it are that the coffee stays hot longer than with a glass press, and it does not break. (I broke my Bodum.) Not sure if the these benefits outweigh the annoyance of the escaping grounds.
