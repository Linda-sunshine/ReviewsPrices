review/summary: quick & easy to use wine openerreview/text: I've had this for almost two years and drink wine a couple of times a week. The foil cutter is very convenient and the opener itself has never failed me. Cork comes out quickly, cleanly and simply. I have also bought two as gifts for friends who liked mine and they now love theirs too!
