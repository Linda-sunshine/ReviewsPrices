review/summary: More like an evaporative coolerreview/text: We heat with a wood stove, and need to add moisture to our dry house. This is like having an evaporative cooler blowing inside the house - the air becomes very cool when it passes through this thing. Nobody wants to be near it, or have it in their room. And it is loud, unless you use the lowest setting, then it tends to hum. We are not really satisfied with this thing. It's going back.I would not recommend this this if you have to be anywhere near it.
