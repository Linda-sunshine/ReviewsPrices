review/summary: Excellent pressure canner!review/text: I love knowing I don't have to worry about replacing a rubber seal. I've canned twice with this so far and it works great. Excellent instructions and a very sturdy product. I have a smooth glasstop stove and have had no problems. It maintained the correct pressure the entire canning time. I would definitely recommend this canner.
