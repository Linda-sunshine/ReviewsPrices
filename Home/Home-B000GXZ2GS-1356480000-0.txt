review/summary: Fast, easy to clean, but filter movesreview/text: This works quickly and is easy to clean. My French press has to be disassembled but this is much easier. My only complaint is that the filter moves slightly, even if you wet it to keep it in place. So I find a few small bits of cocoa in my cup. I don't drink coffee, so I only use this for brewing Choffy and tea. The clean-up isn't as messy as a traditional French press.
