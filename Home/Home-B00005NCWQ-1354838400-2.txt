review/summary: Best coffee pot everreview/text: Getting back to basics, this coffee pot does not require electricity!! My mom always perked her coffee, she said it tastes better. I have lost power so many times, and need my coffee. Since I have a gas stove, I am lucky enough to light the stove with a lighter, and now can enjoy coffee anytime no matter what. I have been using this percolator every day since the power came on. The taste is delicious.
