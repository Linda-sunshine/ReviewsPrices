review/summary: Quits working after a few monthsreview/text: Have had this machine for 10 months now. The two cup size version. After several months it quit working; it would not pump water into its internal tank (it was trying to pump water because the motor was running, but no water was being transferred) and turned on the blue light indicating the external water tank was empty. The external tank was full. I followed the troubleshooting procedures in the manual to no avail. The only way to clear the problem was to unplug it after brewing a cup and then plug it back in. Contacted customer service and was sent a new unit. The new unit worked fine for several months and then the same problem started again with this unit. (I strictly use bottled water, no tap water.) I again contacted customer service and was sent yet another unit. Again, with this third unit, the same problem started again, only with this unit, the problem has been intermittent so far. When it fails completely, I'm going to throw it out and go buy a Mr. Coffee or something similar. As far as I am concerned, this Keurig Elite is another example of a piece of Chinese made junk. What a waste of money.
