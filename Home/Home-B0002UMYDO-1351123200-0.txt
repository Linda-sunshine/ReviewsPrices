review/summary: West Bend Electric Can Openerreview/text: Poor quality; received the can opener from Amazon and lasted about a week; opened about 4 or 5 cans before it stopped working. It got stuck on a can while opening it and i had to unplug it for it to stop making a piercing sound. Plugged it back in and all it would do is buzz and not open cans. Returned to Amazon.
