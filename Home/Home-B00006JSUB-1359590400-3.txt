review/summary: Love Love Itreview/text: I needed one of these for our hunting camp, ours was so old and justwasn't in good shape anymore. I had been looking over the Christmasholidays in different stores and they were at least $30. So I decided tocheck Amazon and boy was I surprised! I ordered one and used it a coupletimes at home to make sure it wasn't going to stick, etc and I fell in love withit! So back to Amazon and ordered another one, now I have one for thecamp and one for the house. Love it! No sticking, not even eggs, just perfect cooking!
