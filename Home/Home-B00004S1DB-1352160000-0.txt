review/summary: Good Productreview/text: Keeps Coffee hot for a few hours and warm for a few more. The one thing they forgot is to insulate the lid, so there is some heat loss out of the top. Also the metal screen bends way to easy and lets some of the coffee grounds through. Overall great product, don't have to worry about this one breaking, and have warm coffee for hours.
