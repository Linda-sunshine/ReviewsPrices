review/summary: BLOWN AWAY with Ecopad for Senseo!!review/text: I inherited the Senseo. Could NOT stand the taste of the accompanying coffee-pods! UGH~extremely bitter! Sooo, since I have ALWAYS adored Dunkin Donuts coffee, I wondered how the Ecopads would handle their grind?UNBELIEVABLE!!! Not sure HOW this coffeemaker manages to extrude ALL that incredible flavor, but IT DOES!! I've run some comparison brewing too: used our 12 cup coffee maker & compared to the Ecopad, and EVERYTIME, the cup of coffee made using Ecopad WINS! SO close to the flavor you get from actually going to DD to buy a brewed cup!!!I bought the 2 pack, but, have just kept reusing 1. I can get 2 TBS of DD coffee grinds into the little plastic pod, SNAP it down, AND I can make a 12oz. cup of FANTASTIC DD Coffee!!It is VERY EZ to fill!VERY EZ to snap!!VERY EZ to clean!!!I HIGHLY recommend this!
