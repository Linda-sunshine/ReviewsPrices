review/summary: Lid breaks easilyreview/text: I love everything about this pitcher except for the lid, which kind of ruins everything else. I like how it looks, I like the thick glass, I'm fine with the handle. THE LID: I understand it's supposed to seal and then you take it off to pour. Mine broke (something in it snapped) within the first two weeks of use, so there is no sealing anymore. Also, most people who are not used to using it (like guests) expect to pour it with the lid on, which creates a disaster (lots of spilled liquid) if someone besides yourself tries to serve themselves with it. If it had a different lid, I would buy this again. My spouse hates it, but I've learned to live with it.
