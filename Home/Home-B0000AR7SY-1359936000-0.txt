review/summary: cheapreview/text: too many parts, too much cleaning, just a big pain in the butt that you'll never use and if you do use it, you'll spend half of the rest of your life cleaning it every use so you don't have stale tasting coffee leftovers in it. I have a hand grinder now that is very simple to use and clean.
