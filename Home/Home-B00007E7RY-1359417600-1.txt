review/summary: Works very wellreview/text: My dog and I both have asthma, and my (very small) cabin is decorated in &#34;early library&#34;, so it's impossible to get rid of the dust. This product cleans the air very, very well. We haven't had an attack since I got it (that's just our personal experience though, it may not work the same for others). I can't fault the quality of this product.However, it's ugly as sin and somewhat inconvenient for a relatively small space, since you have to keep it away from the wall according to instructions. I couldn't do that, since it would then end up sort of in the middle of my living space. LOLIt might be loud for some people, but it certainly doesn't bother me on a lower setting.
