review/summary: Great coffee when it worksreview/text: This coffee grinder grinds great coffee at many different settings. I love it when it works. Unfortunately the design is very counter intuitive and it seems as though it was designed to break. For instance, there is a part of the grinder you need to clean EVERY TIME you grind coffee. It is exactly the same color and look on top and on the bottom. So one can easily insert it upside down by accident. If you dare try to put the clear recepticle on top, you will literaly break the machine. In order to fix it, my husband (who understands electrical wiring) had to pull the entire machine apart and reassemble. It took him over an hour. This has now happened 3 times with different people handling the machine. And this is not the only "trap" one can fall with this machine. There are plenty of other little mistakes one can easily make and lose there coffee as aresult of the poor design. I would also not expect to have to clean an expensive machine every single time and imediately after I use it. After using this for one year, I finally gave up. I am buying something that has a smarter design and is more user friendly, even if I have to spend more.
