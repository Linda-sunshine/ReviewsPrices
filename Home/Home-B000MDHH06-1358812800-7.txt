review/summary: Very pleased with this juicer!review/text: This was my first time purchasing a juicer and went with the Breville BJE200XL because of the ratings and customer reviews. Used it for the first time yesterday and was very pleased at how easy it was to assemble, to use, and to clean. I'd recommend this juicer to everyone!
