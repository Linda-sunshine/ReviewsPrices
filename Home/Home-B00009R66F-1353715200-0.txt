review/summary: My carpets are clean again!review/text: I bought this carpet cleaner to replace another Hoover that had lasted many years. This one got the best reviews on all the websites I researched, so my purchase was based on that. I have two teenage boys, so spills on the carpet are frequent. This Hoover took out some old stains (soda, pet, unknown) with ease. I have found that using the detergent actually makes the carpet get dirty faster, so I use only very hot water with 1/2 cup of white vinegar added. The carpet comes out great (and no, it doesn't smell like vinegar). This cleaner is easy to use. Only con is it is heavy when both tanks are full, but not to heavy to push and pull. The key to getting carpet clean and dry is to take your time and go very slowly.
