review/summary: Not for mereview/text: Pillow feels squishy and soft - until you put it on the bed and try to sleep on it. Too much fill, not enough give. Too big for under my neck, causing my head to be at an awkward angle. Gave it three days, went back to my old pillow.Might be good for someone with a bigger frame than me, or likes a very firm pillow.
