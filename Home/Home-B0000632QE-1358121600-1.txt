review/summary: An excellent product!review/text: I've had this now for over a year and use it frequently.Pluses: The blades are very sharp and so cut well. It's lightweight, the various blades are easy to snap in and out, clean-up is a breeze, and it sits compactly on my counter where I'll see and use it often.Minuses: The white plastic is prone to discoloring with foods such as pickles that have food coloring in them. I believe it's an oversight not to include or offer a shredding blade. Being fairly narrow limits its use a little; i.e., you can't slice large onions on it.I recommend you cut or shred cheese with a device other than this one. It just doesn't work well and you can't just rinse it off and set in the drainer to dry.
