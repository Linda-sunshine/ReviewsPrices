review/summary: Great knifereview/text: I bought this after reviews from Cook's Illustrated graded this as their top choice. (It replaced the Wusthof Grand Prix Chef's Knife which was discontinued by the company.) It is inexpensive and easy to handle. The grip is not smooth, but a roughened texture which keeps it secure in your hand. It is shaped well and easy to use. I usually prefer a heavier blade, but this is good and a well-balanced item.
