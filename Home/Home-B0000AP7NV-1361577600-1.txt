review/summary: Black particlesreview/text: I read the reviews prior to purchasing the Brita water filter, and saw that a few people had noticed black particles in their water. Because this wasn't consistent across all reviews, I went ahead and placed an order. Unfortunately, I seem to be having the same problem. Though I followed instructions provided by Brita (I.E. soak the filter; clean the pitcher thoroughly; throw out first few jugs of filtered water), I am still finding the black specs in my water. Some reviewers had mentioned they had only seen the residue in the top chamber of the jug, but I am seeing it both at the top and in the jug itself where the 'filtered' water is kept.Because the filter is still relatively new (I have been using the product for 3 days now), I am going to give it the benefit of the doubt that this will stop after a few more filtration's of water. If not, I will be returning the item.Aside from the black particles, however, there are no additional issues with the pitcher. It filters water quickly enough if you fill the pitcher with a very slow stream. I also have not had any issues with neither the lid nor size of the pitcher itself.
