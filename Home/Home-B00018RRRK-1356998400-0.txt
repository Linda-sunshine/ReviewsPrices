review/summary: This critter has served me well for yearsreview/text: Prior to purchasing this "Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill" I ether used a small electric hand helps grinder or spent some time cleaning (beating) the grinder at the store to get the previous purchaser's smelly coffee out before using it.Now there are several grinder options available out there and you may want to read through the list. This one has all the culinary correct options. At first it was just fun trying the different options. Everything tasted better just because some effort was put into grinding.As time goes by taste and preparation options can change. What saved this device from becoming a dust collector or a cabinet ordainment, are the differences in preparation devices. Going from drip to bistro required a different grind and the option to adjust is in the dial from the 18-position grind selector, from ultra fine to coarse. Even after becoming too lazy to grind everyday some coffee only comes in whole bean form. Now I am getting old and in a hurry a package or too of whole bean was bought by accident when sitting next to the ground version.Today I still find this elegant looking and utilitarian grinder useful to grind my own coffee preference. I carry just enough for the day in a paper bag on the days I commute to work. I cannot stand that stuff in a can (it smells like coffee but it tastes like words I refuse to put into a review.)
