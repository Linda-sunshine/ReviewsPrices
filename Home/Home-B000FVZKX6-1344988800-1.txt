review/summary: Poor sewing of the fitted sheetreview/text: Received the set promptly after ordering. Washed the sheets before using. Removed the fitted sheet from the dryer and the pockets were coming apart at two corners. Had to sew up the pockets before we could use them. Don't expect the sheets will last thru the up coming winter. Would not buy again!
