review/summary: Perfectreview/text: Made bread in this bread maker for the first time, the bread came out perfect. It had a nice golden crust with moist, tasteful bread. I see a lot of crazy reviews on these type of machines and believe fully that most bad reviews are due to operator error. Reading all the directions and following the measurement to the word is a must if you want perfect bread from any machine.
