review/summary: Love itreview/text: I have wrist and elbow problems, so I was looking for a can opener that was easy. I found it!! My 10 year old son can use this thing. I would recommend this to anyone who has limited strength in hands and or arms. Well built, seems like it going to last a long time. I am buying another one for my elderly parents.
