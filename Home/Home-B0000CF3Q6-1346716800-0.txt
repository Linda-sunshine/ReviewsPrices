review/summary: Shots, Not Cups!review/text: The product arrived in a timely manner, and there were no problems with condition. My only complaint is that this is a three-SHOT espresso maker, not a three-cup one. it is VERY small and probably will not hold 1, 8oz cup. My mistake due to semantics. I'll keep it and give it as a gift, but I've already ordered a 9 SHOT maker for myself.
