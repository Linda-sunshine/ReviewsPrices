review/summary: Yes, it works, noise and first &#34;new&#34; odor as expectedreview/text: I ordered this item, got here on time. I knew it was going to be a noisy one to start. The new smell, this, it took about 3 days of full usage to get rid of. However, I can tell the air is cleaner and my sinus is less stuffy. The airflow of this thing is very noticeable. Does it cycle the entire bedroom within an hour? May be..., I would not be surprised.I give you guys one more interesting function for those with small children (or kids at heart):This can function as a wind generator for levitating balloons. My son successfully put 3 balloons circling around&above; the unit for 10-20 seconds at a time. This occupied my son for 30 min. Awesome. It occupied me for 10 min. That is a bonus. Make sure to put the unit against the corner of the room.Enjoy!
