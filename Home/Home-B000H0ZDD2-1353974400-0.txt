review/summary: Whisper Technology' my foot!review/text: Arrived with the motor fan bent or broken (cannot tell for sure), made horrible clicking/grinding sounds. Tried to exchange it because product had good reviews and I thought it could just be the one I received. Could not exchange, just return for a refund. This was louder than my exhaust fan in the bathroom. Item arrived on time and as described (not counting the fan).
