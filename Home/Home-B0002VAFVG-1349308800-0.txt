review/summary: &iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!review/text: I believed the good reviews over the bad reviews which was a big mistake! After having my juicer for 2 weeks I returned it. THE BLADE WENT DULL! And this was after I carefully followed the directions on cleaning it. Another problem is the amount of waste from using this juicer vs. using a Vitamix. Most of the produce is shot out in the waste compartment vs. a small yield of juice. With the Vitamix I use the same amount of produce and made almost twice as much juice with only a golf ball size of pulp vs. over a quart size of wasted produce from the Breville.Instead of throwing your money away on the Breville juicer invest in a Vitamix instead. You'll get more uses out of a Vitamix with much less waste and easier clean up. Yes, you do have an extra step with getting juice from a Vitamix because you have to strain out the juice, but it's still easier than having to clean all the pieces and parts to the Breville. Not to mention all the extra nutrients and juice you will get from a Vitamix vs. the waste and poor juice yield on the Breville. Add to that the poor quality of the Breville! A dull blade after 2 weeks of use!!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Invest in a Vitamix instead!
