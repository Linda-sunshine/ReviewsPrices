review/summary: great coffee potreview/text: I am really enjoying my new Cuisinart. I have used Gevalia coffee pots for years and I have always had good luck with them - until the recent one. Gevalia must have changed the design of their carafe and no matter what I tried, I always had a counter full of coffee. So, I did some searching and found this Cuisinart. What a great find! I like the auto programming features and that I can set the coffee to the temperature that I like. I also like that I can have it shut off immediately after brewing or 4 hours later - that is a great feature. What I like best is that I can now pour a cup of coffee in the morning and that it goes in my cup instead of all over the counter.
