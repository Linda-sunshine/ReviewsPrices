review/summary: Just Okayreview/text: These are not wonderful, just okay. On some jars, they don't even screw down tight--go beyond where they should stop, and then are just loose again. I've decided to keep glass mayo jar lids as an alternative. These lids are fine for refrigerator storage or dry storage, if you aren't needing things to not leak. I make my own fresh pickles and pickled ginger, so wanted something that would withstand the corrosion from the vinegar that eats up the metal lids and rusts them to the bottles. So far, they did not screw down tightly on the quart bottle of pickled ginger, and I almost spilled the whole thing getting it out of the refrigerator. That bottle now has a mayo lid on it.
