review/summary: Too many Battery Powered 'sticks' have hit the trash.review/text: I needed a GOOD stick vacuum for wood and tile floors, one that would actually 'suck it up' rather than push debris around as I took the unit for a walk.THIS IS IT !Cord length is great, suction is great, style / appearance is fine.YES, I would highly recommend the Hoover Flair S2220.
