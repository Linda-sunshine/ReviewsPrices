review/summary: dehydrating peppers and roma tomatoesreview/text: I dehydrated 2 1/2 gal of habenero peppers and @ 30 roma tomatoes. It did a wonderful job and I let it run for 3 days. I then ground up the habenero peppers in the food processer and put it into a pepper shaker. It is awesomely hot. It did a great job.
