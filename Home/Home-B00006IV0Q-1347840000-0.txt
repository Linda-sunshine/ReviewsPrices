review/summary: Every percolated coffee drinker should have onereview/text: What makes it different from most is the stainless steel parts inside, rather than aluminum. Coffee is acidic, so it leaches away aluminum from most percolators, and people drink it. Aluminum is known to cause birth defects and might possibly play some role in Alzheimer's disease (a controversial subject). There are probably other problems with aluminum we haven't yet discovered. Therefore, it's probably best to avoid the stuff.Anyway, we have no complaints about the new percolator. It works great, and it brews safe coffee.
