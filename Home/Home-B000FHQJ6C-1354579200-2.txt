review/summary: Juicerreview/text: This is my firsts juicer ever. I was told that the worst thing about a juicer is cleaning it and the second worst thing is to have to cut up fruit and vegetables in small pieces. I went to look for a juicer that is easy to clean and takes big bites and I found the Hamilton Beach Big Mouth juicer. I don't have any comparison since it is my firsst juicer. The pulp is super dry and easy to remove. It came with a tip to put a plastic grocery bag into the large container to catch the pulp. This works great. No mess.I like it so much that I put it on my list to give as Christmas presents.
