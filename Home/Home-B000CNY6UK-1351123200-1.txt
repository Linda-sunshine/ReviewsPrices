review/summary: Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Makerreview/text: A wonderful espresso maker-- great quality! We're saving mega $$$ on coffee now that we can make our own excellent espresso at home! It's so easy-- instructions on the box are great. Wish we had bought it ages ago. Price is very good compared to stores we visited. We almost bought a 3-cup espresso maker for same price as this 6-cup espresso maker at local store-- glad we waited and checked Amazon!
