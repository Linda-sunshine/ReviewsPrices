review/summary: GREAT clock radio!!!!review/text: I have had the same clock radio for about 20 years, and I was so sad that it was dying because I didn't think I could find one I liked as much. I was wrong. I LOVE this clock radio. It's much smaller than my old one, but has all the same great features. I bought one for me and one for my hubby. We especially love that it has two alarm settings - we use one for weekdays (getting out of bed for work, ugh) and one for weekends (sleeping in a bit longer, yeah). The radio reception is fine - not fantastic, but rarely is clock radio reception fantastic. This isn't mean to be a house stereo, so not sure why people complain about the reception. I would purchase this again, and as a gift!
