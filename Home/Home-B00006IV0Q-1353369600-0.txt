review/summary: It's Aluminum Inside!review/text: Was so happy when this arrived today, but when I looked inside, the little well at the bottom where the perc stem settles into looked very dull and dark. Like aluminum. I thought, no way, the reason to buy stainless steel is to avoid aluminum. So I called Presto's customer service who confirmed that indeed, the well is aluminum! Unbelievable! Have an order in for UPS pick-up tomorrow. Amazon BTW gets 10 stars for their excellent, painless, free return policy!
