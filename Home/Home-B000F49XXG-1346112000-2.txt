review/summary: Awesome product for the price!review/text: My wife and I had been using a Mr. Coffee Walmart special and it didn't make the best espresso, but for capuccino, it was a cheap solution. It died.I did a LOT of research on a replacement machine. I noticed that there were negative reviews on everything from $30 on up to $3,000. I'm thinking "There's no way I'm spending $3,000 on a machine I may not be happy with!" Actually, there's no way I'm spending $3,000 on a coffee machine, PERIOD. My wife's a coffee snob though and has friends that have and so she was more willing than I.I found this one and noticed the high ratio of satisfied to unsatisfied customers and pled my case that if we didn't like it, at least we hadn't committed a whole lot of $$$ and then we could try the "you-get-what-you-pay-for route".I must admit I read all the reviews and tips on how to make the best cup of coffee using this machine and it paid off - my wife says I made her the best cup of coffee she had ever had using this, the Hario mini mill, Terry's tamper, and some African beans another connoisseur friend of hers gave her for Christmas.We've been using it for 8 months and the only negative is that the steamer sometimes drips a bit - but we haven't cleaned it once since we got it, so maybe it time for a bit of maintenance!
