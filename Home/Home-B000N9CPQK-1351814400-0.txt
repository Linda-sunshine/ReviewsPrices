review/summary: NEGATIVE STARS!!!review/text: I don't know how some people say that it produces "white noise." The thing sounds like an airplane warming up its engines even on LOW setting. I really want to like this product but I can't ignore its presence in the room. It's all I can think about! Is my product defective? I'll post a video review later when I get over the flu.. I wonder if I'll be able to sleep through the sound even with all the NyQuil.. The only thing I like about it so far is that it ejects cool air instead of hot air. At least it isn't heating up the room.Update:It's now broken and just sitting atop my shelf. Don't buy this. It's junk as far as I can tell. I used it lightly and only few times a week really due to all the noise even on low setting.
