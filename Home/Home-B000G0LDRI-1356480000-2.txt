review/summary: No white residue, no constant refills!review/text: I hemmed and hawed over which humidifier to buy. I live in NC, so while winters are mild, they can still be very dry. I bought this product hoping to avoid our seasonal dry sinuses and to keep from static-shocking our pets. Our old humidifier had to be refilled constantly, and couldn't be trusted to run overnight without emptying completely. This one is totally different! I run it with fan on low, with the humidity level on two raindrops ( goes from one to four). For our 1200 sq ft single-level ranch home, we only fill it once a week. It isn't as quiet as I'd like, but it doesn't run all the time. It rolls easily and the tanks are easy to pick up and carry, and it doesn't put out a white residue or leak like other types of humidifiers. I am very pleased with my purchase and have recommended it to family members who need to replace older units.
