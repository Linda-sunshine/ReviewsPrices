review/summary: Love this mixer!review/text: I just recently purchased this mixer from a different retailer. They sent me this version vs. the classic that I originally ordered. I decided to pay the difference and just keep the one they sent me. I love it! Previously I had a Sunbeam Heritage Series Mixmaster. That doesn't even compare to this. The KitchenAid doesn't push all the ingredients to the outer side of the bowl like my Sunbeam did. It mixes very well and I rarely have to scrape the bowl. I just purchased the flex beater attachment, which hasn't come yet. Today I made sugar cookies and it mixed the dough so well.I also love how you can get attachments with this machine. Since I invested a bit in this machine, I will have to wait to start purchasing the separate attachments.I really believe this is a wonderful quality machine. It mixes so well and can do so many different things. I used to think it was just for cookies or cakes. I am now making my families bread and I have created a lot of main dish meals with this mixer. I am so happy to have this sitting on my kitchen counter.
