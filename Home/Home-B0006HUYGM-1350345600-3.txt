review/summary: Finally, a small vac that works.review/text: I ordered this on Saturday, it got delivered on Monday, and I'm giving it 5 stars on Tuesday. Simply put, it works better than any vac we've tried, and we've tried many. We've been through full size uprights, canister vacs, stick vacs, and one other handheld. None of them worked well for removing pet hair from carpeted stairs. The smaller vacs were all missing a rotating brush and the big vacs with the rotating brush were too unwieldy on the stairs. This vac has excellent suction *and* the all important belt-driven brush. It took me less than 10 minutes to clean a dozen hair infested stairs. The carpet looks new again. I thought the riser tool was just a gimmick, but it really works well. And the hose detaches easily and quickly for hitting the corners. Someone with pets and stairs must have designed this vac. The debris cup emptied easily and held enough hair to make another cat. My wife suggested we save a step next time and just vacuum the cats. :-)Highly recommended for folks with pets.P.S.- Someone mentioned this vac was loud. I thought it was whisper quiet compared to our Dust Devil handheld. That vac requires ear muffs.
