review/summary: wow - fresh bread anytime! yummy one too!review/text: Love this machine! Bought it less than a month ago and already made probably 20 loafs! so that means the thing already paid for itself!!! I used to make bread by hand and I make artisan breads which require long waiting, kneading, and waiting again and kneading again! got tired of it yet still wanted nice organic bread that was healthy and cheap (organic hearty breads go for $4-7 a loaf in stores).Here's the best part: I place the ingredients in the machine, set the timer and go to sleep!!!!! We wake up to a wonderful aroma and my daughter takes sandwiches to school with freshly baked bread! how awesome is that!?.Machine is super easy to use, just be precise with the measurements or if you make adjustments (I do sometimes) do it gradually... It comes with the manual that has recipes for 28 breads! yep - don't bother buying bread machine books, this is plenty, trust me!On the funny note, we had 2 potlucks at work and brought whole wheat bread, multi-grain bread, cinnamon walnut bread. Result: 4 more people will be buying the machine! LOL! did I say i bought it less a month ago?
