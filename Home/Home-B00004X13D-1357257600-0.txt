review/summary: Gift of My Dreamsreview/text: My grandson, now 16, put Waffle Iron on his wish list. I honored his wish and was richly rewarded: huge smile when he opened the box. He went home after our celebration and at about 8 pm made his first waffle and e-mailed the photo of it to me. Since then he has tried various combinations of mix and sauces, reporting to me his true enthusiasm for it. It makes perfect waffles; can even make 1/4 waffle for a quick snack. It is easily cleaned, can be stored easily, and mostly makes the perfect waffle at any time of night or day.
