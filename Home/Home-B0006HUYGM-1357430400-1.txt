review/summary: I love itreview/text: I love this vacuum. I got it specifically for our carpeted stairs stairs, which are one long flight, meaning that I had to balance our upright vacuum cleaner on the stairs to reach some of the steps with the hose. This works better than the upright's hose attachment because of the brush. I also love that this has a hose attachment, and I prefer it to the hose on our regular vacuum, because it's so easy to carry the whole thing around and not struggle to reach the hose into odd positions. Unlike some reviewers, I personally didn't find it excessively heavy--I'm actually surprised it's possible get such good suction in such a small unit.
