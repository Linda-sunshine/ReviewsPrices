review/summary: I'm sold!review/text: I just received and used my Breville Juice Fountain! I made Apple-Carrot Juice.I am the current owner of a Hurom Juicer, which I love! The problem with the Hurom is that it requires a lot of prep, which I don't mind because prepping food for cooking or juicing relaxes me. But, my husband does not enjoy prepping like I do, so I wanted to get a juicer that would still do the job, as well as being easy enough for him to use without waiting on me.Pros-The price is $99.95 on Amazon! You can't beat it for the quality and quantity of juice that you're getting!-It is a beautiful machine.-It is easy to clean (as instructed in the manual, I filled the kitchen sink up with hot soapy water so that I could put the juicer parts in it as soon as I finished juicing). Cleaning was a breeze.-The built in froth separator is my favorite perk of this machine! I normally would use a big spoon to remove the froth from the juice I made with the Hurom.-It is not time consuming to use. When I make V8 juice, I plan on setting aside at least 30-45 minutes to prep and juice 32 ounces. I look forward to reducing this time by using the Breville!Cons-None so far!I was initially concerned about the splatter that I read about in the reviews. I did not have this problem because I made sure that I had the food pusher at the top of the chute ready to push the food down as soon as I dropped it in.
