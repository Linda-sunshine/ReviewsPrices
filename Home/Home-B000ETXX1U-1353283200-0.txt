review/summary: Not so greatreview/text: Bought this Wenzel Insta-Bed Queen Raised Sure Grip Bottom with built-in Pump. Not a happy camper. My wife and I tried to sleep on it. Both of us keep rolling to the center and it looses air each night. I think I would have better off buying two twin beds and pushing them together.
