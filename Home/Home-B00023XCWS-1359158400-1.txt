review/summary: Good productreview/text: Nice electric kettle. Like other's have mentioned, there is a rather noticeable plastic smell when new. I simply cycled water through it quite a few times, smell/taste is gone.We use this kettle for hot water when we travel (if there isn't a coffee maker in the room), boils water quickly (~1.5-2 min when full), and not too noisy.Good product, would buy again.
