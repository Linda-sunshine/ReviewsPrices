review/summary: French Press coffee maker 34 OZreview/text: I have several of these (stored away now) since once I used the first on I figured it will eventually break and I hate finding something that works well and not having the ability to get more at a future date is aggravating (no, I'm hot one of those). No problems with functioning of the press and yes, there will be some grounds that get into your coffee. Suck it up or grind your own using a less fine grind.
