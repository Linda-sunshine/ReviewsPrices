review/summary: The Greatestreview/text: I got a Whirley-pop for Christmas two years ago. My first thought, like some other reviewers, was that it was very thin and light-weight. After reading the instructions, I tried it and changed my mind. What a difference stirring the corn and oil makes over shaking it in a pot. My stove top heats very slowly and seems like it has two speeds, on and off so I tend to use this on the high setting. I've never had it stick or burn except for the time I added to sugar to make kettle-corn. The high speed was a mistake for that. This little device creates the most tender, fluffy corn I've ever had. You will never be able to eat microwave corn again! I highly recommend the Whirley-pop!
