review/summary: Spectacular!review/text: I have never struggled with obesity, and I don't have a terrible diet (except, perhaps, on the weekend). However, I was noticing that I was struggling to have sufficient energy after lunch to complete the work I needed to complete. As a result, I asked for and received the Breville Juice Fountain for Christmas. I was skeptical that it would make the difference I was hoping for. I was also skeptical that I would stick with the regiment, since I expected the juice to taste terrible if it had too many vegetables included. I had a plan. I decided to substitute at least 4 lunches per week with juice. Every day must be made from at least 50% vegetables. I have had the product for approximately 1.5 months and I cannot be more pleased with the results! First, the juices were delicious! Second, while the results are impressive, I found that if you include even the smallest part of a beet, the juice will look and taste like a beet. Third, While I am not exactly jumping off the walls, I haven't had this much energy in the afternoon in several years. Fourth, I am still using it daily and have not failed to use it for 4 lunches per week since I started in the end of December.I highly recommend this product to anyone seeking to be a little healthier!
