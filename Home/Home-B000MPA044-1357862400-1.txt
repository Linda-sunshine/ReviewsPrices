review/summary: Great Pressure Cookerreview/text: I love this pressure cooker, easy to use, definately cooks beans and meats in less time. However, with only 3 uses the non stick pot coating is peeling, but the cooker still works. Another thing I wanted to point out is that eventhough it says that beans takes about 20 mins, you still have to wait for the cooker to heat up so make sure you add an additional 5-8 mins to your cooking time and if you are using the natural release option that is another 10 mins. Overall, I'm satisfied with this product, hope it lasts long time.
