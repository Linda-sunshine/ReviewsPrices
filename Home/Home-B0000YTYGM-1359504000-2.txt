review/summary: BEST THERMAL CARAFE COFFEEMAKER EVERreview/text: I've previously owned two of this model; both were factory refurbished. When the second one 'bit the dust' unexpectedly and at the most inconvenient time -- a week before Christmas -- I searched local stores for a replacement. Let me tell you, it's almost impossible to find a 12-cup thermal carafe coffeemaker! Reluctantly, I chose a 10-cup Calphalon brewer. WHAT a mistake! Worst appliance I've EVER owned. Could not wait to receive my new Cusinart. It's a breeze to set up, doesn't drip all over the counter if I choose to pour myself a cup while it's still brewing and even 10 hours + later, when I empty the carafe to set up for tomorrow, the coffee remaining from the morning is still hot!! My Cuisinart gives me a smooth start every morning.
