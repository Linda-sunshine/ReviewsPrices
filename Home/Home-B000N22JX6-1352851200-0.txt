review/summary: Heaters I recommend!review/text: I bought one heater last year and was impressed enough to buy two more this year. I live in the mountains in a small cottage (1050 sq ft) and use oil heat which is expensive. These heaters fill my home with warmth and has saved me hundreds & hundreds of dollars on oil cost. Savings so far this year (2012): $400.00I do use all 3 heaters at once in different areas.They have settings and oscillation. They work, they're quiet and they are attractive.So... If you are looking for extra warmth this heater (Lasko 6435 Designer Series Ceramic Oscillating Heater with Remote Control (Kitchen)Lasko) is the one I recommend.
