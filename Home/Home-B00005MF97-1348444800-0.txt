review/summary: Inadequate processing/pureeing/choppingreview/text: Very disappointed with B&D mini food chopper/processer. It does NOT do a good, or even adequate, job at chopping/processing small quantities. I believe the problem lies in the design/placing of the blades; odd size pieces are always left behind. When I try to puree veggies/herbs (with sufficient liquid to get a paste/puree), there is always ~1/4 to 1/3 that does not get incorporated. Same issue with "chopping" (quick pulses), small-to-large pieces left behind; also, I have to open and mix contents to get it to incorporate/chop. Never have this issue when using full-sized Cuisenart food processor (same techniques); the B&D chopper just lacks a good blade placement/design for processing.
