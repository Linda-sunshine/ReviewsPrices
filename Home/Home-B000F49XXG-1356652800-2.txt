review/summary: my month's experiencereview/text: I don't particularly like the machine. It's not a month old and I can see it is not likely to last very long :(The way it heats up is already inconsistent, and one of the filters lets the espresso come through, but for some reason after the 5th or 6th use, it no longer produces the creama. I've done all I can to insure it's perfectly clean but still it's worthless to me .
