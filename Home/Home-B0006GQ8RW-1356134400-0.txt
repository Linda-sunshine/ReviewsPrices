review/summary: Great Dealreview/text: Received a retail package for a pack of 4 Brita water filters all individually sealed. Did a great job removing that 'metal' taste from my city water. Would be nice if it could filter fluoride, but what do you expect for an expensive set of filters. Overall I'm satisfied with the product as the alternative would be bottled water and that's pretty wasteful and expensive!
