review/summary: Great dealreview/text: I picked these up I think in the deals section and really couldn't be happier. I read lots of reviews and there wer lots of very knowledgable people with regards to knives and metals and what you should and shouldn't expect. I read reviews where people said that they would get rust on them. I read reviews where people said that was normal of the metal type and that it was a good metal. I bought this set for very cheap if my memory serves me right somewhere around 25 dollars. These are super sharp great for anything we need them for. Some have acquired rust spots and that's just from leaving water on them after washing them. I make sure that I dry them and put them away now when I am done cleaning them and for the price I couldn't be happier.
