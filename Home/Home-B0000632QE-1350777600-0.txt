review/summary: Works Very Wellreview/text: I've never owned a mandoline before so I have nothing to compare it with. The blades are sharp and and food glides though it with clean cuts. I like the way everything fits together in a holder so parts do not get scattered and the sharp edges are out of the way when set up for storage. I'll probably have this one for a long time considering how well it is built and the fairly light use it sees in my kitchen. As time goes on I hope to make more use of it.
