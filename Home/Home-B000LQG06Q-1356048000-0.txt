review/summary: So far a great purchasereview/text: Our mattress is very firm and started to give us back problems after a few weeks of use. We puchased this topper in conjunction with the Hollander Cuddlebed and so far we haven't regretted our purchase. After receiving the topper I unrolled the highly compressed glob. The almost doughy consistency felt a little yucky and I was afraid I'd rip it as tightly as it was rolled. After that was done it decompressed nicely and in a timely manner. It fits our Queen sized Simmons Beautyrest like a glove and we keep it in a protective mattress case. The green tea infused scent (to me it smelled more like mint gum) was very prominent in the bed room for about 24 hours but faded quickly. It didn't smell too strong for it to cause headaches or sleepless nights. I cannot comment on the ventilation / stay cool factor yet since the temperatures are nice and cold. We'll have to see how it performs in the 100+ degree Texas summer. I'm pretty frugal when it comes to running the AC so in the summer we keep the house between 80-85F. But right now the bed is cuddly without being a hot pudding. So far I can recommend this product.
