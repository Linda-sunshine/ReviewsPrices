review/summary: Great Resultsreview/text: I have become obcessed with making great pizza at home and so needed a pizza "stone." This is perfect as far as I am concerned. I preheat it in the oven at 500 and then slide the prepared pizza on using a Pizza Peel. I like and recommend this one:Norpro 5683 Bamboo Pizza PaddleI wouldn't use this as a skillet but we have a smooth-top range so can't comment on what others seem to have tried. I also found that it is great for cooking up things like chicken pieces or breaded fish fillets. Just put enough oil on the pan to cover the surface, pre-heat and then toss them on. I even made hash-browns in the oven with it. As with any cast-iron product it is important to keep working oil into the surface to "cure" it. Don't wash or scrub the surface with abrasive products. Remember that you will be heating this up so that will keep the germs at bay so just get the minimum "stuff" off the surface and let it mellow. One quick thing--this is very heavy so be prepared.
