review/summary: Next best thing to in-cabinet trash cansreview/text: Good looking trash can, better than the cheap white ones. Does a good job of keeping odors contained. Hides garbage bag from view to preserve its looks. Had it for a month and it is working well. Finally put batteries in and the kids now love throwing stuff away.
