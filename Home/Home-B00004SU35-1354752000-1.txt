review/summary: Great Home Popcornreview/text: Chances are, if you made it to my review, you've already read a bunch of others. The short version for what's important about this popper:It's not the world's best popcorn maker, but it's really good and really inexpensive for how well it works. It's easy to get good results from, and it's worth the cost. I would definitely recommend this item. It's easier than shaking or stirring, with more popped kernels, and less burnt popcorn.You can easily change your oils/fats for flavor or nutritional control.It's a little tricky to clean up compared to a regular pot, but nothing more than most dishes that take a little attention.
