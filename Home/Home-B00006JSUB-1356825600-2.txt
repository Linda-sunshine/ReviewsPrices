review/summary: Great sizereview/text: This pan is just the size that I needed to brown larger pieces of meat. The fact that it can also go directly into the oven is also handy. If You keep it seasoned, it's also easy to clean. No concern about flaking you find in even good nonstick pan coatings. It's a classic for cooking for family or friends.
