review/summary: Fabulous machinereview/text: This is my third Cuisinart through the years, and by far my favorite. It does everything promised. The best parts about it is the weight of the machine and the wide mouth. It does not &#34;walk&#34;. It easily handles whole fruits and vegetables. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a reasonably priced food processor.
