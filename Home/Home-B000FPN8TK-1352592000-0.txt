review/summary: Ingenious little thingreview/text: This teapot has got to be the easiest teapot I've ever used. I put in the tea and add hot water. Only when the tea is ready I place it on the cup and it fills up the cup with the strained tea. Then into the compost and the dishwasher. Good product.
