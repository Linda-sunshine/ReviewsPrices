review/summary: Perfect for stairsreview/text: We purchased this item to vacuum our stairs and furniture. My in-laws have had theirs for some time and it has held up well, so we decided to get the same thing.The cord is very long, so you don't have to worry about it not reaching all the way up the stairsThe brush on the front is very powerful- seems to pick up pet hair wellWe really like the removable hose to get in the nooks and crannies.
