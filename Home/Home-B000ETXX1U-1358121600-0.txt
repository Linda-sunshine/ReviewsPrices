review/summary: Like the size and the sturdy, not good with air retention.review/text: The size is great. The ease of use (inflating and deflating) is excellent. However, it does NOT hold the air through the night. I usually have to re-inflate it once during the course of the night, otherwise it becomes more like sleeping in a hammock. And since the motor is very loud, this is not always an option depending on the company. I like it but I'm not thrilled.
