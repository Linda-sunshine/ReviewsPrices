review/summary: I Finally Just Threw It Awayreview/text: I bought the Aeropress on the basis of the many positive reviews here on Amazon. I have been a French press aficionado for many years and appreciated the utterly simple design. But I've got to confess that I did my best to brew a simple good mug of fresh-ground coffee using the Aeropress but every effort was fraught with quirky, sloppy and ultimately unsatisfactory results. Why even employ the paper filter when the act of pressing the grounds through the cylinder circumvents that feature?Finally, I had to surrender to my own incompetence and tossed the whole shebang in the trash can. That felt pretty good, I must admit. Better than to keep it in some cupboard and be reminded of a regrettable purchase.Good luck. Most seem to have success with this device.
