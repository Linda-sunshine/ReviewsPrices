review/summary: best hard boiled egg everreview/text: I love this egg cooker! So easy and simple and I recommend it constantly to friends, even strangers. How often does it come up in conversation? lol You would be surprised.Anyway, it's great, I set my timer for 7 to 8 minutes and viola! hard boiled eggs that are always easy to peel. I'm actually ordering two of these today to give to my niece and my sister in law.
