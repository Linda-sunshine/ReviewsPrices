review/summary: Husband LOVES thisreview/text: I purchased this for my husband for his birthday along with some gourmet beans. Having had a standard grinder for many years he thinks this is far superior to the &#34;one grind fits all&#34;. He likes to control the level of texture of the beans whether he is grinding his weeks worth of beans for drip or a weekend treat for the coffee press. Our kitchen is very contemporary with black granite and stainless appliances. I have never been a fan of displaying portable appliances on the countertop however the Capresso Stainless Steel finish is beautiful so it shares the space with the coffee maker.
