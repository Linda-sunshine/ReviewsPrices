review/summary: best office chair yetreview/text: i have a &#34;desk job&#34; & spend a great deal of time on my fanny. this was a pleasant, surprise gift from my employer (i'd started having lower back pain despite being quite active and exercising regularly) who'd actually LISTENED to my appeals for a more ergonomic chair. the product is well-built and designed. the arms a bit peculiar at first and took some getting used to but after using this chair (extensively) now for 6 months, i'd highly recommend it/ suggest it at this price point. i'd done quite a bit of research before &#34;suggesting&#34; this model to my employer (via Amazon's email link feature which is neat) but one never knows 'til one buys/ tries. i'm very pleased w/ results thus far... 6 months later and the lower pain has been mitigated and i'm convinced this chair most certainly has something to do with less pain. if you sit a lot during the day, this chair's a winner. it has functional features that are easy to navigate and assembly was reasonable out-of-the-box (no special tools, protracted time necessitated, etc.). great, comfortable chair for the money.
