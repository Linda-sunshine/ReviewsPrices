review/summary: Great Juicer!review/text: I've had this juicer for about a month and it does a great job! I've probably used it 20 times and I have not found one thing that I dislike about it. It extracts a lot of juice from fruits and vegies which is good because that saves me $$ on produce and there is less waste. I drop whole beets into this thing and it chews right through them like it's a wet noodle. Clean up is easy and fast which makes juicing with this gem a joy!
