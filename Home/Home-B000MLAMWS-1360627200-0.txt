One classic 1958 model from my grandmother, one Artisan 4 quart I purchased in 2009, and this Pro 600 Series. I do a LOT of baking and grew up around a pastry chef. Unfortunately, the kitchenaid mixer is NOT what it use to be in terms of construction and durability. This particular mixer is far superb to the Artisan model (which had to be replaced and fixed twice), but I dare say that I should have bought the Viking or Cuisinart instead. It's loud and the whip/beater are not high quality. Is it worth $400+...no. Does it out perform my 1958 model...no. Does it work better than handmixing...yes. So it's just okay.
