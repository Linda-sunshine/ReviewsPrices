review/summary: Soft sheets, but color wasn't as shownreview/text: I just received my sheets and overall I'm very happy with them. A good product at a great price! They were soft to the touch upon opening the package, and responded well to a cold water wash and tumble dry. They are soft, but feel substantial and not flimsy. My only complaint would be that the color (I ordered chestnut) is not the dark tan shown in the picture, but has more of a green tone. I would call them a dark khaki color. This didn't matter to me much but might if you wanted them to match other tans in your decor.
