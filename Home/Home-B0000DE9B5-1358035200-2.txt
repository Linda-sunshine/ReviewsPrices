review/summary: Didn't love itreview/text: I'll keep this short. I'm a grown man with grown man hands, and this handle was very tight against the base and short. Very uncomfortable to pour when full. You can't pour with the lid on. Liquid frequently ran down the side of the pitcher when it did pour due to the infinitesimal spout. And mine cracked within two days of putting tea into it to cool down in the fridge. I left the tea out for a good hour after it came to boil, so the liquid was warm but not excessively so. My cheap crappy $1 store pitchers can take it. But not this.I bought this pitcher to look nicer in my fridge for company, but nothing about this pitcher was fun for me. It's bulk in my fridge for it's size, tough to pour, and cracked where far cheaper pitchers held up. It is pretty though.
