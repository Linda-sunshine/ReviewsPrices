review/summary: FIRE HAZARD BEWARE!!! HISTORY OF FIREreview/text: My Model caught fire and upon research, I am not alone!Below is the email I sent to Cuisinart:To whom it concerns:I just wanted to inform you that I purchased your Cuisinart Coffee Maker Model DCC-1200 new about 2 years ago. Today while at home, after it had shut off it began making noise and the left over coffee was boiling and the glass pot was bobbling around. I walked to check it out there was smoke coming from the bottom of the coffee maker and the glass on the pot is now scorched. The pot was already off. I unplugged the unit. See attached photo of smoke.I am very disappointed to discover that MANY people have complained of this exact same event taking place with their coffee pot. Thank God, I was home and stopped the progression before my house caught fire!!See some complaints here: [...]I will not be purchasing another Cuisinart Coffee pot and would not take one even if you replaced my $80+ coffee pot that I have only had 2 years for fear that my house, pets and loved ones could die in a fire! I doubt this is the first time you have had this complaint based on the above findings, it is horrific that nothing has been done to recall this!Shame on you Cuisinart!I will be reporting to CPSC 800-638-2772Horrified,
