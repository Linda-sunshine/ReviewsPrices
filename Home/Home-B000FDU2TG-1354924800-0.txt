review/summary: Does the jobreview/text: Works well with soft and hard products. Use for morning shake and add frozen fruit chunks with no problem. Only concern is the leakage of oil from the motor onto the jar's bottom cavity; could be an indicator of future problems. Also, polycarbonate jar scratches easily when cleaning.
