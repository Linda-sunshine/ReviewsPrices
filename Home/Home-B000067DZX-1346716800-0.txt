review/summary: Terrible.review/text: Two of the three filters did not work. Checked with PUR customer service and their policy is to mail back the filters (at my expense) and then they would send a replacement. Unacceptable....as not only do I have to deal with the issue of receiving a low quality product....but now I'm supposed to pay double shipping? And on top of that, according to them, this was a one-time courtesy?? Businesses that do not stand behind their products are not worth the headache. Look elsewhere...
