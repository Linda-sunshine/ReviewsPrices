review/summary: Exactly what I was looking for.review/text: This hasn't been used yet as it is a Christmas present for my youngest grand-daughter. It seems to be the same model as one we'd gotten for her mom when she was a teen ager. It worked so well that she took it with her when she got married. It lasted for 20 years! My grand-daughter has a vanity but the mirror is too far away to put on make-up so she 's been improvising with a desk lamp. If it's anything like her mom's, it will be fantastic. I remember her mom's well. The side lights, the magnification, lighting choices.I read all the negative reviews and bought it anyway. I'm not worried about it. I'm sure it will be perfect. I'll update this review after she uses it a bit.
