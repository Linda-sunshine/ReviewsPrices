review/summary: One Suggestion for Buyersreview/text: Yes, BUNN coffee makers are the best, they last a long time, brew fast and the coffee tastes good.But I would suggest you buy the Square top versions instead of the round slide top. I've had both and the BUNN GRB is a much better model all around. It's easier to put water in and seems like a more "solid" unit.
