review/summary: awesomereview/text: I've been through a few different presses/coffee makers, the general nag for me is cleanliness. I don't like leaving old coffee in a coffee maker and clean up for the coffee makers and french presses can get tedious. I love this gadget. There's minimal parts, it's SUPER easy to clean, and it works like a champ. I love this press. I haven't had a whole lot of time to experiment with it but I'm excited for when I do. The plastic is durable, lightweight, all the parts look rugged enough to last for a long time with minimal TLC. I'm also deployed overseas currently and it showed up far sooner than expected. I would buy from this seller again.
