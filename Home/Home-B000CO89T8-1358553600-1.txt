review/summary: As good as it can bereview/text: Given the laws of physics and the limits of technology, this warmer seems as good as it can be. As it says, it's a warmer; not a heater.When your fresh cup of coffee or tea is at the preferred temperature, turn the warmer on and it will maintain a reasonably warm cup. For $10 it's a great deal. Just remember to turn it off when finished. (There is a on/off light.)UPDATE: You can boost the heating ability with a cup lid. Some cups come with one. Or recycle a plastic lid from an empty jar.
