review/summary: not worth the investmentreview/text: I just wanted to add my review to the others who have posted about the problems with this device. I enjoyed using my blender for green smoothies-- easily pulverized stringy leafy greens, frozen fruit, ice, even lemon seeds. After a few months the plastic fittings that house the blade have loosened and the liquid leaks all over the blender and the counter. Tightening up the housing does not solve the problem for even one use. I decided to leave a review after having looked up a price for a replacement-- $50 for a new jar! Are you kidding me? Check out the amazon reviews, people are MAD and so they should be! Spend your blender money on a different brand!
