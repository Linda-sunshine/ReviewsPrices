review/summary: Price jump from $39 to $64.99 = absurd. Did something happen to B&D's supply chain?review/text: What on earth (or in China) caused Amazon to raise the price of this iron by more than 50%!? Pricegrabber.com's price tracker shows $49 as the high point for the D2030 over the last 7 months. This iron is a fair deal at $39 but a rip off imo at $65.In fact, the increase is so out-of-the-norm for this sort of consumer product that I'm honestly wondering if something major happened to B&D;'s supply chain. Did a major factory in China go offline? Was the model discontinued? Most other online retailers are showing 'out of stock' so clearly something is up.That said, whatever the cause may be, I definitely will not be purchasing another D2030 at Amazon's current $64.99 price point.
