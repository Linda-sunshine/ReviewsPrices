review/summary: Awesome kitchen tool, great customer servicereview/text: A lot of people have already reviewed how well the unit works. I'd like to add that the customer service is also great. I'd decided to shred some mozzarella and started working on a block of the cheese. 90% through the block that I'd put in, the remaining part of it got wedged beneath the lid and the cutter, and rolled into a ball. This put enough force on the detentes holding the lower portion of the tub, that the plastic broke. This is partly my fault, since I wasn't using small enough pieces for the plastic to withstand in the case of this happening (was using the large feed tube). I called up customer support, and with no questions asked, had a new replacement piece shipped out in 10 minutes with no cost to me. I've seen a lot of complaints about customer service for this unit, and cannot disagree with this more. Did I mention I was calling their CS number at 7:30 Pacific time on Columbus day, and had someone from an on-shore call center answer? This alone is reason enough to stick with this company and product (we're amassing quite a number of Cuisinarts at home).
