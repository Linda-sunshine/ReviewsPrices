review/summary: Just an alright coffee makerreview/text: Well, I received the coffee maker and as the saying goes 'you get what you pay for' in many instances, is true. I wish there were a way to see the water level on the outside as the measuring marks are on the inside where you are trying to add water and it is a bit of an inconvenience. I don't think it makes truly great coffee as someone else had reviewed. I'm alright with it but not super impressed. I kind of wish I had gone with a stove top model like my parents had when I was growing up. It made very, very good coffee consistently. My uncle was picky about his coffee and swore by it. Although I am looking up tips to improve the coffee that I can brew at home.
