review/summary: I may finally return my ex's cheese grater!review/text: Many of my friends over the past few years have laughed at me because the one thing I claimed from my ex's house when I moved out was his cheese grater. I love to cook, and his cheese grater was the best I'd ever used. (I never buy the store shredded cheese, I grate it myself). I have tried to find a grater to match his so I can return what I &#34;borrowed,&#34; but until now nothing worked as well.When I bought this food processor, I was thinking about time saved in chopping veggies, fruits, and the like. Never did I dream that it could grate cheese as well as it did. It also did a fantastic job of chopping up the many cups of various nuts I used in many recipes over the holidays. Oh, and it did work pretty well on the fruits and veggies, too. Once I've finished eating my holiday leftovers (I don't know if they'll ever be finished!), I can't wait to see what else this thing can do.If it works as well long-term as it did during the holidays, I may have found a kitchen appliance that could replace my first love in the kitchen - my Kitchen Aid mixer. (And I never thought anything could take it's place in my heart).
