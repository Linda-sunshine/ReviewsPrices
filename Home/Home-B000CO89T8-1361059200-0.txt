review/summary: The WORST!!! DO NOT BUY!!!review/text: Ok.....I threw away the one I was using in my office before this because it was no longer getting my cups of coffee hot...only tepid and therefore wasting energy. Silly me. I was SURE ( since I read all reviews) that this mug warmer by Mr. Coffee would be so great that I just tossed my old one before receiving this. HUGE mistake! This has got to be the worst product I have ever purchased from Amazon! I tried for days with several different shaped mugs of tea or coffee ...nothing..none of them got more than BARELY tepid! It is very hot to the touch.....but for some ridiculous reason it WILL NOT HEAT YOUR CUP OF LIQUID....and I'm speaking of a hot cup of coffee to start with! I was so surprised that I kept trying different mugs...thinking maybe it's the shape or...??? Nothing worked. Nothing.Please do not waste your time. Do not purchase this product!!
