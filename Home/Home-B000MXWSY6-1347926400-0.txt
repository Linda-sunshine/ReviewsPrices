review/summary: Doesn't tell the correct timereview/text: I really like all of the features of this alarm clock, the alarm itself isn't too obnoxious, although the earlier it goes off the more obnoxious it sounds :-) I like having 2 alarms to set, one gets set for the every day wake up time, I can set the other as needed. I really like the adjustable brightness setting, and keep it at the lowest level. The strangest thing though is that this alarm clock is exactly 10 minutes off, and this is very strange because the clock sets itself. I understand that there's a way to manually adjust that, described in the manual, but that manual is long gone. I'll have to go online to try to find it and see if I can figure it out. Until then - I just have to remember that it's 10 minutes fast. Otherwise - a it's great clock and I'd buy another.
