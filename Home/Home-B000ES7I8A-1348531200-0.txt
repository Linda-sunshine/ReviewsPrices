review/summary: Great Product!review/text: Without a doubt, the best kettle I have ever owned. Double wall stainless steel with no seams to potentially leak. No plastic comes in contact with the boiling water, so no after-taste or possible health effects from plastic chemicals. Auto-shutoff works flawlessly. I use mine all day long, so I hope Hamilton Beach continues to make this product so I can purchase another when the time comes. (No, I don't work for Hamilton Beach).
