review/summary: mediocre build qualityreview/text: It is true that it is easy to use and it makes good bread. My complaint is that it doesn't last very long. Mine has gotten in the bad habit of throwing its belt off. I fixed it the first time, but you have to dismantle the machine completely to fix it. Way too much work. The second time it threw its belt I abandoned it.Also, it doesn't seem very powerful. It makes an unpleasant grinding noise while kneading. I don't know if my cooking skills have produced something closer to concrete than bread, but I wish it were more powerful. (Despite the grinding noise, the results were still tasty if the belt doesn't come off half way through, and I was following the recipe that came with it...)
