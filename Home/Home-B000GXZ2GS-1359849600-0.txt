review/summary: I Am Now Officially Ruined For Coffeeshop Coffee - Thanks A Lot Aeropress!review/text: My boyfriend bought me both the Aeropress and the Capresso FrothPro milk frother from Amazon this week. For under $100, total (he paid $59 for the Capresso frother -- far cheaper than the other lesser and hard-to-clean ones), I now make about the best cup of coffee I have ever tasted (even in fine restaurants in Paris, New York, in LA).The Aeropress looks like a junior high science project, and I love that about it, too. The directions are not the greatest. (I couldn't figure out how to get the two tubes apart -- you unscrew counterclockwise...wasn't in directions). But, you just unscrew the cap on the bottom of one of them (with the little holes), slip a filter in there, and make your coffee as directed.I put in two scoops of coffee (fine-ground), put water up to three mark on glass, and then come out with a double espresso. I fill the 3/4 of the rest (of my big 16-oz cup) with water, and it's still very strong coffee (and I like mine break-a-tooth black). I froth a little over a quarter cup of milk and then pour it in to the top.Oh, and actually, still coming out around $100, I have the Aroma electric kettle, which he also got me (nice boyfriend!), which heats the water fast, and apparently, a nice temperature to make great coffee in the aeropress, though I'm not cheffy, so I have no thermometers around, save for one for sick people that doesn't go up all that far (hate to think of someone with a 150-degree temperature). Also, it's best that there's no possibility that anyone's stuck your coffee thermometer in their butt.
