review/summary: Omega Juicerreview/text: I love this machine because the pulp is dry when I finish juicing. I didn't realize it until I juiced one time; I was throwing a portion of my juice on the compost pile. It doesn't compare with the commercial juicers I've purchased in retail stores in the past. The noise level is low compared with the commercial machines.I would recommend this juicer to others that juice.
