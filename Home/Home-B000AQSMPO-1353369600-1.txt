review/summary: It's great....when it works.review/text: I have owned my coffee maker since November of 2011. At first it worked great and made a good, fast and convenient cup of coffee. I switched because I was always throwing out coffee from my drip coffee maker. However, after about four months it started acting up. I actually had to unplug and re plug it like rebooting a computer. I never knew when it would happen but the frequency became greater and greater. Now it started a new trick, it makes a loud growling or gurgling sound and only works every other time or so. Getting help from Kuerig has been difficult.
