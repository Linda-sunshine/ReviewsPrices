review/summary: nice filterreview/text: Pros: filter does an excellent job, allergy symptoms greatly improved within days of regular use. Cons: unit is quite large and unattractive, considerably noisy, and creates a cold breeze which makes the room feel uncomfortable-however I would still recommend it because it is effective.
