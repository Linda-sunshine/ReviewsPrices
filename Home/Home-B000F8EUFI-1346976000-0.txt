review/summary: Clogs easily and died completely after 8 monthsreview/text: This vacuum was nothing but trouble from day one. It kept clogging and the clogs were very hard to remove due to the way the hose is positioned. I spent hours trying to fish out clogs using my fingers, sticks, etc. Every time I noticed that the air wasn't circulating inside the canister, I would find that it was clogged. We don't have any pets. We do have children. This might be a nice vacuum for someone living alone with very light vacuuming to do. I'm not sure. All I know is that it was a huge pain to us. It finally quit picking things up entirely... won't suction anything. I'm not sure what the problem is, but it's not worth it to us to fix it seeing as we were frustrated with it to begin with. We definitely wished we had gone with another product.
