review/summary: Quick and easy and accuratereview/text: Received this bath scale in just a few days after placing my order; couldn't have been easier. The scale is very accurate, gives you weight to the tenth of a pound. It's also very quick. Digital display is easy to read. The scale itself is very nice looking and sturdy and balanced. I am very pleased with this scale and the vendor. I highly recommend this product and vendor.
