review/summary: All American 921 21-1/2-Quart Pressure Cooker/Cannerreview/text: Professionally well made and safe to use..(admit that I was afraid to use it).It is quite heavy so one needs to have some strong arms around if you'reweak like me. Purchased this for canning but it's nice to know I can cooka yummy pot roast or chicken in it, too. So glad it is made in USA.
