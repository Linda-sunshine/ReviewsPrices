review/summary: Great Humidifierreview/text: I purchased this item a month ago and I am very pleased. I love how the Owl design looks and it works fine. It is easy lifting the full tank and to empty the base. User friendly. I get three nights, set on low, before I have to fill the tank again for the bedroom.I use water from my filter pitcher; there is no film left on my wood furniture. Good price too.
