review/summary: Delivers great taste as advertisedreview/text: While the AeroPress takes a few tries to perfect the brew technique, it definitely makes much smoother tasting coffee than other methods. As the name suggests, it is an &#34;air press&#34;, as the plunger doesn't actually touch your coffee/water mix during pressing. The only drawbacks to the AeroPress are that you have to brew again for additional cups and of course there is no way to keep extra coffee warm a la a drip machine. These are minor drawbacks if you are just brewing for yourself. I definitely prefer this method to the traditional french press.
