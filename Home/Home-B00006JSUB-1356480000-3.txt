review/summary: AMERICAN MADEreview/text: I went to the Lodge factory outlet in South Pittsburg Tn. This product is American made in a Foundry next to the outlet and employs appx 200 Americans. There is a 2nds area and this skillet is maybe 10$ cheaper, but when you think about the travel time and gas, plus taxes it is not that much cheaper than Amazon. Lodge is a quality product, it is a life time product that does not have a chemical coated inside that will scratch when you use metal utensils. I believe in buying American when at all possible and this is definitely a no brainer when buying cookware.
