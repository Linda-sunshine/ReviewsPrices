review/summary: Works as advertised...review/text: We bought this to concerve on the amount of high-heat cooking oils we use. So far it has work flawlessly for olive, grape seed, canola, and those types of cooking oils. Just make sure to pump it up all the way or else the sprayed droplets are kind of large. We use it everyday with no complaints. It has really cut down on the amount of cooling oils we use, which will more than pay for itself in a short period of time.
