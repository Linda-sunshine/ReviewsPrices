review/summary: Wonderful machine!review/text: I purchased my Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge about a year ago after reading TONS of reviews for several different machines. I have been extremely happy with my choice! We have our entire upstairs carpeted in a multi-toned beige berber, and with 4 children and 2 pets still at home, it gets LOTS of abuse. This machine gets out stains beautifully and leaves the entire carpet looking fresh and very clean. Features I especially like:* not too heavy... I'm a petite 55 year-old lady and even I can carry this thing up the stairs :) It's light enough tomaneuver easily.* ease of use... If assembled correctly, the components of this machine snap in and out easily and without leaking.Filling the detergent tank is a snap, and emptying the waste-water tank is also easy. Clean up is uncomplicated...even the brush assembly on the bottom.* the suction on this machine is excellent, rivaling much more expensive cleaners, making dry time much shorter.* I use boiling hot water with Hoover's professional strength cleaners. The results have been fantastic.As other reviewers have stated, the tanks on this machine are somewhat small, and need to be filled/emptied quite frequently. That doesn't bother me in the least, however; I'll gladly trade a smaller machine for one that has larger tanks. All in all, this carpet cleaner is a great value for the money.
