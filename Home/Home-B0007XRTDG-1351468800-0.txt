review/summary: My favorite thing in the kitchenreview/text: I bought the Presto 16-inch electric skillet 4 months ago and am SO happy with it. It gets used at least 3 times a week and is in perfect condition. Heats evenly and very quickly. I love how much control I have over the heat, something that is impossible with my electric stove burners. I haven't yet put this in the dishwasher; just trying to extend the life of this skillet as long as I can.I recently took it with me when we rented a vacation house with my parents and siblings. Everyone used this skillet skillet to cook and warm food all weekend and kept going on about how much they loved it; I'm getting my parents and my sister each one for Christmas this year :)
