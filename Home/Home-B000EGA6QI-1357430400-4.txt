review/summary: Even better than I hopedreview/text: I had never used one of these before I spend a while reading reviews and trying to pick one that was a good balance of price, quality, and features, and I decided on this one. One of my hesitations with this model was that it wasn't a variable speed blender, as I had seen on some other brands. But after using it, I realized it's completely unnecessary. I use this for short blasts of blending, not long drawn out blends, so the speed settings would have been useless anyway. The build of this seems great, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone considering buying one. Hopefully it withstands the test of time... but typically Cuisinart products have held up pretty well for me.
