review/summary: Love Love Love - smooth sprays and easy to pumpreview/text: I grossed out of buying cooking sprays at the store after reading that they contained excellerent (yuck that does not need to be in my food). This canister has been amazing ever since I bought it. I now own three of them and all of them have different oils / uses. I keep one filled with olive oil or safflower oil to use while cooking (on my stainless stell pans) and I have two filled with an olive oil / vinegar mixture to use on popcorn and salad. It takes 10 pumps to get the canister to spray for approximately 20 seconds and this is usually more than enough for any cooking uses. The sprayer doesn't last long enough when I am making fresh popcorn but it really isn't a bother.The seal on the canister is great and it doesn't matter if the top is all the way down or not. The oil stays fresh and flavorfull for months inside the canister.I highly recommend this product to EVERYONE so you can stop eating excellerent and many other, unnecessary chemicals in your food. Plus it pays for itself pretty quickly!
