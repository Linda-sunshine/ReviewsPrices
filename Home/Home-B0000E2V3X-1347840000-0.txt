review/summary: Really bad product! Don't waste your money on this.review/text: So this is the highest rated for pizza stones? I bought because of the rave reviews and reasonable price. It seemed to work well at first - nich & heavy, seemed good quality and it held up for a few months of regular use - then came the peeling. Yes, there is a coating that peels off and leave little black chips in your food. Of course it is now too late to return. Do yourself a favor and buy something else.
