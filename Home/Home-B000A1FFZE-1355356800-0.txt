review/summary: Best combo oven and toasterreview/text: This is the second one of these I've purchased, and my last one was over 10 years ago. I love that you don't have to have a separate toaster as well as toaster oven. I checked into one other that had the toaster included, and it was not only expensive, but received bad reviews mostly around the push down lever for the toaster breaking, and very soon after purchase. I've never had a problem except the last one just got so old that the coils no longer heated consistently along the entire length, but I consider over 10 years of once or more daily usage to be above and beyond expectation for the coils. The addition of the &#34;cancel&#34; button for the toaster is wonderful, since my last one didn't have this. For the price, I think this is one of the best out there, and the most used small kitchen appliance in my house!
