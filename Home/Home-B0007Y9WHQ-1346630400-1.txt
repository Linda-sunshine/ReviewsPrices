review/summary: Awesome Spiralizerreview/text: This is one of the best deals for the price. It works quickly and easily. It is easy to take apart and clean. The zucchini spaghetti is spaghetti size not angel hair size as others such as the benriner brand. But it works just as well. I also liked the flat blade for making sweet potato chips. I have recommended it to many friends and family members and everyone has loved it.
