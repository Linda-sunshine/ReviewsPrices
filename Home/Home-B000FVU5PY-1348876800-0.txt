review/summary: "Maize" color should be named "Peach" insteadreview/text: I'm a long-time fan of Pinzon's overall quality and value, so I ordered this queen sheet set in "maize". They are well made, and I like the larger hem detail. My only complaint is that the color is actually more of a peach tone, and not as shown in Amazon's photo. I understand color monitors vary; however, everything else I ordered matches the photos perfectly. So just beware if you're expecting a soft golden-yellow pastel that this particular set will have more of an orange undertone.
