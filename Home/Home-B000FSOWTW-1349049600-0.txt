review/summary: Handy little toolreview/text: After using this electric wine opener a couple of times, I wondered why I waited so long to purchase it! I'd been looking a them for some time and the price was right (and no shipping cost with PRIME). It's easy to use although you have to hold the bottle tightly... can't just let it sit on the table. It's great for anyone..but especially for those of us with arthritic wrists and keeping it continuously charged allows for ready use. The wine chiller is a nice accompanying item, though not really necessary. I keep it in the freezer for use as needed. It can also be used as a little ice bucket.
