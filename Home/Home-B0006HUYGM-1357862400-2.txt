review/summary: awkward to holdreview/text: Okay, maybe it's unrealistic on my part, but I took the Amazon country of origin "made the US" as fact. No, dear reader, it's made in China.But more important, it's heavy and awkward to use. I bought it because I'm constantly cleaning up cat litter and I thought a dust buster would help. The Eurekda is very powerful and ample for the job but if you look closely at the photos, the person is always on bended knees for good reason. Using this hand-held vac will give you a back ache in no time flat. And it's fairly heavy. In conclusion, if I knew what I know now, I would have bought another vac.Pros: long chord, powerful, good suction, easy to remove and replace dirt bagCons: very awkward to use unless you're on your knees. The wrap-around hose should be longer, heavier than many of its competitors
