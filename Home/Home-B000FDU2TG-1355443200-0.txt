review/summary: Don't by this inferior product!review/text: I bought this blender in July of 2011. It broke the first week I had it. I am making smoothies with frozen fruit and would expect that if it had an crush ice button it could handle frozen fruit. I got a replacement which leaked a tiny bit but I put up with it. It finally leaked profusely and I think it is an inferior design.................I ended up calling Kitchenaid and they are sending me a replacement. Hope it works.
