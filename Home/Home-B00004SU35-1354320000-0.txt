review/summary: Love it!review/text: This is our second whirlypop type popper. We love them! There is no better way to make popcorn. We buy pro grade prepackaged corn, oil and salt from a restaurant supply store. These packages have too much corn in it for these poppers so we have to dump some out before it is finished popping. The only reason that we had to buy another one is because I got over aggressive with the cranking and stripped the gear teeth. My fault! Otherwise these are great poppers!
