review/summary: Mrsreview/text: I was looking for a light weight vacuum for everyday use. The Hoover Flair bagless S2220 seemed to be the right one from the reviews I read. It took about 10 minutes to put together and seems to work just great. I especially like the fact that you can choose to have the brush bar on or off.Have a cat and dog and it does a great job picking up fur and hair(people) from wood and vinyl flooring; and also off all my short pile area rugs. I clean the dust cup/filter out after each use and sometimes twice if doing upstairs and downstair floor/rugs. Also this product is great for doing wood stairs and short capeted stairs; I have both and it is light enough to go up or down stairs.Have only owned it about 3-4 weeks; so far so good.Thanks Amazon, you did have the best price!Thanks Hoover!My mom has the Flair (I beleive) S2000 which doesn't give the option of the the brush bar.
