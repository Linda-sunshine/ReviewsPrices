review/summary: perfect purchase !review/text: I went to Amazon , as usual , looking for a food dehydrator to make sweet potato treats for my Bull Terrier , Rosie. I could only find these treats either made in China or extremely expensive for the amount in a bag . This model could not be any easier to whip up a batch of her favorite treat. just wash potato , throw in microwave to cook , and slice in rounds or &#34; fries &#34; . load trays , turn on , and walk away for 6 or so hours . I like that you can use all the trays , or just what you want to to make . clean up is a breeze and I have a healthy snack for her for literally pennies . would tell other pet owners to buy . you control what goes in , and Rosie loves them !
