review/summary: Doesn't live up to expectations.review/text: I purchased this model because I read a good review for it in Consumer Reports. It has disappointed me in every possible way. It keeps breaking down with issues like the belt slipping off, the bag comes lose and blows dirt everywhere, the attachments that ride on-board drop off at the most inconvenient times... I've had it for less than a year and will be replacing it soon. FAIL!
