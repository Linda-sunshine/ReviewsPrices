review/summary: Unreliablereview/text: This product does make a good cup of hot coffee when it works. After six months it started turning itself off any time in the brewing process. Imagine coming into the kitchen for a hot cup of coffee and seeing the thing closed down and the coffee cold! I emailed and called customer service to tell them about the manufacturer's defect and they said,yes it is under limited warranty, but I would have to pay shipping both ways. Why should I pay extra to get the product I spent a lot of money in the first place to buy? Then I would end up spending $90 and buying a lot of hassle as well! Unreliable product and they don't stand behind it. Sorry, I'm not buying a Cuisinart product again.
