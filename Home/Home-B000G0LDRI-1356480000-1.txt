review/summary: This unit seems to work well, as described !!review/text: I bought this with a little bit of nervousness after reading some of the negative reviews. I think some people just have a hard time following directions. I use this in a 300 square foot office that serves as a guitar studio where I teach. I have about 5 or 6 instruments in this room at all times, and the heating cycle in my building during the relatively mild winters in Tennessee absolutely dries out the air to about 20% humidity. This causes problems for most of my guitars, and changes the neck tension due to the wood drying out. This is a major problem for guitars. When I got my Honeywell unit, I read the directions slowly and surely, and started the unit right up. Within an hour or so the humidity had reached 55%, up from around 25%. The unit regulates itself within about 3 or 4 degrees of humidity when you set it to "automatic". The only downside is that I have to fill the unit up with water everyday, but thats a minor issue, not really a problem for a good dependable unit that actually works correctly !!! I am pleased with this unit so far. Its not THAT loud, as some have complained, but then again, I am playing Led Zeppelin songs all day long while its running !!! I think its a good unit.
