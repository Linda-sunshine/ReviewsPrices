review/summary: Great little vacuumreview/text: Lightweight, with good suction, won't harm antique rugs (no beater brush). Very versitile--vacuum the floor, change the brush, and vacuum the ceiling cobwebs easily because the hose is lightweight! My housekeeper liked this one best and now I see why (this is my second one). I wish they would improve the quality of the hose back to what it was 25 years ago because it twists more easily than the old one which is the only problem I have with this vacuum. My other vacuum is a miele upright. Gave the Consumer Reports recommended Kenmore canister to goodwill.
