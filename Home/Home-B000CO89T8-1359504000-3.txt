review/summary: Very hot to the touch, but doesn't keep my coffee warmreview/text: Perhaps this mug warmer would work better with a mug that had no convex &#34;dimple&#34; on the bottom, so as to put more surface area in contact with the warmer. I don't know, but I do know that while it is *very* hot to the touch (it would burn my fingers if I didn't pull them away quickly), it doesn't keep my coffee from cooling, and it certainly isn't making it hot. I suppose I'm glad to have its cooling slowed down slightly, but I still have to go microwave it periodically if I want it more than slightly warm.
