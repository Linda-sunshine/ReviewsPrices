review/summary: Happy with my litle-bitty percolator!review/text: I've had my little 2-4 cup Faberware stainless steel percolator for about 2 weeks now. I love it. It takes longer to "fix" the coffee & to clean than my old 4 cup Mr. Coffee, which lasted for years. In fact, I finally just threw it out. In spite of my best efforts, it looked grungy inside the water well. I wanted something that I could keep really fresh & clean. This little percolator just shines---inside & out. Easy to clean! I don't mind a little extra time if it looks decent inside! I still had Mr. Coffee filters so I just poke a hole in the center of a filter & fit it into the basket. Works great!The lid does fit on VERY tightly, as some have noted. I took some pliers and flattened the 4 little bumps on the sides of the lid. It is still very tight, but it needs to be in order to push the basket into place, however, it IS much easier to take off now & w/o any mess.Makes my coffee quickly, keeps it hot, & is easy to keep clean! I'm happy! :O)
