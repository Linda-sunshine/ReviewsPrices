review/summary: Good Productreview/text: I'm new to juicing and was very impressed with this product. I have used one other juicer before and it was not powerful enough (would overheat) and didn't hold as much pulp. This juicer is very powerful and can hold enough pulp to juice a large amount of juice without having to stop and empty halfway through. The brush makes clean up much easier.
