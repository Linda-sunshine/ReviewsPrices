review/summary: Did not workreview/text: Six days after this unit was activated there were 2 severe weather warnings and two Tornado warnings. The unit never went off.I tried to call Midland customer service to see if there was something I had overlooked but after 55 minutes on hold, I gave up and returned it.Amazon allowed the return with no problems. To bad Midland customer service doesn't work like Amazon!!!
