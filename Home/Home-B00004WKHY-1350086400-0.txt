review/summary: Love this food processorreview/text: I got the purple one, the color is stunning! Used it to make almond butter and it churned it out no problem even though I had it running for about 15 minutes. The motor got warm, but not hot. It's also a lot more quiet than I thought it would be. I own a 2-cup food processor that makes a ton more noise than this one does. Very pleased with the product!
