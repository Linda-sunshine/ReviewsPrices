review/summary: I Love My Percolatorreview/text: I purchased this percolator knowing absolutely nothing about percolators in general (having come of age past the era of the automatic drip coffee makers). I was frustrated because I had three auto-drips die on me in a span of less than two years and nothing is more annoying than starting that pot of coffee first thing in the morning to realize that there will be no coffee until one gets dressed and out the door to the nearest place open at 5 am that sells coffee makers. Those one cup at a time brewers seemed like they wouldn't be practical for someone like me who drinks about a pot of coffee before becoming semi-functional.While reading the reviews, this percolator seemed even more appealing because of the lack of plastic parts, and as someone who uses stainless steel water bottles to avoid plastics in my drinks, I decided it was a definite "go" to buy it.Over a year later, I have to say that I am pleased beyond words. The coffee doesn't burn as quickly and tastes good nearly to the last drop (there is a little sediment issues that deters one from completely finishing an entire pot, but that is SUCH a minor quibble. My only true complaint is that I tend to enjoy my coffee at near espresso strength and the size of the basket the holds the coffee grounds is such that I have been unable to brew quite as strong coffee as a I used to.It is harder to clean, but with the right tools (a brush for the task and Dip-It percolator cleaner) is it possible to clean it without much trouble.I have zero regrets over this purchase. I absolutely LOVE mine. It took a minute to figure out how to do things, being so used to the auto-drips, but it well worth the learning curve. The coffee is appropriately hot and where I was having to brew two or three pots to accommodate different rising schedules of the house due to how quickly the auto-drips burned the coffee and am I now only have to brew a pot and half of coffee.One of the best purchases over the past couple of years. I highly recommend it.
