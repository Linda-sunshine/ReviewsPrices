review/summary: Not very impressed. It's just okreview/text: This is my very first steamvac purchased. Like most, I had surfed for feedbacks and found ones that said this is the best for the price. I was adviced to just rent and use the rented cleaner on my place and my parents to optimize the rental fee. I browsed on Amazon at the right time. They had a black friday deal and am thankful to amazon for giving me a very good deal.So now with the feedback on the product. Being that this has the Clean Surge and my rugs are only around 3 years old and have been washed, scrubbed outdoors a few times during the 3 years, I was expecting this to easily remove the dark spots on my rugs. But i have used up the free bottle of deep cleansing detergent (oh yes, btw, it was good of them to send a bottle of detergent with this item) which is said to be really good, anyways, used up for just two area rugs, and was still not very satisfied with the clean. There are still some dark spots though thinner. If I wasn't only ashamed with causing noise pollution and how neighbors are inconvenienced, I would've opened another 48oz bottle to continue cleaning. Did I mention that I only have 2 area rugs and no installed carpet?It does have mostly plastic parts which I was disappointed with, although like i said, for the price i paid. it was ok, but if It wasn't on sale and i had paid the regular price it would be a letdown. I had already read about the plastic but didn't expect it to have almost all plastic parts. Being mostly plastic did make it lighter weight which is good for somebody my size but i still would like more heavy duty parts esp with the cleaning, rotating, working, moving and movable parts like the motor and the rotators - the mechanism, which would make the whole thing more durable, but would like a more compact design.
