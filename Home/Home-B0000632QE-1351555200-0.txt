review/summary: Swissmar Borner V-1001 V-slicer plus mandolinereview/text: I had tried a different mandolin slicer at my Daughter in law's and decided that I had to have one. This one got the best overall reviews and they are well earned. It is easy to use, does not take up much room and I am delighted with it. We love scalloped potatoes but slicing the potatoes was too difficult so I never made them. I do now. And best of all, my husband does all the slicing because it is now fun to do.
