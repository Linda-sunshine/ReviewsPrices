review/summary: Not bad at all.review/text: The reviews for this product were very mixed, but I took the risk anyway. The sheets were a little scratchy to begin with due to the starching maybe, but I washed them with a vinegar/fabric softner solution and they came out great. The fitted sheet was a little large before washing, but actually shrunk a little to fit perfectly.
