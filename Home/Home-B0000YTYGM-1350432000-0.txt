review/summary: Another reason for overflow- off balance from the power cordreview/text: This machine makes great coffee. I've now had it for 6 months and I am very happy with it. Like all the other reviewers have noted it's important to be sure the lid is screwed on properly before starting the brewing process. That's the easiest way to end up with coffee & grounds all over your countertop.The other cause I've discovered is if I'm brewing a full 12 cup pot of coffee and the unit isn't completely flat on the countertop the hot water in the filter basket will flow over the lower side. The power cord is usually to blame. If I'm only brewing 8 cups of less it's not an issue.
