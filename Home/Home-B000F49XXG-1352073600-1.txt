review/summary: Pretty Good Machine if You Get One That Worksreview/text: I've purchased six of these machines. Two of them worked - one for a year or so and the latest for a week or so. One reason I've bought six is because Amazon has such an easy return policy. The other reason is that, based on reviews, I can't seem to find another machine that is trouble free within my price range of $200 + or so.
