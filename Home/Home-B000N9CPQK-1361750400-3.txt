review/summary: Noisyreview/text: The unit is small, which is good. You can put it almost anywhere. It vibrates a bit, so be careful that it does not move. You may need to put it on an abrasive surface to keep it from moving.The unit became extremely noisy after a few days. It sounded like popping popcorn in a microwave when set at all speeds.I wouldn't recommend.
