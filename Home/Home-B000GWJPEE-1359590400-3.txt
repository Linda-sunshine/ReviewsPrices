review/summary: Good value for the money.review/text: Seems to work fine. Before Mid-winter set in, my spouse complained that it left the counter it was on damp. Worked fine at a half-way setting. Later in the winter we tried turning it to full and found it blew fuses. See &#34;Set of 5, GDC 2A 250v Slow-Blow Glass Fuses, T2A GDC2A 2 amp&#34; . We are back to operating it at half setting and it is working fine.
