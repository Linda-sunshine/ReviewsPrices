review/summary: Works In 8-Cup Coffee Makerreview/text: I ordered this permanent filter directly from Amazon and received it promptly. I rinsed it off, stuck it in my coffee maker (an 8-cup by Mr. Coffee, Amazon link here: [...]), and brewed a pot. Tastes fresh and clean and the best part is that this 10-12 cup filter fits in my 8-cup filter! So if you have a coffee maker from Mr. Coffee that brews 8-cups and are looking for a permanent filter for it, this one should work.
