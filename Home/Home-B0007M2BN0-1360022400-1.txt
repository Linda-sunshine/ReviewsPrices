review/summary: Worked perfectlyreview/text: I have an older microwave and am not sure of wattage. For first attempt, I set it for 8 minutes and the egges cooked perfectly. I'm very pleased with this purchase as I now know I can hard-cook eggs perfectly. Also, very easy to peal. This is an outstanding product.
