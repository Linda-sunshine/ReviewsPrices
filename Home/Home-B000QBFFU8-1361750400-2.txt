review/summary: Met expectionsreview/text: We had a Jack Lalane juicer before and returned it. This one works great, is easy to clean and we love the juice. The only complaint is the juice is a bit thick for me but my wife loves it. So I dilute it a bit or strain it further. I am just sensitive to texture.
