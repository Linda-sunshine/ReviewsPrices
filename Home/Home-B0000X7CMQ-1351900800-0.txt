review/summary: MANY PERKSreview/text: I have been seeing this product on the top of the Best Coffee Makers list for years and finally decided to buy it. Our coffee has never tasted so good. We love the bigger carafe for parties where we always brewing two pots and throwing out half of the second. The coffee stays hot and does not get bitter after sitting inside for a couple hours. My coffee prayers have been answered!.
