review/summary: VERY PLEASEDreview/text: I have only owned this iron for a few weeks, but so far I am very satisfied with it. I should probably mention that I previously had a cheap $15 iron that I received as a wedding gift 4 years ago. So pretty much ANYTHING was a step up from that. In any case, this iron is really great. I use it nearly every day for my online pillow cover shop. I cannot BELIEVE the difference this iron makes. I can iron in less than half the time it was taking me with the old iron. I love the digital screen and auto off feature. The steam is amazing---again, I didn't realize what I was missing out on with my old iron--the steam stopped working on it long time ago! I've read from the discussions about which kind of water to use to avoid leaks, and still unsure from all the mixed opinions, I have used bottled water. So far it's been fine, although a little bit of water leaked out the other day. I'm hoping that isn't an ongoing issue. I will probably update this in the future after I get a lot more use out of it. So far, I'm really happy with it!
