review/summary: great filter but poor lidreview/text: Brita filters are and have always been really good, but I can't say the same for the lid on this pitcher. As others have said, the lid does not fit properly and comes off easily...lame! The one I previously purchased a few of years ago (without the electronic filter indicator) is fine and the lid is snug and never comes off, but the lid on this one is not sized properly and comes off easily on every pour, so you must hold it with your thumb or it will come off completely. Although I thought about returning it, I will keep it but would never purchase this particular pitcher again and certainly would not recommend it. Seems the quality control at Brita has become less than favorable.
