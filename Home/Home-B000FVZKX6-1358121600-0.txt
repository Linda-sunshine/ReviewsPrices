review/summary: Warm and snugglyreview/text: I took a chance on these after reading previous reviews and I'm so glad I did. The first washing did leave quite a bit of lint, but that's not unusual with flannel sheets. They have extremely deep pockets and easily fit my king size thick mattress. The flat sheet is plenty big enough, and the pillowcases easily accommodate large pillows. Most importantly, the sheets feel great! They're very soft and extremely comfortable to sleep on. I got the dark blue and the color was exactly as pictured online. I'll update as time goes on if I find problems with them, but for now they appear to be a great value for the price!
