review/summary: Perfect Espressoreview/text: I've tried many machines/devices with marginal success, and just about gave up on making my own espresso. I understand that a number of great machines can be had for around $1,000, but I didn't want to spend that much, so I got this based on reviews. It certainly does not disappoint. Whereas other machines are very sensitive to grind, tamping, and other factors, this machine makes good espresso with just about any grind from drip to fine espresso. The steamer is difficult to use, and it's best to use a pre-warmed receiving cup.
