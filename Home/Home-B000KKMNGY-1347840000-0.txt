review/summary: ok product, bad fitreview/text: Product is OK but because of the way it's designed the bottom in the front leans forward enough that if you shelf isn't set back at least 1/4" the cabinet door won't shut all the way. Will work great for a pantry shelf where you don't have a door closing against it.
