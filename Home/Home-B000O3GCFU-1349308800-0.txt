review/summary: Nice design for warm (or cold) lunchesreview/text: We have 4 of these (various designs). They hold up well to daily use. Would buy them again and again, as it's helping to keep our kids eating healthy.To keep food piping hot, put really hot water in the container while you prep/warm/reheat the food that you want for lunch. Empty the water, put your warmed food in, screw the lid on, and 5-6 hours later....it's still hot. If you do the same with cold water/cold food...it's still cold when you open it.A great way to get your kids to use these every day...is to get them involved. Let them choose a couple designs. We have these for warm lunches, and several of the other various sized stainless steel lunch containers for cold (sandwich/snack plate/etc) lunches. Have a few stainless steel drink containers also. In addition, we let the kids choose their daily lunch menu at the grocery store, spending the same amount as if they were buying at school. The only 'requirement' is that anything they choose to buy can't come in a box (which really helps eliminate ~90% of the junk food out there). These containers have really helped getting them eating fresh and non processed food/vegetables/fruit. It just works. Almost 3 years straight without our kids (8yrs & 10yrs) asking to eat lunch at school.One side effect, a couple of our kids' BFFs (and lunch buyers) have asked their parents to get these (really!), as they see the cool designs, containing our home made left overs, as well as what the kids buy at the market....and they think it all looks/smells 'yummy'. One BFF even asks every day, 'What'd you bring today'?Clean up is also easy. Rinse/brush with hot soapy water...although sometimes they've seen the dishwasher when we're in a hurry.
