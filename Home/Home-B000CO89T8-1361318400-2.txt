review/summary: fire hazardreview/text: I replaced an old Betty Crocker warmer due to age (20 years) with this, ironically because I thought I may be pushing my luck with ancient wiring. The first time out of the gate, I left the house with the warmer on for hours...the on/off indicator light is so dim I can only see the glow if I cup my hand over the light to shade it. Scared me enough to pull my old one back out, it has an automatic shutoff that would have prevented my potentially dangerous oversight. And warms better anyway!
