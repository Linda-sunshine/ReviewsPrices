review/summary: Happy with my purchasereview/text: I purchased this juicer a few months ago and have been using it a couple times a week. I have never used another juicer but am very satisfied with how much juice I get out of it. It is very easy to assemble and clean.The only negative thing I can say about it is that it does not process kale very well, which bummed me out. Other than that I would definitely recommend it!
