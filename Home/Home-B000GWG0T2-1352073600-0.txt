review/summary: Worked as advertised. Great Product!!!review/text: We watch America's Test Kitchen and Cooks all the time. And quite a few years ago saw this frying pan win their test. When our set finally needed upgrading I found the model number and purchased from Amazon. Have been 110% satisfied with the purchase. Great non-stick properties, super easy cleanup. Have made EVERYTHING in them. We use olive oil only when we want to add flavor etc...not because we have too anymore. I hope T-fal keeps making these when we need to buy again. Must buy for any home cook!
