review/summary: Great for pancakes & french toastreview/text: We use this griddle ALL the time! We turn to this heavy duty griddle whenever we are cooking up pancake/french toast for the family. It sits right on top of our gas range & we are able to cook 2 pancakes at once. We have tried the other side for burgers, but prefer to use a flat pan instead. The rippled griddle side is more time consuming to clean up than a flat pan. Love that nothing sticks to it. Would definately purchase again---as matter of fact--I have purchased it again as a gift for another family member!
