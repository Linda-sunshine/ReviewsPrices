review/summary: Pefectreview/text: I can't believe how well this vacuum works for the price. I just moved into a 3-story row house and was NOT going to lug my old vacuum up and down. I also prefer a bag to a bagless model as I don't like the dusty mess of emptying the canister - I like being able to just toss the whole bag. I looked for the lightest one I could find and just hoped the reviews were correct and this one has been wonderful. I even had a maid over once who didn't want to lug hers (a very expensive model you've probably seen on TV) up the stairs and she said mine was better. Score!
