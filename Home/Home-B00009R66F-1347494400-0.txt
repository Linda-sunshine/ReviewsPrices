review/summary: Love itreview/text: I had an older model of this for many years but after a puppy chewed a few of the parts had to get rid of it. When it came time to buy a new one there was no question, it'd be the Hoover. It does a great job, you can see from the dirty water in the tank. It's quick and easy to fill/empty. It is also very easy to push/clean with and you can do it one handed- as I did while holding my 8 month old. Overall great product for the money. I've recommended it to a couple of friend who have also purchased it and are satisfied customers.
