review/summary: Love the Nordic egg boilerreview/text: I have only used a couple of times, but I love this gadget! It saves watching a pot on the stove. Even if I turn off the stove to let eggs cook, I forget about them sometimes. They also seem easier to peal, I just don't understand why, but it works!
