review/summary: Farberware stopped workingreview/text: Loved farberware for many years but this is the second coffee pot I have purchased in the last year. I bought the 10 cup and it just recently stopped working properly. It only perks half way through the coffee making process. I am very disapointed to say the least and now out of my return timeframe as I bought it in March 2012.
