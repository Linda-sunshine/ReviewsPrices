review/summary: Honeywell Air Purifierreview/text: I was entirely thrilled with this product. It has minimized the amount of cigarette smoke, pet hair, and dust in my bedroom. I keep it running on the lowest setting normally.. but it works amazingly just on that one that I can't imagine how amazing it would work on the higher ones!
