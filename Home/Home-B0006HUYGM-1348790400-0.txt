review/summary: Great suction, good value, room for improvement.review/text: Pros:Inexpensive, good valuePowerful suctionExtra long power cordDoes what a vacuum is supposed to do.Cons:Vent is positioned downward, so dust and pet hair blows everywhere, even when you're being careful.Vents powerfully and generates a lot of heat, much like the average hand-held blow dryer.Hose is short, so not very helpful.Best for flat surfaces, won't reach nooks and crevices in car.Very bulky (definitely not a Dust Buster) and a bit heavier than I was expecting.I anticipate having to replace the filter often.Good quality at this price. Just don't set your expectations too high.
