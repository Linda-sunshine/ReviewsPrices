review/summary: Just worksreview/text: I have a feeling this thermometer is going to last me a while. I use it for homebrewing and somehow I managed to drop it into boiling wort twice today. First time it spent about 30 seconds in there, which melted the front face, but I got a good temp reading though! Hope my beer doesn't end up tasting like thermometer. Still reading just fine - it is indeed waterproof, not simply water-resistant. See pics.The probe is a little too short to be using for a 5-gallon batch, but that's not a fault with the thermometer. Seems pretty accurate (temp of boiling water at sea level - 99.9C)
