review/summary: Almost perfectreview/text: I really like it. It was easy to assemble. Easy to clean. I spilt a glass of wine on it 1st night and it left no mark. (I didn't buy it for a nursery item, I just wanted a glider rocker and I didn't want to pay all outdoors for it). A month down the road it did develop a tiny squeak. (hence the 4 not 5 stars). Another downside is one of the cats like it so much I have to fight him for it.
