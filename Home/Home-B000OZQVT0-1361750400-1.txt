review/summary: Always Fantasticreview/text: These gel fuel cans for our fireplace have never failed to perform. We have a small living room and one can will raise the thermostate 4 to 5 degrees every time. The burn time is usually around three hours. The other plus is that once burned, you just throw the can away. No more messy ashes to clean. I have tried other brands of gel fuel, but have found the burn time to be less and some have a horrendous chemical smell that makes them less than pleasurable. The Amazon price for these is also outstanding.
