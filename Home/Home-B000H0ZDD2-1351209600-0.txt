review/summary: Didn't work at all!!review/text: I have a mobile grooming business so I bathe dogs in a 10x6 trailer. It gets VERY humid in there which makes it take MUCH longer to bathe dogs. I bought this because it seemed to have a lot of good reviews and used it the very next day. I made sure to read all instructions (which were simple) and I had the unit in my trailer for 4 hours while I bathed and dried 3 dogs. It got SO humid in my trailer you could see it. But the Eva-dry only had a Tablespoon of water in it after 4 hours of non-stop running!Note, I find the disposable dehumidifier things from Dollar tree work much better.
