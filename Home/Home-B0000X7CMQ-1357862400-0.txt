review/summary: Some flaws, but okay.review/text: I bought this pot to replace a Krups pot that I had and loved for many years. I tried to find the same Krups pot but couldn't and decided to settle for this, based on the reviews.I was looking for the following things in a coffee maker:1. Thermal2. Programmable3. Cone shaped filter4. 10 cupThis maker has all those features, but here are the cons, in my opinion:1. Thermal carafe doesn't keep coffee hot for more than about 1 hour. If there is a substantial amount left in the pot, it will keep it warm, not hot for about 1.5 hours.2. There is an extra little lid that pushes down onto the screw on lid. This piece cannot be in place when brewing coffee, so it must be kept handy to put on immediately after brew cycle. The carafe will not fit onto the maker when this piece is in place so the carafe has to sit on the counter.3. The screw on lid is VERY hard to turn if it is tightened properly. The lid has ridges and they dig into your hand while you try to unscrew it. If you leave it slightly loose, the coffee cools off very quickly. I have been using a rubber grip to unscrew the lid. It works, but not very convenient.4. The cone shaped filter makes good coffee, but the design for this one is a bit odd. You have to move a spigot to the side in order to put the filter in and then remember to move it back over the coffee grounds before turning it on. If you don't remember to do this, the hot water will go back into the resevoir. Better than on the counter, I guess.I regret my purchase, but will continue to use this pot until I feel I have gotten my money's worth out of it. If you don't mind the inconveniences and you finish your coffee quickly in the morning, this pot may work for you.
