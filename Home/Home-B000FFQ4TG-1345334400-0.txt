review/summary: A suggestion for All Bunn owners - Get a timerreview/text: Reduce your electricity use and reduce maintenance.GET A TIMER. I bought a Sunbeam model from Amazon and then program it for when you will use it. Ours is programmed from 5-10 am. It takes 15-30 minutes for it to heat up so remember that when programming. The one I got has an easy overide - so for any other time just turn it on and allow for 15 minutes of warm up. Timers are available for 7 day programming, too.Not only will this reduce your electric consumption, it will reduce the calcification of the heating element if you have hard water.There is a reason that almost all coffee / espresso bars use Bunns or their clones. They brew great coffee. And the home models are built almost to the same standard as their commercial cousins - the heated parts and tank are stainless steel.If you live at a high altitude (I live at 7500'- so water boils at a lower temperature) be sure and get a high altitude rated one or buy a commercial model that has adjustable brew temperature (make sure it has this feature).The reason they do not have a "pause" is they brew too fast - water would quickly overflow the filter. As a long time Bunn user you will become adept at pulling the pot off and brewing into your cup with only a few drops spilled.So, yes a Bunn has a few quirks - but the coffee is worth it.
