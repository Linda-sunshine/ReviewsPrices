review/summary: fast boilreview/text: I read a lot of reviews before I purchased a kettle, and I'm happy I got a good one! It boils in 1 min 30 sec, it's not too large or heavy, all stainless steel inside, and works really well. Very happy with it. It's not actually cool to the touch, strange advertising, but that doesn't matter because the handle area is cool and easy to pick up and pour.
