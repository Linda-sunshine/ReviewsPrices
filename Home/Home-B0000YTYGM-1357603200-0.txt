review/summary: Nice Coffeemakerreview/text: I don't expect the world from a coffeemaker, but we have had this just under a year now and its been great! Does everything its supposed to and it keeps the coffee warm for a long time without it stewing like coffee in regular coffeemakers. The thermal feature was one of the main reasons we bought it and I've been very happy with it. No complaints.
