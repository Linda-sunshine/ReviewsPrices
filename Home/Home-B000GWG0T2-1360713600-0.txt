review/summary: Wonderful Non-Stick Surface!review/text: I highly recommend this line of saute pans. Just started using it for eggs in the morning. Loved the pan so much I purchased the larger set as well. Medium weight--not too light, not too heavy. Comfortable handle. Works great on our flat top range.Just need to wipe out the pan as nothing has stuck on the pan so far!
