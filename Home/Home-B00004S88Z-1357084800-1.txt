review/summary: outstanding. very similar to Mirro...just a lot largerreview/text: great pressure cooker...but recommend thoroughly researching the size & being realistic on your useage. Maybe twice I have been glad it was a large as it is, but nearly every day I see its bulk glaring back me, as if to say neither my Kitchen nor me is worthy of something so commercially heavy duty. Has a fifty year guarantee...and my bet is they have never had a single claim.
