review/summary: Very pleased with my 2nd Keurigreview/text: The first Keurig I purchased was from Staples. I would brew a cup of coffee but it would have this terrible plastic taste. In looking some online, it appears as though it was a common problem with some of their brewers. Luckily, even though I waited a few months and repeatedly washed the reservoir and ran hot water through it, Staples took it back. So I ordered the B60 from Amazon. Coffee tasted great the first cycle through.I was previously a Tassimo user, but once they lost Starbucks and had a terribly slow time getting more coffee into production, I decided to make the switch over to K-cups. I had this brewer less than a week before Starbucks announced that they were coming out with their own brewer. I'm not sure if that means they will no longer produce K-cups or not. However, it's not a big a deal because there are good alternatives within the K-cup line.I still use a Cuisinart brewer when I want several cups, but for a quick cup or two throughout the day, this works great. Obviously it's not the most economical way to drink coffee, but it's very convenient.
