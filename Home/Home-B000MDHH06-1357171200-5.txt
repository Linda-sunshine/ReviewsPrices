review/summary: Jet engine on your counterreview/text: My wife wanted a juicer that you don't have to do so much preparation and chopping to use, so we thought we'd try this one. For the price, it seemed like a safe bet. And it was.What it will do:- It will absolutely wake up anyone in the house. You think that I am exaggerating about the jet engine, do you?- It will absolutely shred anything that you put in it.- It will absolutely shoot bits of whatever you put in it at your ceiling if not covered.The leftover pulp is a little wet, but overall it does what it claims. We peel citrus and bananas, but don't core apples and just cut up stuff enough to fit down the chute. It even tears through tougher vegetables like beets without slowing down. Very important: Keep the &#34;pusher&#34; over the chute. It isn't used so much for pushing, but as a cap to prevent chunks of fruits and vegetables from exiting the machine at high velocity toward your ceiling. The included recipe book is OK, but we more or less just make juice from whatever is laying around.I can't speak to its dishwasher-safeness, as we have always just rinsed it immediately after use. I can't imagine that dried on carrot comes off easily in the dishwasher. But disassembly and washing is a cinch. The heavy duty brush that is included with the unit instantly scrubs the strainer/blade and everything else simply rinses.We've never owned another serious juicer to compare to it, but we bought it in 2008 and I can say that we haven't thought about needing a different one. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could. The only reason I ding it from 5 stars is that the pulp capacity is a little smaller than I would like (I'd prefer to not empty it as often) and if they could prevent the slinging out the chute a little better, it would be perfect.
