review/summary: Great Juicer...2 Flaws thoughreview/text: I bought this juicer as a way to get my 4 year old to take in some veggies/fruits. Any parent out there that is looking for a good way to do that, I would definitely give this a try. My son would not touch any veggies, nor any fruits that weren't apples/bananas. With this juicer, I throw in carrots, kale, strawberries, and melon. Then I mix with some OJ to balance out some of the taste and it works like a charm. This thing can handle quite a bit.Now, I think there are probably 2 flaws with this product though.1) Cleanup---I know there people that leave reviews saying "cleanup is a snap", but I guess it depends on your definition of "a snap". I personally think it's a huge pain. A pot/pan or a blender is an easy cleanup, but this thing is a pain. There are about 6 parts that need to be cleaned after every use. I don't know...I consider that to be kind of a lot. It's just the way it is so nothing you can do about it, but it's definitely the thing I dread most when it comes to hand washing.2) Size----It is rather big and it takes up quite a bit of space on your counter.I think with those 2 issues, people will probably downplay them and make them out to not be a big deal. But cleanup/size, I don't look at it in a vacuum. It is a pain to clean compared to other appliances and it does take up a lot of space.But still, I think I spent $240 on this thing and $150 is a steal.
