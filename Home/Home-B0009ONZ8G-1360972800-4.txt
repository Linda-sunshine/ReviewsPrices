review/summary: One of the best vacuum cleaners I've owned.review/text: Powerful suction, reasonably attractive design, fairly light and pretty easy to use. The only problem I had with it is the wands cracked on the ends and needed replacing. Overall, I am very pleased with this item. I've had it since 2006, and it still works beautifully!
