review/summary: Buy this you will not be disappointed.review/text: I have spent mucho bucks on seeking the best homemade pizza... pizza stones, pizza bricks all of it... could have just got this and call it a life... Put it on the top rack for 40 minutes on high.. slide your pizza and turn on your broiler.. 4 minutes later perfect pizza... check it out... it is how Mario Batali cooks em in Boston... Cast Iron rocks plus you can use it on a induction burner as a warm plate..
