review/summary: Great until it stops workingreview/text: I have two of these - one for work and one for home. Do they make great coffee? Yes. Are they convenient? Yes. Are they expensive? Yes. I'm perfectly ok with it being expensive if it makes great coffee for a long time. Unfortunately, you should not expect to get more than 1 year out of it (my experience and also, I've recently discovered, that of many others). That makes it incredibly more expensive than what you might think when you buy it.Mine has lost its "umph". The flow dribbles out like an old man with a prostate problem. It will not make a full cup of coffee. If I run water through it without a kcup, it works fine. But when it has to push water through the filter, it really can't do it anymore. Even though I only run water from a reverse osmosis filter through it, I went ahead and descaled it and, as expected, it did not make a difference. I tried forcing water through it (as demonstrated by different people on Youtube) and that did not fix it. I called Keurig. "It can not be fixed and it is out of warranty" said the rep. The offered to sell me another one. I said "No."I'm not sure what I'm going to do now, but I think it's time to look into something else.edit 2-17-2013: The one at home just died. It lasted 25 months. Started to leak water out the bottom when you go through the brew cycle, and of course has little pressure. The one at work lasted about a year. We are not going to get another one.
