review/summary: Great Carpet shampooerreview/text: After reading about so many carpet cleaners I chose this one because of the ratings.I have never owned a carpet cleaner before with 5 cats and a puppy the compact carpet cleaners just weren't cutting it anymore.So easy to assemble, I did it myself. I love the machine, I like the portability and the ease of removal and replacing both tanks. I could not believe the dirt that came out of my carpet. I was so pleased that I went nuts and shampooed all the carpets in my house in no time. It has thus far cleaned every stain I put it up against. Its lightweight and made of plastic which is fine for me, not a hassle to take out. The clean surge feature is great. Overall I love this machine and how well it has cleaned my carpets. Price was right too!!
