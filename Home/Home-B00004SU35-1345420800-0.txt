review/summary: Delicious at-home popcornreview/text: I'll never buy microwave popcorn again. We use our Whirley-Pop popcorn popper once a week for family movie night and it makes delicious popcorn. A little bit of oil, some popcorn kernels a few minutes of turning the handle on the stove and we have freshly made popcorn. It might even be easier than microwave popcorn and I know for a fact that it's healthier, without all of the added chemicals. Friends come over and they are impressed by how quick and easy it is. I love this!
