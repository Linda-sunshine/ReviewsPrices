review/summary: Slow Readoutreview/text: This is a decent thermometer, but it takes to long to give a accurate temperature readout. I use this when cooking meat on my Big Green Egg smoker and I have to leave the lid open to long to get a accurate temperature read. I do like that its waterproof as I ruined my last one by getting it wet. I think I'm going to have to upgrade to a more expensive instant read thermometer.
