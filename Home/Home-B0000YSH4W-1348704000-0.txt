review/summary: An interesting readreview/text: The Giver opens with eleven year old Jonas who lives in a small community. The elders control every aspect of the people's lives such as; marriage, children, and jobs. Jonas finds nothing wrong in his safe community until he is selected to be the new "receiver of memories." As he works with, and begins to befriend, the Giver he begins to realize how controlling the Elders are, how amazing the world from the memories are, and that "release" is not a peaceful term.Lowry does an excellent job setting up a book that at first demonstrates how good a safe community of "sameness" would be; with no one feeling pain, suffering, or hate. As the book goes on she starts to show the reader that without emotions it is impossible to love, and to truly be happy. Lowry also shows how important it is for a community to be diverse, and that everyone is their own unique individual. The Giver is an excellent book that teaches bravery and standing up for what you believe in. I could definitely read this book many more times.
