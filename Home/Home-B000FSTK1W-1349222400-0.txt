review/summary: Perfect Size!review/text: This little shower caddy is very "solid" and is super easy to install. I purchased it to replace a corner caddy in my shower and love it! It holds my sponges and bath soap very nicely and also has hooks where you can hang your back brush, etc.I've only had it a few months so don't know how long it will stay on the wall but it's much more convenient than my corner caddy. It's out of my way but easy to reach. Excellent product.
