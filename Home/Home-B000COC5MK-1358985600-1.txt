review/summary: Elegant and Usefulreview/text: I bought 3 of these in different colors, for Christmas presents. It looks elegant sitting on the counter. It keeps a charge, so you can use it all evening, or take it with you. Works effortlessly. I always had a problem with a cork screw...never would get the cork out. This is a must for every wine household. This works everytime, all the time!! And Oster is a very well known brand.
