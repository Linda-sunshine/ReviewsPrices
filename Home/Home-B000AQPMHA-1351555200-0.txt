review/summary: Differentreview/text: I've had this brewing system for almost two years and have been reasonably pleased with it. It does make some strange noises at times and keeping up with k-cups if you are a big coffee drinker can be pricey. Overall, it does make a decent cup of coffee and cleanup is minimal with no messy filters.
