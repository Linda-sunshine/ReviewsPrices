review/summary: Fantastic!review/text: I just wish I would have known about these before. I love these! The only thing is, they aren't leak-proof. So don't try to brew Kombucha in them or throw a drink in them and toss it in your lunch bag. But for storing leftovers upright in the fridge - or storing beans, pasta, beads, cereal, cotton balls, etc... these are perfect. Love them!
