review/summary: Sleeping comfortablereview/text: I bought this topper per family recommendation....they were right on. I got a memory foam bed as a gift & it was rock hard...i couldn't sleep more than an hour on it. The topper arrived just after xmas...no bad smell...it transformed my extra firm mattress into a bed I literally am excited to get in every night. It's soft, not hot..i live in the tropics. And I can't even feel my hard memory foam underneath. I did a lot of research during my sleepless nights & am very pleased with this product
