review/summary: Can't beat itreview/text: The only issue with cast iron is the weight. Since I live in Manhattan and have a galley kitchen I hang my pans on the wall, and you can't do that with cast iron. Oh well, I pile them up in a corner and in my stove. It's worth it. Although they come well seasoned, I still season them (when they're hot) for a little while pretty often - they're really great. Nothing like an Apple Crisp made in a cast iron skillet on a cold day! Yum!!
