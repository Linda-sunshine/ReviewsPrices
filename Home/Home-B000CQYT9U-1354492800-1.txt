review/summary: Willow Tree SISTERS BY HEARTreview/text: Quite fine. The recipient was charmed by the sentiment. She also liked the two figurines being separate. This reaction was from a somewhat stoic person. Bravo! I have given a variety of Willow Tree angels as gifts. The simplicity of art and design simply underscore the power of the sentiment.
