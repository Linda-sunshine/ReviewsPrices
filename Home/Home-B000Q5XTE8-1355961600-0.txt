review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: Easy to assemble (although the instructions are a joke). The chair feels sturdy with decent weight.However, it is ridiculous that a chair like this comes with no rocker function. The seat and back have independent inclination controls, but once set the chair rocks no more. Even a low priced store brand has a pull-out lever to allow this basic functionality.I bought this chair as I was in a bind with my current chair broken. But, I will not be using this chair long until I find replacement.Disappointed with this purchase.
