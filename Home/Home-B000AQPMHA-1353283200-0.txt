review/summary: Don't do it!!! Piece of garbage....review/text: I was a die hard Keurig fan when they first came out. My first machine was purchased before they were even mainstream and I loved it. It lasted almost 2 years. When it died I just assumed it was from use and bought another one. That one lasted less than a year and had the same problem. Since then I have gone through 4 machines and each one dies sooner than the last. I am finally moving on. Love the concept, love that I can make only one cup BUT not worth the hassle to take them back every time. I read somewhere that Keurig changed their manufacturing and that the quality went down and I agree wholeheartedly. I wish they would go back to whatever they did in the beginning because my first one was definitely the best. Today my newest machine died after a few months. Moving on.....
