review/summary: Cuisinart did not stand behind product.review/text: We bought this grinder. It worked great for about 2 weeks. Then it stopped grinding properly. When Cuisinart was contacted they would not stand behind the product. It took about 3 months to get them to respond to me then just to be told they would not do anything.
