review/summary: Love the blender, but this IS a REPLACEMENT buyreview/text: I love this mixer--it's easy to clean and use and chops the food very finely. I primarily use it to make babyfood, so the smoothie cup is very convenient, but I also make pureed soups, for which it is very effective. However, I had to purchase this item a second time because my first one broke when I was trying to puree some sweet potatoes. I admit, the potatoes were probably too thick, and I had the blender for well over 3 years, but the gear/spline in the attachment stripped out and is no longer useful. When I tried to buy just a replacement wand, it cost just as much as buying a new blender. So I got a different color, just for fun. I'd definitely buy it again, but was a little disappointed that a few potatoes defeated my first blender...
