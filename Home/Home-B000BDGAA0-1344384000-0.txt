review/summary: very disappointedreview/text: I've been looking for the perfect pillow for months now. I have a pinched nerve and herniated disk in my neck. I spend a lot of time tossing and turning. I use a squishy microbead pillow to provide some support and I hoped this would do the trick throughout the night. Unfortunately it was so packed with beads it doesn't give enough to cradle my neck and head. It's terribly stiff and hard and I haven't even put on the cover. I'll be returning this and continue searching for the right pillow.
