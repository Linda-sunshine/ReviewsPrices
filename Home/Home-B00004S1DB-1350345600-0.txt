review/summary: Great. Easy. Cheapreview/text: Wonderful product. Easy to use, easy to clean, solid construction. Will keep coffee hot for hours with lid closed. Also not bad looking for something of that price, does not look cheaply made at all. Couldn't recommend a better french press, the filter lets almost no sediment through. Worth buying.
