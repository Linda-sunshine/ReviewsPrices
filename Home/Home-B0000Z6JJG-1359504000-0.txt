review/summary: Love the SaladShooter!!review/text: I've had the smaller SaladShooter for many years and it was almost ready to be retired. I checked on line to replace and found the &#34;Professional&#34; size, thought it was a better buy. It has a larger capacity with more power to grate and slice. Love the divided top shoot - I can stand up baby carrots, push down and it slices across nicely. Glad I purchased!
