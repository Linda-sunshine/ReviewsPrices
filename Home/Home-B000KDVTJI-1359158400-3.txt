review/summary: Why Didn't I Get One Ten Years Ago?review/text: I could have prevented blackening a lot of kettles and saved the stove burners from the melted plastic handles when they boiled dry if I was focused on something else and screened out the sound of the whistle. Auto shut off is a beautiful thing.
