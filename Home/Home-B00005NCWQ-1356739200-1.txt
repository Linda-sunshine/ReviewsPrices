review/summary: Great coffee pot!review/text: For $20 you can expect much but this coffee pot delivers. I purchased this coffee pot after reading some of reviews and felt some people were being too hard on a $20 coffee pot. I purchased the coffee pot for a trip with all intentions of throwing it out when the the trip was over. BUT... the coffee was soooo good from this old school coffee pot I brought it home. It takes a little time to brew but well worth the time. The best pot ever for the $$!!
