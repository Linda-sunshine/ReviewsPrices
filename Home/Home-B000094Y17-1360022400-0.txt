review/summary: Brita Grand Water Filter Pitcherreview/text: Recommended by friends. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at the taste of the water. The only negative is that there is a learning curve as to how much water you can keep adding to the reservoir before you have a spillover (or cover pops off) when one tips the pitcher to pour. It's not clear to me at this point when enough is enough.
