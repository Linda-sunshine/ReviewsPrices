review/summary: It's just a can opener.review/text: This product has received an average amount of use (3-4 times a week) and it's held up okay. I wouldn't say it's amazing, but it's certainly not a piece of junk. If you can find one look for one that cuts without the razor sharp edge and has good reviews. That's been our favorite style to date. This one does the old sharp edge cut. In that category it's adequate. Go ahead and get it. You won't be disappointed.
