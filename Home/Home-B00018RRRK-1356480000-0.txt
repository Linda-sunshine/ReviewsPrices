review/summary: Cuisinart DBM-8 Burr Millreview/text: I have owned the DBM-8 Grinder for almost six years now. It has outlasted three coffee makers. I use a Kuerig K-Cup machine right now. The taste of your coffee is only as good as the coffee you grind; if it's a little bitter add a pinch of salt to the coffee before brewing this will take the bitterness out. I do not worry about the powder near the top after grinding. Bang the holding bin on the counter before opening the cover and mix the powder with the ground coffee. I adjust the grind settings by the strength of the particular brand of coffee that I use, some times finer for a more robust flavor. I take the thing apart maybe once a year for cleaning if I think about it. People worry too much about the small crap; it's just a $50 grinder after all.
