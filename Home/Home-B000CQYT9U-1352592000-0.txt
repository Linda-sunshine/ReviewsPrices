review/summary: Willow Tree Figurine, Quietlyreview/text: The Willow Tree figurines are all lovely products with a lot of sentimental value. Over the last few years, I have purchased several of them. This one shows a mother and two sons. It is especially dear to me because I am the mother of two sons and I lost my older son to a drunk driver a few months ago. This figurine is one that reminds me that I still have two sons, both of whom I love dearly! I also purchased the "brothers" Willow Tree figurine, so that my younger son may have it as a keepsake of the special relationship he had with his older brother.
