review/summary: Love it!review/text: I've used this 9-cup food processor to make pie dough, homemade pimento cheese, pureed tomatoes, sausage balls, and much more. I love it. It decreased my "prep" time in half. I've put it in the dishwasher for easy clean up. I don't think it's too loud, but I'm not sure why anyone would expect something that pulverises food, to be quiet. It stores nicely. Now I need to get the storage for the discs and blades. Right now, I just store them in a plastic bag, which isn't very safe. I look forward to making more foods for the holidays with my Cuisinart Food Processor!
