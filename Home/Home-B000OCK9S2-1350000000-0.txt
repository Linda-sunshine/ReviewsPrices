review/summary: If you're sensitive, try to save up for something betterreview/text: I am an HSP. If you know what this is, you'll know that little things tend to stand out to us. The only sound obscure enough to be soothing for me is the rain. The repeat is about a 4/4 count. Not bad on the rain, but very noticable on any other sound. The blue clock is extremely bright in the dark. If you don't look at it straight on, you can't see the time.Because the price was low, it would cost more to send it back and get the new one than it's worth. However - if you like a light in your room, this will work. The blue casts light enough to see. I'll be covering mine with electrical tape and waiting until I can afford and find a much better model.The sounds are NOT life-like. So if you're expecting that, you don't want this. The white noise is like when the tv's used to sign off...it is that kind of static. Some of you might remember that and actually enjoy that sound. Becuase the repeat is so quick, any other choices are not good for relaxation. Maybe to drown out other sounds, but certainly not if you want it for any kind of peaceful moments. The heartbeat would be good for a new puppy tho'.It'll work in a bind if you can find a sound on it that doesn't annoy you and if the light is not a problem. Otherwise, do not buy this item. The reviews are mixed, so it obviously is not as bothersome to most. But if you have any sorts of sensitivities to sound or light, please save yourself the grief.
