review/summary: AMAZINGreview/text: I don't know how much more there is to say other than AMAZING. I love this thing and use it all winter. I've made tea in this first thing in the morning and then left this in the car in 30*F weather for 5 hours and the tea is still at drinking temperature. In fact, the only complaint might be that you have to let your tea cool a bit before putting the lid on or it might be too hot to drink when you're ready to enjoy it. Buy it now!
