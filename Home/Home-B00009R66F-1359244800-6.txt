review/summary: Cheaply made & horrible suction powerreview/text: I purchased this steam cleaner after reading all of the great reviews. I have a small 4 pound Chihuahua who had a pee pee accident on my brand new & expensive wool area rug. I thought this would be a great way to remove the stain & odor. I was very wrong. The steamer is made of cheap plastic & I believe the cleaner was already broken when I received it. I am very adept at putting mechanical things together so I had no problem with the assembly but the parts were so cheaply made & flimsy that I was surprised that it got such great reviews. Anyway I proceeded to use the machine as instructed in the manual & at first it wouldn't even spray any water then after a few tries it started spraying the water but the suction power was horrid. After trying to clean two spots I decided to take a quick break & turned the unit off but left it on top of the area rug...huge mistake. When I came back about 15 minutes later, I saw that the steam vac had leaked most of its clean water/detergent contents all over my brand new rug & the rug was sopping wet! Ugh! I quickly tried to mop up the mess but could not get all of the water out. I put some towel under the rug & propped the rug up to help facilitate drying. The next morning I saw that the liquid had left a big brown water ring & ruined my rug! Yes I assembled it right & no the water leaking was not my fault. I sent the machine & the matching &#34;premium&#34; pet stain carpet shampoo back! I got a Bissell Little Green Machine instead as I only need to clean small area when my lets have accidents & found that &#34;Natures Miracle&#34; works much better than the &#34;premium&#34; Hoover pet stain shampoo. If you're looking for a sturdy, high quality machine that has strong suction power, this is not the machine for you. I can't believe that the machine I bought to clean the doggie pee stain ended up creating a much larger & harder to remove stain on my beautiful new carpet!
