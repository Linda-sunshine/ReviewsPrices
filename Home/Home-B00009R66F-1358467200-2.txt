review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I ordered this carpet cleaner based on all the great reviews. When it arrived, I put it together and followed all the instructions. Unfortunately it didn't work at all. The brushes wouldn't spin, there was no suction, and it ended up leaking the cleaner/ water solution all over my carpet. The carpet looked worse than it did before. I opted to buy another Bissell like I have used in the past. I'm sure this is a good product if you actually get one that works, but unfortunately it was nothing but a waste of time and money for me.
