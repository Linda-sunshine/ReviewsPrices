review/summary: "Promise"--Beautiful Figurinereview/text: I purchased this Demadco Willow Tree figurine, "Promise" for a family member who has been admiring my Willow Tree collection. This is her first figurine, and she just loves it. While art is subjective to the viewer, I have not met a woman in my circle of family/friends who hasn't enjoyed receiving a Demadco Willow Tree figurine yet. There are so many to choose from that capture and express a feeling or emotion in a subtle but impactful way, that one is sure to find "just the right one" for the recipient.This solid figurine is made very well and the muted tones and design/movement of this captures a tenderness but strength that is a pleasure to view. Because this particular figurine was the one that most captured my family member's attention, I chose this one. But, this would (in my opinion) make a very special gift from a man to his girlfriend or wife, or as an engagement, wedding or anniversary gift for a couple. This stands very well and looks beautiful from every angle, and I recommend it.
