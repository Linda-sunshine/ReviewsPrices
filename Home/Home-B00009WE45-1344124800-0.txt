review/summary: Great thermometer for the pricereview/text: This is a great basic meat thermometer. Very easy to use. The only downside is that the temperature readings do take awhile to stabilize. It may take a good 10-15 seconds from the time you stick the thermometer in the meat to the time you get a final reading. Not a big deal but if you are standing with the oven open waiting for the readout it can get a little hot.
