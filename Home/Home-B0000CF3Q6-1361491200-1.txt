review/summary: Handle Broke Off Within One Weekreview/text: I really like this type of stovetop espresso maker, and have used one before. I was somewhat disappointed with this one because the black handle that makes it easy to pick up the hot metal thing full of espresso and pour it into a mug broke very quickly--literally within a week of its arrival. I guess I could experiment with reattaching it, and I can still use the device with the careful help of an oven mitt, but I generally expect kitchenware to remain intact for longer than a week. I also thought that the particular model I was purchasing was going to be larger, though that is probably my own fault for failing to read the product specifications closely enough before pressing &#34;add to cart&#34;.
