review/summary: Designed Very Wellreview/text: I am pleased with the design of this product and the fact that it is sturdy. I especially like the center space for a bar of soap with drainage slots. The two baskets help keep products separate for easy identification in the shower without glasses. The hanger for a razor does not work. I kept knocking it off.
