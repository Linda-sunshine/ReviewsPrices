review/summary: I love my first Cast Iron Pan!review/text: I've always been afraid of cast iron, but since so many of my vegan recipes call for it, I finally decided to try it. Well, I love it! Everything cooks so evenly and it's very easy to keep clean. As a bonus, I also realized I can make my homemade pizzas in it (so I didn't have to buy a pizza stone. BIG plus)... the pizzas come out perfect! I love my Lodge Skillet. (ps It's also made in the USA, which to me, is a great bonus.)
