review/summary: Perfect sizereview/text: I bought a 10-cup processor and this one. Guess which one I use all the time and which one is still in the box? Yep - this is the processor I use all the time. There's just two of use to cook for, so usually I just need a couple cups of sauce, veggies, etc. This does the job fast, looks good, takes up hardly any space and is a dream to clean.
