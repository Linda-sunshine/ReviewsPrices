review/summary: Surprisingly terrible!review/text: We got one of these for our son's tiny nursery (about 8'6 x 12') to help with the lack of humidity in winter. He loved it. He named it Fred. Not only is Fred impossible to fully clean. Not only is Fred difficult to fill without your arm breaking off. Not only is Fred noisy. But Fred doesn't humidify. At full blast, it would take literally 3 days to deplete a single tank.And I wish it was confined to the first one we got. We got 2 replacements from Crane that worked the exact same way. Their customer service was fantastic and very polite, but the product is absolute garbage. I considered trading Fred in for a drop, but the drop suffers from the same filling and cleaning issues. I'm going back to Kaz in a big way.
