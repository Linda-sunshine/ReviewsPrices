review/summary: Amazingly, this is a great little grinder!review/text: I didn't expect this to work that well when I bought it. After all, it's plastic and I didn't see how the suction apparatus would really work. Boy, was I wrong. This little thing works GREAT!It's manual, so cut your meat pieces somewhat small to make life easier for yourself (1/2- 1 inch wide strips do the trick) and make sure you've put all of the pieces in correctly. Shiny knife-edged part of the 4-sided cutter faces outward, away from the grinder. Do that, and it all works like a charm. The suction works brilliantly on any flat surface, and it takes apart easily to clean. It's very sturdy, which I didn't expect in a plastic grinder at all - definitely high-impact plastic. Plus, it doesn't take up a lot of space like my old grinder did.I've been making fresh ground beef for burgers and meatloaf and home-made sausage because I don't like the gristle/fat in store ground meat, and it is SO much better tasting and really doesn't take that much extra time to do - maybe 5 minutes more than opening a pack of store ground who-knows-what. I've also ground nuts for cookies (French Lace need finely ground pecans).I haven't used the pasta maker yet, but since it's the same concept I don't expect a problem.If you want a grinder, buy this.
