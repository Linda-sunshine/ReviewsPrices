review/summary: The best tap filter I have usedreview/text: Simple in design, this faucet mount filter has far outlasted any other I have used (4+ years). There is no filter change indicator, so I regularly replace the cartridge within the recommended time based on my usage. Culligan makes a durable, no-nonsense filter.
