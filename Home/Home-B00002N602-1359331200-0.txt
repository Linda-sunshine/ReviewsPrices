review/summary: Satisfied customerreview/text: I did quite a bit of research online before purchasing this pressure cooker. It's definitely not top of the line but it absolutely does the job at a economical price. This is my first pressure cooker so I wasn't even sure if I would use it often, but the Presto has won me over. I use it multiple times each week - it's a fantastic convenience. Note that there is some minor assembly required.
