review/summary: Smoothie extraordinnairereview/text: I bought this blender about seven months ago and within the last three months specifically, I've been using it to make smoothies two or three times daily and it performs perfectly. The one thing I can say I'd change is the setting on the blender that is supposed to prevent the contents from being sprayed onto the lid. It does this by starting the blades at a low speed, then increasing the speed quickly to the speed you chose. The desired effect is lost and a lot of the contents (especially leafy greens, saturated in almond milk for my green smoothie)end up stuck to the lid.Other than this slight inconvenience, I find this blender highly reliable and a great starting point if you're looking into a diet rich in smoothies. That's been my main use for it, as I transition into being a vegan. Smoothies are a large part of my diet and I don't know where I'd be if I was still using my $40 wal-mart buy. Plus I have this blender in Raspberry Ice and it looks so good on my counter. I get a ton of compliments on it!
