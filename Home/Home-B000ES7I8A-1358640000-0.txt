review/summary: hammer the spoutreview/text: I have this in my cart and after reading other people's reviews who have said they have done a lot of research...(for me :) hehe :) I plan on trying this out and then starting to reform the spout with hmmeringand maybe bending with plyers, etc...it's too good of a deal-the spout aside. I am in need of a new one; as my plastic one is leaking-no more cancer kettle for me :D Going to have to make a cozy/fabric holder for the outside because we aren't used the steel and can touch the outside of our plastic one (without getting burned). If you don't like waiting for dishes to soak, you can the water from your kettle :) If you don't like waiting for stove water to boil for spaghetti, or whatever, this speeds things up, also I've used mine in my shower (on the walls), my plastic kettle. So excited for this one :D However, if you don't like having to fix things you might rethink this one and purchase one with a better spout.
