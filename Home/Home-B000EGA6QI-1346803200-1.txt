review/summary: Powerfulreview/text: Very nice immersion blender with enough power to blend everything I throw at it. Mainly malts with frozen fruits ( like ice ), soups, and sauces. It's incredible easy to disassemble and clean. Nice to not have to dirty up the real blender for 90% of what I would use it for.
