review/summary: Cuisinart DTC-975BKN Thermal 12-cup coffeemakerreview/text: This is the same coffeemaker as the same one I replaced and it does have some not perfect aspects,i.e if the filter/ coffee basket is not seated correctly the coffee and grounds are diverted out of the pot. Just make sure the basket is seated correctly and life is good. It makes good coffee and I love the thermal pot,which keeps the coffee hot for hours and maintains the flavor.
