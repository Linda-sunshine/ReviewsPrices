review/summary: DEFECTIVEreview/text: ******** READ ALL OF THE REVIEWS********1. All of the water leaks out of the clean water compartment2. The handle screws/bolts don't match the rest of the apparatus, you must go out and buy your own!3. The dirty water bin top is close to impossible to close, I had to use a closed-fist punch to close it4. The release latch was defective, thus making it impossible to stand upright.Do not buy this, if you do, well, you can't say I didn't warn you.I returned mine is &lt;24 hours.
