review/summary: Ordinarily would give 5 stars, but...review/text: Nov. 2012: I've used these filters in the Brita pitcher for years, and the filtered water tastes much better than local water, which has high chemical taste. However, the last two filters have run the water through at high speed - very different from usual slow filtering. I actually threw away a filter thinking it was faulty, but the next one from same package did the same thing. The filters aren't cheap, and I'm wondering about checking with the company about this. First I'd like to know if anyone else has had this problem recently. (I see there were some complaints of this in 2010). Thanks for any replies.
