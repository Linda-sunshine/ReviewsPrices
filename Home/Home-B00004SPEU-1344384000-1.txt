review/summary: Great little grinderreview/text: We already have a coffee grinder, but I wanted a second one to use for non-coffee items. I make our baby's food and I needed something to grind the rice to powder to make rice cereal with. I also wanted something for grinding spices. I did some research and debated between getting one where the grinding chamber is removable and thus easier to clean. However, based on my research, it sounded like those grinders are not as powerful as one where the grinding chamber is a part of the unit. So far I have only used with rice but it has worked well and makes the rice a nice powder.
