review/summary: Very bloody - buyer beware!review/text: Blades themselves are crazy sharp and that's good for the veggies. And this product has that over-engineered quality you expect from a German (Swiss?) product. Alas, the veggie holder is the weak link. Too often one is frustrated with it and risks holding the veggies by hand. You might say, "Duh, what do you think could happen if holding the veggies by hand!" And you're right - cut fingers! But as a designer, any design is flawed when it doesn't work as intended and the user makes adaptations. In my opinion, the poorly functioning holder is a big flaw and it puts you (your fingers) at risk. I am not alone in this assessment as other users in our home have had the same problems with the veggie holder. As such, the product is too dangerous to use and after a recent incident will by put out to pasture. One other design flaw is that it sits too close to the counter; you frequently have to clear out the cut veggies to make room for more.
