review/summary: Greatreview/text: These are great. I put them in my fire place and they crackle like real logs. They last about 2.5 - 3 hours too. They do have a strong alcohol smell when you first open them and if you light them right after opening them there is a strong smell... but if you let them sit out for about 20 minutes before lighting them, there isn't an odor.
