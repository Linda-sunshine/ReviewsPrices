review/summary: HATE this processor!review/text: I bought this processor from a big department store. I hate it so much that I am reviewing here. It is flimsy. It also does not work--in prepping a dinner recently, the mayonnaise I was making did not fully emulsify--there was raw egg at the bottom after lengthy processing with a slow stream of oil. I then moved on to a compound butter--the garlic and shallots in the butter never really pureed and, again, at the bottom of the processor, were ingredients (lime juice, chunks of room temp butter etc.) that never incorporated into the mixture. This is an AWFUL machine--and I am a long-time Cuisinart devotee. Taking it back to the department store and praying to find something better. This one is crap.
