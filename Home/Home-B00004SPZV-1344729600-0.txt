review/summary: It works but not like it should.review/text: We used to have a pampered chef sprayer and it worked much better than this thing. The lid has separated from the plastic pump part. But more annoyingly, the spray is like a jet spray from a fire hose not a nice even mist like the pampered chef kind.
