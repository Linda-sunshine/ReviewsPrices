review/summary: Love this thing!review/text: This is exactly what I have been looking for. I have a mix of carpet and wood flooring in my home. Carpet easy to vacuum. Wood floor, not so much as most bare floor vacuums do not seem to pick up what you want to pick up. They leave stray pieces of cat litter behind, etc. SOOOOOOO frustrating. This Hoover, however, picks up EVERYTHING. You can HEAR the power of this baby. So, if you want to get every bit of debris off your wood floor, BUY THIS THING. Nothing I have tried works better . . . ! (Use your other vacuums for your carpets).
