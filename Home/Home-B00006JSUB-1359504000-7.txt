review/summary: A little heavyreview/text: I love this pan! It came pre-seasoned, which was a huge time saver. My Gram has one of those blue diamond frying pans, and this is even more stick-proof! The only thing I don't LOVE about this pan is the weight. I think the website says it is 5 lbs., now way- more like 10!....maybe I'm just a wuss?
