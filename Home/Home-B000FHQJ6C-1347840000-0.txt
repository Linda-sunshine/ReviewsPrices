review/summary: It was working great until.....review/text: Less than a month of use, and not daily, and one of the latches fell off. There is a pressed-fit bearing that holds on the the metal latch and this fell out and the handle off. You can't just put it back together. Disappointed to say the least. It is easy to use and clean and does a fair job on everything I have put through it.
