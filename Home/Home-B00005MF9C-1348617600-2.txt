review/summary: 6 years of great service and counting...review/text: 6 years of great service and still running... Yup! Six years! I'm getting another one right now! The ONLY ONE reason is the filter, I couldn't find anywhere!!! Isn't that stupid? I've tried so many substitutions and none of them worked as the original one. I've made a huge mistake trying to clean it up within a soapy water+vinegar solution. Don't do it! All it takes, just a hot water rinse! I can NOT complain 'bout anything else!
