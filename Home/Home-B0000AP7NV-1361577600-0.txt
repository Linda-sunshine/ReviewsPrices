review/summary: Happy I didn't heed the negative reviewsreview/text: I always drank tap water but in the past few months, I've started noticing more and more of a chlorine smell. I love the convenience of bottled water but the expense and hassle of recycling so many bottles is not my style. Also, a case of water is so heavy to lug from your car to the house after you bought it. ;-)For single-person use, this pitcher is excellent. Follow the directions and you will almost never see any carbon particles in your cup. Soak the filter for at least 15 minutes before use, rinse it off, discard the first 2 pitchers of water, and keep the pitcher filled so that the filter is submerged at all times.I have one at work and one at home.5 stars.
