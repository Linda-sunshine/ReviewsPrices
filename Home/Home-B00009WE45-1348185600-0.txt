review/summary: Good productreview/text: I like this thermometer. It is accurate and it has stood up to the abuse that I have subjected it to. I can't give it 5 stars because it is hard to turn on and the response time is a little slow. I have found that I have to push a sharp object into the on/off switch in order to turn it on.
