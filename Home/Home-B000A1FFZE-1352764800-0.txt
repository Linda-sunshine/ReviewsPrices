review/summary: Double function toasterreview/text: I like this product. Only one thing sometime annoys me. The handle on the side of the toaster ( for the toast function) does not holds from the first push down. Every time it happens I thing it will not work. But otherwise I am happy with it and a lot of my friend will order it from Amazon. They all like that double function and the size of it. Thanks.
