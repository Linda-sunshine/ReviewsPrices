review/summary: Good productreview/text: I like this product as it clears the dirt effectively. The click lock handle to adjust the height is great. 25' power cord is too good for me to cover whole of my living area. One thing i dont like is the stretch hose is very small to reach table tops. Overall its a good product for this price.
