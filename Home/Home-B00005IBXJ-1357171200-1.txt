review/summary: I think I just wasted $50...review/text: I saw the reviews and took a chance (life's full of them, right?) Sorry to dissapoint but many of the 3 star and below ratings are true. My &#34;Pizza Oven&#34; took almost an hour to warm a frozen pizza and all the cheese still wasn't melted. I think this machine/contraption is best used to warm food that has not touched a fridge or freezer. Something like you have a party and wings are getting cold, put them on the &#34;Pizza Oven&#34; and bam, in 30 minutes or more your wings are warm again, 'Nuff said.
