review/summary: It's no substitute for canning, but helps keep food fresher.review/text: I love my vacuum sealer. I pressure can large quantities of foods for long-term storage. Obviously this is no substitute for pressure canning. However, I do use the vacuum sealer all the time for food in the fridge for short-term storage and has really extended the life of our fruit, cheeses and leftovers. I did an experiment when I first got it and cut up a pear and placed half in a vacuum-sealed jar and the other half in a non-vacuum sealed jar. A week later there was an obvious difference as to which one was sealed. The pear pieces in the non-sealed jar had browned and lost their firmness and became a bit &#34;squishy.&#34; The vacuum-sealed pieces were as bright and firm as the day I cut them up.Some of my uses:I'll partition fruit into smaller jars and vacuum seal each one. For example, blueberries that were lucky to last a week before getting moldy can now easily go 2 weeks. (Helps mitigate &#34;blueberry burnout&#34;).I'll scramble a large batch of eggs on Sunday morning and vacuum seal them in smaller jars for easy breakfasts throughout the week.We love goat cheese at our house but don't eat it often enough or fast enough before it gets moldy. I hate throwing away money/food as is but especially hate throwing away expensive food. I started vacuum-sealing goat cheese in a small jar and now it lasts long enough for us to enjoy the entire &#34;roll.&#34;I often have small portions of leftovers that aren't enough to can. I started vacuum-sealing them so we can change up our diet without wasting the leftovers. For example, I'll cook a large batch of chicken. I'll have enough left over for one jar, but the family get's a bit tired of chicken. We used to take a break but the leftovers end up going bad (or too questionable to chance) and I'd end up throwing them away. Now, I seal the chicken, stick it in the fridge and am comfortable eating it a week later.
