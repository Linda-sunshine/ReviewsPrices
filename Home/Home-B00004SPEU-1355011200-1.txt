review/summary: Fantastic and simple grinderreview/text: I love this grinder! I've had my home grinder for over 20 years, and it's still working great. It is a straight forward grinder...no strange twisting to get lids on, dials for grinds, bells and whistles -- just very very simple and it works great.It gets used at least once a day, and frankly I abuse it...I grind super-fine for an espresso machine, and tend to participate in the grinding process for some odd reason by shaking the grinder up and down a few times while grinding. Honestly, I don't recall if, 20 years ago, I decided that super-fine needed that, but it's what I do all the time, even if making a coarser grind for the odd drip-cone cup of coffee. My shaking has been, I believe, responsible for a wire inside coming loose, so once when it stopped working I opened it up, found the loose wire, and reconnected it. Very simple wiring inside. Blades are still sharp, the lid has a few chips in it but so do I after 20 years.I'm reviewing this product now since I'm going to buy a new one soon, to have in the wings should my old one simply give up the ghost one day after I shook it just a bit too much...and I can't bear the consequences of not being able to grind my morning beans if that happens. I've shopped around a bit and looked at what is out there these days, and decided I'm just going to go for exactly the same one -- don't need the Star-Trek Enterprise model coffee grinder (in fact, I bought one of those once for a field station, where it got used less than once-a-day, and it irreparably died after a couple of years....so I bought a Krups for the station instead and it's doing fine).
