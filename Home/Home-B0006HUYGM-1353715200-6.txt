review/summary: Eureka!! An answer to my problem.......review/text: Four cats = hair everywhere!I have tried everything known to man that might effectively clean, collect, remove the hair and nothing yet has been truly successful.Until now!I've cleaned a cat bed and had to empty the vac - that's how much hair that my upright vacuum attachments couldn't pick up. I've cleaned the couch and it's spotless. I've cleaned the quilt in our bedroom. I've cleaned certain areas of the carpet.I have no complaints about "loud." I own a Eureka Boss upright vac that is louder than most vacs so it seems loud may just be a common feature of Eureka products.I'm in my 70s and had a bit of concern about the weight but so far, no problem even when vaccing a vertical surface such as the couch back.Everything about this little gem is easy, easy, easy!
