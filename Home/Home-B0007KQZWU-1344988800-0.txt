review/summary: Best set of pans I've owned!review/text: These pans are the best pans I've ever owned and I've used quite a few other sets. They're easy to clean, even heating, heavy enough to use like ironware, and light enough to use easily everyday. The way they look has my wife wanting me to hang them up in the kitchen for everyone to see. I'm glad I purchased the 4 qt sauce pan to go with the set and 'am thinking about getting a 2 qt and 6 qt soon... yes, I'd buy them again.
