review/summary: Popular giftreview/text: My large extended family does a Yankee Swap on Christmas mornings. Last year my gift for the game was a knife sharpener. It was the most popular gift there- four different relatives attempted to claimed it before the swap was over. So I purchased another knife sharpener for this our 2012 Yankee Swap. It was still very popular. Knife sharpeners are durable & practable. Dull knives are dangerous.
