review/summary: Excellent juicerreview/text: I've had this product for...er...since March or so. Quite an awesome product. I was hesitant to buy it because of all the negative reviews and so I did my research. Found out that the flaw was eventually fixed so I went ahead and bought it, knowing I could return it if there was a problem. Well...end of the year...no problem. My kids love the apple juice it extracts and WOW, is this sucker powerful...lol! I use the pulp from the juices in my compost bin so even my wormies enjoy this machine lol. Overall we are very happy! Thanks Breville...your juicer rocks! Now I don't have to buy Naked juices anymore...they lost our business after they helped to fund prop 37...boo on them!
