review/summary: Wish I bought it a long time agoreview/text: This is a great addition to our kitchen. Even though it is way bigger than our electric burners, it still works great as the whole pan heats up. So for sauteing it is almost like having a large skillet. We have also made large casseroles in there as well, as well as chocolate cake, as you can put the pan in the oven.
