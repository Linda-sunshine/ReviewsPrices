review/summary: Awesome Purifier for a smaller bedroom!review/text: We have two dogs that both shed. One is a Jack Russel Terrier and the other is a Chihuahua. They spend most of their time in our medium sized bedroom. Every other week we have to empty out this filter because it collects SO MUCH dog hair, dust and debris. I absolutely love this purifier. It is well worth the price. It has really really helped with my extreme allergies.Pros:&#8226;Picks up lots of debris and dog hair&#8226;Easy to clean and change out the filter&#8226;Pumps air in and out very quicklyCons:&#8226; It is a little loud, we don't mind this because we always have our fan on anyways&#8226;Filter change light doesn't come on when the filter must be changed so we just clean it every other week.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a good purifier for less than $100.
