review/summary: We love itreview/text: Does exactly what it is supposed to. It opens automatically with batteries or with the adaptor. We chose to use the adaptor so we don't have to worry about the batteries wearing out. Only thing ... it's a little bit disconcerting when after a few seconds, the lid lowers itself. But you get used to that. You can turn off the automatic lift function if you want.
