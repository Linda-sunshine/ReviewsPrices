review/summary: What Do You Mean "Non Stick?"review/text: There are so many reviews raving about this griddle/grill, proclaiming it to be nonstick. I was excited to get one because I am trying to phase out of using pans with nonstick coatings that wear off.I first tried the griddle side with pancakes. The pancake batter has quite a bit of oil in it, plus I added additional oil to the pan. The pancakes stuck pretty badly. I added even more oil so I was practically frying the pancakes -- then they did not stick.Next I tried hamburgers on the grill side. I first gave it some extra oil. The burgers stuck terribly. It was not fun cleaning the grill. I put hot water on the warm grill to soak while we ate the burgers. Then I took a brush to the grill. What a joke -- nothing came off. Then I used the Lodge grill scrapers. That worked better than the brush but still left a lot of meat on the grill. I finally ended up using steel wool which finished the cleaning job. I don't think I will even try using the grill side again because I have better things to do than spend all that time cleaning it.I am disappointed because I had high expectations.
