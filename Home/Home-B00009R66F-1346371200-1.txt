review/summary: Cleans well, but can leak entire tank of dirty water if bumped while carryingreview/text: It is easy to use and cleans well. However, the brushes are too easy to remove it seems. I was carrying the unit down some carpeted stairs with a full tank of dirty water. (Don't ever do this, is what I learned the hard way.) It bumped against a step, and three of the rotating brushes fell out, creating a stream of black water I had just vacuumed from the carpet on the floor above. Only half the waste water in tank came out, because I managed to turn the unit on its side and stop the flow.I had to find the manual and figure out how to put the brushes back in the unit. The manual only described half the steps, because Hoover does not want the consumer to remove individual brushes. 15 minutes later I was able to figure it out -- under the stress of worrying about the damage half a gallon of black water was doing to my carpet and subfloor. Then I was able to vacuum up some of the spill, but most of it had dripped under the carpet where the the vacuum would not reach.If you do carry the carpet cleaner, don't ever do it with dirty water in the tank, and be very careful not to bump it.
