review/summary: My Favorite Mixer - I own Threereview/text: Sweet Mercy's Top 5 Chocolate Chip Cookie RecipesMy KitchenAid is my favorite appliance. I've actually got three of them, two Artisans and one Professional HD. It's sturdy, efficient and fun to use, and when you have it in red, it's pretty!I've actually used these in my bakery and they made great cupcakes, icings, cookies, etc. Honestly, I've abused my KitchenAids but only ever had trouble with one of them. The response I got from KitchenAid customer service when I informed them about the issue blew my mind! They were incredible and resolved the problem immediately.I recommend this mixer to anyone looking for one for home use. For a little tougher mixer, check out their professional line.
