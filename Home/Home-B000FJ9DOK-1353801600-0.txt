review/summary: Still works after 3 1/5 yearsreview/text: Bought this one with 3 other thermos bottles. After more than 3 years, still looks like new. We fill it up with ice and water before heading to the beach. We drank all the water. After 6 hours in the hot sun, by the time I was washing it when I got home, there was still ice in the bottle. Definitely a 5 star product.
