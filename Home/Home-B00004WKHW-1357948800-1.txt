review/summary: Good but Smallreview/text: When buying this I knew it was going to be small but it's really tiny. Its good for making dips but for big dinner prep I wish I would have bought a bigger one. Overall the product is really nice ( had about 1 months) Ive used it every week to help make fritattas and sauces. Good quality product but small.
