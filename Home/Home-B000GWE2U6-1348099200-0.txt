review/summary: Piece of junkreview/text: I don't understand how these Crane humidifiers get so good reviews. I got a froggie for my son and a drop shaped one for our room. We only opened the froggie one, and these were the problems:1- It always left drops of water on the surface where you used it. The instructions said not to put it on wood or a surface that may absorb the water. Well, all my furniture are made or wood. You can not put it on the floor, because it would be too low to send moist in the air. I had to get a small table that I didn't care for, and I used only for the humidifier.2- It can not be too close to any walls because it won't be effective. You have to figure out a special space in the room that is not too close to the walls.3- The instructions said that I you don't want the humidifier to leave water on your furniture, to set it to a lower speed. I measure the humidity in my room, and this humidifier did not change it much at its highest speed, let alone the lowest.It was completely useless. My son had fun playing with his froggie, until he cracked and I didn't even care. I never opened the drop shaped one, and returned it to Amazon.Before the Crane, had a Sharper Image humidifier that worked perfectly.
