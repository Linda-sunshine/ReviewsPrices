review/summary: Too much breakable plastic....review/text: This cleaner works quite well for the tariff, but it is not exactly built to last. In the end it may not be as inexpensive as it looks because it whets your appetite for a carpet cleaner, but I don't think it will hold up very long, so you end up buying a less expensive one and then a more expensive one -- instead of just buying the more expensive one in the first place. It ends up being a throw-away carpet cleaner rather than a long-term investment in carpet cleaning. Again, it works well enough, but the land fill doesn't need more plastic. Save more money and buy a &#34;stronger&#34; unit -- even if it's Hoover.
