review/summary: Great item for soups, smoothies, pestosreview/text: There are things about cooking that are tedious, but this little beauty has made life simpler, tastier and I leave it out because the color is cheerful. I rated it four stars because it isn't the easiest to keep clean, but if I clean it immediately, and I do mean immediately, it is less a problem. This tough part is under the blade, where you cannot see. My kitchen brush does the trick fairly well - toughest cleaning has been in making pestos - where olive oil, basil, pine nuts, garlic tend to hide up under the blade. For soups, this is brilliant. I let the pot cool down, my giant soup stock pot, and immerse the stick and voila, I have cream soups. Why didn't I buy this one sooner?
