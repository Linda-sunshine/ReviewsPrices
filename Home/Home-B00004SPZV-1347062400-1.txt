review/summary: Great for fat controlreview/text: I've switched to using a lot of skinless chicken and baking a lot of my vegetables, but I really had trouble evenly coating veggies without soaking them in lots of oil and the chicken, unless brushed with oil, would end up like shoe leather. A friend of mine had this bottle, and when I first saw her use it, I was intrigued. Sure, I'd thought about non-stick sprays, but in applications where I wasn't trying to prevent sticking, it seemed silly to put all those chemicals onto my food. The idea that this is just pure olive oil (or canola or whatever oil you like) and delivers a fine mist was perfect.Performance-wise, it's great. Pour in a bit of oil, give a good amount of pumps (I average 6-8), point and spray. When done, I loosen the cap and release the pressure so as to prevent leaking. In fact, that's the only reason I deducted one star. I do rather wish the container could handle holding the pressure in for extended periods of time, but it's a small matter of discontent...my impression of this tool is overwhelmingly positive. I've used it for baked fries, baked zucchini, perfect asparagus, and various lean meats, which turned out perfect: slightly crispy around the edges with the insides being succulent and exceedingly juicy. Highly recommend.
