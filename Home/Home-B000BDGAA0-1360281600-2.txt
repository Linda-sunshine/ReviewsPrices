review/summary: Glow effect? My 3rd time buying this pillowreview/text: The 1st two times I bought this pillow, it was the best pillow ever! This 3rd one is too hard. I've used it off and on for a few months now. The other night, I could not get comfortable on it and I punched it down. It glowed where I hit it. Everyplace that I grabbed at the pillow... glowed for a few seconds. I thought I was going crazy so I had my husband try it, and he too saw that with every punch or grab, it glows! What is in this pillow that gives it that effect? If you have this pillow, please try this tonight and come back and let me know if you see this strange phenomenon too.
