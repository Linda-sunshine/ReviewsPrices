review/summary: Really god but not durablereview/text: The product is great. Sleek, simple, convenient. But after about a year of usage I had to rotate the kettle on its base at an exact angle with the cord in order for the electrical contact to work. Now, after less than 3 years, the contact is not established at all. I'll have to buy another kettle, even though I was quite satisfied with the rest of the product.
