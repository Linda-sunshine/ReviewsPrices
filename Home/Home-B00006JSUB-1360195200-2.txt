review/summary: Works well for stir fry but limits your wrist actionreview/text: I bought this as a quick and inexpensive way to cook up stir fry. The skillet cost me $15 through the Amazon Warehouse, so it seemed like Lodge and Amazon were practically begging me to buy it.The skillet works extremely well for its intended purpose. It does take a little getting used to, though, in that washing it with detergent would take off the preseasoning. I'm not overly concerned about this--reseasoning a skillet requires no more than a coating of Crisco in an oven at 350 for an hour. But I don't want to be doing it overly much. In the end, I've found that scrubbing out the pan with plain hot water and a synthetic pad or brush will do the trick.Did I mention that this skillet is HEAVY? I'm 190 and in relatively good shape, and the skillet can still be a bear to handle. Using two hands (there's a handle on both ends) is safest. Try one hand only if you're trying to show off. The elderly or less strong will have difficulty with this pan. My girlfriend, a 55 yo RN, can't handle it.But if you don't mind the heft and have the storage space, it's a great pan to have around.
