review/summary: Just the right sizereview/text: I used the food processor for the first time just two days ago. It is the perfect size for my needs and chopped everything evenly. I bought this processor to replace the 14 cup size which was too big and way too heavy. This model is just heavy enough to keep it from "dancing" around the counter while operating. My only complaint would be that there are so many safety measures built in that you really do have to read the book before using just to put it together. The permanently attached "pusher" seems to be overkill. Are there really that many people who would use their bare hands to push food into a spinning blade?
