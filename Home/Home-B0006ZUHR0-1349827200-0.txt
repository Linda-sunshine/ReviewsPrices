review/summary: Black & Decker D2030 Auto-Off Digital Advantage Ironreview/text: I bought this iron as a birthday gift for my niece, so I don't have any first-hand experience with it. I selected it from her Amazon Wish List and she was very happy that I bought it for her, and she did let me know after she arrived home and used the iron that she absolutely loves it, therefore I feel that I can recommend it on the strength of her comment regarding it.
