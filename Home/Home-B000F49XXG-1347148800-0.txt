review/summary: Only Lasted 5 Monthsreview/text: I loved, loved, loved this espresso machine until it stopped heating after only about 5 months of use. It was perfect in every way after I got the hang of espresso-making. I used it for 1, sometimes 2 espressos most days, taking off a month or so when I experimented with cold-brewed coffee. After reading the problems other folks had with DeLonghi's customer service I'm considering my options, but they don't include another Delonghi purchase.
