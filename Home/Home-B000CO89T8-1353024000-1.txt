review/summary: Good Product Overallreview/text: It definitely heats. I think what's key is having the right mug to use, where the bottom of it is as close to the bottom of it as possible (you'll understand what I mean if you look at the bottom of your mug). I like the product, but be careful not to touch the heated part for more than a couple seconds or you'll burn yourself!
