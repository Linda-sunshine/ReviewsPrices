review/summary: Best pan I ownreview/text: I have had one of these 10 1/4" skillets for several years. When I got it the first thing I did was season it some more (it came pre-seasoned) which is very easy. What I like best about it is that it sears meat really well, and you can cut cornbread or steak in it without worrying about damaging the finish. Cast iron never goes bad. You can always take all the old seasoning off and redo it. I also have a 15" Lodge skillet, and I love that for large roasts or just feeding a large crew. This doesn't work as well on the ceramic cooktop because of the heat ring, but it helps to straddle 2 burners with it. I have more expirementing to do with this and see how is disperses the heat. I suspect that it will always be a great deal hotter right over the burner. And yes you can use cast iron on ceramic cooktops. Just don't drop them. I recommend using 2 hands when moving the big 15" pan.
