review/summary: Great for Everythingreview/text: I've been wanting an enamel dutch oven for a long while but kept holding out for a Le Creuset. I finally gave in when I found this pretty little number by Lodge. I knew they were a well respected name in cast iron and I thought it was just as pretty as the Le Creuset ones but at an eighth the price.Now that I have it I've been using it for almost everything. I've braised chicken thighs, made beautiful vegetable stock, several soups and I will be making doughnuts in it this weekend. It gives everything a great sear without sticking and cleans up quickly and easily. I also love that it heats so evenly, it is my new favorite thing to cook in by far. I highly recommend it.
