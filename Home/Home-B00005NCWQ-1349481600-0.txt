review/summary: Easy to Use and Makes Good Coffeereview/text: We searched through a lot of coffee percolators until we settled on this one. It worked great on the gas stove in our camper, and makes more than enough coffee for 4 people. Good quality, and I like that the inside is finished making it easier to clean than some other models. My one complaint is that there is quite a bit of guesswork involved in deciding when the coffee is ready - the instructions give a range of minutes when it could be done. We basically waited until the liquid bubbling in the clear bulb on top is coffee colored, and then gave it a few more minutes to make a strong brew. It would be nicer if there was diagram for how long to leave however many cups and on what heat level. However, we are generally happy with it, and of the choices available, I would say this is the best.
