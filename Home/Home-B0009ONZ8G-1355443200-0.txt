review/summary: Guys point of viewreview/text: I bought this vacuum in 2006 after a divorce ( yeah, she got the vacuum)from Amazon with NO clue as to what model or make to buy. So I did some reading and after all that, I bought this one back then because it was just under fifty bucks. I though, what the heck, if it's junk, I'm not out that much. Well. It has it's good points and weak (not bad) points. Yep, ya get what you pay for. It's a bit loud, hose is rather thin and short but you can buy an extension. some of the detachments are kinda low grade. Other nasty habit is that if you run over anything like a wire that stops the beater brush it burns through and breaks the belt in a split second, you can't shut it off fast enough. I've changed lots of belts in my day but this flat belt looks like its 3 inches too short to fit.As in....put new belt on motor shaft. ( oh yeah, only 4 screws and turning it upside down to do this) Then comes the fun, you put the belt around the beater brush and you swear it will NEVER reach the slots it drops into. But with all the strength you can muster ( and like I said I'm a guy) you pull until your face is purple , but the thing does fit.....and you feel like, "quick, put the screws in before it come off and breaks a window and flies down the street!) But don't get me wrong, I love the thing. I've had five hundred buck + vacuums that couldn't do what this one does. This thing picks up everything. I swear it feels like it will suck the paint off the wall so be careful around the cat and small dogs. Even after 7 years nothing has broken and it still has all that suction. So if you want to save a truck load of money and need a basic vacuum, this is it. I would buy this one over any other in a heart beat. Now, where's the cat?
