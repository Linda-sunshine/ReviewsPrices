review/summary: The Cuisinart DLC-2009CHB 9-Cup Food Processor is a wonder!review/text: I purchased the Cuisinart 9-Cup Food Processor because of the Cuisinart rating in the Country Cooking food show. There was an ad in the paper for this processor and Amazon.com beat the price.The processor is powerful and mixes doughs rapidly without slowing down. You have shredded carrots, sliced potatoes, cabbage for slaws in seconds.Clean up is easy and there aren't a lot of tiny places in which it is hard to get food out.The DVD that comes with the processor is fun to watch. It shows you how easy the unit is to use.I would highly recommend this food processor.
