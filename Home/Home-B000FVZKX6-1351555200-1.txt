review/summary: Flannel Sheetsreview/text: These sheets are great! They are so soft and comfortable. I purchased them because of the other great reviews. I was looking for some soft sheets, not necessarily warm ones. My mother-in-law has flannel sheets that I slept on and they were so soft so I had to have some. These are warm without being too hot. I recommend these to anyone who is looking for incredible softness. They wash up well and I do notice lint but not too much. Just great sheets, I even purchased a set for my mother-in-law, as hers were getting worn out.
