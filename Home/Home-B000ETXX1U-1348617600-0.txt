review/summary: Lifesaver for guestsreview/text: Having guests over to my studio apartment was not a fun experience until I bought the Insta-bed. I had tried another air mattress previously that was embarrassingly deflated midway through the night. The Instabed inflated in minutes, it wasn't too loud, and it was comfortable for two nights! No re- inflation necessary.
