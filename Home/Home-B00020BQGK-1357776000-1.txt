review/summary: stick vacuumreview/text: i have owned several stick vacuums in the past. i have been trying to keep my last one alive for a few years now. i took a chance and ordered this flair. it is one of the best upright stick vacuums i have owned. it has great suction, whth and without the beater bar. the head on it is fairly small but that keeps the suction high. having to empty the cup more often isnt a problem since i know that that dirt isnt on my floor now. it is reasonably quiet. the exaust doesnt blow the unpicked up dirt everywhere. the cord is long enough to cover a large area without having to plan my cleaning around finding outlets. i wish that i would have bought one of these a long time ago.
