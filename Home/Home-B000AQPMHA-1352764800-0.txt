review/summary: Its Crapreview/text: Do Not buy this Brewer ! This is my third Elite Brewer and all three had the same problem, the brewer will stop brewing a full cup of coffee after a couple of months of use. It was told to me that it was a design flaw but when I asked if it could be replaced with a different model they told me only if I pay for it. Kerig's customer service was great the first time and replaced the brewer for free but by the third time they didnt want to hear it. I asked to speak to a supervisor and they had none availible and someone would call me back.....still waiting. Obviously this model has a defect that has not been fixed and all Kerig will do is replace one faulty model with another. Save your money and look elseware for a reliable brewer.
