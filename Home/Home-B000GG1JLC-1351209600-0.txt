review/summary: Cheap & Does the Job!review/text: This thing is cheap, but it definitely does the job. It's just two pieces of plastic, but that's really all you need to hold some ties in your closet! My only caution would be that the spindles are a little too close together. I only have around 14 ties (it's supposed to hold 20), and I had a hard time squeezing them all in. I'd recommend just buying a bunch of these, and only using every other spindle. Even then, this is BY FAR the best value you're going to find on a tie rack. Get it and try it out!
