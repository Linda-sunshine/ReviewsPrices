review/summary: Great Story. Much Too Short.review/text: Everyone knows the basic premise of this story so I won't go into it. It's a great story, a definite page-turner, but way too short. And that's mostly why it's a 4/5. It felt like a long short story rather than a novel. And what I mean by that is that it needed more meat. More detail. This book could have easily been 400-500 pages long without slowing it down too much. Where are the descriptions of the community in general? Flashbacks to when Father was a child? Stories about Father caring for Asher in the Nurturing Center? Stories of Jonas and Asher working together and Asher causing Jonas to not be able to concentrate? Flashbacks of the Giver back when he was the Receiver? It could have been much, much longer. And I really wish it had been. This book took me 3 evenings to read and I'm generally a slow reader.
