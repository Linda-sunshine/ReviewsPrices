review/summary: This press makes sludgey coffeereview/text: I got this press hoping to replace a broken glass french press. I have bought and broken so many glass French Presses that my husband named them Kenny (after the South Park character). I had minimal expections and this only met one of them -it hasn't broken yet. The filter seems to be pretty ineffective. It let's both the finest AND some of the larger bits of coffee grinds through. The coffee turns out almost black. When I add milk it is easy to see just how many broken beans end up in the cup. If you really love french press coffee I would pass on this one
