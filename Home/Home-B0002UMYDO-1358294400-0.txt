review/summary: West Bend 77203 Electric Can Opener, Metallic West Bendreview/text: Excellent can opener! It opens cans with ease! My manual can opener had become to painful to operate and a Black and Decker automatic was dropping and unable to correctly puncture & grip cans. The only negative with the West Bend 77203 Metallic is the word "Metallic" refers to the color of the plastic body color not the body itself.
