review/summary: UGH! Made in Chinareview/text: This is my own fault. I didn't want to pay the big bucks for a LeCreuset so I bought this even though I knew it was made in China. It has great heat distribution and is beautiful but I am worried about the safety of using China made cookware so I will now have to buy the LeCreuset as well as this one because I have doubts about the safety. If you feel comfortable using cookware made in China I would hightly recommend this!
