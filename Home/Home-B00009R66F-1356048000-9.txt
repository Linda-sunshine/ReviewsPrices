review/summary: Not Badreview/text: You may need an engineering degree to figure out how to use and store the upholstery cleaner. The diagrams are small and vague, and not intuitive. It has a smaller tank and swath. With that said, it did an excellent job for us. Soaked (not sprayed) the carpet with oxy type cleaner. Let it set for 30 - 45 mins. Use suction only to pick up the oxy cleaner. Then shampoo with the carpet cleaner liquid. It removed pet stains.
