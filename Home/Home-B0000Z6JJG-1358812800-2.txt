review/summary: BEST shredder slicer I have EVER owned 25+ years!review/text: I have had quite a few food processors - Kitchen Aid, Sunbeam Osterizer, Cusinart, Breville thru the years and I keep coming back to using this for slicing, and shredding as I cook alot even now with the kids grown gone-freeze meals ect.. Have had mine since my 35 years was in grade school. WONDERFUL product! Makes best shredded carrots for carrot cake/bread ect... Slices potatoes, onions, carrots, zucchini, sweet potatoes, ect.. for scalloped vegetables/potatoes, grates cheese wonderfully. Clean up is a snap with putting in dishwasher. Talk about value for the buck!
