review/summary: Love this pan and it's Made in Americareview/text: I have been using iron for years. This griddle is perfect for so many things, and it seems to heat more evenly than my old well-used skillet. The handle gets pretty hot, faster than my skillet, but just have to remember to use a pad. Best of all- it's Made in America!
