review/summary: compact, fast, but toxic smellreview/text: Compact design. I didn't have problems with the wheels rolling on me while using. I took the online advice and steamed from inside of garmet. It puts out really hot steam so be careful. It heats up fast too. I'm average height. I'm glad I don't have to hang my clothes over the door frames to steam.They should really make the water fill hole on top so you don't have to remove the resevoir just to fill.ONE BAD THING! When it heats up the rubber hose gives off a toxic smell! I hope this goes away in time. Maybe I should just run the steamer for a while to see if it goes away gradually.
