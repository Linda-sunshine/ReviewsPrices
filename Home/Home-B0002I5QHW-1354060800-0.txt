review/summary: 6 lbs of sausage the first time with no problemreview/text: Bought this to make deer sausage for the first time and it worked great. The suction mechanism is awesome on granite counter and no way was it going to release. The grinding mechanism was smooth and I ground 6 pounds in probably 15-20 minutes with little effort. The clean up is easy in the sink with hot soapy water. For the cost I don't see how you can go wrong. Why pay for an expensive kitchen aid attachment unless you are making 30 pounds. For the every now and then use I would recommend this grinder.
