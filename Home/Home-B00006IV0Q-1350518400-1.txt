review/summary: Great coffee the "old fashioned" way - but even better!review/text: After several years of bad coffee from a Mr. Coffee maker, we decided to go back to the "old fashioned way" of making coffee - with a percolator. I chose this percolator because it was reasonably priced and looked well made. I have not been disappointed. My order actually arrived 2 days early, and I am happy to say that I am totally satisfied with my purchase. It makes a 12 cup pot in less than 15 minutes, and it is hotter and much better than coffee from an ordinary coffee maker. We are taking a weekend trip soon, and plan to bring the percolator along with us, rather than having to deal with a hotel room coffee maker - there is that much difference in the taste! My only disappointment is that this one does not have the clear handle on the top. As a child, I used to love not only the sound of the brewing coffee, but watching it rise up into the glass handle! If you are a "coffee nut," as I am, I think you will be very satisfied with the Presto Coffee Maker!
