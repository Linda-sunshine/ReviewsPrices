review/summary: Love it!review/text: It's the BESTt buy! The price is GREAT, and it makes PERFECT waffle! It's easy to store as it can stand so it doesn't take much room in your pantry; and also.. easy to clean! Just make sure you read and follow the direction carefully before and after you use it. We start a new tradition of waffle breakfast every saturday since we bought this baby!
