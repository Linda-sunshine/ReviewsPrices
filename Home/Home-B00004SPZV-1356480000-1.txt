review/summary: Didn't last longreview/text: Due to some heart complications, we primarily use olive oil. Olive oil is expensive enough, and the spray is even higher, so the sprayer seemed like the way to go. This sprayer does not hold much pressure, and it would send out a stream rather than a spray. When the oil level gets low, it requires a lot of pumping, and it was easily overpressured by my wife and blew out the seals. Very cheaply made.
