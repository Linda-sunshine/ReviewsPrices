review/summary: Spills!review/text: I've been a Brita user for years and finally had to replace an older model. I bought this model and I regret it immensely! As other reviewers have mentioned, the top doesn't fit and I've had major spills in the short time I've owned it. Even after all the water has filtered I've had issues with it. I'm a patient person but I'm afraid I'll have to replace it with another model or gasp! A pur filter system! Hope Brita gets the hint and does away with this model.
