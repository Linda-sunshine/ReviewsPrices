review/summary: Can You LOVE an Kitchen Appliance? Yes.review/text: Why anyone would dirty a perfectly good stove with cooking splatter is beyond me. Which is why I own this product.Works like a charm. Minor assembly at first (10-Minutes); but cooking, frying, broiling has been a walk in the park. I use my stove as a last resort. This baby does everything! Clean up is no harder than cleaning a baking dish or frying pan, submersion is fine. No brillo, or steel wool or abrasives, please. Get it and unchain yourself from the stove top!
