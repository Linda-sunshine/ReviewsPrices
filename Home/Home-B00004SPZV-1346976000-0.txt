review/summary: Mine broke but I still use itreview/text: I love my Misto but the top came detached from the plastic tube that is used to help build up pressure. This makes pumping difficult but it still sprays. Amongst other things, I use it to lightly coat popcorn and season with a spice blend for a healthy snack.
