review/summary: Poor qualityreview/text: Had the B70 for 2/12 years. Come to think about it, the coffee it made was ok... not great. Always used water from the refrigerator which is filtered. It now says "Not Ready" and won't brew another cup.I called Keurig and described the problem. The gentleman told me that the unit was out of warranty, but that they would be happy to replace it with a new one. Of course, I was asked to pay for it. After reading the reviews and problems online, I'm not going to but another one of these units. I hope more people realize the poor quality of these units and avoid buying one.
