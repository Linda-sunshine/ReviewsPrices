review/summary: Convenient coffee in a snapreview/text: I've owned by Keurig B60 for over a year. Sometimes, it does stop brewing...but that's because there's coffee gunk stuck in the top nozzle or some water stuck somewhere in a line. To clean:1. Unpug machine2. Get a paperclip and straighten it out.3. Shove paperclip up the three "tracks" that water is supposed to go through (in and out, in and out)4. Then, remove water reservoir.5. Hold your Keurig over the kitchen sink.6. Turn it over and over and over again until all water comes out.(It's a pain, but I find I must do this about once every two or three months. This in addition to descaling it with vinegar.)As for weak coffee...I have bought various appliances where I can use my own coffee (which work fine for me & don't require tossing out so much waste). Also, I have one or two brands of K-cups that I particularly like (Caribou Coffee, for example). The "bold" varieties may work better for some people than the lighter ones. Depends on how strong you like your coffee.
