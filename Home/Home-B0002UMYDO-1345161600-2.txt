review/summary: Found WESTBEND after a LOT of Research for electric-can-openers.review/text: Spent around 4 hours reading reviews, opinions and over 1,000 testimonials. 75% of the reviews for the Westbend model772-05 was 5-stars.(1) The device does as advertized and opens with ease. This is especially important,for my wife is over 70 and has serious arthritus.(2) Once the opener starts, there is NO need to hold the down handle. There is a micro-switch that detects when the can is finished. (3) The construction was impressive. Rugged and professional Grade.(4) The detachable head does as advertized. It is easily removed for cleaning in the dishwasher, and replaces with little or no effort. The magnet is strong and well placed to hold ALL lids until YOU remove the lid.(5) WESTBEND is the ONLY company that has "replacement Parts". That tells me that the device will last long enough to replace the cutting unit and NOT have to throw away the whole unit.(6) The unit was delivered on time and in perfect condition.(7) I am EXTREMELY pleased with its quality engineering, design and construction. STRONGLY Recommend this unit. REMEMBER "Quality pays for itself". This electric can opener is QUALITY!
