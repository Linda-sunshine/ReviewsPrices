review/summary: Beautiful item, nothing sticks, best pizzareview/text: Pizza forums recommend at least a 1/2'' of rolled steel for NY style pizzas in ovens under 600C, for proper heat retention. My oven makes it fairly high--580C, but my experience with the pan is excellent. Over the course of the summer, I have perfected a NY style pizza pie, and the crust turns out to be magnificently formed, with a slight, ashy bottom that is not burnt but crispy enough for my tastes.I also use it to bake breads of several sorts, and so far nothing--not sauce dripping, cheese dripping, nothing--has stuck to the pan permanently. Cleaning it is a simple matter, and one simply needs to coat it with oil after letting it dry to keep it in decent shape. (I leave out a lot of the seasoning process, but I am satisfied with how it is right now.)14'' pizzas are just big enough for myself, but I do wish to make true 18'' NY pizzas one day. In the meantime, this is as good as it gets!
