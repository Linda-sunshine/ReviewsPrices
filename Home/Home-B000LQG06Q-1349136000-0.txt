review/summary: Very soft and great!review/text: I really needed something soft to lay on to place on my bed. My bed is very hard and firm and since I couldn't afford a pillow top matteress I was in a search for a pillow top. I went by the reviews on this one and thought the price was great and figured I had nothing to loose. I had it for a week now and I must say I sleep WAYYY BETTTER!!!I work a lot and was sleeping for me was bad before I would toss and turn all night every night and my bed really felt like I was sleeping on the floor.This mattress top makes it feel like your sleeping on a pillow top mattress it is really soft and comfortable. It's a cheaper way to have a pillow top mattress I believe in order to have entry and a good productive day you MUST have good rest and a good bed. No exceptions.I gave this a 4 and not a 5 because I wish the cushion was thicker. I'm thinking of buying another one just to put on top of the one I have to make it more soft and feel like I'm sleeping on a cloud.Packaging/shipping:The packing was great it was rolled up in huge Saran bubble wrap. It didn't have no funny scent. Shipping was good enough timeMaterial:Very soft. Color is light tan so can get dirty very easily. Stays in place under sheets. The size seems to be a bit smaller than my queen size bed but nothing food badShould you buy:Yes! If you don't have the money to invest into a pillow top mattress for this price it is a very good alternativeI only hope this cushion lasts for a very long time and doesn't flatten in time.
