review/summary: It really is a world of difference.review/text: Excellent value. Extremely warm and comfortable. My partner and I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning now because these sheets are so much warmer and more comfortable than our previous set. Seems to survive the washer cycle just fine so far. Make the upgrade: you won't ever go back to normal (cold) sheets.
