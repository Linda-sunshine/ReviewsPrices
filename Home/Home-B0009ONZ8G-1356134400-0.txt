review/summary: doesn't suck, really badreview/text: The hose on this Made in Mexico vacuum is sooo thin that, within days, it callapsed, reducing the suction of this machine. Poorly engineered detail? You bet. They worked hard at saving 25 cents worth of material, and made this machine inferior. Way to go, bean counters. The hose is too short too...not handy for using attachments. Engineered in USA?, Made in Mexico. Might want buy product in person to actually inspect quality.
