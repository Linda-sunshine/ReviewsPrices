review/summary: Takes a long time, but does a good jobreview/text: The bread that comes out is outstanding. The machine is much better designed and made than the BreadMan it replaced. For example, the pan twists to lock into the base of the unit, in the same direction the paddle turns, so it effectively keeps itself locked in tightly while it's running (the Breadman had metal spring-clips that held the pan down -- at least until the springiness wasn't strong enough to).The unit is exceptionally quiet too.The only thing that keeps it from 5 stars for me is that once you put the ingredients in and hit the start button, it just sits there. It is programmed to wait for 30 minutes before doing anything. I haven't found a way around that.The french bread is awesome, but it takes _6_ hours to crank out a loaf.The other breads take about 4 hours, which isn't too bad.If you're getting this to make dough then the initial 30 minute delay can be maddening. If you're planning on having it run overnight so you wake to fresh bread -- it's perfect. The machine is quiet enough it won't wake you up.The other issue is the recipes -- many of them call for very odd measurments -- 3 and 5/16s cups of flour for example. The machine includes a measuring cup with 16'th cup gradations, or you can do the math and realize that 1/16th of a cup is 1 Tablespoon, so the above 3 5/16ths cups would be 3 1/4 cups plus one Tablespoon. The directions say to do things by weight instead of volume -- but that can be confusing too.
