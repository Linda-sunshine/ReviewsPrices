review/summary: Good Bread Makerreview/text: Old bread maker worked itself off balance and fell off counter and that was that. This bread maker works fine, automatic yeast dispenser is handy. Lots of possible uses. Only thing I would note is it is a lot noisier (?) than the old one and that one was 15 years old. Other than that no compliants.
