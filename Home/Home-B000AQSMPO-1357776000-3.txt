review/summary: Problems with brewer but customer service is greatreview/text: I love my Keurig but I can't give it five stars because after about two months I started getting the "prime" error, which I gather is some problem with the pump. I use my Keurig every day, mostly just for myself, but I make two cups of coffee in the morning and two or three cups of tea during the day. I looked on Youtube and found suggestions for fixing the problem. Forget the "clean the needles" one unless you did something silly like taking the top off a k-cup before brewing. Removing the water reservoir and replacing it would reset it most of the time, sometimes I had to also unplug the unit for a few minutes and then it would be fine for a day or two. That went on for three weeks and then yesterday it went to the "prime" error after every use. Today it put out less water than it should about half the time. I called Keurig's customer service and the rep had me put the unit through three cycles. The water measured up okay (of course, with Customer Service on the line) but the prime error came up each time. I just had to read off the serial number of my unit and agree to send back the k-cup holder as proof of purchase but I don't have to ship the bad unit to them. They are sending me a new one at no charge. So, even though the brewer I got this time went bad I still think it makes great coffee and the customer service rep was very nice and they are sending me a new unit. I hope this time I'll be lucky and get one that lasts longer.
