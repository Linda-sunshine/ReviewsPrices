review/summary: Great filter and water is great, but filter change schedule is too frequent making it possibly quite expensivereview/text: I love this filter pitcher as it holds quite a bit and filters quickly. The tap water I use it to filter comes out without the rusty weird scent and the filtered water tastes great. I've had it for a month now and have no major complaints. The only downside is that the filter needs to be changed every 2 months, which is pretty frequent in my book and can add up to make this product quite a bit more expensive. I wish they'd come up with filters that last a bit longer.
