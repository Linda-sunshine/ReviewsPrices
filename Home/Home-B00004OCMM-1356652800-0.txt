review/summary: About Year Rustedreview/text: Oddly enough it rusts in only two places. One place you can scrub off the rust with a brush. However, it also rusts in place where the little sharp wheel is connected. There is a small hole (you can see it in the picture) and it's gotten so bad in there that it's about to rust through. I gave it two stars because it is extremely functional and easy to use. But I can't for the life of me understand why they would design this so that the reverse side of the cutting wheel is exposed inside a small hole?
