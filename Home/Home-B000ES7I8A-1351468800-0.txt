review/summary: Design flaw overwhelms everything good about this productreview/text: I bought this product 6 months ago. Initially, I liked it a lot. Heats water quickly, nice looking, and the cool touch definitely works. I didn't mind the quirky top release or the relatively small capacity. But after 6 months I absolutely hate this unit. You can not pour it without water running down the unit and all over the place. It doesn't matter if the top is closed or open, you can't pour without spilling hot water. I've tried pouring slowly, fast, with a full pot, half empty pot - it doesn't matter. Now it just plain annoys me everyday that I use it.If you don't mind mopping up after each pour, you will like its other features and price. It appears to be made of good quality parts. However, if you want function over looks - avoid this. I wish I did.
