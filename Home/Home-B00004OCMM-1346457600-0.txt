review/summary: Unequivocally the best can opener ever created.review/text: I figure it's time I sit down to write a review about this can opener. How good is it? This is the fifth one we've bought, but not for the reasons you may think. It's because the other four were gifts. It's flawless in its use and design. If you're one of the people who have had rotten luck with can openers their entire lives then this is a godsend. You will never need another can opener. The only downfall to this is that you may end up purchasing a lot of them as well for gifts. That isn't a bad thing. That's a good thing.
