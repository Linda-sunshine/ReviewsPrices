review/summary: staf warningreview/text: The set is quite beautiful. Bought for my daughter. Nicely sealed. She opened Christmas warning. It said before you open read the warning. Do not remove Joseph by the staf. She opened it and the staf was already broken. Too much of a hassel to send back. Not attached very well. We will repair ourselves.
