review/summary: It's okayreview/text: It looks pretty good and does the job just fine. However, it doesn't have a sturdy feel, and the exterior gets much hotter than other kettles I've had. Makes for a decent economy kettle as long as you remember to be careful. I wouldn't recommend it if there are kids around.
