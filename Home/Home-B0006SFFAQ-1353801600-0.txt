review/summary: good coffee, but LEAKS when fillingreview/text: We have owned this for over a year. If we use the pot to fill the coffee maker it makes a HUGE mess! We thought for this price it wouldn't leak. So long for that idea. But the coffee does taste great. Also we were suppose to get a mail in rebate. My husband mailed, check never came. The rebate was a huge reason we decided to spring for that pot.I consider a leaking pot a BIG problem and that is why I gave only one star.
