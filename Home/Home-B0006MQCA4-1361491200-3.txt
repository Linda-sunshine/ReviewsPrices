review/summary: Dispenses Waterreview/text: I mainly use this for coffee, and water tastes fine. The front and back handles are great, and makes for easy sliding in and out of my fridge. Not too big, and not too small, just right. My issue is with the stubborn non-filter filter. I have to slap the side of this thing to get the filter to do its job.
