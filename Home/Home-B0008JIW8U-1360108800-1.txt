review/summary: DIGITAL DISPLAY DOES NOT LIGHT UPreview/text: The first Mr. Coffee 4 cup I bought had a LED display that was easy to read. The new one has a LCD display that requires you to turn on every light in the kitchen to read it. This is a hassle after dark and you want to program it without waking the entire family.
