review/summary: Item arrived damagedreview/text: I received this mixer as a Christmas present. I have been wanting/researching the item for several years and my husband surprised me with one. I was so excited until we took it out of the box and found a big dent on the top of the mixer. Since the motor is directly below, we do not know if there is damage internally as well. I am bummed because I can not "exchange" the mixer. Rather, I have to return it then wait 4 weeks for a refund to then hope there are still some left and order another one. In the future, I won't order items of this nature if it's not directly through Amazon. I will update my review if I have to pay for shipping this damaged item.
