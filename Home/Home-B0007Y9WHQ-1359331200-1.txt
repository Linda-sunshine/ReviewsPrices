review/summary: Great vegetable slicerreview/text: The price is reasonable for this kitchen tool. I cut up beets for salads and the slices were very thin.The blades are extremely sharp so be careful! You would use this tool for any firm vegetable or fruit. It won't replace other shredders or processors in you kitchen but I did find it useful. If you want to increase the raw vegetables in you diet try using this product and thinly slice carrots, beets, apples and enjoy!
