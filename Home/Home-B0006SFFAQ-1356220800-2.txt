review/summary: Replacement for the big-box discounted unitreview/text: Have enjoyed drip coffee from the very first Mr Coffee drip maker. The convenience over perked coffee is just too great. Out lived several Mr Coffee's and tried several other brands including the $19.99 specials at you-know-who's store but they only really lasted about a year and then it became a game of start the coffee and 3am to enjoy it at 7am..... Bit the bullet and spent real money for the Cuisinart DCC-1200 and we are converts to spend more, get more (usually but not always). We have a private well with very good water but the filter is an added bonus which we use and change as recommended. Coffee is very good and clear without grounds floating around. Have no trouble filling with water and have trouble with dripping from the pot when pouring. Coffee remains nice and HOT which is how we like it (and we do not have it turned all the way up). Recommend this to all of us tired of spending a little and getting what we paid for....a little.
