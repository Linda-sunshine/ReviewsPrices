review/summary: Love this Grinderreview/text: I have been requesting coffee shops to grind my coffee for me for years. Recently I visited Coffee Merchants in Colorado Springs (they roast their own beans - good stuff). When I made my request, the lady behind the counter recommend I pick up my own (and recommended this brand). Apparently you loose 50% of the flavor after 7-9 days even if your storing in the freezer. I can't tell you how positive this grinder impacted our morning coffee experience. We still have a couple bags ground in the freezer so its become our weekend ritual to prepare a fresh pot of coffee with freshly ground beans. If you like your coffee, you will love this grinder. Its a real grinder (no spinning blades). One of the best purchases I've made in a while
