review/summary: NEVER AGAIN!!!review/text: That's right. Never again will I conveniently purchase any "non-stick" aluminum piece of garbage (especially like the ones from "CHINA"- MART). Did you know that the chemical that bonds the non-stick teflon coatings in the aluminum pans is TOXIC and CARCINOGENIC. Anyhow, back to the pan. It came in a timely manner and in excellent condition. I first washed it off with warm water and then dried it off. Second, I coated the entire inside surface with olive oil and heated it up until it began to smoke. Third, I removed it from the heat and let it cool down completely. Now came the real test.......cooking non-stick. I preheated the pan, added a tablespoon of olive oil and threw some corned beef hash, hash browns and then 3 scrambled eggs. Everything cooked to perfection and NOTHING STUCK TO THE PAN that couldn't be washed away with warm water only, after the pan cooled. I'm so pleased with this cast iron product, I also purchased a 12" pan, two 6" pans, a 7 quart Dutch oven and just for kicks, the square grilled cheese pan.
