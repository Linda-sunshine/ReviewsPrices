review/summary: perfect for hash browns, omeletsreview/text: pre-seaasoned, ready for first use after a quick rinse. Cast Iron is great because it retains heat and the solid, heavy structure won't warp. And when the seasoning starts to wear away, very easy to re-season to keep it easy to clean and non-stick.
