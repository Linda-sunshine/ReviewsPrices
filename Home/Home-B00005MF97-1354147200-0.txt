review/summary: Short lifereview/text: I used to like very much that small mixer. It worked perfectly for my needs - and I've always respected its size. I'd never use it with really hard food or place large amounts of anything in there. It lasted 13 months (in fact, 8 months, because I was abroad for 5 of the 13 months) perfectly and then it suddenly stopped working. Since It worked well, it got 2 stars instead of one.
