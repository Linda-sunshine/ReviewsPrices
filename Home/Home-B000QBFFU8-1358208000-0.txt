review/summary: Great!review/text: I have been using it almost every day. It's very easy to use and clean and does a great job with everything from leafy greens to ginger root. I've had fun experimenting with different fruit and veggie combos, but the family prefers basic fruit juices. It would be even better if it could somehow have a classic citrus juicing (reamer) attachment so you wouldn't have to peel the oranges...
