review/summary: I So Wanted to Like Thisreview/text: and am still trying to find something positive about this purchase.I just washed my kitchen floor, which is small so I do it on my hands n knees. I had vacuumed first, then used the washcloth and was astonished at how much hair and little dirt remnants were left behind for my cloth.I also find the extension wand useless, it's too short and the stupid tool is too small. I need an extension for the extension to be of any use.I bought it because I got tired of reading reviews, no matter what I looked at, there were always people that complained. In this case, the complainers are right. It's very noisy, and the cord never stays in the little holder, even flat, it still won't fit under our bed.For the price, don't expect much and I suppose you might be happy.Hopefully it is cleaning the carpet better than it is my floors. It appears to do a good job at that.It is lighweight, so I'll end this on a positive note.Keep shopping around, is my advice, we get what we pay for. If I had kept the box, I'd be returning this.
