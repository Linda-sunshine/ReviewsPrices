review/summary: A fine coffee makerreview/text: Good solid machine and the first of my electric coffee makers to last as long as it has (I did go for a few years with a Milleta, which I still have for any future power outages around here).The gold filter is nice, but being as I live on a septic system (no sink Dispose-all unit), I still use the paper filters for backup -- easier to clean out without having half the grounds go down the sink.I do love the 2 hour automatic shut-off feature -- never again will I have to turn around and drive home to check to make sure it is off!It's happily brewing as I type this.
