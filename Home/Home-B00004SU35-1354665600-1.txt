review/summary: Makes great popcornreview/text: The flavor is by far superior to microwave popcorn. And it's a fun activity for the kids. Just be careful when opening the lid. The steam gets extremely hot. Almost burned the skin off my fingers. I'm never buying bags again. Gave it four stars only because I can't really comment on the quality since I only used it once. Appears a little flimsy and doesn't seem like it's going to last too long.
