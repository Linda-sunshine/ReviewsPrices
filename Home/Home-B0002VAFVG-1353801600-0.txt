review/summary: Worth itreview/text: I decided that I was going to start juicing after watching a few documentaries on juicing and holistic medicine. I thought, what the heck, I would give it a try. Thought it would be just a fad in my life; this was the best thing I ever did. Not only did I lose that ten extra pounds I picked up in my 40's, I feel better. I am generally a healthy man, but frequently experience aches and pains,especially after a long day at work or a heavy workout at the gym. I would sometimes need to take ibuprofen to be able to fall asleep. Not any more since I started juicing.I like this machine. It is very easy to use. After you use it about 10 times you get into this routine of how to clean it and what to do to avoid the little messes it makes(like cranberries flying out of the top). It has little leaks here and there at the point where the top meets the discharge bucket, but this is easily avoided once you know its quirks and how to situate a plastic bag in the discharge bucket. Initially I was saving and freezing the pulp from the juice to use at a latter date. I still havent used some of the pulp, I am putting it in the compost pile for my garden in the spring.I juice for breakfast and dinner and take sensible food for lunch and snacks. I like the speed involved in the juiceing. I have often thought of getting a different kind of juicer that wasnt so high speed and maybe had &#34;drier pulp&#34; in the discharge, but if I did, I would be afraid that the extra time it takes to juice would cut into my sitting down and enjoying my juice and quiet time in the morning and in the evening.I would recommend the juicer. I would recommend buying one cheap book on juicing to give you an idea of what fruits and veggies you can juice and why. I used that once and now I just buy whatever looks good and is organic and juice it! Most have been good, some a little odd, all were consumed!!!!!
