review/summary: very disappointedreview/text: We were very, very disappointed with the 1-quart measuring cup. It is almost worthless for using with liquids. There is a major problem in the design of the spout. When you try to pour out it, a large quantity of the liquid ends up on the counter. It appears that the spout itself is too small or shallow. This design flaw makes the cup virtually worthless -- it was a complete waste of our money. We've also noticed that the glass is somewhat wavy and that it gets much hotter than other Pyrex measuring cups when heated in the microwave. I'm not sure why that is. We have an older Pyrex measuring cup of the same size which is wonderful. There is no comparison between the two. I would strongly recommend against buying this particular measuring cup. I'm not sure what else is available, but I'm sorry to say that this model has major quality and design problems.
