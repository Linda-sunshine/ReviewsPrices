review/summary: A Must Have!review/text: I LOVE this water stopper! It is durable and it is great at filling up your tub and not falling off! This is one of my favorite purchases ever, I love this little device! It also has an opening at the very top so that if the water is going to spill over the tub it will fill up and get too heavy to stay on the tub. While I've never tried this out, I think it is a handy little addition in case you somehow forget to turn off your water. I've used this water stopper countless time and i've had it for a year and a half and it is still working just like new!
