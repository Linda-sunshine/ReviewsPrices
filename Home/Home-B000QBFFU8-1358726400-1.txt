review/summary: You Get What You Pay For (Thankfully)review/text: After seeing the Joe Cross documentary, &#34;Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead&#34;, my wife and I decided to give green juicing a try. I selected the Breville BJE510XL 900-watt multi-speed juicer based on reviews by other Amazon customers concerning this brand. It was hardly the cheapest model, but appeared to offer features I thought would prove helpful over the long haul.Upon unpacking the juicer, I was immediately struck by the quality, fit and finish of the components. Extremely sturdy and fitting perfectly - and easily - together, the juicer is extremely easy to assemble and disassemble for cleaning after use. Following my first trial round of juicing, I found cleaning to be a breeze. Because you're only dealing with the residue of fresh fruits and vegetables, cleaning most of the juicer's parts involves no more than rinsing them off under running warm water. You'll spend a bit more time cleaning out the filter screen with the small scrubbing brush (included), but even that wasn't nearly as bad as I had expected.As a new user, I was struck by two things: first, the fresh juice is really good (I'd never tried green juices before); and the pulp ejected into the pulp container was extremely dry. The machine had extracted a much higher percentage of the juice content from the fruits and vegetables than I'd imagined possible.All in all, while I'm brand-new to this game, my initial impression of this juicer is highly favorable and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone serious about making this type of nutritional change in their life.
