review/summary: Container Started Leaking But It's Being Replacedreview/text: I hesitated to buy this blender because of the reviews saying the container leaked after a while. I contacted Kitcheaide on it and they assured me thay had a quality product so I went ahead and bought one in March 2011. Yet last spring shortly after the warranty ran out it started leaking and with the one piece design you simply cannot replace the gasket. So then I bought a house and the move has kept me distracted until now, the leak continued to get worse and finally today I sat down and called Kitchenaide. The girl was really nice and set up for a new container to be shipped out to me at no charge.So other than that I really like the blender. It has a strong motor that does a good job. I fix MRP smoothies nearly every day in it, sometimes more than one and it does a great job doing it with very little strain on the motor. Let's just hope the new container lasts just a little bit longer before it leaks. Id like to see th emotor crap out before the container. By the way, I like the one piece design though, if they can get rid of the leak its a great product.
