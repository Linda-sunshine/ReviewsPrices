review/summary: So convenient and works so well.review/text: I received mine as a gift, and wondered initially if I would really use it all that much. Well, lo and behold, it is such a handy and excellent product, it sits permanently on some very expensive real estate counter space. Counter space in my kitchen is at a premium, but Capresso's glass water kettle deserves its spot. I use it frequently to boil water for every thing one boils water for: coffee, tea, boullion, soup, sterilizing. The appliance is very attractive, boils water faster than anything this 68 year old man has ever used, is amazingly quiet and, happily, let's you know through a fairly loud click that the job is done. It is pricey, yes, but I would replace mine if it ever broke. Incidentally, my Capresso has never emitted an odor of any kind.
