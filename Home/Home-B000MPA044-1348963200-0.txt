review/summary: poor qualityreview/text: Easy to use but very poor quality. My last one lasted a bit more than one year and then the pressure wouldn't go up. I bought another one in Jan this year (2012) and the digital numbers started burning out and today i couldn't set pressure nor timer.A good pressure cooker, only if it works!
