review/summary: Attractive and Functionalreview/text: Even better than I had expected. Looks nice and easy to use. Hadn't weighed myself in a really long time and surprise, I weighed less than I had thought. Guess it's those green smoothies I've been drinking. I know the scale is accurate because I had a friend weigh herself and she knows her weight.
