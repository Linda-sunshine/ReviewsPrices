review/summary: Helped my hip issues!review/text: Started having severe hip pain while sleeping when I became pregnant so I tried this mattress topper. This, along with a body pillow fixed my hip issues and now I can get a good nights sleep. The foam does smell a little strong but with the cover/sheet over it, it's not too bad.
