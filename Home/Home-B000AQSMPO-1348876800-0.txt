review/summary: BROKE AFTER A YEAR AND A HALF....DO NOT BUY!review/text: My wife and I got our brewer about a year and a half ago. A couple day ago it just stopped working. It wouldn't brew. You had to keep turning it off and on again for it to occasionally make a cup but it was such a hassle. We contacted the manufacturer and they said the warranty only lasted a year and would not replace it. Although they did offer us another one for about $70. I wasn't going to pay that if it was just going to break again. I would not recommend this brewer. Yes, it is good while it works but who wants a $200 piece of machine that will only last a year or two?
