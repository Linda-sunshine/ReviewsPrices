review/summary: Beautiful scale but it has problemsreview/text: Bought this after reading Consumer Reports. Great price on Amazon.com. It's a beautiful scale and it looks great in a small bathroom. Invites comments. Looks much expensive than it is.Now for the problems - the biggest complaint out there and I agree is that it tends to vary at times. However, having tried a lot of others, this one is more accurate than the typical consumer model.Battery has to be perfectly set for LCD to register. I noticed a lot of complaints about the LCD suddenly stopping. I had mine for a few days and it stopped reading after I stepped on it hurriedly and it lifted up a bit from the floor. I didn't think that this slight bang should have been enough to cause it to break.Logically I figured it was either a loose wire or the battery. So I took off the cover (you need a tiny screw driver). The battery had a bit of give. I put a folded small piece of paper over the battery to reduce the give. Now it works fine. Obviously, this is a defective design.So now I'm debating whether to return to Amazon (but I'd have to pay shipping of almost 1/2 the cost), write to websupport@taylorusa.com as they seem receptive to constructive criticism and perhaps will pay shipping or just keep it and hope the piece of paper does the trick.I'd recommend this otherwise, but it's just frustrating to have to agonize over a $22 item. that's why 4 stars instead of 5.
