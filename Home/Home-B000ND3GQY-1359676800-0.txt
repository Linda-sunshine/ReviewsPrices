review/summary: Well done Cuisinartreview/text: I love Cuisinart products and this Srir-fry pan is only one missing in my collection and now I got it and immediately put it to test and as usual my cooking came out just fine.Make sure you cook on medium heat as pan gets very hot very fast on high heat. You don't want your food to get burnt of even damaging your pan. Cleaning is easy just use Bar Keepers Friend and your pan is back to normal clean and shinny.I strongly recommend this Stir-Fry Pan to those who are looking to get one moreover the price is reduced to under $28 bucks and said to be the best seller........so give it a shot guys.....Thank you
