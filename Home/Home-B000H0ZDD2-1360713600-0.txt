review/summary: It works for mereview/text: It is quiet enough to run all night in the bedroom. (The ones who say it's too loud either got a broken machine, or they're the type that have to put a pillow over their spouse's face at night so their breathing doesn't keep them up.)I live in a very humid area. Usually 86% to 100% humidity. Before getting the Eva-dry, I would wake up and have to put on damp clothes, or go to bed at night in a damp nightgown. Ugh. Any canvas bags or cases would grow mold at the drop of a hat. Now, I turn my on Eva-dry when I get home from work and let it run for several hours before putting on my nice, dry, nightgown. I let it run all night while I sleep and have comfortably dry clothes to put on in the morning. My canvas bags and cases still have to be looked after as I don't run the Eva-dry during the day, but the progress of the mold has significantly slowed.I am glad I bought it and am very happy with my purchase.
