review/summary: Increase your kitchen spacereview/text: For the price I thought this was going to be cheaply made, but I was pleasantly surprised that it's actually pretty sturdy.It's has enough height that you can stack 2 wrap rolls if they are both relatively shorter.I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn't have enough kitchen space or anyone who would like to make their kitchen space more organized.
