review/summary: Awesome winter sheetsreview/text: Exactly what they were desrcibed as, they are slightly oversized I have a larger than normal queen matress it is thicker than most and has a pillow top most sheets I have issues keeping the fitted sheet on this one stays on great no problem the only thing washing them the first time you may want to check the lint screen a few times I had to clean mine out several times while drying. They are very warm much warmer than expected
