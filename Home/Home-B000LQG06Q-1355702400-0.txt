review/summary: Cloud Ninereview/text: Ordered this topper for an older mattress on which the pillow top had worked its way in to variety of peaks and valleys. Problem solved! Topper provides a lovely smooth layer with just the right amount of 'cush'. Very slight smell upon opening packaging, not entirely unpleasant, which dissipated quickly. We have purchased 2 more. Sure beats replacing the entire mattress set.
