review/summary: You get what you pay forreview/text: I was hopeful based on some of the reviews, but ultimately disappointed by this machine.I bought this one to replace a 12 year old Starbucks model that finally died. Maybe I am a little spoiled by the old machine, but the first thing I noticed was the long heat and prep time suggested in the manual -15 minutes. Once ready, the steam flow was weak at best and took quite a while to prepare enough milk for one cup. Worse, the espresso pump was barely strong enough to pump out one shot of coffee, minus the crema. In short, underpowered and small. I will continue searching, but I suspect that there may not be a cheap answer to a great at home expresso machine.
