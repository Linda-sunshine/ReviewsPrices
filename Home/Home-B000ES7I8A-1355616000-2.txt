review/summary: Good pot with minor flawsreview/text: Good pot, but not as fast coming to a boil as the last pot I had, which I ruined by absent-mindedly putting it on the gas stove. It does the job, but the cover is so designed that if you make a full pot of water, the cover goes into the water, which means you need to be sure to keep it clean.
