review/summary: Good way to start Juicingreview/text: I bought this juice to start juicing. It is a good entry level juicer. What I like abut this juicer is that you do not have to chop most of your fruits and vegetables. Just put them in the tube and push them through.I am giving this a three star rating because it does not get all the juice. If you want to get all the juice out you are going to have to spend a lot more on a fancier juicer. But don't let a three star ratting fool you, this is a great juicer if you want to give juicing a try or make occasional fresh juices such as carrot or apple juice.
