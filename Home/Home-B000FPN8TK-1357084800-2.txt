review/summary: Perfect Tea Infuserreview/text: I think they must have improved this since some of the lesser reviews, as my filter is firmly set in place. This is so easy to use. I simply put the loose leaf tea in the unit, add water, zap in the microwave, let brew for the time I want and then set on my tea cup and presto, I have perfectly brewed tea. I can't think of any way to improve this item. I like it so much, I'm back today to buy the larger size for me and more for gifts for friends. You won't go wrong with this purchase.
