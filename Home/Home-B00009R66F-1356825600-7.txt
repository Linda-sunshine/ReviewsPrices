review/summary: Incredible suction power, carpets look professionally done!review/text: I've had Hoover products in the past, and rely heavily on Consumer Reports who rates this and my anniversary wind tunnel upright vac as great buys. I bought this steam vac with hopes it would perform as well as my vacuum. It has totally blown me away with it's performance. It was pretty simple to assemble, couple of screws and bolts. Instructions were clear. Unit made my 12 yr old carpets look like they were just professionally done and they smell great. Stains are history and those rotating brushes REALLY get the dirt out. How nice that I can take this out whenever I need to and save a fortune on carpet cleaning. It is a bit heavy, but manageable, my 2 1/2 yr old grandson was very frustrated because he needed help to push it...he LOVES cleaning! I would highly recommend this unit over other higher priced ones. I fill it with really hot tap water and it takes about a tank per room that I clean. Water is still hot when I'm done. With 2 adults, 2 toddlers and 4 dogs this is a godsend. Thank you for a product that does what it says...and is affordable!
