review/summary: Great tasting water!review/text: Love the taste of the water! We had a Brita before this one. My husband would drink it, but it tasted bad to me. This filter gives a great tasting water that I am sure is just as safe as the bottled water in the store. A fact I am counting on, but not bothering to prove. The filter slows down in about two months and we just put in a new one. Couldn't be simpler. It is super fast at filtering the water too!
