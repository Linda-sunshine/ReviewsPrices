review/summary: I Love Itreview/text: I'm replacing my 4-quart Presto Pressure Cooker (aluminum) that I've had over 35 years with none other than the same, only new and stainless steel. It looks really great, it's easy to use, and cooks just as I expected. I wonder that I waited so long. I have no qualms about recommending this 5* cooker that will make your cooking more fun, better, and faster!
