review/summary: Best (first) juice ever!review/text: I use Amazon for a lot of purchases, but this juicer was bought from BestBuy with points and cash.However, this thing is amazing! I will take 4 leaves of Kale, 3 celery stalks, 2 granny smith apples, a pice of ginger and a cucumber and juice it all in about 2 minutes. While I drink it, I disable the parts, rinse them out, and put it all back together in about 4 minutes. Fastest. healthiest. Meal. Evar!!!!Get it! Get juicing! Live long and healthy! :)
