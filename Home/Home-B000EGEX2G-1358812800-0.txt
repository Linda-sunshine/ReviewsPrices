review/summary: The price is right, but there are flawsreview/text: This glider was a great price, but I wish I had splurged on a nicer glider. In fact, I wish I had test-driven a few gliders before making a decision. I've spent endless nights in this glider, only to discover that my sister-in-law has a much comfier glider. Yes, she paid more, but well worth it.This glider looked great initially, but now, after three months of use, it has shifting cushions and the fabric looks worn and dirty. It's also squeaky. Some babies enjoy this; my baby does not.Dang.
