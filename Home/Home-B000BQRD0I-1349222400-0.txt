review/summary: Great Value, Great Productreview/text: I originally bought this because I did not have an iron but needed to get wrinkles out of my work clothes and military uniforms. This has quickly become one of my favorite things to use in my house. Regardless of what I'm wearing, pretty much everything gets steamed the morning of weather it needs it or not. A lot of my shirt have annoying sleeves and wrinkle really bad. This steamer fixes that problem in a manner of seconds. Within a minute I have a clean, unwrinkled top and bottom for whatever occasion. I do recommend this product but be careful when its on, the first day my hand got a little to close to the head and I slightly burnt myself. This steamer heats up very quickly and is extremely affordable in comparison to the higher end and more expensive models.
