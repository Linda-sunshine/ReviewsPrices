review/summary: GREAT kitchen devicereview/text: I absolutely love this device. You just fill it up with your oil of preference (I use extra virgin oliveoil) and use it instead of no-stick spray, or to cover homemade fries, evenly spray a salad etc. None of those additives you get from the store bought cans and you also save the environment since you can simply refill it when it runs out.The can's pressure is created by pumping the lid up and down a few times (which i did not figure out immidiately) and then it is good to go.HIGHLY recommend this! You use less oil (=healthier and better for the purse) + you skip out on all the chemical stuff that are added to no-stick sprays.
