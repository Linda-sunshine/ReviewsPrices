review/summary: Great product and Excellent Customer Servicereview/text: I purchased a Keurig over a year ago and a month or so ago it stopped pumping water through. I only used filtered water so I didn't think there was a blockage. I searched the internet and followed all of the youtube suggestions. Nothing worked. I contacted Keurig and after a brief discussion they promised me a new one. It came quickly and works excellently.
