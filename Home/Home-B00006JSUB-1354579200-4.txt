review/summary: LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!review/text: Cannot profess enough, how much I love this skillet. When I first started using cast iron, I didn't know how to properly use it. Now I pre-preheat the skillet. About 60-30 minutes before I'm ready to start cooking I put the skillet on medium heat and pretty much forget about it for 10-20 minutes, season with oil and turn of the stove. When I'm ready to fire it up, I heat it up for 3-5 minutes on medium-high and I'm good to go. After a few re-seasonings, this skillet is a dream, cannot express how much I love this thing!
