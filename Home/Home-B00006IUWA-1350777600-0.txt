review/summary: NO ON-OFF SWITCH, BROKE 1st USEreview/text: I'm sure that most of these poppers last years, but the one I bought stopped working the first time I used it. Any company can make the occasional lemon, but how cheap is Presto that they don't even slap an on-off switch on their product. On the plus side, Amazon was fantastic with the return/refund. I've never had to return anything with Amazon, but they're great...they provide a return label, schedule the pick up and pay the shipping. Anyone who complains about customer service with Amazon is either lying or impossible to please.
