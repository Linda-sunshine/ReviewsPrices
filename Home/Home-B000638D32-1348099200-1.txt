review/summary: cuts like buttareview/text: I love this knife. It's made cooking much easier for my wife and I. We don't use it for everything but hard to cut soft items like tomatoes, meat, etc... it slices through much better than the rest of our knives, and at a price point you can't beat, this was well worth it.
