review/summary: A skeptic's 5 star reviewreview/text: I've been hearing about the Aeropress for a couple years now, I've read the countless positive reviews, and I figured that you were all a bunch of Luddites when it comes to coffee. No way was this thing going to do what it promised. The two things I took exception to were people calling the resultant brew "espresso" (note: it ain't) and the instructions to brew at 180 or whatever. Coffee science defies these notions. You suckers bought into somebody's snake oil claims...or so I though. Well, I decided to pick one up based solely on the fact that I wanted to try a new Able Brewing product (the Disk Fine) cuz they are a cool, local company. Well, I have to admit, this thing does make a good cup. It doesn't make espresso, and it works best when you use properly heated water. What I'm really enjoying about it is that it allows me to experiment and continue on my everlasting quest of coffee geekery and tinkering. There are tons of ways you can brew with the Aeropress, and that's pretty much a coffee geek's dream. I can use the Disk or the included paper filter. I can brew traditionally or inverted. I can use a finer grind with a shorter steep or a courser grind with more contact time. I can press fast or slow. I can play with water:bean ratios. I can mix up all of these things and experiment and play and geek out. I like that. I also like how quickly I can brew and clean up. This isn't going to replace my Chemex or V60 or Eva Solo or siphon or Kone or anything, nor did I want it too as I enjoy the differences inherent in all brew methods. It also hasn't produced anything that'll keep me from going to the shop for an espresso. It will, however, allow me to enjoy the process of brewing and drinking coffee at what is probably the cheapest entry price for any manual coffee method. I couldn't really ask for much more. The Aeropress has exceeded my expectations on every level.
