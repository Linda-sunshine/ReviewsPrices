review/summary: Good HEPA Purifier for Lg Roomreview/text: I did a lot of research and decided on this unit because of the great reviews, price and probably more-so because the HEPA filter never needs replaced!! I ordered this for my mom and happily she loves it!! She said it's very quiet and has really helped reduce the dust in her living room!! I personally can say I've noticed a HUGE difference when I walk into her house!! Before I'd smell cigarette smoke that seemed to linger around even when she wasn't smoking, but now I honestly don't smell anything at all!! I was very impressed!! Obviously this isn't a whole-house unit, but she spends most of her time in the living room (a pretty decent sized room) and it seems to do the job! I myself have a couple big bulky name brand air cleaners and I bet this one defiantly compares!! Actually plan on getting myself a couple..
