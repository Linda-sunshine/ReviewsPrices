review/summary: Dangerousreview/text: Caution !!!!! This coffee maker nearly melted down on my counter. It was 45 min post brewing, still on and began smoking and smelling like burned plastic. After unplugging it continued to smoke for 5 min. Only one year old. I called company and looked on-line. It has happened to others. I reported it to safer consumer .gov.
