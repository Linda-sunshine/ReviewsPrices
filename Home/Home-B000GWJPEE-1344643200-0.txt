review/summary: Great for daughter's roomreview/text: This Hello Kitty Humidifier is absolutely awesome for my daughters room. It holds plenty of water and is really cute. The night light feature is also a hit. I wish it came with a filter, but I purchased one seperately to prolong the life of the humidifier. Now, I just need to find the Thomas one for her brother
