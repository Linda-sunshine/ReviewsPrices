review/summary: Not entirely happyreview/text: I have always used kitchenaid mixers, but I have to say this one is not what I hoped for. I made the decision to move up from my classic kitchenaid 250 watt motor to the Artisan 325 watt hoping for less drag on heavier doughs ex..cookies this one still drags and is actually a little bumpy. I guess I should have gone for the 525 watt motor. All in all the Artisan works great just not sure it was worth the extra money..I would recommend it with a caveat.
