review/summary: A+ Dutch ovenreview/text: Received this as a Christmas gift from my son. I have several Le Creuset pieces, which I love. This Burgandy Color Dutch Oven oven from LODGE is just as fabulous. The color is beautiful - made a slow cooking, wine-braised brisket with vegetables & when it was done & opened the cover - looked like something out of a gourmet magazine. I know I will use this again and again. So easy to clean ... love this gift!
