review/summary: perfect can openerreview/text: Seems insane to be writing a review on a can opener, but after wasting $30 buying garbage ones from the grocery store I feel it's my duty to share the word about the perfection that is OXO. Thi can opener couldn't be better. When my old one broke after 10 years, I kept picking up new ones and none worked. Just buy this thing and wait the two days for it to be shipped. You can't ask for anything better. Sublime product!
