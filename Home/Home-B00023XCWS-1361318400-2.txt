review/summary: Heats super fastreview/text: This is a great kettle,now I wish I had gotten the larger size,but the pice I paid was way beyond worth it. It heats super fast,faster than any other electric kettle I have owned. There is an on/off switch on the handle,unlike others in this price range you have to plug and unplug. It automatically shuts off when you reach boiling unlike others in this price range that boil out. The spout is no spill,it pours straight in the cup without spillage and sloshing out like others. I can fill three 12 to almost 16oz cups out of one put. The only negative is the heating element is on the inside at the bottom of the pot,it is probably why it heats up so fast,but it is difficult to clean the minerals that can accumulate at the bottom underneath the element. Otherwise it was a fantastic value,well worth the price I paid,and I plan to buy another for my elderly father who is beginning to leave the flame on under his stove top kettle. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I am a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to electronics.
