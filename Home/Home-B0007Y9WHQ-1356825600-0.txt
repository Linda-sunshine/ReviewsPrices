review/summary: Not bad!review/text: I just made curly sweet potato fries with this slicer and it worked pretty good! You do have to press quite a bit to get thicker fries, and the handle it a tad too long (my hand kept bumping the bottom of the slicer while rotating), but all in all not a bad slicer for the money.
