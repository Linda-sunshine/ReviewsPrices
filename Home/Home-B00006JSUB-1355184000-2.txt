review/summary: good quality and price is comparable with other web seller, shipped super fast got them within 4 days after orderingreview/text: just used it few times , surprise that it get really hot fast, pan fried some thin slice beef and came out with some oily taste but cook really fast. the oily taste could be from the oil when they season the skillet. i'm pretty sure it will go away after using it few more times. One thing i need to do is to file a sharp spot in the middle of the skillet ,it was sticking out and very sharp, i was surprised that Lodge QC person did not detect this, it snag and cut my finger when i was wiping it with a paper towel after cooking. I just hope it does not affect the surface after filing that one spot. overall it works very well.
