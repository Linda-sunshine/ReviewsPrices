review/summary: great bread; godawful noisereview/text: This breadmaker makes great bread without adjusting the recipe. (I live ataltitude.) The bread rises higher than any of my previous breadmakers. It locks and unlocks easily without the fear of burning oneself. The bread comes out of the pan easily and with little effect from the paddle. It is impossible to use this machine on the delayed cycle at night because I can hear the pounding of the dough as it is flipped around by the paddle. This is very disappointing because I bought this machine because it was reviewed as being very quiet. I've contacted Panasonic; I got suggestions that were silly. They did give me the address of a repair place that is about an hour away. I shouldn't have to get a month-old machine repaired--if indeed it needs repair. Maybe it's just a noisy machine.
