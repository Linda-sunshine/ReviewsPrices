review/summary: Home baked breadreview/text: Home baked bread! What more needs to be said. There is nothing that smells quite like the aroma of bread baking in the kitchen. I have used my new Panasonic bread maker to make sandwith, regular, and whole wheat breads and they all were done to perfection. This product works like a dream and I have had no problems. It takes a long time to make a loaf but a little planning circumvents any inconvience. I beleave the time is one of the big secrets to this systems success. I love fresh bread from this machine:)
