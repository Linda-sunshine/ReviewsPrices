review/summary: BROKE AFTER 5-10 LIGHT USES. KITCHENAID'S RESPONSE: HELPING YOU WOULD CREATE A "PROBLEMATIC PRECEDENT" FOR USreview/text: I purchased this item and used it lightly 5-10 times. After the 10th time, it broke. Since I clearly got a dud (when looking at all the other great reviews), I called Kitchenaid for a remedy. Since it broke after the warranty expired (1 year warranty), Kitchenaid refused to offer any remedy (even to service it for me). Chances are you will not get a dud, but if you do, you should know that Kitchenaid won't help you at all. I purchased a Kitchenaid over other products because of it's great reputation. I probably won't be doing so again.UPDATE: 12/07/2012: I just received an e-mail from Kitchenaid that the reason they don't want to help me is because to do so would create a "problematic precedent" for them. So, in other words, if you ever have a problem with yours, they will never have to help you, and they can stand by that because they've never helped anyone before. Hmmm.
