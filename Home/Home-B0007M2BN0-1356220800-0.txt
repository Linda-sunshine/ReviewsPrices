review/summary: Hard boiled eggs with some tweekingreview/text: I only make hard boiled eggs with this product. I found that lowering the microwave power level a bit and extending the cooking time prevents cracking and seems to make peeling easier. You should also be careful when you remove it from the microwave, as it is extremely hot. Best to leave it for 20 or more minutes to cool it down and thoroughly cook your eggs, as the top is awkward to remove.
