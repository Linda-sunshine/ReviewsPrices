review/summary: What's with all the negative reviews??? I love BOTH my units!review/text: I bought 2 of these units for my house (One in the master bedroom and the other in the living room). These units are not the best construction but a little tweaking will fix all issues. Some of the issues I have noticed.1. The water reservoirs need to be adjusted a bit to reduce vibration sound. Its not really an issue but I have noticed some people complaining about this. They adjust quite easily.2. I'm not sure about the "air washing" quality. It might take a couple dust particles out but its not noticeable. I think its mainly due to where my units are located or because of its design. Pulls in air from the front bottom and puts it out front top. The air in its immediate surrounding keeps circulating, which is fine as a humidifier but not to clean the air. It might make an impact if it was put on a stand... I haven't tested it yet..As a humidifier it works perfectly. Set it on 50% and let it run. Water reservoirs are big enough to last a whole day or more. I usually fill them once every other day. If you're someone that wants to set your humidity level at exactly 65.353%, this is definitely not the unit for you. But if you want just a humidifier that will make the winter months bearable this is the perfect unit for the price.______________________________Some things I would like to clarify about complains from other reviewers. I almost did not buy this unit. So glad I did. Warning! Sarcasm ahead!You're trying to compare a Kia with a Mercedes. Please be willing to spend the extra money for a better unit. There are other units out there that cost $500-$5000 for the same thing. I don't see you complaining about your used 1992 corolla. You get what you paid for. They have humidifiers that feed straight into your vents in your attic if you're willing to put up with the installation fees and the cost of the unit. Try investing in those for a no hassle experience! If you don't have that sort of money. Join the club and stop complaining!_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _1. OMG I have a humidity monitor set right next to this unit and it shows the humidity level is off by 0.0001312351%- There are much more expensive humidifiers that will take care of that issue for you. Please be willing to spend that kinda money. I can guarantee you that ANY humidifier you buy at Walmart or home depot does not take into account the air flow in your room. In a ventilated room (AC vents blowing and/or bedroom door open) this unit performs as expected. Another way to fix this issue would be to buy 1 of these units for every area in the house and have them all set to the exact humidity setting and turning them all simultaneously and filling them regularly without any interruption. That will take care of that issue for you. Also, make sure to turn off all your HVAC units so that there is no air flow to effect your results. Just because you're a tool... wait.. I mean just because you think you know how to use a tool (humidity sensor) does not mean you are using it correctly.Maybe if you spent more on a humidifier you would not have this issue._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _2. OMG! unit is made of cheap quality blah blah blah.- I've had these units for a couple of months now. I have noticed the vibration on occasion. It generally happens when I dump the water reservoirs in a hurry. Nothing a little adjustment wont fix. I admit the units could use better housing material. They could have been made out of stainless steel or silver so that they would be rust proof, a perfect fit, antimicrobial and shiny! Yes they could have a digital humidity control and make your coffee for you as well. But then some would complain that its too heavy.Maybe if you spent more on a humidifier you would not have this issue._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _3. OMG! this unit is sooo loud!- Really? Anything that moves air is bound to generate some white noise. If you have it on the highest settings it will create a lot more of it. Its not any louder than a tower fan at the same air flow. One way to fix this issue is to turn it off.Maybe if you spent more on a humidifier with an air washer you would not have this issue. Wait... You would still have this issue!_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _4. OMG Water spills!- None for me. Only spills I've had is when I've tried to move the unit when it has water in it. I don't even have anything witty to say here. I've been filling up the tanks in both my units for months now on almost a daily basis. I've never had a spill.Maybe if you spent more on a humidifier you would not have this issue. And if you had some motor skills..._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _5. OMG I have to fill it up with water!- Really? You're complaining about how effective it is? One way to fix this issue would be to buy a dehumidifier feed the excess water straight into this unit. That way you wont have to fill this with water. Problem solved!Maybe if you spent more on a humidifier you would not have this issue._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _6. OMG the tank is so heavy!- Buy one with a smaller tank. You'd have to fill it up 10 times a day. Or you could have your dehumidifier feed the water straight into this unit. Both of which fix this issue.Maybe if you spent more on a humidifier you would not have this issue._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _Hope this helps.. :)
