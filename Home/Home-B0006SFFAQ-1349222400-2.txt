review/summary: What was the designer thinking?review/text: 10/03/2012We have been fortunate to have owned several Cuisinart products in the past, coffee makers included.The recently-acquired DCC-1200 programmable coffee maker is attractive and works well, but it does have a significant design flaw which makes one feel that it owns us: the water level indicator is not external, but rather is an internal stair-stepped or offset even-numbered system which requires that one look into the abyss early in the morning to see how much water has been added, and the abyss is dark. With a flashlight, I ascertain the water level, but must also wear my glasses.Easy solution? Use a measuring cup or other container holding a known amount (bottle, large jar, et cetera) of water to add water.That container in the dishwasher? Get out your flashlight and glasses.Doing this is off putting, but is perhaps just under the nuisance level of having to return the product.For 35 bucks one might put up with the flaw... we paid $99 for the DCC-1200.
