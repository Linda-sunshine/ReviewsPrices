review/summary: Absolutely no different than a french press, possibly even worse.review/text: This device is seriously overhyped. The coffee it make is absolutely no different than a french press, except with a french press the coffee has longer to steep. The aeropress doesn't even need to be plunged, it's basically a drip system if you leave it long enough. The final press does get you a little strong squirt at the end but made nearly no difference in the taste or bitterness. Additionally, it holds hardly any water, a french press holds plenty of water, makes several cups. I made several cups using aeropress, french press and coffee maker. I dislike coffee makers in general or any drip coffee, and the aeropress tasted just like the coffee maker.I would return this item if I hadn't already used it, you don't return something like that. I'll not be using it though, and is a regrettable purchase.
