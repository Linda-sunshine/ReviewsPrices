review/summary: Bad odor when unit is runningreview/text: Having read several glowing reviews on this heater I had no hesitation inordering it to add some warmth to my small office.The unit was shipped promptly. There was no packing slip inside as it wasshipped without the usual &#34;Amazon&#34; box.Last night I read the instructions and plugged the heater in to enjoy theextra warmth. The warmth was there, but so was a strange &#34;chemical like&#34;odor. Left the unit running for about 15 minutes. I have asthma, and when I started coughingI turned it off. I have tried 2 more times today to use the heater, but the results each time were the same.
