review/summary: Powerful and efficient juicerreview/text: I've been juicing for many years now with an old, small Hamilton Beach juicer. How did I ever do it?? My old juicer could only accomodate one skinny carrot at a time. The Breville can juice 3 regular size carrots all at the same time. The pulp is much drier than my previous juicer, also. My only complaint isn't really a complaint. I wish I had chosen a juicer that "spits out" the pulp into a separate container. I dislike having to empty the pulp container after 1/2 bag (5-lb bag) or so of carrots. However, I knew this juicer didn't offer that feature when I bought it, so I won't actually mark it down for that. It's easy to clean and the pitcher that comes with it is great with the lid that fits under the juicer to eliminate splatter. Overall, an excellent juicer and reasonably priced.
