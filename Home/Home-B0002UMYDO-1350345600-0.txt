review/summary: West Bend Can Openerreview/text: I bought this can opener because I had trouble finding a decent hand one. This was the number one rated electric can opener and I see why. It is easy to use, clean, and takes up little counter space. I love how powerful it is. It is not loud, but still has had no problems opening any cans we have sent its way. I even bought one for my mother for her birthday.
