review/summary: Our second Brew Central coffeemakerreview/text: The DCC-1200 Brew Central we purchased 5 years ago finally quit, outliving its 3 year warranty. First it was the heating plate that failed, followed a few days later by the on/off switch. After looking around a bit, I knew we needed to simply replace this appliance which makes very good, very hot coffee, and kept it hot on the warming plate. You won't go wrong with this workhorse, day in and day out.
