review/summary: Proctor-Silex has ruled since my mom ruled the kitchenreview/text: Bought this as a replacement for a model my wife picked up at a local retailer. That one did not produce the results one would expect, so I thought we would go with a brand-name that has been around since I was a kid.GOOD choice. . had company over the week it arrived and it is simple to use and the waffles were GREAT !! EASY to clean, also
