review/summary: Great purchasereview/text: This product seems to be doing its job. The nice thing about it, at least during the summer, is that it seems to cool off the room too. It's a bit noisy, but I just leave it running during the day. It's a bit too loud to be comfortable white noise to sleep through st night.
