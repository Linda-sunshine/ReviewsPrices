review/summary: Super Gadgetreview/text: In 1998, a friend bought a B&D single cup coffee maker for me and I laughed thinking I'd rarely, if ever, use the thing. Not only do I use this machine every single day, I keep a brand new unopened one in a box in my closet in case anything happens to the one currently in use. I love this gadget! Coffee. Hot tea. Cocoa. Personally, I don't use the travel cup, I just slip my standard mug on it. I love that it has its own filter. No need for those paper filters. Makes a very good cup of coffee quickly. Frankly, it is one of my favorite things.
