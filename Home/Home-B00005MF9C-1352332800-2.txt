review/summary: Great Valuereview/text: I have been using this coffeemaker for a bit over 6 months. I am completely satisfied with it. As others have stated, it looks and feels flimsy, but it works perfectly and makes great coffee. I use the cup about 3/4 full of water along with a level tablespoon of Community medium blend coffee. It brews very quick, and the permanent filter is easy to rinse out. I finally disposed of my Home Cafe pot, this one works great, is much less expensive to use, and I recommend it without reservation.
