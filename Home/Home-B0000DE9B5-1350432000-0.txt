review/summary: The Real Dealreview/text: Love this pitcher. The glass is thick enough to be very sturdy but not so thick as to make it too heavy when filled. Pleasantly, it looks deceptively compact for the amount that it holds.The handle is close to the body of the jug, and this could conceivably be a problem for someone with very large hands; however, my hands are small, and the pitcher is very comfortable to hold and pour. In any case, the handle was not designed to be the type you put your entire fist around -- rather, your fingers slide between the handle and the pitcher, and your thumb rests comfortably on the other side of the handle perpendicular to your fingers. You would naturally want to support the body of the pitcher with the opposite hand during the pouring motion. Using this technique, I have had no issue with spillage or dribbling as mentioned by other reviewers.The lid is easy to operate. Simply hold the outer rim in place on the jug and turn the inner dial clockwise to seal. No need to turn it very far. You will feel the suction pulling the lid tight. To loosen, simply reverse the process: turn the inner dial counter-clockwise to break the suction.I am extremely happy with the quality of this pitcher.
