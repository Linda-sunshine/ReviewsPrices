review/summary: Still works and looks like newreview/text: I have had this Electric kettle for years. It still works perfect, still looks like the day I bought it from Amazon.What is really great about this is. You never have to worry if you should forget to turn it off. It will not burn out, Once it boils, it shuts off automatically.This shows Cups and Oz.It is very simple to use. Full to the amount of water you want, close lid, which closes and opens easily, flip the top button forward. That is it.There is no whistle. It boils very quick.Some people complained about the plastic smell. I NEVER had that problem. Mine never smelled.I'm now wondering if this is BPO free!!!The only complaint I have is, It is not great looking on the counter. I do not leave mine out on the counter. If it was stainless , maybe I would leave it out more in the winter time for making tea.Being that it is not so great looking would not be a reason not to buy it.Works fantastic, and the price is too low to pass up.
