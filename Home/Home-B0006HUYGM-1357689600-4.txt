review/summary: Great productreview/text: I was looking for a small furniture vacuum that REALLY picked up animal hair and I found it! I'd tried everything from sticky tape to pet hair rollers and even running my canister vacuum head over the cushions... nothing worked as well as this hand held. Anyone with pets knows how hard it is to get fine animal hair out of a corduroy sofa, and mine acts like a hair magnet. I had considered getting rid of the sofa before I bought this vacuum, now I don't need to. The brush has a flip up guard on it so that you can brush up or down on back cushions instead of getting all twisted out of shape trying to position it like you do other small vacuums. The suction is great, no wimpy little hand held here.Worth the price.
