review/summary: The best hand-held vac I ever had.review/text: I bought this and the Eureka 3670G Mighty Mite Canister Vacuum, together. I live in a 600 sq foot studio apartment, and I needed vacuums which works for my area rugs and hardwood floors. The Mighty Mite vac ended up being a huge disappointmet, while the hand-held vac turned out FABULOUS. I couldn't believe how well this little thing cleaned my floors and rugs. I was amazed that at how much of a better job it did than the Mighty Mite. I bought this hand-held vac primarily because I wanted a corded hand-held since they have more power than the rechargable cordless ones, and I was spot on with this. I vac my living room, kitchen, bedroom and bathroom areas with this little thing in no time.For those who live in small spaces (with mostly hardwood floors), and who want to try and avoid cluttering up precious storage room with big vacuums, I strongly recommend this hand-held vac. It WILL work wonders as a primary vac. I did not intend to use this as a primary vac when I was purchasing it, and now I am.
