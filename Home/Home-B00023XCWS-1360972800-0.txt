review/summary: Does the jobreview/text: I bought this for ~$11 so I could make hot tea. It does the job, seems easy to clean and is relatively quick (boils a piping hot 4 cups in under 5 minutes). This is your basic, standard electric kettle. Things I don't like:- it has a filter (pro) but it keeps falling out when I dump out any remaining hot water (dumping out leftover water is part of the cleaning instructions)- I can use it for water only (no hot chocolates)- although the water gets hot very quickly, it doesn't stay hot for more than a half hour (I like to take my time drinking tea)Overall this is a standard, basic, well functioning electric kettle that does what it claims to do. In the future, I may consider purchasing this again but will also compare it to another kettle that can also boil milk.
