review/summary: Sold me a used one when I paid for a new onereview/text: Just wanted to vent my frustration with online ordering through amazon especially on this particular steam vac. I purchase a new one and what was delivered was a used/refurbished product. The box was open previously and vac didn't look anything like new. This just gives me pause and makes me want to go buy at a brick and mortar store like sears, best buy or lowes.
