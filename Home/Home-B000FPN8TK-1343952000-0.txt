review/summary: Don't hesitate...this is the onereview/text: I recently switched to loose tea because of the cost savings. I was looking for something I could use at work and read multiple reviews. I was concerned that this might be a bit "Mickey Mouse" as my husband calls it, so I also purchased a more traditional stainless steel ultra fine tea infuser. The Ingenuitea BLOWS IT OUT OF THE WATER!!! I love that it is microwave safe, BPA free, and it filters the tea so well- better than the "ultra fine" infuser. No tea dust at the bottom of your cup. It doesn't make a mess all over your desk and its just fun. If you drink loose tea, you really need to get this thing.
