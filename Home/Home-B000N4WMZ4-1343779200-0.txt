review/summary: Fantastic enameled cast iron dutch ovenreview/text: I've always wanted enameled cast iron dutch ovens, and year after year I kept waiting for Staub or LeCreuset to go on sale. Of course it never happened. So back in 2008, I ordered the Lodge dutch oven in caribbean blue. I've been cooking stews, pot roasts, Chinese stewed pork, on my gas stove or in the oven. I have to say that I really really really love this dutch oven. Even heating, great for browning before braising or roasting, this pan works like a dream. To clean up, I always let it cool down first, pouring some water in to let it soak for awhile, then everything wipes up with a damp sponge. I loved it so much that I got the 6 qt too. The pot is very heavy, and I recommend a sink mat if you have a porcelain sink.
