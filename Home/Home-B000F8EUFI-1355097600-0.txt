review/summary: light weight and convenient size with PoWeR !!!!!review/text: i got this vacuum for my gift shop. i needed something that i could carry without ramming into breakable inventory. this is not only light and small, it has a convenient, sturdy carrying handle !!!!!the vacuum itself fits into and under small spaces, and the handle drops to the ground so i can reach wayyyyyy back and under low shelves with the head of the vacuum !!!!!what made me love this vacuum first was the fact that the only thing i had to assemble was snapping the handle into the base, no tools, no confusing directions .and it picked up all the dirt, fuzz and lint in the store !!!!!!
