review/summary: My Bf can feel the air quality difference already, but has white noise effect.review/text: This purifier is pretty good at its job. I can see my bf who is allergic to dust/ dust mites in house has stopped sneezing significantly. Filter is damn easy to clean. Just hand vacuum it! However, it is NOT as QUIET as it claims. In a small room, after 30 min of run, I get annoyed of constant white noise in the background. You can tell difference if you have to turn on volume of your television a bit more if purifier is running in the background.
