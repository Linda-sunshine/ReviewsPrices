review/summary: Great Vacreview/text: This vac has more than enough power to handle any task. The first time I used it on carpeted stairs, it pulled out a significant amount of dirt, that my old vac (without a power brush and with significantly less vacuum) was leaving behind. I was amazed when I looked in the clear catcher how much dirt was in there after one run up the stairs. I saw lots of reviews regarding the weight of this machine, and I worried whether my wife would be able to handle it, but she doesn't find it overly heavy at all. She loves it. We should have gotten rid of the junk we had years ago.
