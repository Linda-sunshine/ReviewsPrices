review/summary: Sturdy... but Rustyreview/text: These knives were very affordable and I decided to purchase them as a starter knife set. They are sturdy and cut well... but they rust almost immediately. I hand wash them and then let them air dry. Within the 2nd wash (some of the even the first!) they has little spots of rust on them. I also wish there were more blades that weren't serrated, but I didn't realize that at the time of purchase. Overall, I think you get what you pay for, they're pretty cheap knives. They cut well, but they rust quickly. Is rust bad for humans?
