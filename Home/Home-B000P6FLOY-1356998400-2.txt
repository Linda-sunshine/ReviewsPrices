review/summary: Great little brew companion!review/text: I bought this to use in my home brewing hobby as I was stepping into all-grain brewing. This is a great little thermometer for the money! The preset temp alarm is great when bringing my water up to mashing temps and the timer is handy for setting the mash times. The only negative I see is the short probe since I use a fairly tall kettle for all my brews. That's understandable since this is probably not geared for home brewing. The short probe is the only reason why I don't rate it 5 stars. A solid 4 stars, unless a longer probe is offered as an option.
