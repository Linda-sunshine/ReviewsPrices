review/summary: Fast!review/text: Wow, this thing can grate 10 carrots in about 2 minutes! Powerful and fast. The blades are super sharp and work great. I chopped an onion in the time it took my husband to open a text message on his cell phone! It came with a CD which was much easier to learn from than reading the manual (which I did first). It also came with a hard spatula that scrapes the bowl perfectly to remove the last &#34;crumbs&#34; but doesn't scratch the bowl.
