review/summary: Excellent productreview/text: If you don't have access to your grandma's cast iron pans, then this is a great alternative. We bought it for our son, who uses it on his induction cooktop. It has a flat bottom (our vintage pan has a little rim around the bottom). It is preseasoned, and our son loves using it. The double handle is helpful and it has a little pour spot to help with draining off grease.
