review/summary: Handy food chopper!review/text: I like this food chopper - it's easy and simple to use. It's two speeds chop almost anything I need it to chop. I also like that the bottom plastic protector can be removed and used for a lid to store the chopped food in the container. It's easy to clean too. My mom visited and used this chopper and she loved it so much that she wanted one too. I've had mine for five years or so and I recently bought one for my mom. It's a great buy!
