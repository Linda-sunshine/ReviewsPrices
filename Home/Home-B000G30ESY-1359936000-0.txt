review/summary: Changed my (culinary) life!review/text: I LOVE this rice cooker. It is perfect for cooking for 1-2, and has a small footprint on my counter (as far as rice cookers go). I have successfully made white and brown rice, oatmeal, polenta, quinoa, steamed veggies, steamed fish, rice porridge and rice and beans. I've tried risotto a few time but it comes out a bit mushy. There are some helpful rice cooker cookbooks out there if you want to get adventurous.Cooking times are long, as the regular cycles include presoaking and it just takes a while to cook fluffy, delicious rice. I make liberal use of the timer feature, especially in the morning. Who doesn't love waking up to real steel cut oatmeal?You must remember to use the rice measuring cup that comes with the cooker or the ratio with water will be all wrong. One of those cups (the unit of measurement is known as a &#34;go&#34;) is roughly the equivalent of 3/4 cup using a standard measure. If you lose your cup it's easy to buy a replacement online, or just use 3/4 cup.Also, the lining of the bowl is not intended to come into contact with any metal utensils or scrub brushes. I use a wooden spoon or plastic rice scooper or ladle. The nonstick surface is super easy to clean. After a few years there may be some scratches because of the occasional &#34;just one scoop with a metal spoon.&#34; just buy a replacement bowl.Some other rice cookers have a tendency to collect icky grime in the water trap. I've not had that problem with this cooker, and the inner lid is easy to remove and clean.The keep warm feature will keep rice well for an evening, but by morning there will be some hardening of the grains at the edges.
