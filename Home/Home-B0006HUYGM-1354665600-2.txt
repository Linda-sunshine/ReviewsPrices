review/summary: Perfect for stairsreview/text: I bought this to exclusively do my carpeted stairs. My Dyson is old, and none of the carpet attachments work with our model. This vacuum made our staircase look brand new. The riser cleaning function is genius. For the price, I consider this a steal. I would have gladly paid more for a unit that works as well as this. Bravo to Eureka for getting it right.
