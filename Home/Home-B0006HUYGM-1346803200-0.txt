review/summary: Didn't last too longreview/text: This unit is one of very rare review that I have rated one star. When it worked it was with great suction power. However, the unit stopped functioning and smelled something like burned motor after I used it 4-5 times.I did not do anything unusual, I used it as light-duty hand vacuum to do quick clean up and yet, the unit failed. I will not buy the same model again.
