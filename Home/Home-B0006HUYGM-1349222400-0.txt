review/summary: Compared to B&D Flexreview/text: I have several Black and Decker Flex portables, used for quite a few years. I thought to try another brand/style because of the battery life of the B&D. The You Reek just blows the dirt around, i.e. very poor at quick pick up of dirt. Its suction area is very, very selective on its position for sucking in debris. I guess I am spoiled by another brand - if you have no other experience you would most likely like the You Reak.
