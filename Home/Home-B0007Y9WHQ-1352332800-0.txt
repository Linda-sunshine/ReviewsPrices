review/summary: Love it!review/text: I got this because I am allergic to wheat and I saw posts about it related to creating "spaghetti" for those on gluten free diets. I have to say, I am quite pleased. I have had it a couple of weeks now and I use it almost daily. It is easy to use and easy to clean, and I love the results.
