review/summary: NOT HOT ENOUGH!!!review/text: I was so exited to try this coffee maker. Looks great and all but it's not much different than most all other drip makers in that it doesn't make the coffee all that hot. Another thing is that it doesn't brew at the temp it's supposed too, it brews more like at 185 degrees. So if you're like me and love your coffee piping hot, I wouldn't suggest this coffee maker.
