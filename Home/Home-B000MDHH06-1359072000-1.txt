review/summary: Not for hard core juicing!review/text: To be fair, I should have done my research before buying this juicer. This juicer is good for casual juicing. But I initially bought this juicer for juice fasting and it was an error on my part. With that being said, lets start the review.I do not like the compact design. It really is a PAIN to clean. This juicer is good for juicing carrots, kale, apples, cucumbers and carrots. The pulp is fairly dry, but when juicing things like berries, pineapple, tomatoes, tangerines, the pulp is fairly wet. Not only that, the juicer spits up bits of the soft fruits and pieces of leaves like spinach and parsley. So when I clean up, I also have to wipe down the cabinet doors, the floor, the wall next to the juicer, as well as the counter top. Sometimes just thinking about the clean up makes me not want to juice at all. I have read that some people like to re-juice the pulp a second time to get all the juice out, but you can forget about trying to do that with this juicer. It'll just be a hot mess if you try (trust me, I tried). And this juicer is quite LOUD. As with all centrifugal juicers, juicing mainly fruits causes oxidation, which is not really ideal. Especially when I have to clean the juicer right away after juicing, letting the juice sit there for a good 7 minutes while I scrub the blade thingy with the bristle brush. The most you can juice with this juicer is about 27 ounces (about 800 ml)at a time. You can't really make more than that because the pulp container gets full and you have to dismantle the juicer to empty it out. I suppose you can put it back together, but it's just so messy. This juicer comes with a 1 year warranty.So, my recommendation: Not for hardcore juicing. Please do your research before buying any juicer. It's best to invest in a good juicer with a longer warranty.
