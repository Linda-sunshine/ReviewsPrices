review/summary: Could Have Been Better...review/text: This coffee grinder would have been better if the ground coffee catcher was NOT so static prone. The coffee grinds fly EVERYWHERE no matter how much you tap on the sides or slowly pull the container out. Tried three different brands of coffee beans, grinding multiple times on different days and the problem just kept getting worse. Called the manufacturer only to be told that they NEVER heard of a static problem with this unit and the best they could do was tell me to exchange the grinder. Coffee grinds were so static charged, they flew into my face, eyes and hair, as well as all over the counter and floor! The mess was terrible with much wasted coffee. Otherwise, this grinder was sleek/fairly compact, very quiet for a coffee grinder and ground very nicely/consistently. The top was a little hard to line up right, as you need to aline a very small dot with the base for use. The metal base was heavy and solid. The plastic bean bin was a little flimsy on the bottom part, but replaceable, if needed. I would have loved it, but for the static problem which was intolerable, so I returned it. Too bad...
