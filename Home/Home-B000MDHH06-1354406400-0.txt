review/summary: This Juicer is AWESOMEreview/text: This Juicer is incredible. I've had friends who complain about making juice, even though they love it- but every other review that says it's easy to use and easy to clean is completely correct. I'm fairly new to 'juicing'- but I use this juicer to make both veggie juices - like salad in a bottle- and yummy fruit juices. It's healthier than jamba and less expensive. I can't believe how NICE of a juicer it is, and what a great price! Side note- it's the same juicer used in "Fat sick and nearly dead" for all you juice cleanse fanatics out there :)
