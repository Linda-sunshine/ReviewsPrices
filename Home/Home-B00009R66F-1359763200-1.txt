review/summary: First time use....I love itreview/text: It's brand new and did a fabulous job today. The unit is not the most sturdy feeling, it seems like most everything is being made of &#34;plastic&#34;. I will keep this in mind when using it and try to avoid any rough handling.I was just a little concerned when assembling the unit because I did not hear the &#34;snap&#34; sound. Before using it for the first time I kept an old towel handy in case of leaking, but happily everything was fine. By the way, assembling was quick and easy.With over 3,000 reviews, I can understand why this seems to be a popular machine for many years.I hope to have continued success with it, will update later if any trouble is noticed.
