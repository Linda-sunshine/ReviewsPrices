review/summary: Great back and neck supportreview/text: I had tried these in stores when they first came out and always thought they radiated uncomfortable heat and smelled so bad it would keep me awake, but I tried this one on a trip and when you sink into it, all you smell is a hint of mint or outdoor greenery. The construction never makes you feel any more overheated than a regular mattress. It's a big improvement to when they first came out.
