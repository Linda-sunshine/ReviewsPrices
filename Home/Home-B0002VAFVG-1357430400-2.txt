review/summary: My Countertop Has Never Been Juicierreview/text: This juicer makes good juice. Unfortunately, about ten percent of that juice winds up on the juicer itself and the counter upon which it sits. It is a big time leaker. We spent good money on what is supposed to be a top juicer. I can't believe we have to deal with this kind of spillage. Get your act together, Breville!
