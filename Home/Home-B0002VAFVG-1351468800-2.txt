review/summary: Wow! My first juicer ever, and I am impressed!review/text: Well after having a savory carrot, apple, ginger concoction recently at a great breakfast spot, I asked what juicer brand they used. Breville was the reply! Just the received the juicer today & immediately replicated the same recipe in about 5 minutes. Delicious, just as I remembered the flavor. Easy to assemble and use. I look forward to a future of exploring more juice recipes and also improving my diet. My only regret, I just wish I would have purchased one sooner! Time will tell about the reliability of this model. Make your Mother proud and eat (juice) your vegatables and fruits!
