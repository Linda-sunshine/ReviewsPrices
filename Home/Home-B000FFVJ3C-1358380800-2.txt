review/summary: Great Productreview/text: This is a great product for dehydrating fruits and vegetables. I've used it for everything from making pepper flakes to making pumpkin jerky. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the grossly inaccurate manual. The manual always underestimates the time required to dehydrate times. As an example, it states, that for peppers, the drying time is between 5-12 hrs. The unit takes at least 72 hours to dry peppers.
