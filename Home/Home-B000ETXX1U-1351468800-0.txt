review/summary: Reliablereview/text: Brother-in-law just spent a week on this bed and said it was better than is mattress at home. Inflates quickly and stays firm all night. Love the built in air pump and the nook to store the cord in. We can throw sheets and covers on this air mattress and it would be just like any other bed.
