review/summary: One of those products that makes you realize you are in the futurereview/text: I had a long day of running around, and I made some great coffee to start off the day, and I figured I would try out this thermos to see if it really made a difference. Long story short, 12 hours later it was still hot, and i had drank a lot less coffee because I wasn't used to it keeping its heat so well. It was amazing and I literally said out loud as I was walking down the street &#34;I love the future.&#34; Awesome product!
