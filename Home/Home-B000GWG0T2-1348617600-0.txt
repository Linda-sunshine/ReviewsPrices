review/summary: Awesome pan!review/text: This is one of the best pans I have ever purchased. It makes perfect eggs, omelettes and burgers; and the surface is durable. The heat indicator doesn't seem to change color to me, however, if you know how to cook, knowing when the pan is hot enought shouldn't be an issue.
