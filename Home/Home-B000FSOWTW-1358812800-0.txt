review/summary: christmas giftreview/text: This was a Christmas present for my son-in-law. He was very happy and delighted to get this set. Iwas delighted atthe very reasonable price. The wine opener is pretty enough to set out on the counter and looks like a sleek work of art!And the bonus of the cooler was perfection. Great product and so functional.
