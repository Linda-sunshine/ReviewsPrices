review/summary: turns out I like power tools in the kitchen!review/text: I wanted an immersion blender for months before finally ordering this Cuisinart SmartStick because the negative reviews (of this and competitors) sounded SO bad. Finally I figured I was being silly to hesitate because it's just not a very expensive item.This is the only stick blender I've ever used so I can't say it's the best but I'm really having fun with it. At least some of my positive reaction is that I just like power tools. :-)It was perfect on hummus. Pesto took more patience - the basil leaves seemed to want to just clump together rather than get chewed up but I finally got some awesome pesto.Don't even try it with ice cubes. (I don't have an ice crusher but if your fridge has one, I bet that works great with the SmartStick.) Performance on frozen fruit was so-so. Pureeing a non-frozen plum was no problem. I did finally get pureed pineapple (that started as frozen chunks) but there was a lot of whining. The motor of the blender, not me. :-) This is probably how that plastic part gets stripped that other reviewers talk about. (I never keep the motor running for more than seconds of "pulsing" so am hoping to avoid anything stripping or getting burned out.) I haven't tried a fruit smoothie with it -- I wanted just the pureed fruit. I'm sure the fruit, frozen or not, would be easier to puree with some liquid.But pureeing hot cooked veges into soup was the best! That's what this baby was born for.Maybe higher-end is better; I'm guessing more power (more than 200 W)is better. However, for the price, I'm pretty happy with my choice.
