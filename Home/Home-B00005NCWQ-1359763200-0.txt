review/summary: Very pleasedreview/text: Very pleased with this percolator. In this cold climate, I like coffee to be really hot, and drip coffee makers don't get coffee hot enough for me. It works very well. I suggest using it with very freshly ground coffee, and do get it ground coarsely which is what works best in percolators. Keep an attentive eye on the stove and reduce the heat immediately once you start seeing the coffee perc up in the clear top. If you pay attention to detail, and follow the instructions in the booklet that comes with it, your coffee will taste quite good.
