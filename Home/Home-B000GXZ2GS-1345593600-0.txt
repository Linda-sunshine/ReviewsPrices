review/summary: Great for single cup, deeply annoying for more than one.review/text: It's great for when I'm brewing just for myself! Very fast, very easy, good filter every time. I've had it for about 6 months now and it's still in great condition. It doesn't do the fun vacuum bubble like it does in the commercial on Vimeo every time, but that's only a novelty anyway. It also eliminates waste if you have trouble finishing a whole pot or french press, which is great if you still like the gourmet stuff. However, it's problematic in 2 situations:1) It's annoying if you plan on making more than one cup. For the second cup, you're going to be burning your hands trying to clean it. You're also going to have to get the kettle going for a second time because by the time you make the first cup, the water won't be boiling anymore. Very awkward. For this reason alone, it's not a good replacement for other methods.2) It's impossible to brew an overly strong cup for iced coffee or cheap grounds. Due to the size and filter type, you physically can't fit more coffee grounds inside than basically an "optimal" brew. This is obviously a good thing for connoisseurs who use nothing but $12/pound freshly ground beans, but if you just want a thick, fully opaque cup of cheap pre-ground stuff to power you through the day, or something to pour over ice with some half-and-half, you'll want to use another method.
