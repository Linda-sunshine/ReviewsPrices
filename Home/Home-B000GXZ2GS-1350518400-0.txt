review/summary: Can't shut up about the Aeropress.review/text: I have become one of those obnoxious people that is constantly talking about their favorite brewing method. This is so ridiculously simple and fast that if I were one of those people that promoted children drinking lots of caffeine, I'd say even your kids could do it. I guess you could teach them how to make YOU coffee...but I digress. Cleanup is also ridiculously fast and simple.But the reason I can't shut up about it is even better than its simplicity and speed and the fact that it makes an INCREDIBLY delicious cup of coffee--it's that my stomach does not like coffee. I get several hours of nausea if I drink more than a little black coffee or espresso that hasn't been cut with enough milk. But not with Aeropress--the brew is lower acid and I can drink an entire Aeropress Americano with NO stomach trouble whatsoever. And THAT is worth talking about. :)
