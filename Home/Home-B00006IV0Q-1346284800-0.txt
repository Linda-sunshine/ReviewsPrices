review/summary: Great HOT coffee!!review/text: I've been using perculators for years and like many used drips but found they could never make the coffee hot enough. I've tried all the brands of perculators and this is my second Presto and I will stick with this one moving forward. It brews a great cup of hot coffee, pours very well and is easy to clean. I've only had a few months so can't vouch for how long it will last. I make a pot of coffee 3-5 times a week and it seems with most perculators they don't last for more than one year which I've come to grips with. At this price, it's still better than going to a coffee shop daily. Highly recommend!
