review/summary: Goodness depends on your expectations.review/text: I got this for grinding espresso, but having my German dad's frugality prevents me from spending several hundred bucks on a grinder like I really should have for grinding that fine. First, it's not a good espresso grinder. It's a solid unit which has been working perfectly for two years now. Out of box, as designed, it is best for drip or French press coffee. It really lags in three areas compared to the elite grinders. It does make a little coffee dust, but what do you expect? No biggie. Then there is a little bit of static generated in the grinding process, but it's also no big deal. The big weakness is that it's not designed with the precision to grind really fine espresso. It will grind almost fine enough, but not quite fine enough for a really good crema. This is a limitation for me. My friend who has one agrees precisely. Just know what you are getting into with this unit.If I bought it for espresso and it doesn't grind fine enough, then why do I use it every day and am perfectly happy with the results? It is because I modified mine so that it grinds more finely and uniformly. Remember this will void your warranty and is not recommended unless you know what you are getting into. I shimmed one of the burrs .002" so that, on its finest setting, it grinds the same as the commercial grinders. I used Illy Cafe's canned espresso grind and grounds from my friend's very pricy grinder for comparison and the results are identical, including the amount of coffee dust.
