review/summary: Nice little grinderreview/text: I bought this grinder as a cheap way to get into making sausage. We wanted to make lean sausage that was healthy and didn't leave half a pint of grease in the pan when we cooked it. So, we bought pork roast, ground it and mixed it with very lean hamburg and seasoning. We've ground about thirty lbs of pork and it works flawlessly. If you're looking for a fast, commercial grade grinder that handles large amounts of meat in a short time, don't expect this one to do it. This unit is for the home user that wants to process small amounts at a time (we do 4 or 5 lbs at a time). Grind the meat when it's still a little crunchy. Something I really liked about this grinder is that it's so clean looking, like a piece of lab equipment. No metal residue, doesn't rust and cleans up in seconds in warm, soapy water. You even get a little exercise turning the handle. Others said that they had problems with the cutter and nylon bearing. Follow directions and don't tighten the collar too tight. If it turns hard with no meat in it, the collar's too tight.
