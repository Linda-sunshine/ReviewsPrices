review/summary: Great Value.review/text: For such a low price, one can't complain too much if there is any minor problem. But a problem is a problem, regardless.Now, maybe I was just overly expectant, but this tie rack will come loose if there is too much weight on any given side. Meaning, if it's not nearly evenly distributed weight all around, it'll come loose from the tight grip it has upon first use. Considering the light weight of ties (cloth/silk), I wouldn't expect it to give in so easily. However, it is just a hanger.Still great. Saves space compared to many other tie racks and stays put for the most part.
