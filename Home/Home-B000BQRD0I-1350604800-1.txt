review/summary: Great Steamer!review/text: This is my very first steamer, honestly, so I have nothing to compare it to. That said, it's very easy to use, heats up in 30-45 secs, and does a great job on removing wrinkles from shirts, etc. I hate ironing, so this is a very nice alternative. Watch out, that steam is HOT! I highly recommend! Great value!
