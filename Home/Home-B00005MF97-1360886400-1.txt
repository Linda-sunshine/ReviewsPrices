review/summary: great chopper!review/text: I don't like to hand chop items in recipes, so this Chopper was a big help. I made chicken crepes and used my chopper for the onion, celery, apples and chicken. A great time saver. It's a nice size, and the plastic base at the bottom can be removed and used as a lid for unused portions.
