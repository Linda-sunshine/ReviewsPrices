review/summary: a spiral gemreview/text: I used to own a very fancy $350 French spiral slicer and after about a year or 2 it became dull, no longer sliced, mashed the veggies, and i could not get parts for it. then i saw this on Amazon for 1/10 the price and 2 years later i can tell you that this is totally awesome, sturdy, and well-made. it does not slice as thin as the French one but if you let up on the pressure of the feed handle you can get fine results. worth every penny and the spirals it makes are show stoppers, fun to eat, decorate with, and use in cooking. easy to clean and store as the blades fit right into a holder on the body of the machine. . I JUST LOVE THIS LITTLE GUY!!!
