review/summary: Not a bad option....review/text: I ordered this bed for my move across country. The movers were going to take up to 3 weeks to delivery our furniture so we decided to get the bed instead of sleeping on the floor of the new place. Easy to inflate, I like the dual chambers for the outer support and the inner sleep area. This bed help up well to 24 days straight use. We occasionally added some air to the bed but nothing outrageous. Easy to deflate as well. I like that the bottom had grippers so it wouldn't move too much on the bare wood floors. Over all a great bed and we look forward to letting our out of town guests using this bed as well.
