review/summary: great space heaterreview/text: Hello - I work out of my home office and I needed a space heater for my basement. It is probably upper 50's low 60's in my basement and I'm always so col down there. I got this heater to help take off the edge and it hasn't disappointed me. I used it during last winter and now I've already fired it up several times for 2012. I live in Michigan where its cold for like 5-6 months of the year, so I use it almost daily. Make sure you don't set it too close to your legs; after repeated uses of it a bit too close, I started to burn myself a little bit. I've since set it farther away and that has worked out a lot better. This will not heat up a large space, at least not one like your basement where it is similar to mine. It would however be a nice heater for a main level floor or your bedroom, or if you plan to use it like I do.
