review/summary: Perfect for my office!review/text: For about a week's worth of 'take out' coffee, I bought this for my office at work. The community coffee in my building is too weak and tastes weird (probably cheap brand), but with this I can brew one nice strong cup to my liking, with my coffee. :) I really love that it has a cone filter, which I've always used (in my opinion cone-filtered tastes better than basket-filtered coffee.) And while the permanent filter is convenient, I've just purchased a dozen boxes of Melitta #1 natural cone filters because I've always preferred Melitta's natural cone filters for my traditional coffee makers. And although I considered bringing my Keurig Mini that I use at home on the weekends, this is a much cheaper route as I drink more coffee at the office. For what I pay for a box of K-Cups, I get a whole pound of good coffee that lasts me a few weeks. I highly recommend this perfect little coffee maker!
