review/summary: We are addicted to this juicerreview/text: My husband and I bought this juicer and have had it for a week. We have used multiple times every day and have become quite addicted to the thing. We have juiced everything from tomatoes to kale to beets to ginger to apples to cucumbers ... anything we can think of! It does it all will ease and produces a large quantity of juice, leaving behind fairly dry pulp. I like that it has so many speeds so that you can customize the speed to the particular fruit/veggie (if you spin it too fast for a particular item you are missing out on a good deal of juice).Cleaning is pretty easy. It says you can put the parts in the dishwasher, but we just clean them by hand each time. This takes less than 5 minutes and is really simple. To save clean up time we put a plastic grocery bag on the pulp collector ("trash can style", hanging over the edge) and it catches all the pulp without getting the catcher pail dirty. Just grab and bag and easily transport to garbage or compost and that is one less thing you have to clean.Love, love, love this thing and have absolutely nothing bad to say about it.
