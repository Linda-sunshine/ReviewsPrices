review/summary: Do Not Buy Hoover SteamVacF5914-900review/text: I have been waiting for the internal bladder to be repaired on what is a new Hoover SteamVac F5914-900 carpet cleaner that I used to clean 2 rooms. This product has been in the "shop" since October 26. I'm glad it's not my bladder that needs repair and that Hoover is in charge of sending the part. Is the part arriving on a "slow boat from China"? It is currently December 19. I called after one month and I was told the part was ordered, but they can't do the repair until it arrives. I ordered this carpet cleaner which arrived September 10, 2012. My plan was to clean one room per week. It took several weeks to get started. It was pretty easy to assemble. The directions were fairly easy to understand. The cleaning of the 2 rooms the first 2 weeks turned out fine. On the third week I got to the stair attachment. When I started the cleaning process all the cleaning solution in the tank leaked out on the carpet. Try getting a gallon of solution from a carpet covering hardwood floors. Whoa...Did I read the directions correctly? I read and reread the directions and tried it again the next week. The same thing happened. I can read and follow directions so I called Hoover Customer Service. I gave the model and described the problem and was told over the phone what the problem was. Are they all defective? So my plan to have the carpets cleaned are on a 2 month or more HOLD. Will the one year warranty expire before I can clean the stairs? It looks like the warranty may expire while it is in the "shop" waiting for an internal bladder. As far as rating this item and Hoover one star is too high.Don't buy this product.As for Amazon this was my first purchase. It was easy to do. My regret is buying a defective product. If I purchased it at a brick and mortar store I would have returned it to the store. I would have had my carpet cleaned by Thanksgiving as I originally planned.
