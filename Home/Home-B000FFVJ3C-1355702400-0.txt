review/summary: Works greatreview/text: It is easy and convenient to use. Easy to clean afterwords. Storage is not too bad. All in all a very simple way to make jerky. My kids love jerky and this dehydrator makes it a snap to cook great tasting jerky indoors (I do like to use my smoker every now and then - but this has got the smoker beat for convenience - especially if you use ground meat and Nesco's Jerky gun)
