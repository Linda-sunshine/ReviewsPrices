review/summary: Good for spillsreview/text: I liked the product , It cleans well and does pick up spills. but it doesn't heat water so we have to pour hot water in the water in let which is not very convenient. Water tends to cool down soon so I end up refilling the water in let frequently. We have a large living room so I have to fill water at least twice.
