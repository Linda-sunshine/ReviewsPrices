review/summary: Now I have enough room to make big batches.review/text: I finally have a &#34;blizter&#34; that has enough room for all the ingredients in the big batches of recipes that I make without stuff spilling over the top. I gave away my smaller &#34;Cuisi&#34; to a beginner cook that only needs it for once in a while. It had already served me for many good years and I hope this bigger one will serve me for a long time, too.
