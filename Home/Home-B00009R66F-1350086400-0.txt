review/summary: Awesome Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleanerreview/text: The Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner did and excellent job of cleaning carpeting and even tile floor. I have three dogs, two cats and the machine stood up and did a great job on cleaning the soiled carpet and flooring. Easy to assemble, easy to operate and does not leave the carpet soaking wet. The sample cleaning product was good too but I would advise ordering a bottle of cleaner when you order the machine. It has high ratings because it works and it is a strong durable machine.
