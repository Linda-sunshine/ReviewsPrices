review/summary: Three years and going strongreview/text: I bought this kettle for approximately $11 over three years ago. I use it pretty constantly as I am a tea drinker, and it is still going strong. It is simple to operate, shuts itself off when the water is ready, and brings the water to a full rolling boil in just a minute or two. I cannot recommend this kettle highly enough. I love it and consider it to be among the best $11 I have ever spent.
