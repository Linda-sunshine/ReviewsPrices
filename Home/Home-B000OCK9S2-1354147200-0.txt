review/summary: Great for our nurseryreview/text: I needed a sound machine for our newborn to try and keep out the noise from our toddler. I love it! I use the &#34;white noise&#34; option but I think the other sounds are nice too. We have another (more expensive) sound machine in the toddler's room and I don't like it as much as this Conair - the sounds are too high pitched and &#34;tinny&#34;. The Conair has a deeper sound, the white noise sounds like the heat or A/C is running all the time, which is dreamy to me. I needed a clock in the nursery as well, so that is a bonus.I have it across the room from her crib. I think if it were right next to her or if an adult put it on a bedside table it would be a little annoying, but I suppose one would get used to that.Overall...very pleased and tempted to replace the toddler's with this one!
