review/summary: The display are tooooo dim!review/text: When I received this, I plugged it into the AC outlet and find only the radio working, I was thinking that this screen is broken and want it returned at first, but later on I find that the screen is working but the brightness is just toooooo low, even the brightest option is indiscernible in the my room that is full of sunlight that afternoon. Now I can only see the time in the evening, is this just me?
