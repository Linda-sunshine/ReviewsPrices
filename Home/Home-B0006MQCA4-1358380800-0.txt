review/summary: Tastes Crisp and Clean!review/text: This water filtration system works wonderfully. The water it produces is so clean and has filtered so much of the impurities my tap water has. There is absolutely no smell or taste of chlorine. The metals are gone, and I am left with crisp, delicious water. I love the slender design, it enables it to fit nice and snug into a refrigerator. It is a good idea to fill this thing up as you start to get low, this thing filters slowly (drip by drip). Great product, I highly recommend this filtration system over any other if you are searching for a good water filter.
