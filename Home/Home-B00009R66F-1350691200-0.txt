review/summary: One of the few true bargains in this worldreview/text: You'll find many long and informative reviews on this product. This isn't one of those.The Hoover SteamVac is something of a bargain.Oh, it's not perfect: the dirty-water tank could be somewhat larger, and I curse the need to flop the handle down to get it out (oddly, our first one had a big handle that acted as a release lever for the dirty-water tank and I can't quite see why they changed that design to the two separate locks).It works best with hot water in the cleaner tank, and as others have noted if your floor has dog hair, etc. you'll find it gunking up the brushes so generally you need to vacuum first. Oh, and because the whole thing works on suction, and blowing air through the dirty-water tank, you don't want to just plug it in and run it with half a tank of three-week-old crud in the dirty-water tank lest your whole room end up smelling like the muck in the tank.But these are all nits. It's a useful product at a reasonable price and quite durable. The hand attachments also do a pretty decent job on car upholstery.
