review/summary: Expertly crafted story of a world that may not be too far awayreview/text: The Giver offered a world some people long for and others will fear. The people in the book believe they live a perfect society. No one wants for basic needs like food and shelter. Everyone has an assigned job, and knows what events they should experience with each stage of their life. Everyone is essentially the same. Only one person knows all of the beauty and sorrows of the world, the Giver. And he is about to give that knowledge away to Jonas, the new receiver. As Jonas gains knowledge and memories from the Giver, he begins to worry about all that the community gives up in order to acheive the sameness they live in. Is the lack of fear about war and poverty worth the loss of color and love?This book will make you think about the changes in our own society, and what they might bring. A great way for kids to learn about different social issues as well. I recommend reading it as a family.
