review/summary: Awesome!review/text: I wanted a clock radio that wouldn't take up a lot of room on my nightstand, and this really doesn't. The radio is crisp and loud enough to be played for fun. The knobs to set the two alarms are one of the favorite features. Setting up alarm times is a breeze. Another thing I really like is how low I can set the brightness. I hate bright alarm clocks, my last one was impossible to sleep next to unless I hid it under the bed. this one is perfect. Oh, one last thing, it came with the time already set! Very cool, I adjusted it because factory time was 2 minutes fast though, which was a breeze.
