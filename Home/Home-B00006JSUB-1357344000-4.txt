review/summary: Emergency pan becomes the standard for cookingreview/text: I made a pyrolizer stove for the back porch, both as a power-outage emergency stove and to make biochar for the garden. I bought the skillet to fit it. Now that I understand keeping the skillet seasoned, I use it more than any other pan I have, both on the pyrolizer stove and on an induction burner in the kitchen.
