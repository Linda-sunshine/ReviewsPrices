review/summary: Good skillet.review/text: For the first few times I used this 9&#34; skillet, I had to scrape the bottom hard to keep food from sticking and burning. Then, after a few more times of use and proper cleaning, it began to get easier where the food didn't stick as much as it did at first. Finally, after using this skillet 8 times and cleaning it properly, food no longer sticks to it!! It works as if it was a teflon skillet, so now I'm happy with it. The proper way I was told to clean it was let it cool after use (obviously), use a Scotch-Brite sponge and warm water to clean it, then use a paper towel to absorb all the water from its surface, then lightly coat the entire inside with olive oil (or whatever oil you like to use) and let it sit this way until you are ready to use it again. This procedure seems to work perfectly! The only con about this skillet is that it has a rough surface on the inside, Lodge could have made this a lot smoother than it is, but overall doesn't seem to matter too much as, again, it now works like a teflon skillet. Highly recommend this skillet!
