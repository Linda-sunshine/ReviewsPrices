review/summary: Wonderful for back support!review/text: This pillow is just a little stiff for sleeping on, bit I LOVE it for back support when sitting up in bed reading. It doesn't bunch up or go flat, and it comes with its own cover for protecting it. The size fits perfectly in a standard pillowcase. I liked this so well, I bought one for my sister, who also suffers from back pain...she loves hers, too.
