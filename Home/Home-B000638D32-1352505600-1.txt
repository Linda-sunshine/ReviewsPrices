review/summary: The Victorinox knifereview/text: I didn't have the Victorinox Swiss Army 8 inch fibrox straight edge chef's knife for very long, perhaps a little over a month, hence the brief review. Thus far, this light weight knife is easy to use, it is sharp and can be used for cutting most things. It is a general purpose knife. I guess it depends on the amount of cutting I do, the duration of sharpness remain to be seen. It is a good knife and I would recommend it.Florence Maruyama, customer
