review/summary: Worked three times then failed - dangerousreview/text: Like some others, this lasted for about five uses before the lid started to pop off during heating. I thought at first I hadn't put it on tightly, and reattached it. It popped off a couple of more times before one of the eggs cracked.Like others mentioned, this is awkward to handle and gets very hot.Great idea, terrible execution.
