review/summary: Best floor vac ever!review/text: This is an awesome vacuum for floors! Even though it easily swivels to get into corners you don't actually have to use that feature much because it seems to suck up EVERYTHING in front AND to the side of it without having to jam it into corners over and over to pick that last bit of paper or a Cheerio where the wall meets the floor. Easy to use and slim to store. I got mine from Amazon warehouse for about $10 cheaper and it works fantastic.
