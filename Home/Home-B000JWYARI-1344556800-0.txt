review/summary: Rough and Scratchyreview/text: I bought these Sateen Sheets in hopes that it would be the smooth cool feel of sheets that you would get at a nice hotel. After numerous washes and fabric softener additions I realized that these sheets would never soften up and that I had made a poor purchase. If you want the soft feel of nice sheets I would not recommend these sheets. I bought Pure Beech Sateen Sheets from BBB and they were perfect right out of the box with one wash to make sure they were clean.
