review/summary: Not as easy to clean as they sayreview/text: "They're also easy to clean--simply wipe them off using hot water and dish soap."This is simply not true. As soon as I am done with this product, I put it in my sink full of water and dish soap, soak it, and then gently clean it. I even use Dawn, which has gotten every other grease spotted pan clean. This is stained, badly, from grease. I bought this product December 2011 so it hasn't been a full year yet. I use it about twice a week, at most. I almost didn't even recognize the product when I saw it on amazon considering how stained it looks in comparison.The only other complaint I've had with this is it easily burns the bottom of baked goods in comparison to past cookie sheets I've used. It doesn't cook as evenly as I would like.Other than those two complaints, I've never had a problem with sticking, which is a relief. This is so much easier to deal with than parchment paper (which I gave up on years ago) and wax paper.
