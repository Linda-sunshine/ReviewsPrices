review/summary: NOT for adults - recordings are horrible!review/text: I sleep SO much better with noise, just white noise, so I thought this sounded good, plus I liked the idea of being able to use the radio in the morning. But the recordings are AWFUL. I wanted to use the rain one but it made this clicking noise every 10 or 15 seconds that drove me crazy. I tried out some of the other sounds but could very quickly identify where they started repeating. And the radio dial is SO TOUCHY that it doesn't stay in one place. I did get theSound Spa Portableby HoMedics (at Bed, Bath and Beyond I think it was $19.99 and then I used a 20% off coupon) and I LOVE it!All this said, Amazon's return process was SO EASY I'll never worry about making a return again!!!!
