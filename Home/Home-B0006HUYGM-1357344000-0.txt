review/summary: Great tool for carpeted stairs!review/text: With a family of 4 - two of which are dogs - the entire house is always in need of a good vacuuming. Though we have a Roomba on both floors of the house, they don't do stairs. Lugging out the heavy vacuum is a pain. This little handheld is just what the doctor ordered! I couldn't believe how much dirt and hair it picked up even though I had just vacuumed with the Dyson two days earlier. I love this tool.
