review/summary: My favorite vacuum thus far!review/text: This vacuum is light weight, easy to store, and picks up dirt/pet hair better than my last vacuum!!! Plus, no bags to bother with any more!!! Just keep in mind for the best cleaning experience, keep the filters cleaned off and replace as needed. Heavy use would increase this to 4, maybe 5 times per year, I do this &#34;maintenance&#34; once every six months because I notice the difference and appreciate the convenience this vacuum provides for me.This is not the vacuum for a large household but it is perfect for my small family in our town home. Perfect &#34;starter&#34; vacuum and easy to carry!
