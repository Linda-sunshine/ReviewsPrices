review/summary: Excellent Juicer!review/text: I've had this juicer for a few months and I couldn't be happier with it. I use it to juice about five times a week. It is very easy to disassemble and clean. I feel I always get the maximum amount of juice from my veggies, as the pulp is always very dry. The only drawback is juicing citrus fruits. I don't think it is the best juicer for that. I've never had a problem with leakage or the motor. The instruction booklet says several times to push the food at a slower pace for maximum juicing, which I do, and it works great! I'd definitely recommend this juicer and have even bought one for my brother. Great product!
