review/summary: Cleans up dog hair on furniturereview/text: This vacuum works really well to clean the dog hair off our furniture. It's powerful because it's corded and the spinning brushes are the key to picking up the hair off the fabric. It works a lot better than dragging out our upright dyson and using the attachment as well as it's more convenient. You just have to clean out the filter frequently since it's small.
