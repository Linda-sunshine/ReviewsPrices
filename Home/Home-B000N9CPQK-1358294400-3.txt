review/summary: Not Bad Depending on applicationreview/text: Ratings:Air Cleaning - 4 / Noise - 3 / Filter - 4 / Controls - 4I got this for den where there is smoking, the intent was not to clean dust and such from the air but cut down the smoke accumulation. For that purpose this worked very well. Given that this is not specifically designed for smoke it is likely that the pre-filter will need replacing after some washes so I went ahead and got some spares.It will not remove the smoke smell from a room for a non-smoker but it does take out the brunt of the smoke and pretty quickly on high. So while smoking the unit is on high, fairly loud, for example you would not want to be watching TV or listening to music with this thing on High, but it does make short work out of a smokey room.On Medium the noise drops a lot, but still not suitable in my opinion for a quiet setting, but would be fine in a family room with the TV on, and on Low it is hard to heard in any setting but a dead quiet room, in which case you'll want something else if you are senstive to fan noise.So for my purpose this did just what I needed, 5 minutes after someone smokes, the room is as clear as it will get, again not bad given the price.I saw some review where the case had issue, rattles, air bypassing the filter, not sure if it was luck or not but mine is fine, no rattles and there is a rubber seal the appears to be directly the air where it should go, through the filter.
