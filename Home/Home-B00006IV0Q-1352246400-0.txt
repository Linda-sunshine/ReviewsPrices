review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I've had this percolator for three months, and the plug going into the percolator is going (and, of course, the return window has expired). Other than that, we love this percolator. Just wish I could find one with a decent plug, and maybe I wouldn't have to buy a new one every few months! Purchased this one instead of the Farberware -- the Farberware one lasted about a year, so I'll be going back to that one.
