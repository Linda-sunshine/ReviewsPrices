review/summary: I love it - it is great, and FUN. Read the directions!!!review/text: I used it several times this week, and it now has a permanent place on my food-prep area It works better than I ever expected. The 'noodles' are amazing - sweet potato and onion. I sauteed them with mushrooms, coconut oil, shredded carrots, S&P;, garlic, ginger, hot chili oil and chicken. WOW. It was real comfort food. Perfect!It is very sharp - ouch. And ouch again! Be diligent and use in a very well-lit kitchen. And once I realized it had suction cups, it no longer moves around like crazy when in use. It works great on my metal tabletop; not so great on the cutting board, obviously.I read the directions, but forgot to hold the little handle that helps push the veggie towards the slicer, and ended up breaking one of the tiny prongs from the 'pusher' arm into 'noodles'.I didn't realize it until I ate my food and found it. Today I noticed the handle and it worked perfectly. I sliced 4 large onions in no time, no crying even.Easy to clean. I LOVE IT. I wish I had it when my kids were at home.I LOVE IT!
