review/summary: So far so goodreview/text: Maybe I have myslef hypnotized but I took a little nap and when I woke up my mouth and throat and eyes were not all dry.The air seems to me like I am standing outside in the fresh air ,well when air used to be fresh.smile.I had second thoughts about this, first i was trying to find the model with a permanent hepa filter but after dealing with the Honeywell Store and that nightmare, I decided just to be thismodel from Amazon instead..I just turned it on about 4 hours ago just about 20 minutes after it was delivered.So for now, I am a happy customer.
