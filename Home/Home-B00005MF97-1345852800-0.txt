review/summary: Excellent and faster for preparation!review/text: We purchased this item for ourselves and our birds! We feed our pet birds both seed, vegetables and fruit. We needed something to help chop their food and our food easier. This is great! I was able to chop the celery today fast and easy and in a minute, it was ready to be put in their dishes! Wow! Before you knew it, they ate it fast. The size was great and they had no problem.It's great for us too.I like the bottom you can use as a lid. That's great. If you have a lot to store in the refrigerator, all you have to do, is remove the blade, and keep the food in and put the lid over top.!
