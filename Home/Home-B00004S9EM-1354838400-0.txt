review/summary: A long love affairreview/text: This model, which was delivered today, is number five since 1989. It was meant to replace a model I bought in April 2010 which had lost an essential little piece of plastic on the sleeve assembly and I figured it would be less hassle to just order a new machine than to buy ill-fitting and expensive replacement parts.When I unpacked my new model I read the warranty and low and behold, that essential little piece of plastic that broke is covered up to 3 years and the Cuisinart Customer Service number was right there.I got my old machine and a magnifying glass, you know they'll ask for the serial number, and I called Cuisinart. Emily asked a few questions, she determined my part was covered and she is sending me a replacement, it should be here within a week.. All she asked in return was that I send the broken part to them.This comment is for all those 1 star reviewers that have bashed this machine and Cuisinart Customer Service. Customer Service could not have been nicer, no hassle, no runaround just professional demeanor and good service.Looks like my two machines and my dozen slicing and grating discs I have collected over the years are good to go until December 2015 under full warranty
