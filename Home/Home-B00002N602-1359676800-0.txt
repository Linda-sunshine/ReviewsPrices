review/summary: Quick Cooking Wonder!review/text: I had one of these great cookers long ago. My old one was very heavy. This one is made of stainless steel and seems to be lighter. I had to attach the handles, so some assembly on this one is required. My first recipe was, 'Ham Hocks & Navy Beans', and I cooked the pre-soaked beans and ham hocks in about 25 or 30 minutes. They turned out great, but had to guess at the cooking time, as the recipe was not in the enclosed instruction/recipe booklet, but in my head! Since then, I have purchased two great pressure cooker cookbooks. I plan to cook many more dishes in this quick-cooking appliance. Be sure to read THOROUGHLY, the instruction booklet, to safely use this(& all) pressure cookers.
