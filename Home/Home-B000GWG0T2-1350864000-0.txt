review/summary: Good skillet but one surprisereview/text: I replaced an older 7" Tfal skillet with this one. I like my new skillet a lot. It is very non-stick, heats evenly, and works well.But, imagine my surprise when, the first time i used it, i noticed it was slightly out of round! The pan, held up by the handle, is just a little bent on one side. Not enough to return it, but i certainly expected better qa from tfal.I also notice that the handle gets hotter than my old tfal skillet with its hard handle...the new one has a rubber covered metal handle.
