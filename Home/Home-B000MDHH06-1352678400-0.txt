review/summary: Somewhat disappointingreview/text: This juicer does its job. However, I previously owned a different branded juicer that finally gave out after many years of great service. That juicer was much smaller than this product. This product is quite large for what it does and it takes a lot of storage space if left out on a counter to use on a regular basis to convert fruit and vegetables to juice. I am not sorry I bought the juicer but had I realized its size, I would have opted for a different brand that has smaller machines.
