review/summary: New Design = New Design Flawreview/text: The lids of these things aren't shaped correctly to match the top of the handle. Because of this, anytime somebody places their thumb on top of the handle while pouring (which seems like the &#34;safe&#34; thing to do), the lid will pop off. Surely, this company has engineers that are capable of recognizing and fixing this flaw. Unfortunately, somebody must have decided it was &#34;good enough&#34; to sell instead of spending the money to correct things. Wish my ~7 year old pitcher hadn't broke- it didn't have this problem.
