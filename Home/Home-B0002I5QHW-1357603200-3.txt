review/summary: Same as my Lakeland Mincer!review/text: I'm from the UK and I bought this for my Sister in law as a gift....I used it while I was staying with them in the US on holiday and its the same as my precious mincer that I bought in the UK! A great product, sturdy strong plastic and it really adheres to the surface well...I do turn the handle with care though. It's easy to assemble and take apart for cleaning which is also simple to do. All in all I am going to be giving more of these mincers as gifts to my daughters and nieces!
