review/summary: Good product but poor accessory selectionreview/text: We ordered this unit a few days ago, received it, and the unit itself seems fine and well-built (we haven't actually used it yet). I bought it because it seemed like an identical-except-a-little smaller version of the DLC-2011. And it is, but there's one *other* important difference: there are way fewer accessories available for this model! The -2011 has a selection of different slicing and grating disks and other such things available, the -2009 apparently does not.So if having a variety of accessories is important to you, I'd suggest buying the larger model. Or, ironically, the smaller (DLC-2007) one, it also has a better accessory selection!
