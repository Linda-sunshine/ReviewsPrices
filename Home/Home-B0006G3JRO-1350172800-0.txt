review/summary: Love itreview/text: I received this as a gift for Christmas in 2011..I can't say enough good about it!! Not only is it great for blending soups and sauces, but the chopper attachment is used daily in my home, also the attachment for whisking is wonderful as well for eggs or mashed potatoes....Highly reccommend this product.
