review/summary: Works for Mereview/text: Live on the mainland side of a North Carolina Sound and receive a lot of very fine dust from an island on the other side. Purchased this to reduce the dust circulating in the hourse (1600 sq ft) even if its called a room purifier.Normally run at low and at night. So far has been great. My only concern is how often I'll have to replace the filters, but that's in the future.
