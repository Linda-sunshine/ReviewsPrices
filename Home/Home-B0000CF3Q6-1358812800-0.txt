review/summary: Best and least expensive espresso makerreview/text: I've had this espresso maker for about two weeks and find it to be an excellent and most efficient espresso machine. It brings out every bit of flavor from the grounds and does it in less than 5 minutes. I purchased the 3-cup model which fills a demitasse cup. If you want to serve company buy a larger model. I paid less than $25, don't consider any of the more expensive brands.
