review/summary: Don't spend more to be fashionable!!!review/text: We have used these pots for 18 months now. We use them daily, some pots we wash only to put them back on the stove and use again right away. This is the first stainless cookware I have used and I love it. We use a gas range and the heat is even, smooth and quick. They look fabulous and have held up well. One very interesting thing is that the handles rarely ever get too hot to hold. The lid handles will occasionally require an oven mitt, but only during the hottest and longest cooking. I love that there is no teflon to flake, or to scratch. We don't use metal utensils much, but that is more for looks than function. Cleaning them is not very difficult at all. If a pot or pan looks like the food is crusted on we simply soak it while we are eating. When we get back the food falls off into the sink. Only the toughest burnt in food remains. The same thing happens with my teflon pan so this isn't a detriment.We clean them with Bon Ami cleaner when they are horribly messy, and they come out perfect with minimal effort. I highly recommend these, and am glad we purchased them.We also got to see some of the more expensive versions from other brand-names at friend's houses. They don't look any different, and didn't cook any better. Save yourself the money. The Cuisinart Multi-Clad are perfect for the price.
