review/summary: Excellent bread from day ONEreview/text: I got this machine a week ago. It's just wonderful. I started making bread from day one, trying different recipes from the booklet that comes with the machine. So far I've tried plain white, whole wheat and french, and they hace come really good.I live in Colombia and so we don't get the special flours and yeast for machines; however, using traditional flour and yeast has given me so far good results.For the price, this has been an excellent adquisition to my kitchen tools. I do recommend it.Recomendadisima. Una excelente compra, muy econonomica, y que produce un muy buen casero desde el d&iacute;a uno, solo hay que seguir con cuidado las instrucciones.
