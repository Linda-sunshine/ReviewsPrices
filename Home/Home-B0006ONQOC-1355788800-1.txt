review/summary: Great Ice Cream Maker!review/text: The ice cream maker performs exactly as expected; have made several different recipes in it and even invented a few! AS noted, be sure the bowl is completely frozen and the base is chilled before using the machine, but everything I've put in it has been done perfectly within 20-30 minutes. Delicious!
