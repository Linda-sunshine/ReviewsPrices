review/summary: MY LIDS DON'T LEAK :)review/text: I'm not going to diss the negative reviews of people saying the lids leak...but i can honestly say mine don't...i put water in a jar put the lid on tightly and turned it upside down and left it there for a while...not one drop came out...so maybe the negative reviewers aren't putting the lids on tight enough? i don't know but i honestly think the rule of buying online is don't listen to the reviews..just buy what you want and if it's messed up just send it back...at least you'd know first hand whether it's a good product or not...i'm so glad i decided to get these lids even after reading some bad reviews...they cost $5 so taking the chance isn't that big of a risk
