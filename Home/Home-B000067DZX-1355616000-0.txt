review/summary: Good filters at a great price.review/text: I can really taste the difference when we put in a new PUR filter. We have two water pitchers that we use regularly. These two stage filters make the water taste fresh (far different than our usual Texas water taste). The 3-pack was less expensive than the 4-pack, so be aware of the savings. Wally world charges more for this product and Amazon delivers to my door. Simple purchase decision for me.
