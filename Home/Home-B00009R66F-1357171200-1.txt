review/summary: Like the other 1 Star Reviews... nice when working but it didn't even last a year!review/text: Machine cleaned well initially. In fact we were thrilled with our purchase. We have no problems putting it together and it cleaned to our expectations (not professional level but good for house maintenance).Our second time using the unit I heard a loud pop when the dirty water tanked had filled followed by clicking noises from the engine as I turned it off. I cleaned the tank, reinstalled to continue cleaning, and the brush wouldn't turn.I did have success with Hoover Customer Service and I found them to be pretty average in terms of support: not overboard but good enough. They wanted me to take the machine to a service center for repairs under warranty but that was 1.5-2 hours away. They then listened to the motor over the phone to hear the clicking noise and then promptly sent me instructions for how to disable this machine and complete arrangements for a new one to be shipped to me.Yes, we will get a new machine so I'm at least a little pleased. However, it will be the same model and by the time I get it the new one it will no longer be covered by a warranty (1 year from date of original purchase carries to the new machine).All in all, I paid $135 for 1.5 average carpet cleanings. Money could be better spent elsewhere.
