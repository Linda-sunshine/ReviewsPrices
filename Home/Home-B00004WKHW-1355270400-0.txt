review/summary: Better for chopping than grindingreview/text: I chose this because it send it was a chopper and a grinder. I have used it for both, but the grinding is quite coarse regardless of how long you hold down the button. Also, the buttons do not lock, so you must push them down the whole time you are using it. Overall, it is okay, but I had to buy a regular grinder for my coffee beans, which I was hoping to avoid.
