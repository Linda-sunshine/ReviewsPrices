review/summary: Awesomereview/text: My mom has had a KitchenAid mixer (20 years old), my sister has an KitchenAid mixer (11 years old), I have a KitchenAid mixer (1.5 years old) and hopefully they will still be around when my children need one. This company is a legend in the mixer world. Sure they are a bit on the higher priced end, but trust me you will appreciate it. For sure get the one that has the handle on the bowl, just trust me on this. It is easy to attach attachments, I have used the slicer, grinder and shredder all work nice. Even if you find a used attachment it will still work on your new machine. The only question I have had on mixers is which KitchenAid color do I want.
