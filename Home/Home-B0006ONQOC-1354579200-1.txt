review/summary: Makes Ice Cream Very Wellreview/text: I don't know how this compares with other ice cream machines, because it's the first one I've ever used, so, for me - it seems pretty good. I haven't gotten a batch out of it that I've LOVED, but, I think it's me. I am pleased with the cleanup, low noise level, and general appearance... I think it was a good buy.
