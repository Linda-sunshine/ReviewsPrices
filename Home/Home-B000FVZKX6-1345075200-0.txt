review/summary: Best. Sheets. Ever.review/text: I bought these exact flannel sheets in October 2010... It is now August 2012. I have washed these sheets weekly for the past two years. They have not pilled...at all...And thats crazy, considering they have probably been washed almost 100 times! They feel as soft as when I first got them, and I use them all year... (Air conditioning int he summer makes me cold...) These are soooo worth every penny, and if they ever wear out, I will look for these exact same ones!
