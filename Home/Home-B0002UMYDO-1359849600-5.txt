review/summary: Where have you been all my life?!review/text: We have spent hundreds on can openers. They all work for the first couple of weeks, then it is back to shopping. This item works so well, that my wife has been &#34;eating crow&#34; for complaining I spent too much. She has changed her stance, she even bought one for her mother. It is the best can opener EVER ! Worth every penny!
