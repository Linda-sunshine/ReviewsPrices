review/summary: LOVE this!review/text: A few years ago I got into juicing. I got the Jack L. one, one from Target, one from Costco, one that pressed the veggies into this small little worm of debris and the Breville. I liked the Breville the best, it was sturdy, clean looking and I thought it did a good job in juicing the veggies. But in the end I returned it too because it was too hard to juice and clean up after every meal.A few weeks ago I decided that I needed to juice again for health and well being. Send husband out to find a Breville and he found this one. What I like about it is the varying speeds. There is a scale that shows you the level of vegetables or fruits you are juicing. So harder fruits will get ground at high spins than softer fruits like berries and such. It is pretty neat the way it works. There is a pitcher that you can use to have the juice go right into that rather than into a cup and I like that better for making more than one juice at a time.Clean up is still a problem. There is a lot of clean up to do but the materials that it is made of is very easy to rinse off and pack up. The grinder/juicer part rinses off easy too and then just adding a little soap to the brush and simple as pie or juiced pie!
