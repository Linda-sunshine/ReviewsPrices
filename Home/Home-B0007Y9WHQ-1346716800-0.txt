review/summary: love it!review/text: I bought the spiral slicer a few weeks ago and I've already used it most everyday. I just love it! It is so easy to operate. Clean up is a breeze, just run hot water over, take the blade out, clean, put it back in, so easy. Yes, this spiral is plastic except for the blade part but it does everything it says it will do. I have totally enjoyed mine and enjoy all the fresh veggies I add to my salads.
