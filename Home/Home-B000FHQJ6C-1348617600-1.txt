review/summary: Great valuereview/text: I've been looking for an effective juicer that wasn't going to cost $200 for a long time. When I read the reviews for this one and saw the price, I thought why not give it a try. The reviews were positive and the price was right. One important concern for me was that the juicer would clean up easily and quickly. And this juicer does that. There is ittle mess and it's very quick and easy. The motor is powerful. The juicer works great. I am very satisfied.
