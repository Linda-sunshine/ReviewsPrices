review/summary: Great kettle but one leaks, one doesn't shut off and now one plate doesn't boil!review/text: Update: February 2013: After buying 3 more of these, I just had 1 boiling plate go out (I know this since the pot works on the other boiler plates). I looked into the warranty policy and on top of shipping these back, I would have to send $10, waiting for 2-4 weeks also making it so not worth returning. I like this kettle and maybe I do run them more than most, but I think for a combined $120, I should get at least one winter out of them so I am downgrading this to 3 stars. Will try another brand and see how it compares.Update 1/04/13: I have been running 4 of these kettles every morning for my animals' outside water bowls. 2 of them will not "auto" shut off now but it boils fast even when temps are freezing outside so it's easily shut off.I would have given this 5 stars but after 1 winter of heavy usage, I stored it and when I took it out this year for this coming winter, it leaks at the bottom. I have to say I got my $30 worth of usage out of it and luckily it's in my outdoor gazebo so I don't mind a little leakage but if this were being used him my house I would toss it. I will buy more so I don't have to boil water over and over to warm up my animals outside water bowls. I would still recommend this product!
