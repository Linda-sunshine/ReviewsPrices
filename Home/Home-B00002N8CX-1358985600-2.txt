review/summary: We love the Mighty Mite vacuumreview/text: Our Mighty Mite was purchased as a replacement for our old Eureka Boss vacuum, which served us faithfully for many years until it wore out. The new one is also light weight, has similar attachments, and works with much more power than the old one. It's good for both bare floors and carpet (safe for Orientals), and is easy to manipulate and carry to clean stairs. We are very happy with it and expect it will be as sturdy as the old one.
