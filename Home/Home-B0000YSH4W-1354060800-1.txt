review/summary: Good book, terrible audiobookreview/text: This book was interesting and enjoyable but the audio production was terrible. Don't listen to it; read it instead. First off, they used cheesy music on and off throughout the book, probably to make it dramatic or suspenseful but all it did was detract from the seriousness of the book. Also, the reader did not say the chapter numbers so moving back and forth between the audio and print book was very difficult. I think the chapter breaks were identified by the cheesy music. The reader was OK but not great. All this put together did not make for an enjoyable listening experience. The book is easy to read and rather predictable for a well-read adult, but this did not detract from the story and my ability to enjoy it.
