review/summary: Super quiet humidifierreview/text: After suffering for 2 winters with my daughter's super loud Graco humidifier, I finally broke down and bought her a new one. After reading Consumer Reports, I chose Crane. It arrived today and we are immediately pleased with it. It is so quiet my husband didn't even know it was on when he went into her room to read her bedtime stories. Her old one was so loud that she refused to go to bed with it on and I would sneak into her room to turn it on after she was asleep. This one gives out a good amount of cool mist which is adjustable, is super quiet and has an auto shut off and is super cute - all for a reasonable price! I also have two Vicks humidifiers (purchased over the years from Walmart) and both cost the same, are much louder and don't have an auto shut off - so this is far better value for the money. I am going to replace them with Cranes!
