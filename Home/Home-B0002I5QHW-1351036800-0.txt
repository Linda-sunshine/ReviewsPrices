review/summary: Poor Performancereview/text: I wanted to make my grandmother's pepper relish, but I hate using a food processor as it just doesn't produce the same quality of pieces that I grew up with when we made it with an old metal meat grinder. So I thought maybe this would do it. Nope. It couldn't handle the slices of sweet bell peppers, let alone the onions or cabbage. Maybe it is terrific for meat or pasta, but not for much else. And yes, I made darned sure the blades and plates were all in facing the correct direction. The nice thing about this item is that it backs into it's own tray, making it easy to store. But I don't have room to store something I can't use, so this was a return for me.
