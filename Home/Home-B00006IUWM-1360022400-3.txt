review/summary: WOWSER!review/text: Pure, plain, and simple it works! It works really well. I busted out a drawer full of knives and had them sharpened to perfection in about 30 - 45 minutes. Knives I barely used any more because they were so dull have been re-honed to their nearly new sharpness. If you are considering purchasing a new knife set (like I was) because your knives just aren't sharp enough to get their kitchen tasks done this is a much cheaper and longer lasting option.
