review/summary: Great product, shipped with metal knob with no defectsreview/text: The Lodge 3-Quart Dutch Oven arrived with no defects. It appears that new products now ship with the metal knob as others have stated. The ENTIRE pot is glassed, so there is no place that I can see where it can rust as older reviews have stated. We have used it once thus far, and clean-up was very easy. In my opinion, the reason why a few people have had issues is that they are overheating these pots. These pots are glassed cast iron, and cast iron does a great job of evenly distributing the heat. You don't need high heat. The instructions clearly state that you should only use low to moderate heat. We had no issues, and we don't expect any future issues as long as we follow the manufacturer's instructions. It's a great dutch oven.As for the Lodge 7.5 Quart dutch oven, the cover arrived chipped, and I'm not surprised. It is extremely heavy, and frankly, the manufacturer's packaging is painfully inadequate, in my opinion. That is why it arrived damaged. It is such a heavy dutch oven, that my wife had great difficulty lifting it. In my opinion, if a person needs such a large dutch oven, their interests may be better served with a lighter weight alternative, such as a Calaphon stainless steel dutch oven.Finally, we also ordered the Lodge Skillet, which is glassed cast iron. We are very happy with this well-designed product. It cooks a wonderful frittata! The black, glassed, inner surface is rough -- like course sand paper. The food sticks to the surface, so clean-up in not as easy as smooth glass or anti-stick cookware. However, we found if we put soapy water in the dirty skillet, and gently heat it, it is relatively easy to scrape it clean with a silicone or plastic utensil. While it is harder to clean up this skillet, we noticed a huge difference in how smooth and silky frittatas come out, so it is a trade-off we are willing to accept.
