review/summary: Fantasticreview/text: I have a somewhat shallow bathtub, which was great when our children were little. I could never take a soaking bath in it until I got this gizmo. I have also used it to fill the tub with emergency water during a pending power outage. I just put tape over the overflow hole and place it over the drain to prevent the water from leaking out. The tub stays full.
