review/summary: 2nd One!!!review/text: These teapots are fantastic! This is our second one as we used the first one so much that I wanted to replace it with a new one. We use our teapot everyday because I love to have a fresh cup of tea after I make it home from work! This teapot works like a charm and easy to clean as the strainer is removable. This helps to make sure you get all the loose leaf tea is cleaned from the pot. Very good investment!
