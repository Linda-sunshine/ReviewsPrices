review/summary: Perfect for the jobreview/text: I have two dogs, a cat, and two toddlers, in a two story house with carpeted stairs. I originally ordered this for the stairs because I was tired of dragging the old vacuum up and down them. Its great for all those little messes that go with having a young family. Powerful suction for a little thing. It's easy to empty. I ordered the extra filter so when I clean and dry the one that came with it I can still use it. Couldn't be happier with the purchase.
