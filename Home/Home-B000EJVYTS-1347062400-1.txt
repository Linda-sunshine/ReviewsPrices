review/summary: It Looks sturdy on the picture but really is not!!review/text: This garbage can is not as durable than I thought. I had one purchase from costco and it's alot cheaper than this one and it lasted for four years. Still works but kind a want a new one. After doing my research I found this garbage can with a good rating and thouht give it a try. But very disappointed. The garbage can material is so cheap. The sensor does not work all the time. I have to turn on and off the switch all the time and it's really annoying. Overall this garbage can it not worth it!!!
