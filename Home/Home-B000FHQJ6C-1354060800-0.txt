review/summary: Exceeded my expectations!review/text: I got my juicer on Monday and have used it several times I already. I am very impressed with it so far. I've been thinking about juicing for about a year but I can't afford one of the really nice machines. The other reviews for this one said it was good for beginners and I agree! Very easy to put together and take apart. I clean it right after I use it and everything just rinses off. You have to apply a little effort to make sure you get all the pulp out of the filter basket but there was a little brush included for that. The machine is a tiny bit loud so you wouldn't want to use it if someone in the house is sleeping. Overall, I am more than pleased and I really consider this a good purchase.**UPDATE** 1/10/2013Just wanted to say that my juicer is still working great and I love it. The one negative I have come across is that juice sometimes get under the assembly piece that holds the actual blades and it's really hard to get it cleaned up. It's on the base so you can't put it in water and you need little fingers to get a rag in there to clean it.Other than, the machine is still in good shape, still working great and producing good juice. I want to also add that I always peel citrus fruit and cut the seeds out of the apples even though it says you don't have to. I usually put some of the pulp back into the juice and this keeps it from being too bitter.
