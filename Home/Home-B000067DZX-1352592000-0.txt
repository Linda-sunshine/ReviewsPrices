review/summary: Water Filtersreview/text: I have had pretty good luck with this product in the past but the order before this one, 3 out of the 4 filters only worked about 3 to 4 times. The charchol filler kept running out and much was in the box when I opened it.When I held it up to the light, it was only half full on three of the filters. I was very disappointed with this performance as I said,I have had pretty good luck with this product before. If this latest batch of (4) does the same thing , I will consider a different brand filter. It's a lot of money to spend on a filter that only lasts less than HALF the time it is suposed to.I guess I would not recomend it unless things improve.I also feel some sort of compensation would be due under the circumstances.Sincerely,James D. Mack
