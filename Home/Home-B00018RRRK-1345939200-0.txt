review/summary: Cuisinart burr grinderreview/text: I've had this burr grinder for years and like it much better than my previous grinder.Cons:It is difficult to clean. I've spent hours digging old grinds out of the mechanisms. It cannot be taken apart to clean the burr.It is loud.The 'timer' is not accurate for coffee measure.The high speed of the grinder can heat the oils in the beans and leave a burnt or bitter taste.My next grinder will be a high quality (ceramic) manual grinder.
