review/summary: Great Productreview/text: We love popcorn and this is a perfect popper if your follow the directions. Medium heat, lightly oiled, keep stirring. Comes out perfect every time. We use Orville's, popcorn comes out light and fluffy and you just swipe with a papertowel to clean. Highly recommend.
