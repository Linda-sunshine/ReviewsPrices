review/summary: Great on carpets!! Be careful on wood floorsreview/text: I purchased this product to replace the Hoover Floormate that I had for several years. I figured a carpet and hardwood floor cleaner together would be an awesome bonus.I loved it for the carpet. It is well designed and easy to use.I purchased the attachment for hardwood floors which is useless unless you want to use it to protect the floors during transport. The attachment lifts it up off the floor a bit too much decreasing its ability to suck up the water.It will scratch wood floors without the attachment, but if you are careful and make sure the floors are free of dirt and sand and don't mind small scratches ( I have dogs so my floor is covered with scratches) it actually cleans better than the Floormate.
