review/summary: Presto doesn't disappoint :-)review/text: Just got this today and what I don't understand is how the price changes almost by the hour(?). I remember initially ordering it for $27, but initial credit card used was declined. But, it worked out since when I re-ordered the price was just 19.88 with free shipping!Any rate, just tried this out today with popcorn purchased from a local grocery store and it is great as many reviewers have stated. It literally just wasted probably 5 unpopped kennels, that's it. Thanks Presto! Tomorrow is going to be a festive movie night!
