review/summary: Great Juicer for Leafy Greens!review/text: I've owned this juicer for about a year. It is the best juicer I've ever had for juicing leafy greens. And green juices are where it's at!There is no such thing as the perfect juicer for ALL juicing jobs. And don't listen to anyone who says there is! I own an inexpensive citrus juicer. A centrifugal juicer for soft fruits such as melons. And I have this one for juicing my leafy greens. It juices all your greens, herbs, wheat grass ... so efficiently.However, this baby also juices apples, pears, beets, carrots, ginger, peppers, cucumber, celery, and fennel (anything firm) like a champ.The chute is a little smaller in diameter than some other juicers, so I have to cut apples, pears, cucumbers, and beets into more narrow pieces to get them down the chute. But it's a small price to pay for the EASY CLEANUP. I can't tell you how easy this baby is to clean! It comes with a heavy duty 'toothbrush' looking tool that is used to scrub the small screen clean in a flash.Using this juicer makes me want to juice! The slower, masticating design gives a higher juice yield. And the super easy clean up is worth mentioning again. It comes with everything you need including 2 nice size containers to catch the juice (with another screen which screens out any foam which is a nominal amount) and the dry pulp. Tip: put a produce bag in the pulp container for an even easier clean up. And what you're left with is no foam juice. (My containers are not made of cheap materials. I don't put them in the dishwasher. I wash them by hand immediately after juicing and I've never had a problem.)I've also used the blank side to make 'ice cream' using frozen bananas and strawberries. Yum! You can also make nut butters, but I'm losing weight and nut butter aren't currently on my diet plan. Can't wait until they are!Super smart design. The 15 year warranty on this baby, for the price? You can't beat it.
