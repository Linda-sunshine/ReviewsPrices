review/summary: Best Grinder EVER!review/text: Hi everybody!I bought this particular Krups coffee grinder mainly because my mom has one that is coming up on 20 years old. As the saying goes, "they just don't make em like they used to." Or do they? The answer is YES. Side by side comparison of the 20 year old white Krups, and my brand new black Krups revealed almost no difference. They are identical. You know what that means to me? It means the company knows they make a great product that lasts for years, so why change it? All I can say is I wish Krups made cars.So, about the grinder... It is very simple and straightforward. A powerful machine with one purpose: to pulverize anything you put in it. I mainly use mine for coffee, but I also use it for spices occasionally. Normally I hand grind all my spices in a mortar and pestle. I have even used it to grind my home grown dry chili peppers to put in a shaker. It works beautifully! The only problem with that is cleaning, but its not fair to fault the machine for that. After all, it was meant for coffee beans. It does take a bit of work to clean it without damaging it. You can't exactly put it in the dishwasher. I used a dry toothbrush and toothpicks to pick out all the spicy mess. I assume I got it all out since I don't taste any chili pepper in my coffee. Heck, for 20 bucks, its worth buying a second one just for spices!This is a great grinder! It is well built and very powerful! There is no doubt in my mind that this one will last 20+ years just like my moms!
