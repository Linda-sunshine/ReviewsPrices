review/summary: The only way to make coffeereview/text: After visiting Italy and trying, for the first time, coffee made from a moka pot / percolator, I can no longer enjoy American coffee. Even the strongest beans used in a drip filter results in a watery beverage that I no longer care to drink. With the moka pot, the small serving size brings our a truly robust and more well-rounded coffee that is great for cappuccino, or just to sip (rather than gulp).Overall, it was very easy to transition to the percolator style coffee, but impossible to go back to drip coffee. Wish I knew about percolators years ago.
