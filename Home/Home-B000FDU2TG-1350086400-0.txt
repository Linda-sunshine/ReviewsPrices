review/summary: Best blender under Vita Mixreview/text: I wasn't sure about paying $100 for a blender, however, as soon as it showed up and we plugged it in, I realized this was an excellent high quality blender. I began trying to blend things that my old blender just would not do. The KSB560 did the job easily. We are very happy with this blender.
