review/summary: Don't waste your money.review/text: Tovolo Perfect Cube Ice Tray, Set of 2, Dark BlueI bought these trays because I was sick of the ones that came with my refrigerator breaking up all the ice cubes into pieces when you tried to take them out.I wish I would have read some of these comments.I agree....they are....1. too hard to get out...they come out in nice squares but your fingers are numb from trying to pop them out.2. no matter how many times you use them, or wash them...I seem to keep getting powdery white stuff on them where they come in contact with the plastic.3. Yes...mine to are giving the ice water a weird flavor...I think it is that powdery stuff...cuz when I put the ice in the glass and run water over the cubes a few times and pour it out...the powdery goes away and there is no bad taste.I just went to Walmart and bought some 1.97 each...Rubbermade ice trays...hope they are better.
