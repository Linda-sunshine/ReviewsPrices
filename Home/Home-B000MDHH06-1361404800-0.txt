review/summary: My first juicer, a good value and easy to use & clean. Also comment on how to juicereview/text: This is my first juicer. I chose this Breville because of the 1500+ purchases here on Amazon. I wanted a juicer that was reasonably priced and easy to use and clean. It does everything that Breville claims and in the reviews I read.One of the things I was not sure about was the chunks of fruits and vegetables that were left in the receptable after making juice. I found a picture by googling the juicer I bought. There was a comparable amount of chunks in the picture as was left in mine. Does that sentence make sense? My juicer vs the picture of the juicer I bought = same amount of chunks more or less.It is large, but not compared to a Jack Lalaine. My son gave me his old Jack. OMG - I would never juice if it was the only one I had. There are so many parts to clean and assemble before you can start your juicing. It takes up a lot of counter space.One comment that doesn't have anything to do with the Breville itself, is how to select fruits and vegetables for your juicing. I recommend getting a book. The first juice I made was with kale and apple. It tasted ok, but it caused an oral allergic reaction. The next green drink I made was with spinach and apple. I had another oral allergic reaction. I have been developing allergies to food this past year - so, I wrote those off my list of green veggies. I was a bit bothered that I couldn't use kale or spinach, because I really wanted green juice; so I googled and found that for first time juicers it is not recommended that you start with that type of green veggie. It is recommended that you start with vegetables like carrots and cucumbers. And when you do start using kale and spinach and the like you should start with 1/4 cup. The lesson I learned is there is a science to doing good juicing. I am buying the juice bible book.
