review/summary: Broke after 6 monthsreview/text: This was a great cookie scoop. I had the small and used it to make my small cookies (rather than massive cookies that you can buy at a bakery). I was using it in some chilled cookie dough when the mechanism came off the track. My husband fixed it while I did the rest of the cookies by hand. When I tried it again later, it came off the track again. My husband fixed it again. It broke again. We gave up and threw it in the trash. We weren't using it in anything thicker/colder than ice cream, so it shouldn't have broken so easily.
