review/summary: Very well madereview/text: Every OXO product that I own is extremely well made and yet functional and easy to use. You wouldn't think that spending nearly $20 on a can opener would make a difference, but it really does. This is ergonomically designed and opens cans in a breeze. Highly recommended.
