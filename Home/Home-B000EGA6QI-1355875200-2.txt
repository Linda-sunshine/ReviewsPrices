review/summary: Best I've Ever Owned!review/text: The best immersion blender I've ever owned! The best I've ever used!Well, it's the only one I've ever used. But it's the only one I'll ever need. The unit is small, compact, very well put together, has a powerful and quiet motor, and is super-easy to clean. Unless it's overly gunked up, I clean this baby by putting a drop of Ivory in a jar, filling with hot water, and then ... well ... immersion blending the soap.Great little product, stores in very little space!
