review/summary: Works as a good weight not a good hat.review/text: I bought this because I thought I was gonna make some cornbread... It's still under my stove unused. It's really heavy (which I knew) so I'm to lazy to get it out and just cook with my lighter aluminum stuff. I sort of wish I didn't buy it now but I don't mind it being in the drawer.
