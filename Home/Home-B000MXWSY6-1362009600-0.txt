review/summary: Lots of features. Simple. Excellent!review/text: I am not a morning person. Overly annoying alarm clocks also don't last long for me. With all that said, I am very pleased with this purchase. The clock wasn't expensive and seems to be loaded with features.Things I really like:-2 separate alarms/time settings. Can set both or either to radio or buzzer.-The buzzer can be really loud if you want, but it isn't a disgusting noise. The buzz/alarm tone is just different enough to wake you up but not completely obnoxious like some of my previous clocks.- It has three brightness settings. I love this feature since it allows for minimizing the amount of light in the room if you'd like.-The snooze let's you quickly choose how long you'd like to snooze. (Pressing the snooze button sets the snooze from 10-60 minutes. Very cool!)-It came with a battery and the clock was already set.-It has a daylight savings time auto-adjust button.-It's easy to read but not a huge, space-hogging clock.Things that made me go, &#34;Meh.&#34; (But aren't bad enough to warrant losing a star.)-The radio isn't all that great. Typical cheap tuner adjustment that will eventually allow you to find the station you were looking for, but only after you sort through all the ones you weren't at great length.-The volume adjustment is similarly finicky.-You're going to need a special little phillips screwdriver to change the battery.-It's not built like a tank. I'd say one or two times against the wall and this thing will be in pieces.So, not too many negatives, especially at this price point. I like it!
