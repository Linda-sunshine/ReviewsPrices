review/summary: Good little Vacumnreview/text: This is a small, lightweight vacumn cleaner. I ordered it as I have mostly bare floors in my home with a couple larger area rugs. It does a good job on the rugs, does so so on bare floors, but I don't think it is designed for that. The exhaust is on the front of the vacumn, but I've had no problem with that. My only complaint is the hose is shorter than I would like. I have to pick up the vacumn to reach ceiling fans, high shelves, etc. It's more inconvenient than anything, The vacumn is light so it's not hard to pick up and use. I ordered extra belts and filters when I purchased it, but haven't needed them yet. I have had this for about 3 months and would recommend it for smaller vacumn jobs.
