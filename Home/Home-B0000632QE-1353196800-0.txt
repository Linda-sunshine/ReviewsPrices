review/summary: Just awesome!review/text: I'm not a big fan of cooking because I work so much and have so little time at the end of a work day. Slicing and chopping to make a homemade meal takes so much time. This tool is every bit the quality it boasts and makes slicing, chopping, making julien veggies so very easy and fast! This mandoline is SHARP. Do not disregard the warning and DO always use the food guard. I've had this for about 2 months and I'm so happy with the purchase.
