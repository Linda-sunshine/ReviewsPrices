review/summary: A great juicer at a great price!review/text: Before I made my decision on which juicer to buy I did my research. I read as many reviews and information on what to look for in a juicer, and how different juicers perform. The Omega J8005 definately worked for me. The masticating juicers give you better quality juice, with more nutrition. So do your math when you buy a juicer, there are many out there and they do put out juice but not the amount and quality so take your time and check out the Omega juicers....
