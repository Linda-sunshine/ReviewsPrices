review/summary: Great Sheet Set!review/text: I bought the Pinzon Flannel Sheet Set based on reviews. I am completely satisfied with my purchase. Great quality, the sheets fit my mattress perfectly, and they are super comfortable. Another satisfied customer! By the way, the first time I washed and dried them there was minimal lint in the dryer...some other customers were complaining about excessive lint. Not with my set.
