review/summary: An excellent cup of coffeereview/text: Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew replaces a Bunn Coffeemaker that broke. The plastic screw receptacles holding the brewing bowl gave way allowing the bowl to drop onto the container. I especially, appreciate the additional features of automatic brew and automatic shutoff of the warming base. The container pours especially well. I also appreciate having the ability to pour from a partially completed brewing cycle. Set it for early morning and awaken to the aroma of a freshly brewed "pot" to start your new day. An excellent product with full features awaits your purchase. I am completely pleased with purchase from Amazon at a very competitive price with no shipping and no sales tax.
