review/summary: i use these dailyreview/text: They are awesome for pretty much everything.I cut up cucumbers and peppers and store those in one, and use another smaller one for the hummus.They are way better than those plastic ones you can get at the grocery store.Those always seem like a good idea at the time, you know!These clean up well, and the lids are not too terribly difficult to put on.
