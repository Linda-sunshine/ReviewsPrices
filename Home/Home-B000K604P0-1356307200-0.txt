review/summary: Use for coffee everydayreview/text: Have been using this product for 3 weeks now.Beautiful, sleek, modern color. Easy open, use, clean.Does not fit under the Keurig. (I use a separate mug to brew into, and then transfer into this thermos.I read the top hinge give up after awhile. So far so good in week 3!I am happy with this product.
