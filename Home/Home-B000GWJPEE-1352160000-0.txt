review/summary: Works great. This is the second I purchase.review/text: I had the cow for years and now the frog. Very well built. No reason at all to buy anything more expensive than this. This does what is suppose to do and does it very well. A full 1 gallon will last you all night and morning. Like EVERY single humidifier you need to clean it every 3-4 weeks. If you don't clean this humidifier or any other humidifier you buy you will risk getting sick. Humidifiers are great but like everything else "If used properly" My wife have no kids but we find it fun so don't let the kiddy look discourage you, this thing works great like the big boys.
