review/summary: Great Ideareview/text: This is a really great idea. It's a little hard to get it to stay stuck on the tub because of the curve there, but once you've got it on there, it stays. It doesn't completely stop the water from draining but it does slow it down significantly. I figure once it's drained down far enough it's time for more hot water anyway. Overall this item does what it says it will do.
