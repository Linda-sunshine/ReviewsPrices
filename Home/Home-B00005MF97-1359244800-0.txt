review/summary: VROOOMreview/text: I love me some Scotch Bonnets but I have never had the skill to dice them like they do on the Food Network. In comes the BD Food Chopper! Amazing little product that perfectly chops my peppers, vegetables, even apple chunks! It's small so it can easily be stored in the cabinet when not in use and it is very easy to clean. If you're trying to lose weight this will make an excellent salad. The cost, efficiency, and build of these little beast makes it one of my favorite food choppers.
