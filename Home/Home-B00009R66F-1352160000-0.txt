review/summary: Very easyreview/text: This cleaner is sturdy, but not too heavy. It cleans well, my carpets were heavily stained after my 3 year old's birthday party so we purchased this cleaner and its really done the trick. The extensions work really well too on chairs. I plan on using this 2x a month and it wont be hard to do.
