review/summary: Keurig B40 Elite Brewing Systemreview/text: This coffee rocks! It is so damn good and I cannot explain how they do it! the only difference between the models is based on how much water it holds! I only wish Keurig made a coffee maker that made a pot at a time. The seller shipped it out fast too. My guess is they are heavily caffeinated but I cannot prove it!
