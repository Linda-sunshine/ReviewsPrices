review/summary: heats water fastreview/text: heats water extremely fast..i drink atleast 2-4 cups of tea at work everyday and hate to put water in the microwave, so i purchased this kettle. like previous reviews stated after one or two uses i noticed water spots at the bottom of the kettle which doesnt really pose any alarm to me. also it does come with a little filter thing at the water spout which i feel is unnecessary for me because i boil bottle water anyway but its always good to have, and once its removed its kind of difficult to put back in. good purchase tho
