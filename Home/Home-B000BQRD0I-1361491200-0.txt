review/summary: Decent at first, but hose soon broke off and then steamer just stopped working.review/text: It's a cheap plastic steamer that does an okay job, until ultimately the hose breaks off and the steamer just stops working as other reviewers here have said. You get what you pay for, I guess, but I didn't expect for this thing to crap out in less than a year. The steamer also began to leak, drip, and spit out water toward the end of its short life.
