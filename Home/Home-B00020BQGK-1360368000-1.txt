review/summary: 2nd time Flair no goreview/text: Here it is 10 days after the warranty expiration and the same problem as with the first Flair. The brush does not turn. We took the first Flair to a designated repair shop, and the mechanic could not determine nor fix it. Not a lemon. The second Flair has the same problem as the first. The repair-man strongly suggested buying a different brand.
