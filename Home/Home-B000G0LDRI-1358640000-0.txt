review/summary: Works wonderfully. Has a problem with mold.review/text: The product does exactly what it should and regulates the humidity nicely. It is a bit loud for our small home (1100 sq ft) but does a good job on medium fan speed to keep the noise down.Let me make something clear, I don't write reviews. I usually feel that enough people have commented on a product and that I would just be wasting people;s time adding to the pile of opinions. This however is not an opinion this is a cold hard fact.The filters on a good day are $24 and the protec antimicrobial two packs are $12. The following link is to a picture of the black colored mold that has appeared after less than 30 days of use as I just checked my Amazon order history. This is on the name brand hc-14 filter and is in my living room not in some basement in the corner. I have had the unit now for 2 seasons and bleach the unit every season and have always had this issue. I have tried third party filters (wicks) and continue to have the same problems. The unit is now going directly into the trash can after $250 for the unit, parts, and maintenance. Save yourself the money and buy a non wick type like I am tonight.I apologize if the image doesn't work as I don't know how to upload the images to amazon.[...]
