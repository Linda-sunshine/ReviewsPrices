review/summary: You get what you pay for but $150 isn't what you're payingreview/text: No way are these $150 sheets reduced to $59.99. These are $59.99 sheets, without a doubt. And, since Pinzon is Amazon's own line of sheets and you can't buy them anywhere else, I think that the $150 "list price" is false advertising. As $59.99 queen-size sheets, they are what you expect. I washed them with detergent and fabric softener before I put them on the bed. They are tough sheets in all senses of the word. They will probably wear well but they feel "tough." These are not the sheets you would buy for the Princess who could feel a pea under many layers of mattress. It may be, and I hope, that these sheets will soften up with wear and washing and I'm not going to buy another set right now. But, as the title of this review indicates, I got what I paid for. Next time, I'll pay more for better smoother softer sheets.
