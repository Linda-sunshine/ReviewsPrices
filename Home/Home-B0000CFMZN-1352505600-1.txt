review/summary: Pryrex GLASS measureing cupreview/text: I am an amateur cook, so I love to watch a lot of cooking programs. One of my favorites, whom I subscibed to is America's Test Kitchen, or Cooks Country. In one of their espisodes they were testing measuring cups because Pyrex is phasing out of their "traditional" glass bowls and using plastic. The test kitchen said they were phasing out of the GLASS measuring cups and going to the plastic which is grossly inferior. So I ordered both the 1 qt. and 2 cup size and probably will order a couple more. So if you like these, you'd better order them now, because when they're gone, they aren't making any more. Perfect tool for the do it yourself cook, like I am. Wouldn't be without them. Oh, the reason I'm getting them....we broke our others over the years...lots of years of use and abuse.
