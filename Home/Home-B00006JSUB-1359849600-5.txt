review/summary: 1200+ like minds agree, this is a great skilletreview/text: I've been converting to cast iron cookware this year and this was my first purchase along that path. After reading many other reviews I didn't have much expectation of the pre-seasoning and after having the product in hand I decided quickly to start the seasoning from scratch. I've used cast iron before so I was surprised to see the pre-seasoning remove as easily as it did with hot running tap water and rough scrubby pad, no matter though, the intent was to remove it. Since then and with heavy use the seasoning has been building up very nicely and the cooking experience has been exactly as was expected. It's awesome to go straight from having cooked a full meal in here to throwing in water, baking powder and flour to stir up an awesome gravy right after. Sure this could be done in any pan you cook in but it's just so much more satisfying done in a cast iron skillet.
