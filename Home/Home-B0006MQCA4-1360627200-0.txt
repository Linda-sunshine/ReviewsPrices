review/summary: Am I ever glad I purchased this!review/text: My son is going to college downtown Chicago, and wasn't drinking the water because it tasted so bad. After doing research on filter systems, I came across this one and decided to give it a try and have it sent to him. Am I ever glad I did!! He keeps this dispenser in his mini frig (it fits great by the way!) and says he can't stop drinking...it's that good! Highly recommend! I'll buy one for my daughter when she goes to college next year. Thanks Amazon for yet another good product delivered right on time.
