review/summary: Took the plungereview/text: I read a lot of reviews on this product and wasn't sure I should spend this kind of money on a coffee pot. I am glad I did. I never drink a pot of coffee so getting my coffee a cup at a time works for me. The coffee is hot and I don't waste any. The K cups are expensive but you can get the K cup refillable to reduce your per cup cost.
