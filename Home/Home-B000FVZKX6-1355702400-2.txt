review/summary: FINALLY SHEETS THAT FIT!review/text: Hello Fellow Shoppers,In my linen closet I have so many sets of sheets for my California King-sized bed that "once upon a time" fit my bed. But slowly and surely they all shrunk. It wasn't I received Pinzon sheets as a Christmas gift 2 years ago that I realized these are the ONLY sheets that don't shrink and still fit the bed perfectly to this day. So, after a 2 year test, I ordered more last month and I'm buying even another set.Keep in mind I have bought only high-priced sheets. High thread count. Snooty brand names. They all shrunk.(Full disclosure :) - except for one pair made for the brand name Laura Ashley that lasted for years.)So, I am a Pinzon fan for comfy, quality sheets, that don't shrink.I hope this helps. :)
