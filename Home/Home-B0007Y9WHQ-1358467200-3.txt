review/summary: Fantasticreview/text: This product is fantastic, works great, so easy to clean, amazing, ad it sucks to by counter so well I have to slide it to the edge of the counter get it off, there is noway for me to pull it straight off the counter, and it is plastic but still feels very good, clean up is a breeze, also I used a very big, very hard beet that I could not cut by hand, man this thing made perfect spaggetti out of it with some minor maneuvering. If this breaks will order again.
