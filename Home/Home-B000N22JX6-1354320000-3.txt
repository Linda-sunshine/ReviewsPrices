review/summary: Pretty good little heater...review/text: I've tried and returned and kept several different heaters. I ordered this heater based on the excellent reviews and at first I wasn't super happy. I found that when I placed it on the floor about 4 feet away from where I sit and work, the air felt cool by the time it reached me and like it was blowing cool air at me...not good! But before I condemned it, I gave it another test or two. I have a tower Holmes heater that I love...and when placed in our large master bedroom, it brings the temperature up around 5 or 6 degrees in a one hour time period on a fairly cold day. I took this little heater upstairs and gave it the master bedroom test...and surprisingly, it accomplished the same feat and it heats our medium-sized office in no time! We've decided to keep it and because of it's nice look, its job is to keep me cozy warm while I'm busy in the kitchen.
