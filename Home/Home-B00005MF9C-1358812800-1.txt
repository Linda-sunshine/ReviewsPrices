review/summary: brew'n goreview/text: I bought this again, the current one is still in good working order, but I was afraid that if it broke down I wouldn't be able to replace it, so I bought, just in case. Saved a lot of money thru the years, can't believe people are wasting money on these expensive K-cups, wasteful .
