review/summary: Lives on my bar.review/text: Pro's: holds much more water than the pitchers. Taste is great. Filter easy to change, and sold on line and at K Mart.Cons: Takes up too much space for my fridge.Super glad I purchased it.Only problem, the first one they sent me was cracked, so I had to mail it back and wait for them to get it, and then mail a new one in return. Entire thing took me approx 3 weeks. Later I found it was sold in the K Mart in my town, and for only a few cents more. So to summarize, I love the product, but this was a case where the internet was not more convenient.
