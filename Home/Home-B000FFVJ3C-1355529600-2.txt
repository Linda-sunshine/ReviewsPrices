review/summary: Jerky at it's bestreview/text: This unit works great. I have done about 5 lbs so far and all has turned out great. I did cut back on the cure as using it all makes it to salty. The unit is quiet and easy to clean. I put trays in hot soapy water to soak then brush clean. The drip pan is nice also.
