review/summary: Listen to reviews, after 8 months they rust.review/text: These knifes were good for eight months, but they are starting to rust. I would recommend dishing out a bit more money for a higher quality set, unless your in a bind like us. Make sure you want knifes with blades displayed. We wanted something with a smooth flat blade, similar to a butcher knife for poultry cuts.
