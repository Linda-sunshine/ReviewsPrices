review/summary: Efficient, but lots of plastic and moving parts.review/text: I hate moving parts. I like safety, I like ease of use, I like the way all the parts fit together oh-so-nicely, but the more points of contact between moving parts, the more possibility of breakage or jamming. Takes about 3 uses to fully comprehend the machine. Quite powerful, and very versatile even with the few cutting discs and blades included.
