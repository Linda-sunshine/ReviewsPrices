review/summary: Great Travel containerreview/text: I searched for a week on the Internet looking for a good thermos to hold my coffee and keep it hot for a while. It takes me a while to work through a cup or more of coffee and every travel container I tried from the stores either leaked, blew its top when I shook it or the coffee was cold in an hour. I read a lot of reviews on different sites about this container and finally decided to buy it.I was NOT disappointed. This is a great travel cup and a regular cup. The only thing you have to be careful of is to not fill the cup above the bottom line where it narrows. If you fill above that line the container will leak. I fill the thermos with coffee, add my cream and sugar and give it a good shake to mix everything together. This is the first cup that has not spewed coffee all over me when doing this. I release any pressure and go off for my day.I've dropped it and it has not opened. It is easy to clean. You have to clean under the lid as this can get gunky, but it easy to do with a green scrub pad with some baking soda on it.Buy it, you will not be disappointed. It is a great travel container.
