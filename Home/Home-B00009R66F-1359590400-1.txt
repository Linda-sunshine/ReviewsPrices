review/summary: Great steam cleanerreview/text: I almost didn't buy this steam cleaner after reading some of the negative reviews but I gave ti a shot. Set up was easy, the cleaner is easy to use and cleaned my filthy cream color carpets about as well as a professional service would. My carpets are 20 years old and look like new. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this unit cleans. Unlike others, I had absolutely no problem with set up or leaks. The two tank system works great. It's easy to remove and fill the solution tank and super easy to remove, empty and clean the receiving tank. Some people complain about breakage. The unit is all plastic but seems durable. I used it only once to clean my whole house, then stored it away in the closet. It appears to be very sturdy and should last a long time if you take care of it. This is a great product for the price. I also purchased the Hoover cleaning solution and Zep Oxy Clean (sold in Home Depot) as a pre-spotter. I'm impressed with the results.
