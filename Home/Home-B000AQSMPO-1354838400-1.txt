review/summary: Easy, but expensive and weak coffeereview/text: Very nice to have around, super easy to use! I did not have good luck with the reusable filter because it leaked. The K cups have decent flavor, but get expensive rather quickly. The biggest gripe I have is the coffee is just too weak, it defeats the point to have to use 2 k cups for a decent cup of coffee. If you like your coffee weak and don't mind the expense of the K cups, go for it.
