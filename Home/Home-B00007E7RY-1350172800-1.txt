review/summary: A classic with a disturbing upgrade.review/text: This Honeywell Round Air Purifier has been around for years. As many have noted the sound can be rather loud. But I enjoy 'white noise' while I sleep so that is not an issue for me. What is an issue is the light on the control panel.I guess that Honeywell wanted to look "contemporary" so they put this way too bright light in the control panel. It doesn't make the machine look like a modern computer with LED's. All it does is produce a bright blue glow throughout the room: much like a UFO landing to come and get you.Unfortunately they don't have an on/off switch for it. So I broke the warranty in order to get a good night's sleep by removing the control panel and sniping off the bulb.In spite of that problem the purifier works just as it should - a fine machine.
