review/summary: A Waste of Moneyreview/text: I am terribly disappointed in these sheets. I did read some of the bad reviews, but there were so many good ones, I thought I would take a chance. I wish I had not. These are horrible sheets. The color taupe is just plain ugly. The fabric is stiff, rough and heavy. In addition there is nothing "sateen" about them. There is no sheen or shine at all. I washed them and out of the dryer they looked just disgusting. Trying to give them a fair chance I ironed them. Yes, I spent 40 minutes with a steam iron on linen setting and could not get the wrinkles out. They look bad and feel bad. In addition they are hot and uncomfortable to sleep on. I am not terribly picky about these things, but I cannot understand how anyone could enjoy using these sheets. They are a total waste of money. I might be able to rip them up and use them for cleaning rags, but only for dusting, as they are so stiff they wouldn't absorb water. If you have read the other bad reviews, believe them. Don't throw away your hard earned money on ugly,stiff, wrinkly, heavy and uncomfortable sheets.
