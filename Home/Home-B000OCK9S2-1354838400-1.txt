review/summary: Worst Clock Radio EVER!!!!!review/text: Don't even waste your time buying this.....matter of fact you don't even need to read this. Absolutely the worst clock radio I have ever had. Little 1-4 inch travel size clocks work better, look better, and sound better. The sound therapy is atrocious and whoever designed this clock should be banned. The display is troublesome because you have to stare straight into with no variation in angle or height. In the picture it looks to be white but it comes out of the box an old, almost dirty, brownish tint of white. Overall this is just a terrible item and should be taken off of Amazon. Thank you.
