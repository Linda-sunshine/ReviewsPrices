review/summary: Broke after 2nd usereview/text: After reading the reviews, I thought I was buying an inexpensive but good duel speed grinder that was going to serve my purposes for grinding both coffee beans and dry spices. The grinder is powerful, but the construction is poor. The latch, which must connect with the grinder before the machine will turn on, is glued onto the lid. And not very well. My broke after the second use. I now have to go through the hassle of returning/reordering and being w/out coffee while this gets sorted out. I'm trying a Melita grinder next, as this was a waste of time.
