review/summary: Motor burned out after only several usesreview/text: I've had this unit for a couple years but only used it a dozen or so times. Like other reviewers have said, it worked OK at first (noisy and slow and uneven grinds, though), but then one time it ran real slow and then burned out - literally, I even smelled the melting wires. I'm sure I'm out of warranty but I certainly won't be buying another one of these.
