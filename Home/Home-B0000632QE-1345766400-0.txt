review/summary: Very Sharp!review/text: This IS as sharp as everyone says it is! One evening I was in a hurry slicing up cucumbers for a salad and I did not use the guard. Before I knew it, I had sliced off a chunk on the tip of my little finger. If you think it does a great job slicing vegetables you should see what it does with fingers. Just kidding, of course. But it is a very, very good slicer. I am writing mainly as a testament to the fact that you should ALWAYS use the guard with this - or any - mandoline. Please take heed and learn from my careless mistake.
