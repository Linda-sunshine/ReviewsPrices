review/summary: Flimsy Vacuumreview/text: I am less than thrilled with my new vacuum, purchased to replace my 30 yr. old Hoover upright. This vacuum provides a powerful suction on plush carpeting. However, the vacuum is so cheaply made and has design flaws when compared to my original model. The hose design is shorter with a material that is far less flexible. The placement of the electrical cord is very poorly designed; resulting in my "vacuuming" the cord as it got stuck under the rotation teeth on my second day of use. This type of damage never occurred in all the years of vacuuming with my original Hoover upright. Needless to say I am most disappointed with my purchase and realize I should have picked a different model, although this vacuum was well rated in Consumer Reports.
