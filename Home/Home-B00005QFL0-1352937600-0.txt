review/summary: This bread beats anything in this little desert townreview/text: Great, I bought my first Panasonic bread maker in 1990, used constantly, moved and left it behind. (it gave me fatithfull performance for 15 years) Bought this one a few weeks ago and it meets my every need by providing tasty quality loaves of bread.
