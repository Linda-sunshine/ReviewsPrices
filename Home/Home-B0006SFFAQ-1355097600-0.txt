review/summary: Great so far! Replaced a Krupsreview/text: We had a Krups KM Power Brew for 3 years and it started leaking. This Cuisinart wasn't as expensive but so far after 2 weeks everyday use we are very happy with it. The water level reader is easy to read - we don't use the pot to fill the water so no issues there. We like that it came with the gold metal filter but can also use standard #4's when you want. Love the pot, it does drip when pouring like our Krups did, but the we'll have to see how long the lid will remain snug since it snaps on - not hinged. Easy to operate - like the knobs and the on/off toggle. Much quieter than our Krups and the 5 beeps when done is nice - gets quieter by the 5th beep. Also has a &#34;i'm turning&#34; off beep which we like a lot as well.
