review/summary: Worked for one monthreview/text: It worked extremely well for one month, the second month OK, and then the head stopped working. Only used it on the tile floor in the kitchen. The beater bar stopped working and now all it does is pick up by suction. Tried to open the head and see if a belt came off. Nope cant open it without it getting really messed up. Do not buy this product!
