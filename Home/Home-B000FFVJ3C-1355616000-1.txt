review/summary: It's my 1st one so I can't compare to others but I like it.review/text: I think if it had a thermometer I would like it better to make sure the temperature was where it was suppose to be. So far we have made jerky and sweet potatoes for a dog treat (much cheaper than the ones in the dog store and she loves them). I dried some herbs too, that's where I would have needed the thermometer. After a day I checked with a external thermometer and found it was only 86 but was set on 95. Once I got it regulated to 95 the herbs dried fine.
