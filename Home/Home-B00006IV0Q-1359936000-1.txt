review/summary: Makes Excellent Coffeereview/text: Have been using for about a week. Makes great coffee that is really hot. Takes a bit more time than a drip but with much better results. Seems to be well made. Used this to replace a Cuisinart 4 cup drip maker. Brings back the nostalgia of Grandma's coffee.
