review/summary: could be betterreview/text: UPDATE: 12-14-12I LOVE AMAZON! After contacting customer service about my problem and that my grinder broke after only 8 months of use, they shipped me a replacement grinder out. I'm not changing my 2 Star rating for this product but I would give AMAZON 10 STARS, they have the best product inventory/options and the BEST customer service reps anyplace!ORIGINAL REVIEW:I bought this grinder only after reading the majority of the customer reviews and now I wish I would have kept reading and bought a different model/brand. Not only is this grinder too small, it holds approx 1/2 cup of beans, it does not grind the beans fine enough and after only 8 months this grinder died. I am so upset and would not recommend or buy this piece of junk again!
