review/summary: A great replacement for our old one!review/text: Our old air popper's electrical cord had started getting really hot when we used it so we set out to find a new one. First pick struck out giving us popcorn, from a brand new bag, that was chewy. Eww. So when I bought this one I crossed my fingers and hoped. It is a very close second to our old one and a HUGE improvement over the other one. The popcorn is still slightly chewy, our old one gave you 100% crispy-crunchy popcorn, but -way- better then others on the market.I'd happily recommend it to others and would definitely buy it again!
