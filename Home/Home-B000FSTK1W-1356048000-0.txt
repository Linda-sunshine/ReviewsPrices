review/summary: Seriously? This thing is insanereview/text: I wanted something in he shower that wouldn't rust and get all nasty after a few months. I was worried that this would fall off of the wall. Some of my other experiences with 3m have failed miserably. I've been so happy wi this product! I've had it for months and it hasn't budged! It takes a beating too. I wasn't very strategic about the positioning of it (my own fault) and bump my head on this thing ALL of the time. It's still up there...as solid as ever. Would recommend highly!
