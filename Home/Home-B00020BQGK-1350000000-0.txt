review/summary: This is not a whole house vacuum!review/text: I am currently reviewing this class of vacuum to replace a Eureka Boss stick vacuum that lasted 15 years, but it amazes me how may reviews say it will not do their whole house without overheating. I agree, it should not overheat, but it also is not made to replace a $200+ vacuum that will do your whole house (carpets and hard surfaces). Quit complaining about the length of the cord also. Twenty feet of cord is plenty long for touching up individual rooms.
