review/summary: Just what I neededreview/text: When I started playing the guitar last year, one of the big surprises was how sensitive they can be to humidity. SInce I live in the midwest and have a heat pump, the humidity in my house can get very low during the winter. So last year I bought a room humidifier rated for over twice the size of my &#34;music room&#34; (an unfinished bathroom in my basement). It struggled to keep the room at 45% relative humidity even when the filter was fresh and ate a filter per month all winter.After a lot of research, I decided to get this &#34;whole house&#34; model. And am glad I did. We've already had a few very cold snaps where the heat pump ran for a while, and humidity dropped into the 20's upstairs. But the Honeywell HCM-6009 very easily kept my music room between 45-50% humidity with fan at low setting with no problem. It didn't even have to run continuously like my old unit.I personally didn't find the noise a problem - the sound of the forced air heating is louder. Usually I'll get almost two days from the twin tanks before having to refill but in the worst of the winter I expect to make daily refills. And i'm lucky that the tanks fit my kitchen sink perfectly for refills - I don't have to hold them up. Filter life is also much better than my old unit.In a perfect world this unit would have a digital humidity level setting but it only took me a few days to dial in the manual setting to get the 45% relative humidity setting I wanted. I have a plentitude of digital humidity gauges floating around already calibrated. And from what I read in the owners manual, Honeywell has more advanced units that have digital settings. It is a matter of what you are willing to pay for.
