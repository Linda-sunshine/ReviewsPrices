review/summary: It's still alive, barelyreview/text: A day after pulling it out of the box the light stopped working. The paint job on the dials smeared off and now it makes a dreadfull humming sound when you turn it on. I feel like any day now it will just stop working. Didn't even last a year but my daughter loves the darn thing. It is very cute.
