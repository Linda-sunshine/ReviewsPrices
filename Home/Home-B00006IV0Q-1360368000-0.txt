review/summary: HOT COFFEEreview/text: That's why I bought this coffee machine. I like my coffee hot and there is no other machine on the market that I have found that makes good, old fashioned, hot, coffee. I've seen other reviewers say it's a little bit of a pain because it takes longer to brew and having to put a paper filter underneath and over the coffee grounds, but I'm ok with all that because I'm getting exactly what I purchased this for, hot coffee. I've spent alot of money on expensive coffee brewers and I've either stopped using them or taken them back. The ones where the coffee goes into a thermos is the worst. The only cup that ever tastes good is the first one. After that it tastes luke warm and old. I even take this with me when I drive to go on vacation.
