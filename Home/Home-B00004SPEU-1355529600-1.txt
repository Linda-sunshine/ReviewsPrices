review/summary: Grinds beans just like I wanted.review/text: Reasonably priced and works as intended. Another reviewer mentioned that when you yank the top off after grinding fine grounds drop on the counter and he was right, but he was also right that it doesn't matter since the grinder does a great job. I concur.
