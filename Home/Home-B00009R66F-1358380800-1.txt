review/summary: I want to love this machine, but.....review/text: I love this machine, but I have only been able to use it 4x since 2011 since it constantly breaks!The good...it cleans the carpets really well & doesn't leave them very wet at all. I am not so thrilled about the attachment, but it works ok.The bad...my 1st lovely machine only worked one time before it malfunctioned and started spewing water all over the floor (even when off). After calling Hoover, I sent it in to be fixed and they ended up giving me a brand new machine! I was happy until after three times of use, my 2nd machine started doing the same thing...spewing water out of the bottom. Agh!!After calling customer care again they are sending me another new machine (my 3rd). Great customer service, but terrible product!!!
