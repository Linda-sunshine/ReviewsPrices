review/summary: The WORST vacuum I have ever experienced.review/text: Handle swivels back and forth because it's so heavy and out of proportion to the base. Burns my legs as I vacuum. Only will pick up flat things. Dropped a bunch of small dog kibble. Could not pick it up. Has a tiny compartment for collecting dirt. Not for people with pets. Unless you live in a very cold climate (& need your shins warmed) and have virtually clean floors, this is not the vacuum for you.
