review/summary: This is the best bread maker everreview/text: I already owned this bread maker having been introduced to it by my oldest son and his wife. When another son and his wife's bread maker bit the dust, we knew this was the only thing to replace their old one with. We had the delivery the next day and all reports from the family are very positive about the results. It truly makes a great loaf every time. I comes with it's own measuring devices so everything can be accurate. If you buy this machine, you will love it.
