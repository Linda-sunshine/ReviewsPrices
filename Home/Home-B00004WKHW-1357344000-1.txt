review/summary: very nicereview/text: I like it, good size, good processing.I needed a processor with a work bowl that could be esaliy removed from the base and this one is great.It has been very easy to use and clean up and is small enough to just stay on my counter in my small gallery kitchen.The recipies I've used it for are simple, and it is a breeze to manuver the cup after processing.One problem, the lid slipped from my hand and one of the tiny grips broke off, but the activating slide did not breake and so it is still completly functional.
