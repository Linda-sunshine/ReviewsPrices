review/summary: Low noise, good grindreview/text: I bought this to replace my 30 year old Braun that bit the dust. I love it that it grinds with much less noise. I had to live with brewing store bought ground coffee for a week, I am so glad I can grind my own again. The Capresso is so easy to clean and keep in top shape.
