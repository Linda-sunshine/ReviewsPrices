review/summary: Just disappointed....review/text: I am on my 4th Kuerig in 2 years. I LOVE the coffee when it brews, but it is obvious that these machines have a design flaw. For the price of these coffee machines I would expect them to have a much longer life. I am done. My parents and sister have all had the same problems. Theirs all lasted just over a year and out of warranty... Still too short of a lifespan for a $150 coffee brewing system.I will not buy another.Keurig B60 Special Edition Brewing System
