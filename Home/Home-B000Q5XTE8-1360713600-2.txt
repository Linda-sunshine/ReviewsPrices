review/summary: Great chair!review/text: This is a very comfortable, supportive chair with many options to adjust to your particular comfort. It is a very quiet chair, my old chair creeked everytime I moved. The mesh back is different, but I like it. Our office purchased three of these chairs, and everyone loves it, even the employee that has back trouble, it gives her the correct lumbar support.
