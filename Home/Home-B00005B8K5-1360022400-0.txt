review/summary: Missing Lidreview/text: The product is exactly what I wanted, except that I am missing a lid for the small circular pyrex, so it's actually 9 pieces, not 10. I want a replacement, but I don't have a defective part to ship back and I'm guessing sending an empty box wouldn't work. The policy of trying to squeeze everything back into it's professionally done packaging for a missing piece is absurd, time consuming, disappointing and environmentally unfriendly.
