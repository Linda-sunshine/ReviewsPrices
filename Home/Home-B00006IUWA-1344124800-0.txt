review/summary: Excellent product for the price!review/text: I hunted this down because I wanted to make popcorn the healthy way. I hadn't seen one of these since the 1980s. Glad to see they're still being made. I use it almost every night. No butter. Works great.I just wish it had an on/off switch. To turn it on, you plug it in. To turn it off, you unplug it. Small complaint.
