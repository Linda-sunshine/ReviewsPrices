review/summary: NOT as good as I expected.review/text: Came with a VERY limited set of recipeesConsScraper blades are made of plastic and are not really up to the taskThe Pre frozen bowl never seems to get cold enough. CA reccomends 0 degrees - I chill mine down as cold as my freezer gets (Negative Eight) and it still does not freeze the ice cream well.
