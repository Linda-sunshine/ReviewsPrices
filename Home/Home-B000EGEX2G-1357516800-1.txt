review/summary: Looks Are Deceivingreview/text: Chair came with a broken snap and was too much of a hassle to reship back to company, so we kept it for our new infant granddaughter for mommy to rock to sleep at night and comfort. But wouldn't buy another piece like this on line...plus don't we get what we pay for?
