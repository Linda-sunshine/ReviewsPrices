review/summary: Horrible productreview/text: I had owned Brita pitchers for almost 8 years and never had any problem but unfortunately this one is full of flaws. It leaks from the very first day I start using it. Moreover the top cover falls over all the time whenever we try to pour the water in the glass. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
