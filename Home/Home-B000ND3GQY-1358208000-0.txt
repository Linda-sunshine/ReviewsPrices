review/summary: Non-traditional but worksreview/text: After reading mixed reviews on more traditional Woks, decided to give this a try - largely due to price and SS construction. First of all, it's HUGE - easily accommodates cooking for a family. Lid is huge but handy for keeping stir-fry warm. Haven't figured out the best heat for stir frying. Cooking on gas range with med-high flame, it's easy to wind up with stuck food and scorched oil spots on the sides. I'll try it with lower flame as some have suggested. Great tip from several reviewers about Bar Keepers Friend (powder) for removing burnt spots - restores pan to new with almost no effort - awesome stuff that BKF. All in all very pleased. I like cooking with stainless - no patience for pans that can rust as can happen with some of the more traditional woks.
