review/summary: Broken only second time use!!!review/text: Just use the second time and it becomes pretty hard to push, try to follow the manual to fix but can't find any cause. a handy man help to check it then found out there is a broken rubber belt in the machine and we can't get why there is a broken belt??!!! the belt is linked to bottom part of cleaner to make it easy to push, but we can't get why it's broken? Although the one we bought is used, when we received and used first time, it worked good. However, it's just second time to use it and it's broken!! We indeed follow the instruction to take care the cleaner and really don't understand how it happens. so bad... doubt the quality made in China is really unreliable....
