review/summary: Great Alternative to an Expensive Espresso Makerreview/text: This is a great alternative to those much more expensive espresso makers. I discovered this on youtube. I like an occasional espresso, but not enough to invest in an expensive machine. This makes very tasty espresso and does so in a few moments. I was amazed that this was so easy to use and made good coffee. I think if you are on the edge about investing in an espresso maker this is a must buy. I found this a great way to make lattes at home to stay out of the much more expensive coffee shops.
