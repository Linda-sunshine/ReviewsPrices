review/summary: Great for parrots, birds and lots of dustreview/text: I bought this filter a few weeks ago. I bought it for my two mid-sized parrots. They are in sleeping cages at night in a large walk-in closet (6' x 8'). There is an incredible amount of dust and puffs of feathers floating around in that room. I keep the air filter in there at night and carry it out to the living area during the day (18' x 38'). It is not super light, but it is easy enough to carry twice per day. Even in the large living area, there is a noticeable decrease in the amount of feathers and dust floating around. I do worry that the prefilter will fill up quickly with all the feathers. I look at it frequently and can see them on the prefilter, but the fan is so strong that it hasn't seemed to loose any filter power yet.This filter is very loud. I would equate it to the noise level of a standing fan. I cannot leave it on high on the other side of the room while watching a movie. I either turn it off, or run it on low.It was very easy to get this started up and running from the box. Just a few steps and it was ready. I am very happy with this purchase and glad to finally have found a solution for the high amount of dust I find in my place.
