review/summary: Great!review/text: I looked through amazon reviews for food dehydrator before buying one for my mom as a gift, and this one was the most well received in my price range. She loved it. It's not too loud, it's lightweight, and it doesn't take up too much space. Great gift for someone who wants to break in to the food dehydration scene.
