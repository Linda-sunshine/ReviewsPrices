review/summary: Might have gotten a bad copyreview/text: I hardly use this air purifier because it's really noisy. I think I might have gotten a bad copy because it 'boots up' fine for the first minute on low -- very quiet, sounds like a quiet fan. However, after the minute there is a VERY distinctive high pitched whirring/howling sound that is just completely distracting. I just leave it on when I go to work and turn it off when I come back.
