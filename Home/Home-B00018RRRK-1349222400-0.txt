review/summary: Noisy Messy Erraticreview/text: As the title and other reviews say it sounds like a jet taking off when you hit the start switch. The grounds go everywhere on the counter. This is while the container is still in the grinder and then more when you take out the container and lift the lid to actually scoop out the coffee.Grinds to fast causing coffee to heat from the friction of the erratic burr plates that produce three or four different textures on one grind setting. Has a slide setting for amount of coffee that appears to either be highly erratic like the burrs or perhaps in combination with them causes you to get a different amount of coffee Every-time you grind. So you can not set it to get that one pot ground and then expect the same amount of ground coffee the next time you grind, thus the need to use a scoop instead of just dumping it in the filter.Not at all what one should expect.
