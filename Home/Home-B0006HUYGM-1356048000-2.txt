review/summary: Not that efficientreview/text: Not that efficient Bot this unit from Amazon over a year ago based on reviews. I am mostly disappointed in the cleaning performance and ease of use. This vac is heavy, noisy, hard to push around. The dust filters clog with dirt when washed which reduces air flow the next time you use it. Filters run about $7.50 ea and with their limited capacity and ability to be reused could become a fair expense over time. I would not recommend this vacuum to a friend.
