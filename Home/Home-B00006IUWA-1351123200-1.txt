review/summary: Love this popper!review/text: This is a wonderful, inexpensive popper that's very easy to use. It's great to be able to quickly enjoy popcorn without worrying about all the chemical additives in the microwave packs. It yields a great deal, and I usually have only a few (like less than 5) unpopped kernels at the end of a cycle.I find that the butter melter doesn't get the job done thoroughly enough, but that may be my fault as I'm usually using butter straight out of the fridge. Regardless, I don't find it inconvenient to melt it separately.I definitely recommend this product.
