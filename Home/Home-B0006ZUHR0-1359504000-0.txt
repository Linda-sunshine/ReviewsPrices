review/summary: My Second D2030review/text: This iron, has worked flawlessly for me the past 10 years, after repeated use and constant use with starched clothes the iron has started to rust and leak fluid inside that will ruin clothes. All the electronics still operate exceptionally, I just believe metal has a shelf life, so I purchased a new one and I'm going to ensure I keep only filtered water inside it.
