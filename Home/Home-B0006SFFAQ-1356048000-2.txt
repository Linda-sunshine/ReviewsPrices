review/summary: JUST LOVE THIS COFFEE MAKER!review/text: We owned this coffee maker and with daily use over the years just wore it out. It makes an excellent cup of coffee. I wanted to try something new, but my husband wanted the glass carafe. I persuaded him to let me try the new Cuisinart Coffee on Demand after reading the rave reviews here on line. After making one pot of coffee with this new machine I knew we made a huge mistake. The temp and taste of the coffee could not match this Cuisinart Brew Central, and the hight (no carafe) did not allow him to use his favorite mugs. Also the on Demand system, although it seems easier, takes more effort to clean. So I told my husband he was right and returned the Coffee on Demand and quickly purchased the Cuisinart Brew Central again. Very happy and my husband was thrilled to hear me say he was right!! :)
