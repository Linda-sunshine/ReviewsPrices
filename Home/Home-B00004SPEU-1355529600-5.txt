review/summary: Cute and effectivereview/text: I love this grinder. I bought it in red and it's a really pretty, vibrant, true red. I like the looks of it so much that I tend to 'forget' to put it back in the cabinet after use.As for function, there's a lot to like there as well. I bought it for grinding spices and flax seed. I've used it almost daily for one or the other (mainly flax). Some reviewers complained that the stainless steel didn't go all the way to the top but there would be no point - the lid fits inside and rests on top of the stainless edge.I personally wouldn't recommend this for grinding coffee. I use the Krups burr grinder for coffee beans (close to 10 years now) and it works great. However, this little blade grinder is perfect for quickly pulsing spices and seeds.I think the cord is the perfect length, on par with that of my slow cooker, blender, and similar appliances. Any longer and it would just be a hassle wrapping it up for storing in the cupboard.
