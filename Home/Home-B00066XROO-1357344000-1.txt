review/summary: Works like a charmreview/text: This griddle heats up very quickly and allows me to make a quick breakfast at a great quality.I have cooked pancakes, eggs (fried), bacon, and sausage on this so far and it works wonderfully.The only issue I have had with this so far is that when I drain the grease off the griddle into the tray, it seems as though some is getting stuck under the groove. However, that isn't the part we cook on so it's not a big issue.
