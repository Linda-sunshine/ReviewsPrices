review/summary: great vacreview/text: this hand vac is powerful. picks up all the dog hair off the couch. Is easy to empty and the cord is long enough to reach all over without plugging and unplugging. The only con, its a pretty heavy vac so if your using it for a long period of time it can get heavy.
