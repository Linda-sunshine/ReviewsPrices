review/summary: Initial impressionreview/text: I ordered the Presto 02811 model coffee maker last week and it arrived yesterday. I have been using the Michael Graves (Hamilton Beach) programmable coffee maker for about two weeks. It made a decent pot of coffee, but the flavor seemed watered down. Even when using the "flavor" button.When the Presto arrived yesterday I did a side by side comparison with my Michael Graves coffee maker. I put 8 cups of water in each coffee maker, timed how long it took to "brew" those 8 cups, measured the water temp at the end of the brew cycle, measured the water temp after 5 minutes, then measured the water temp after 10 minutes. Here are the results:Michael Graves:8 cups of waterBrew time: 7 minutesWater temp: 170 degreesWater temp after 5 minutes with the hot plate On: 165 degreesWater temp after 10 minutes with the hot plate On: 160 degreesPresto model 02811:8 cups of waterBrew time: 9 minutes and 21 secondsWater temp: 175 degreesWater temp after 5 minutes with the pot still plugged in: 175 degreesWater temp after 10 minutes with the pot still plugged in: 175 degreesThe Presto model took longer to brew, but the flavor was so much better. The sounds, and smells, coming from the Presto model reminded me of when I was growing up and the percolator models were pretty much all anybody really had. It was great stepping out of the shower this morning and being able to actually smell the coffee (no pun intended).The Presto isn't programmable. But, it's easy to get it ready the night before, just like I would in the programmable style, then simply plug in the Presto before I step into the shower. Then I unplug it, pour the coffee into my thermos, and off to work I go.I used the same coffee filters that I used with the drip coffee maker. I just poked a hole in the center so it would slide down over the percolator tube. And, I don't use electricity (however small the amount) keeping a digital clock/timer active.As a result of my unscientific experiment I will be using the Presto model as my daily coffee maker. The Michael Graves coffee maker will go back into the box, and be placed on a shelf in the garage, to be used when/if my Presto finally stops working. It's nice to have a backup in order to avoid those early morning coffee disasters.
