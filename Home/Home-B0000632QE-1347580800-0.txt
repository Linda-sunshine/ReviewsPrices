review/summary: Very Good Resultsreview/text: I started out being somewhat afraid of this device, as I had visions of amputated fingers, squirting stumps, well you get the vision. However we follow the safety guidelines and nobody has been even cut using it. It seems to make veggies go farther, a head of lettuce can be sliced and into a salad bowl in no time and I especially like slicing cukes for vinegar or sour cream cucumber salads. Carrots need to be sectioned into thirds to slice them more easily but most other veggies can be done up without preparation. It makes excellent thin potato chips and dicing is a breeze. We've sliced semi-frozen beef into "minute" steaks so we can control the quality not to mention reduce the cost and that works very nicely!Clean up is relatively easy, the plastic turns a bit orange after slicing carrots but it comes clean with a bit of work. No other shortcomings. We wash it, put it back into its case and let it dry there for safety's sake. I now am having visions of getting a wicket cut when reaching into the dish rack for a dish and grabbing the mandoline.
