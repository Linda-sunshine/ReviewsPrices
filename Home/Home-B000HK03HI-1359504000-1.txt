review/summary: Does a great job opening cansreview/text: You have to use the magnet separately from the can opener (it doesn't automatically attach to the can lid and keep it out of the can's contents), but it works really well. It's strong and comfortable, and the magnet does come in handy when the lid falls into the can.
