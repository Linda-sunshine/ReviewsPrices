review/summary: It really worksreview/text: I read all the reviews prior to buying.It is heavy.But the suction is really good.I use it for everything.It picks up more stuff than my upright Hoover.I have a cat & it does well picking up cat hair.It has a long cord so you can use it for whatever time that you need.I would not recommend it to someone that has a hard time getting up & down from a low position.But I was looking for suction & long duration.It checked all my boxes.
