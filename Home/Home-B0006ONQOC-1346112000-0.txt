review/summary: My go-to dessert for partiesreview/text: This ice cream maker is fantastic. My sister and bro-in-law gave it to me for my birthday a couple years ago. Now I bring ice cream to almost every party/potluck to which I'm invited, and I've become famous for it. Everyone asks what flavor I'll bring next. (I made white chocolate ice cream with macadamia nuts and coconut shavings for Easter, pumpkin spice ice cream with chopped pecans for Halloween, etc.)The machine is easy to use, easy to clean, works great every time. The best ice creams are the ones where you make a custard base (with egg yolks, cream, and sugar) on the stove top, add relevant flavor (melting in two bars of dark chocolate, for example) as instructed by the recipe, chill that custard a few hours in the fridge, then set up the ice cream maker, pour the flavored custard mix in and turn it on. Half an hour later, you've got ice cream that's better than Haagen Dazs.
