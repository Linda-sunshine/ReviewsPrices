review/summary: For the shop at workreview/text: I got tired of the guys always using the microwave to boil water for their ramen noodles so I bought this kettle. For the price it can't be beat. It gets heavy usage every day and has been going strong for six months now. It boils water much faster than the microwave and it has been great having around.
