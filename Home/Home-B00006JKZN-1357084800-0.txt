review/summary: Awesome!review/text: We gave this to my husband for Xmas. We have since made waffles EVERYDAY! The price, quality and ease of use is perfect. My kids are young and have enjoyed adding in chocolate chips, berries, etc. We are getting creative amd so far nothing sticks as leftover residual. Using this is much easier than making pancakes!
