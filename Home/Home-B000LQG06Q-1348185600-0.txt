review/summary: AMAZING, feels like you're sleeping on a cloud!review/text: I ordered this product for my college dorm. The dorm beds are extremely uncomfortable, so I purchased this mattress topper to alleviate some of that discomfort. Once I set it up and tried it out, I was amazed at how great it felt to lie on. I don't think I can study while lying down on my bed anymore... I'll just fall asleep! Wonderful purchase, highly recommend it. Although I do love green tea, I am not sure I like having a mattress topper that smells like it. It also made my sheets, pillows, and anything I set on top of my bed smell like green tea. I suppose it's better than the memory foam smell though!
