review/summary: Very nicereview/text: I got this as a gift for my cousin's wedding. I have a Le Creuset pan and on inspecting this one there didn't really appear to be any difference (other than ours is bigger and oval). The color was lovely and it was good, heavy duty enameled cast iron. My husband and I couldn't live without our cast iron pans from the dutch oven all the way down to the 8-inch skillet. The skillets we have are from Lodge and they are great quality and easy to take care of. I highly recommend this brand. Can't beat the price and quality!
