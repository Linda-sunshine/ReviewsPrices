review/summary: Heats quickly, does a nice jobreview/text: This iron heats up quickly and the digital settings are easy to use. I use steam a lot and it works very well. The auto-off feature and notification sounds of the iron also work well and are very useful. I've tried numerous irons in the $30-$60 range over the years and this is the best I've come across.
