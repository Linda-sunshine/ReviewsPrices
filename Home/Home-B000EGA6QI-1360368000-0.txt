review/summary: Lousy drivereview/text: As in a previous review the drive shaft connection on my blender sheared after six uses. It is no good having a 200 watt moter with a 100 watt capacity drive connection. I have designed drives that the weakest link broke if overloaded. It was like a fuse, easily changed and cheap, not like this thing. Of course I can not get an exchange or a rebate,
