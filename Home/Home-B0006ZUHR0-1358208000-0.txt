review/summary: Completely Satisfiedreview/text: I have had this iron for about two weeks now so I can not comment on its durability or longevity, yet, so far I am very happy I picked this iron. I was going to buy a more expensive rowenta, but I am glad I did not. This iron heats up VERY quick, and gets plenty hot. Also, the steam dial on it allows for a lot of steam that definitely helps if needed. The stainless steel plate on the bottom is a nice feature. The iron is heavier than cheap irons, but not a burden. It really has cut my ironing time by at least half, and makes ironing a whole lot less stressful. Would absolutely recommend!
