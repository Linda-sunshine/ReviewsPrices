review/summary: Best water bottle I ever hadreview/text: I consider myself a water bottle connoisseur. I'm never without one. When I started reading about BPAs in plastic water bottles, I decided to get a Stainless Steel one to replace the plastic one I had. I've been happy with my other Thermos brand products so I decided to give this one a shot.When it came in the mail, I immediately washed it and filled it with water and went on my errands. I left the water bottle in the car as I went from store to store. When I came back to my car (which was parked in direct sunlight of a hardware store parking lot for two hours on a hot, Philadelphia summer day) I was surprised to find my water was still freezing cold and the ice cubes had not melted! I was sold!The mouth opening is also the perfect size. Any bigger and you risk water spilling all over you as you are trying to drink and drive/bike/walk and any smaller (my previous water bottle's opening was straw-size) and it makes this annoying slurping sound (which I didn't mind, but I got looks from people around me). Highly recommended!
