review/summary: Very pleasedreview/text: I've had this pan for a couple of weeks now and use it almost daily. I purchased this pan because it was the top choice on America's Test kitchen and it is as good as they said! I got the 12 inch skillet and just ordered the 8 inch this afternoon. It is a great product for the price. The non-stick surface is so smooth that I had to buy new flexible silicone spatulas because my old ones just chased the egg around in the pan when I tried to flip it. Love having this kind of problem!
