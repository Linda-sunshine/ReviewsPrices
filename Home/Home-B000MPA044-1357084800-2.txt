review/summary: Fun, fun, fun!review/text: I asked for this for Christmas because I often cook for my extended family, making meal prep for 9 people. Was hoping this would make my life easier. The day after Christmas we decided to try it out (there were just 3 of us that day), I put in 3.5 pounds of pork ribs (boneless), some peppers, onions, etc--was following a recipe for Carnitas off of allrecipes.com. Turned out marvelous (after cooking 50 minutes). A couple of things... I was surprised (don't know why, as I'm familiar with pressure cooker canning) but you get to smell the food cooking the whole time. Yummy! Watching Chef Brad was one of the big reasons I decided I wanted this and it does work just like on his shows, I was wondering about the time to come up to pressure. I put my meat in to brown, set it for the 50 minute cook time at high pressure, left the lid off, and in about 3 minutes the meat was browning--so about as long as if I had browned in a pan on the stove. After I had browned the meat and added the other ingredients I put the lid on and waited 5 minutes, was still trying to come up to pressure. Grabbed the manual and noticed I had it on pressure release, fixed the little pressure release valve and about 5 minutes later the pressure had been reached. I was wondering how long that would take, if it would add 20 minutes or something to the cook time, but it was quite quick. I did partial natural pressure release when done (let it cool itself for 10 minutes) and then flipped the pressure release valve with a fork and let it finish releasing pressure (took about 1 minute) and then we enjoyed some lovely, tender, well flavored carnitas for dinner. I'm sold! The recipes with the book are a bit weird, but they help you get an idea of how long to cook various things. Look on allrecipes.com for recipe ideas or chefbrad.com has a lot, too.
