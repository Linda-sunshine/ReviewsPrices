review/summary: Great for small areasreview/text: I had a mold problem in a small bathroom that had no real ventilation. I left this dehumidifier on pretty much 24/7 and it helped tremendously. It is easy to empty, and it's very quiet in my opinion. The reservoir is never completely full when the 'full' light comes on, but I still did not have to empty it that often. I think it is ideal for closets, and works well in small bathrooms.
