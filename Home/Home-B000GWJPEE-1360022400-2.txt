review/summary: Super cute, effective; pretty largereview/text: This has got to be the cutest humidifier I've ever seen, but it's not exactly something you can hide in a corner. I have not had any problems with it leaking or getting the furniture around it wet, however I have had to turn it up to a relatively high setting to make sure the output doesn't lessen overnight. It doesn't appear to need much cleaning, and I usually only have to refill it every other day. I'd definitely recommend it for kids or if you aren't looking for subtlety.
