review/summary: Thrilled with B60 Keurigreview/text: I am very pleased with my B60 Keurig. I like the options for choosing mug and large mug sized drinks. I usually always use the mug size. The machine works very well and makes a good cup of coffee. I do not understand the reviews complaining about the noise. It makes a small noise while brewing that doesn't bother me at all. I can pop out the k-cup holder to rinse in the sink, which will make the machine last longer. It is much more expensive using K-cups than making an old fashioned pot of coffee, but I can have a cup of coffee later in the day that is fresh rather than reheating stale coffee that sat in my old style machine. So far I have no complaints. I hope the machine lasts longer than some reviewers stated. When entertaining, I ended up throwing out huge pots of coffee that went unused. I like the fact that my guests can choose one cup of coffee at a time. Also, my guests like the variety of coffees available.
