review/summary: This is NOT an espresso maker. It's a coffee maker, and it's awesome.review/text: I feel compelled to point out that this is a Moka pot, and it makes excellent coffee - but it's not an espresso maker. (Read here for more info:[...]. Espresso requires 9 bars of pressure, the Bialetti only gets up to ~1.5 bars) With that said, I can't speak highly enough about this product, it definitely delivers a delicious cup of coffee.As for this particular model, the 6-cup size, it makes one "USA-Normal" cup of coffee at a time, about ~8oz I think.As for the Bialetti Moka pots in general, you just can't go wrong. Chances are, if you're reading these reviews, it's because you've never owned one. And in that case, you can have faith in the fact that these things have been around, virtually unchanged, for 80 years.
