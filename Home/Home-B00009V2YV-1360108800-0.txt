review/summary: Best Buy for a Weather Radion I have foundreview/text: This weather radio is a fine unit. You have it set and leave it on always, It makes not a sound unless there is a weather alert and it go off 24/7It is comforting to know that in the middle of the night whenever this Unit will make a warning sound thatyou cannot miss.I bought one for my Mom who is 86 and she loves it to.It may scare or startle you some but it is well worth that warning. Once it issues a warning it automatically starts broadcasting the National Weather Radio warning that's going on.Real fair price I felt and a nice safety addition to your home.I and my Mom have no regrets about it. Mom won't turn hers off as I won't it's Super Reliable
