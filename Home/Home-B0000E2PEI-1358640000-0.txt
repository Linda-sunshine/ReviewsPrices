review/summary: Horrible scale!! + Horrid customer servicereview/text: Taylor scales are the worst!!! I purchased this scale at first all was great except the fact the platform is tiny... within a few months the scale was reading me 10 pounds lower in weight then what i was!! Doctor confirmed this. I called customer service and they tried to help me reset it but it didn't work. I was then told i can send it in and they would send a replacement 6-8 weeks.. are you fricken serious?? Not only that but the shipping cost was on me to send it back... was gonna cost almost $20 to ship it back NOT worth it!! Taylor won't be getting my business ever again.
