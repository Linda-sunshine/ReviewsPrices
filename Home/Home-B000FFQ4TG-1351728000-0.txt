review/summary: Bunn coffee brewerreview/text: This is our second Bunn like this. Our first one lasted many years. My only complaint is the decanter. It is tricky to pour from. The spout needs to be redesigned, but this is a common complaint, and Bunn has not fixed it, so we live with it. It helps to open the lid when pouring. Coffee from the Bunn is worth the inconvenience!
