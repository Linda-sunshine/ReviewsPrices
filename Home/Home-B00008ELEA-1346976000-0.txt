review/summary: Farberware 8 cup percolatorreview/text: I received my coffee pot a few days before the estimated delivery date. It was as expected, I've had Farberware products in the past. I have to say I'd forgotten what HOT coffee was like and I'm very happy that this pot does serve a hot cup of coffee. Even in the warming stage it's hotter than my last pot.There is one thing I don't care for though, the way the lid is secured to the pot. I feel as though I'm going to pull the handle off the lid. It's a secure lid but find it to be hard to remove it.Overall I'm very happy with this purchase.
