review/summary: Incredibly disappointedreview/text: The first time I bought a queen. It was perfect and still is perfect.This most recent time I bought a king and it went into the trash almost immediately.First of all, it arrived dirty.Secondly, it was "split".Worst of all, it smelled like cat pee.Into the trash it went because there was no way I could squish it back down into a manageable size to return!We tried to "air it out" but no luck. Cat pee was overwhelming.Yuck!Teresa
