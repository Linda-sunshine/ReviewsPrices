review/summary: Disappointed!!review/text: This is not my first Brita but this is my first "new filter" design Brita. I feel duped. There was nothing said in the description that the filter design had changed. So now I have 5 old style new filters I can't use. This is not the worst part. The new filter is HORRIBLE! It get clogged and doesn't allow the water to flow thru to the bottom. Instead the water sits at the top trapped. I would return this whole unit but unfortunately I thru out the box.
