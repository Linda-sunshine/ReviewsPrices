review/summary: Nice grinder but useless because of an Achilles' Heelreview/text: This is a nice compact grinder that suctions well to the counter (we have Formica). Unfortunately when we were grinding meat the plastic piece that receives the metal crank stripped rendering the grinder useless. It might work well for softer foods. Also the instructions were extremely minimal and it takes a while to figure out how to put it together and operate it.
