review/summary: Great Dehydratorreview/text: This is the first and hopefully last dehydrator I will ever use! I have made many batches of jerky in it and it comes out great every time! Just make sure you rotate the meat every once in a while as this is a top fan model. This gives the meat on the bottom a chance to catch up to the stuff on the top. Great
