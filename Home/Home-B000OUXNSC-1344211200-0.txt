review/summary: Affordable & Quality... Who knew both could exist!review/text: I read every review carefully before purchasing 4 of these for our boys twin bunk beds. Some of the concerns other reviewers had were about melting in the dryer and not fitting the beds... but I can say with confidence, that neither of those things happened to us.They were shipped promptly, and came beautifully packaged in a thick plastic zippered bag - no funny chemical smells either. Immediately after receiving the product, I washed them in my standard wash machine (no fancy front loader for me!), and then hung them to dry since it was beautiful outside. A week later, I was changing my young son's sheets from an accident and decided to dry his mattress pad in the dryer... and it came out fine! No melting, no shrinkage - just as beautiful as the first washing!If you're sitting on the fence about buying these, I say 'go for it!'... You can't beat the quality for the price!NOTE: We have 6 twin beds for our boys and Amazon capped the amount of Mattress pads we could buy to a maximum of 4.... thankfully my mom was able to purchase the remaining ones I needed - so keep that in mind if you need more than 4.
