review/summary: Love my new Keurig B70 platinum brewerreview/text: As an Amazon Prime customer, I received my new brewer in two days, free shipping, and I love that! My new brewer was easy to set up, brews great coffee. I especially like the "short cup" option. Using bold coffee blends it is the next best thing to expresso for my taste. There are five cup sizes, which offers great flexibility. I have previously owned one of the first home brewers, bought when Keurig first offered the home model, about 8 years ago. That one never died, the person I gave it to dropped it. It remains to be seen if this model has as good a repair record. After giving away my old original because it got noisy, I bought a plain one size cup fits all B50 and had a string of bad luck with this model, went through 4 brewers in 2 1/2 years. Keurig honored its warrantee in each case of failure, sent a new one each time. I bought this B70 because I wanted the "short cup " option, and it was my birthday. I have no doubt that should there be any trouble with this new one,Keurig will honor its warranty. Love the Keurig brewer and Amazon Prime!
