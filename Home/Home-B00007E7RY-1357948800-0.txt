review/summary: Powerful filterreview/text: We live in an old apartment building in the city and this is great for keeping the air in the apartment clean. I have noticed a lot less dust since starting to use this and allergies seem to be reduced. We also have two cats and it has seemed to help with the amount of hair floating around. Instead, I have found a lot of the dust and hair in the filter when cleaning it out.The unit is a little noisy, but not unbearable. Anything that is moving a lot of air around is going to make some noise. You probably don't watch to talk on the phone or watch TV with it blasting on high right next to you, but it is not a distraction for us. If we need it to be quiet, we shut it off for a little bit. We actually like the noise, because we can turn it on high in the bedroom at night and it helps drown out the sounds of the city and neighbors. At first, it may have been a little distracting, but now we are used to it.I recommend this to anyone looking for a good air purifier.
