review/summary: Versatile vacuum!review/text: I've had my eye on the Eureka for months and finally pulled the trigger over Black Friday weekend.I mainly bought this to use for vacuuming our vehicles and it works wonderful. I have two other small vacuums that just wasn't that great for car vacuuming. What sets the Eureka apart from the competition is the rotating brush. It does wonders on the car carpets. It has plenty of suction that is superior to most small vacuumsAlso, it's great for vacuuming carpeted steps too. In addition, I found an unexpected vacuuming use for it. We have two cats that love to get behind our sofas. So the backside of the sofas gets very hairy. I decided to run the rotating brush over the backside of the couch and the vacuum makes short work of the cat hair.Also, if you are needing to vacuum in tight spots, etc. I recommend this kit as an add-on:http://www.amazon.com/Micro-Vacuum-Attachment-Kit-Piece/dp/B000BSJCLY/ref=pd_bxgy_hg_img_y
