review/summary: A true money saver!review/text: This little machine packs a punch! It's noisier than I would prefer, and the pump priming can get a bit fussy if you don't give it ample time to heat up (give it about 30 seconds longer than when the green "ok" light comes on), but it has performed consistently. One down side is that you have to stand there the whole time and manually shut the machine off at the end of the pull and you have to measure out the water if you don't want overflows or diluted shots, but that's a small price to pay for the quality.
