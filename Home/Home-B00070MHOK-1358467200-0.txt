review/summary: Great Deal&#62; Some Issuesreview/text: This steamer is great! Yes, I agree with other users who say that sometimes it spurts out water but I have noticed that if you keep it a little below the max water line then it stops that issue. In addition, I average about one shirt or pant per fill up as it goes through the water very quickly. Then you have to wait for it to cool down and refill. So the whole process becomes even more tedious then it already is. However, with all that being said it does get the job done and nicely at that.
