review/summary: Great productreview/text: I love this product. After breaking the first one (Completely my fault -- I poured a hot liquid into the sink with the jug after pulling it from the refrigerator. Not my smartest idea.), I didn't hesitate to purchase another. It holds a lot of liquid and the seal on the jug keeps things fresh. The only downsides I've noticed is that the handle is a bit small compared to the rest of the container and it does get a bit heavy when filled.
