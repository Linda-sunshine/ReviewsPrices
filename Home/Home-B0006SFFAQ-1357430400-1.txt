review/summary: Good Coffee, Hard to Use Coffee Makerreview/text: Makes a piping hot, tasty pot of coffee. The 4 cup setting is useful.The timer is inconsistent. Most of the time the button that sets the time doesn't work. I push, push, push and it just laughs, laughs, laughs.Soon after buying the thing, while removing the coffee pot from the coffee maker, I broke the "stop brewing" mechanism on the brew basket. It's ridiculously complicated and delicate for something that's so close to the top of the coffee pot. It may be broken but I hear it. I hear it mocking me. Mocking me from beyond the grave.I hate filling this thing with water. It's a bad design to make such a basic function so awkward. Specifically, the opening you pour water down is narrow and the markings for how much you've filled it are inside the black plastic water container. It reminds me of when i used to top off G. W. Bush's brain with knowledge once in a while. Too little and he's swallowing his tongue while he's talking. Too much and he's invading any country Dick Cheney points him to. The numerals on the inside of the water carafe are so hard to read that I wonder why they bothered to use Arabic numbers. Why not Chinese ideograms or binary coding numbers. At least binary won't know sarcasm.But the taste of the coffee still beats most other drip brewers I've had. Thank goodness it isn't a nuclear reactor. They're just mean to me.It's time to go. I hear the mermaids singing, each to each. They do not sing to me.
