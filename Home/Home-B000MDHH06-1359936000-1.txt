review/summary: First-time juicerreview/text: It's my first juicer, and now I juice twice a day. I feel a lot better than I had been. I have not been feeling well since I had three surgeries, back to back last year. I have seen improvement starting the first week, and even now. I am about five weeks in. The health benefits are one thing that is really great. The other is the simple clean up. For juicers, this one is great for easy clean up from what I have read. It works very well. No problems there. I have juiced the following with no issues: Kale, carrots, cucumber, peeled ginger, romaine hearts, spinach, peeled tangerine, peeled lemon, tomato, peeled garlic, peeled orange, peeled grapefruit, apple, peeled lime.... and pinapple core. I peel anything with a peel, because I do not care for the taste of the peel. I am very pleased with the machine, and look forward to many more days of happy juicing. Feels great!
