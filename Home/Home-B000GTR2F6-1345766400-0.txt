review/summary: Built-in Obsolescencereview/text: When I first received the B70 model, I was pleased and purchased a wide variety of flavors. I showed it off to my friends and we had wonderful "coffee klatches" over the 4 years that this brewer worked. But then the problems started. Just take a look at the videos and you will see what can go wrong. Once the problems start, they escalate and you start wasting k-cups, doing a variety of cleaning tasks in order to produce a cup and over time, the one-cup feature loses any value because you simply cannot produce a cup of coffee. The only solution is to buy a new brewer...well the performance of the old brewer certainly discouraged me from buying a new one, even at discount!
