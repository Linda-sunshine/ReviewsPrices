review/summary: Best value knifereview/text: I have purchased two of these knives for use at home and two others to give as wedding gifts. They are durable and sharp. The texture of the handle really gives you great control of the knife while handling it, which allows for more rapid and precise chopping. The 8-inch is a great size for chopping just about any vegetables or cuts of meat. The first knife I bought, I frequently washed in the dishwasher, and this did make the blade dull after a few years. I kept it though because it still works pretty well on some foods, just not on vegetables with tough skins like butternut squash.
