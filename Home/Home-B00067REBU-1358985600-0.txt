review/summary: Excellentreview/text: I wanted a cheap bread maker as I'm not very domesticated so I didn't know if I'd use it. I wanted to make fresh bread for my little boy so I'd know there were no additives and not too much sugar or salt. I make loaves,bread roll dough and pizza bases. I've not used the 'jam'' setting yet. It's very easy to use & easy to clean.I love the delay timer so it can be set to make fresh bread for exactly when you want it. Well worth the money.
