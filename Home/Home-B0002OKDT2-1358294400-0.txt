review/summary: I have Breville and this. Here are the advantages/disadvantages.review/text: The advantage of these masticating juicers is supposed to be that they get more juice (especially for leafy stuff) and that some enzymes aren't destroyed because the lower RPM (80 vs 30000) causes less heat.After using both, I believe that this gets more juice--but not significantly more (except leafy stuff). It's also much quieter. But I don't buy that &#34;dead enzymes&#34; argument. The Breville is spinning fast, but it's not rubbing the fruit/veg, so the friction isn't an issue. I would argue that the Omega is constantly rubbing the fruit/veg, so it would be worse in this aspect.So you have to decide how much you care about getting more juice and maybe about the noise. I can use the Omega when the kids are asleep, but the Breville is off-limits.But you must also consider that with this type of juicer you have to do more prep. I can shove entire apples and heads of romaine lettuce into the Breville, while some Carrots are too large for the Omega. You have to cut everything first.Regarding cleanup, the Omega is easier to clean, mainly because the parts are smaller and all fit in the sink.
