review/summary: Love it after 3 yearsreview/text: I have used this kettle several times daily for over 3 years and it is still going strong.Three previous kettle types lasted little more than a year each.I love it for all the reasons stated in other reviews: all stainless, no plastic in contact with water, outside doesn't get hot, easy to fill, once you know not to go past the bottom of the lid in upright position, cordless, easy to set back on base, no leakage, shuts off when boil is reached (soon after) or if accidentally turned on while empty,and it comes to a boil MUCH faster than my gas burner stove. I quickly got used to not seeing exactly how much water is in it. The capacity is really only about a quart for the one I have, but it boils so fast, I just refill if I need more. The on switch does seem delicate, but I've been reasonably careful and have no problems to date.I'm actually ordering another one for my daughter because I want her to have the best.
