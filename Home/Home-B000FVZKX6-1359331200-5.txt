review/summary: So soft - it's like sleeping on a warm cloudreview/text: If clouds could be warm, and come in multiple colors, then they would be these pinzon sheets. They are perfectly soft and warm and almost generate the sensation that you're floating. I've had them for a few weeks and have washed them during that time and I have not experienced any issues.The pockets are generously deep and fit my king size bed without having to stretch them in order to make them fit. If you're looking for good quality cold weather sheets then these are for you.
