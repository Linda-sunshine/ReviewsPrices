review/summary: IT Stays on my stove topreview/text: I think &#34;what can I make tonight using my new gift&#34; I love this Dutch oven. The metal lid lift is better than the plastic because it can go in a higher oven temp if you need it too. It cooks like an oven right on the stove. I love to slow cook or braise pot roast in it. What can I make in the summertime without turning on the oven? Baked fruit cobbler? Homemade applesauce? chicken Marsala? I thought the item would be too heavy. I personally would not give it to my 93 year old grandmother but I and my neighbor who has borrowed it have not had a problems with the weight.This pot vs. a crockpot. I thought about the differences of using this pot vs a electric crock pot. My crockpot (I have three sizes) gets hot and stays hot but I have found that unless you really have five to six hours to cook, it takes a long time for the crockpot to get to it's hottest and really begin to cook foods. The crock pot is a fix it and forget it while your at work idea. Usually I use the crock pot for &#34;take alongs&#34; to tailgates or pot luck. The dutch oven is a oven that can be used ontop of the stove. Bread can be baked in this sucker. My neighbor did make a big pot of baked beans in this dutch oven and it sat on my counter for two hours and was still so hot she needed pot holders to lift it back in the car to take home.The bottom of this dutch oven is the narrow part, the sides are a bit wider, creating the oven effect. The top edge of the pot is black. I thought it was exposed cast iron. It is not and the directions explain that. It's a matte black enamel. I will be using this a lot this summer for jelly and jam making.
