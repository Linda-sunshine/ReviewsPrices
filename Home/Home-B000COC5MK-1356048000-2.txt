review/summary: Oster bottle opener works very wellreview/text: It is attractive, especially if your appliances are metal surfacedIt opens wine bottle easily and painlessly. I've only had it for a few months but it opens wine bottle seamlessly.It charges easily, I just keep the base plugged in and it is always ready to go, takes up little space on the counter and opens bottles with any kind of corks.
