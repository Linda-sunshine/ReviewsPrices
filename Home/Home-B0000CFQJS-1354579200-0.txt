review/summary: The price was great!review/text: I recieved it in the mail after just a few short days after I ordered it. The only little thing I didnt like (not a big deal) was that my Mr. Coffee maker has an auto stop so you can pour the coffee during brewing you dont have to wait till the entire pot is brewed and when I took the coffee pot out, to pour a cup, the filter doesnt stop the auto pour feature right away so there was a little bit of coffee spilling on the the hot plate below. Other than that,Its great. I love not having to buy filters!
