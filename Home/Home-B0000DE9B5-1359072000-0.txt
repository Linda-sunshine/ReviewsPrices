review/summary: What's Not To Like?review/text: Made in Italy says it all- well designed and properly made. Of course you must take off the lid to pour - not really an inconvenience. Once the lid is off,you can pour without dripping. The handle is tight to the body of the pitcher in order to store in the refrigerator. I drink tons of iced tea and this pitcher is perfect as it allows me to brew and store the tea in the same receptacle. But it, you won't be sorry!
