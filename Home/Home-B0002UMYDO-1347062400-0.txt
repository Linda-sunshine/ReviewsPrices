review/summary: Very underpowered motor, a waste of moneyreview/text: A beautiful can opener that worked well for 3 months and it is a real shame this piece was not engineered with a heavier duty motor that would last. We average maybe opening 2 regular cans of dog food a day and within the quarter, the motor just kept getting more and more sluggish until I threw it in the trash and bought a cheaper one that has both looks and muscle. It's one thing that we import small appliances like this nowadays but should it be equipped with such a shoddy, underpowered motor that one must have to dispose of it due to inoperable in only months? So disappointed in this part of it as its a beautiful opener. We had this opener since March 2012 and it was place in the trash Aug 2012 due to not enough power to open a can of dog food, not a large can. We never used large cans on it.I purposely wait to post my ratings as I bought this opener due to all the positive ratings. I wonder how many rave reviews of this item were posted shortly after receipt and first use of it as the opener does make a solid A+ FIRST IMPRESSION, that did not last 6 months.
