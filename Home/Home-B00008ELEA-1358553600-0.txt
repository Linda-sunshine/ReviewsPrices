review/summary: Product is a cheep Chinese knock-off of Farberware's original product, but it does work.review/text: The general construction of this &#34;newly&#34; designed product has all the evidence of it having been constructed as a &#34;throwaway when broken&#34; product, that is, unrepairable. Perhaps this is what some folks want but I liked my original percolator which was repairable but which the &#34;distributor&#34; (Black & Decker?) no longer chooses to do. Ok. We bought it and it will be interesting to see how long it lasts and perhaps prove me wrong as to how I see the constructiion of this product.
