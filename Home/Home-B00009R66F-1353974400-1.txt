review/summary: Better than expected!review/text: After researching carefully which carpet cleaner I wanted to get I decided on this one based on the reviews. I used it the day we got it, and it was amazing! We have dogs that occasionally have accidents on our white/cream carpet, and this carpet cleaner makes my carpet looks like nothing ever happened, and even dries the carpet so you aren't left with a big wet spot! Very easy to use, and very easy to put in solution and take out the dirty water. The only downside I have is that the bucket that picks up the dirty water could be bigger so I don't have to empty it as often. But then again, the cleaner is big enough as it is and if it was any bigger it wouldn't fit anywhere to store it. Overal a great product, and definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for an easy to use carpet cleaner!
