review/summary: Great chef's knifereview/text: I have complete knife sets by two leading German companies but the Victorinox knives are my &#34;go to&#34; knives. I like the thin steel blades and the non-slip handles. These knives are light weight and hold a extremely sharp cutting edge. The blades are not as thick and ridged as my other knives. I only use them for general slicing and chopping. I would not use them for cutting frozen foods or heavy bone as when butchering. I've only had them a short while so I cannot comment on how well they will perform over time.
