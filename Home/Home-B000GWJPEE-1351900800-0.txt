review/summary: not efficientreview/text: Have used this for 3 years and recently I've decided to replace it with a more powerful one. The relative humidity (RH) is around 30% in my bedroom. The room is small, only 12 sq metres (about 130 sq ft) and keeping it running all night only raises RH to about 40%. It may be enough for a number of people but it's still too dry for me.I remember that the manual says 1 gallon of water for 11 hours, so the output is about 344ml/hour... almost the smallest output among all humidifiers. I'd try one with output ~500ml/hr, or, 3 gallon/day.
