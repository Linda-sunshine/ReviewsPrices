review/summary: Great Coffee Maker - Model DTC-975BKNreview/text: This was recommended by a friend and after extensive research, I purchased from Amazon. It makes excellent coffee and the thermal carafe keeps it hot for hours. Easy to clean and the water level indicator is easy to see on the left side. I read other reviews that indicated a lid problem with subsequent spill-over. I have not encountered that and actually think the lid design is great - no button pushing or cap twisting to pour. You MUST ensure that the &#34;Pour&#34; on the lid is lined up with the spout - or you will have a mess. Not difficult to do if one reads the directions. Looks really nice in the kitchen with stainless steel appliances too. Highly recommend this product.
