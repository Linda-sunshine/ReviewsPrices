review/summary: Awesome Waffle Makerreview/text: I am usually relatively indifferent about leaving reviews for Amazon purchases. This is such a sweet product that I'm willing to take the time to praise it here. It is much more substantial than I expected from the price, and extremely easy to use. My first batch of waffles, using a recipe from The Breakfast Book, came out perfectly. If you follow the instructions, and spray oil for each waffle, cleaning is a cinch. The fact that you can stand it on its end to conserve counter space was an unexpected bonus. The waffles are kind of big, but easily break into quarters for those with less vast appetites (and of course you can freeze any leftovers).Awesome!
