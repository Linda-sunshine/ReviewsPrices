review/summary: Pretty darn good and really small, tooreview/text: I love the size and operation of this food processor but:It's really noisyand won't grind seeds (like Cardomom) at all.But for chopping nuts, or chocolate, as long as you can handle how LOUD it is, it is great!And easy to clean, too.
