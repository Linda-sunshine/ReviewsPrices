review/summary: Can't Live Withoutreview/text: Ok, it's a little hyperbolic to say I couldn't live without it but yea...espresso makes my life better :)This can come in basically any size you want depending on the one you buy. I like the smaller ones because I can travel with it. It takes about five to ten minutes for the espresso to brew depending on the stove type you have. It makes great espresso. Totally recommend and great as a gift for caffeine people.
