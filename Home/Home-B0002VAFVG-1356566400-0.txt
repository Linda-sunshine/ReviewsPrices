review/summary: Solid juicerreview/text: I use to have a Breville juicer that had a couple of plastic parts and sometimes it would leak. I decided to buy this model and it's pretty darn good. I usually will put a few carrots, apples, celery in Pyrex before I go to sleep. When I wake up I just run them thru the juicer and the juice is ready within a minute or two. I have a little dish bin that I soak the juicer parts in afterwards and it works great. The stainless steel looks great on the counter along with myBlendtec TB-621-20 Total Blender, Black
