review/summary: Hurt My Back!review/text: I cannot fault the seller in any way for this bed. It shipped very quickly and I received it in pristine condition. Unfortunately, this bed has a very serious design flaw. I'm a side sleeper and because this bed has an inner and an outer chamber it sags in the middle. And FYI, I'm not a big guy, I'm 5'9" tall, 168 lbs. and in decent shape. Within a week of sleeping on this thing, I woke up with severe pain in my back. And Yes, I made sure it was well and properly inflated before I went to bed. Because of the sag in the middle and sleeping on my side as usual, I apparently didn't turn early enough in the night and it slipped a disk in my back pinching my sciatic nerve. I've spent 4 days as a near cripple in severe pain, had to inconvenience other people who rely upon me, had to get physical therapy, 4 days of lost wages because I couldn't drive and I had to go out and get a new memory foam mattress. If you are a side sleeper, I would advise strongly against this mattress. Consider yourself forewarned. I would donate it to Goodwill, but can't even do this in good conscience. It is going in the trash on Monday. Sorry Wenzel, you seriously need to go back to the drawing board on this one. The materials and pump are good quality, but not much good to anyone with the sag.
