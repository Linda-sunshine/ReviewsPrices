review/summary: Cuisinart DCC-1200 coffeemakerreview/text: We found it hard to understand the instructions. Also, there are some disappointments. The clock is not lighted, therefore hard to read. I think the coffee isn't as hot as it should be. The clock does not return to 'time of day' when the auto off ends. We don't customarily use the auto on feature, so haven't tried that feature. We will keep the coffeemaker and get used to its idiosyncrasies.
