review/summary: Is a cup a cup?review/text: First of all, I want to stress that this coffeemaker does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does it well. If you want a coffee maker that will make one cup of coffee at a time and do it quickly and efficiently, this is the coffee maker for you.Of course, that brings me to the word "cup."To me, a cup of coffee is, well, what many people would call a "mug" of coffee. That is, 12 ounces.In the surreal world of coffeemakers, a "cup" really is something like about 2 1/2 or 3 ounces. So, when you buy a four "cup" coffee maker, what you are really getting is a one cup coffee maker. You just have to do a little math.So, this one cup coffee maker is a very nice machine and makes one cup of coffee for nicely.
