review/summary: So Far So Good...review/text: ...of course with flannel sheets, it's all about longevity. I can say right now they are thick, soft and look better made than any other flannel sheets I have owned. First dry left a lot of lint but no pilling. I will plan to follow up in a year or so after some wear.Funny thing, Amazon is not known for their top notch packaging. Fairly delicate objects are often placed in a box with one of those air pillows and lots of room to jostle around. Not the sheets! They were packed very well with padding on all four sides and no spare room. How ironic is that!
