review/summary: Can you get your hand in the carafe to clean it? I CAN'T!review/text: WHAT are the people who design this stuff thinking? I don't want to put in some cleaner and wait and pour it out, I want to SCRUB my coffee pot.I bought it after reading so many good reviews on it - what are the people who review this stuff thinking? - took it out of the box, saw the flaw with the carafe, and thanks to Amazon, am immediately sending it back. Oh, and the quality? Incredible, it is lightweight enough to be made out of papier-mch&eacute;. Is it?So, on goes my quest for a decent coffee maker. One that is apparently glass with a big opening for EASY cleaning, quality no object since they're mostly all junk today, probably a Mr. Coffee since a higher price doesn't guarantee a really good product, one that permits a permanent filter since I don't DO paper filters, and, MOST OF ALL, one that doesn't REQUIRE WATER FILTERS. What a scam, the requirement of water filters.Oh well, welcome to this century. What a world.
