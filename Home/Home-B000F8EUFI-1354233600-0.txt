review/summary: I gave this a 4 star only because I don't know how well it preforms on a high loft carpetreview/text: I purchased this for my daughter. The carpet in her apartment is a tightly looped dense synthetic. She has a cat and both she and I have hair down to our waists. I've used this vacuum 3 times and it works without a flaw. It is light weight, eahe corsy to move about, and seems to even get the dust in the corners. I have used the attachment on the mini blinds and a chair where the cat likes to sleep and it worked very well there. It is easy to empty too. I like that the cord is long enough to run through the entire apartment if I plug it in the hallway.I own a dyson. I do believe I spent way too much money. If this upright Dirt Devil is available in France I will be replacing my much heavier dyson with this vacuum once I return home
