review/summary: Best price for a decent electric kettlereview/text: I'm a college student living in a dorm/residence hall. This electric kettle has been an enormously handy investment (making instant oatmeals, coffee, tea, ramen noodles, anything that needs boiling water). It comes with a mesh strainer that attaches to the spout too.I was not looking for anything fancy or too complicated - just something that can boil my water with quickly and effortlessly. This kettle is perfect because of it's lightweight and simple design. Additionally, I appreciate the auto-turnoff function.I didn't experience any "plastic" taste in my water. Before using it for drinking, I washed it with soap and a sponge, and used it to boil water at max capacity twice.The outside of the kettle does get hot when/after using, so be careful not to burn yourself. The cord is kind of short (about a foot and a half) too.
