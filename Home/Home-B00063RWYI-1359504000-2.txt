review/summary: Hopefully healthyreview/text: This is my first iron cast pot, and I admit it, making the switch from non-stick is difficult...My cons:- it is very heavy- it requires oil, which I generally avoid (for weight loss purposes)- it sticks a bit when it's newMy pros:- from what I read it is a somewhat healthier choice than stainless steel, and a much healthier choice than non-stick- it conducts heat very well and saves energy- the small amounts of iron that leak into food are actually healthy- to my inexperienced eye, the pre-seasoning was well done; I couldn't detect any rust, anywhere, eitherI already cooked 2 stews in it, and was pleased, but not overly thrilled. I just hope it's healthy and it will get better in time.
