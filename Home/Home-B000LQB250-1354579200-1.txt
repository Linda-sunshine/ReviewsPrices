review/summary: Amazing!review/text: I have had back pain since the 70s. I have tried several varities of spring mattresses over the years including "premium" mattresses costing +1K. Up until just recently thought memory foam mattresses were out of my reach. Purchased one from Amazon and would never buy a spring mattress again. I woke up with very mild pain and it would pass after sitting for an hour. I thought maybe the mattress was too firm. After reading the reviews for this topper I purchased it and was amazed to wake up completely painless. Topper appears to be very high quality and should last for years. I do rotate the mattress every other week.Odor: It was very faint but pleasant and used it the same night it was delivered.
