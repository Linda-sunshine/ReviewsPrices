review/summary: Great little vacuum!review/text: I paid like $36 for this thing and I love it! I have hard wood floors and then two huge area rugs and two shaggy dogs, and this thing works GREAT to clean the floors! I get big tumbleweeds of dog hair and if you even get near them with this thing it sucks them right up! on my hardwoods it actually pulls the dog fur out from under cabinets, sofa, etc. great deal!!
