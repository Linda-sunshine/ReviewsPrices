review/summary: Sharp, lightweight and great price!review/text: I recently moved into a new apartment and with a tight budget needed a knife set that would get me through the next year until I could purchase something more permanent. These have, so far, outdone themselves!I'm so happy with this purchase, I may not need new knives for longer than intended.They are sharp, hand wash very easy (I never let them sit in water and I don't have a dishwasher) and the block is very good quality for the price.The chef's knife is my go to knife for everything, the paring knife is the perfect size for me, the scizzors are a great addition and the steak knives work quite well.If you're tight on $ and need a decent set, this is the one to get.Review Edit: 6 mos later and I'm still thrilled with this purchase. I use them daily and clean them right away to avoid rust stains. They are still sharp and look new. =)
