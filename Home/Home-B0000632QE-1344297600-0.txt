review/summary: Good Googly Moogly!review/text: I like having fingers more than I like using this contraption.I bought this on June 25th. I think I used it three or four times. I liked that it all stored together. Except that taking it out of the storage thingy scared the bejeesus out of me every time I went to use it. Nothing would slide easily out and with those blades there was no safe place to get a good hold on anything to pull it out.It's sharp and it does slice just like it says. And the finger guard does work. Unless you are using one of the julienne blades and some food gets stuck in between them. Holy wow. Don't touch those things. I was shredding up a pile of brussels sprouts for dinner last night and I will say, even with those tough customers, the blades were slicing through them like buttah. Also, MY FINGER when I barely touched one while dislodging some sprout. I cleaned up and kept on slicing and telling myself I need to just be more careful. And then I was like "Self, being more careful in this situation? Means never touching this thing again." So I took the whole shebang and threw it in the trash. Because I am really far too much of a klutz to use such a thing ever without bodily harm. I finished shredding in my food processor. Which has way more parts and was a pain in the butt to wash, but it involved less bleeding into the dinner.So, if you aren't a fool like me, this could work for you.
