review/summary: This is NOT just a coffee grinder. It's meant for spices as wellreview/text: Some people in the reviews seem to think this is exclusively a coffee grinder. That is incorrect. It is a grinder that can be used for coffee AND spices. The retail box simply says Krups F203 Grinder. That is what it is called.In the details, it mentions that it is intended for use with coffee AND spices.Hope that clears it up for anyone who is confused as to what this grinder is meant to be used for.For dry spices and for coffee, it is fantastic. Produces a very nice and even grind. Does seem like it will need slightly more thorough cleaning after using certain spices, but that is to be expected.
