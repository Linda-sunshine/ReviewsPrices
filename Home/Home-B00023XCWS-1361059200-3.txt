review/summary: Procter Silex K2o7oy PERFECT for soup or HOT COCOreview/text: This is a good little pot for HEATING WATER...It has not had any 'Plastic' odor or taste for me. I use tap water and have enjoyed this pot for some time. It does have a short (3 foot or so) cord ,but I find it easy to un-plug it from the pot for easy pouring of the HOT WATER. It makes good Ramen noodles,HOT COCO,instant Coffee and TEA. I also use it for instant grits and instant oatmeal etc. It boils water faster than my 800 watt microwave and is more convenient.
