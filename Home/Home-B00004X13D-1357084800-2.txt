review/summary: Worked like a charm!review/text: I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He had asked for a waffle maker &#34;like hotels have.&#34; This was exactly what we were looking for and so inexpensive! Waffles tasted great and were easy to get out of the plates. Cleaning was kind of a chore but with this deal, I can't complain.
