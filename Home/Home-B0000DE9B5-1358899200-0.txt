review/summary: Airtight!review/text: I really like the lid on this jug. Once you set it in place, you can twist the mechanism to expand the seal to securely fit the lid. I don't know if it will hold the full contents while upside down, but I wouldn't be surprised - it's very secure and seems to seal completely. This is a big plus if you like fresh tea versus refrigerator flavored tea!The glass jug is also very nicely made and the opening is large enough for reaching inside to clean thoroughly. The large opening also serves one well when adding or removing tea bags.
