review/summary: Boy it's fastreview/text: This is just what I was looking for. It's fast and I can use butter if I want or have the popped corn just plain (when I am counting calories). It's really easy clean-up too. I had an older model, but I am glad I bought the new one because it cooks so much faster. It's just great.
