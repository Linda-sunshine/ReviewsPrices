review/summary: Bestever Fry Pan - T-falreview/text: Besides not being The Cook of the Year (or any, for that matter), I wish I could remember how many fry pans I've been through over 50 yrs.--I shudder to think what the total cost would be! After all these yrs. & all those pans, I finally find THE Frying Pan--this T-fal #E9380564. Now when I fry 2 eggs, they stay separate, they don't slide together to one side of a warped fry pan. OK, so I figured that it wasn't just the pans, I also was heating them too high or too far ahead before I put the food in them. This one not only stays flat, it has survived MY cooking for six months now! It's the Best! I highly recommend it.P.S. Cooking based on electric stoves, latter yrs. on ceramic-top electric.
