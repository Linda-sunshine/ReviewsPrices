review/summary: What a wonderfully simple espresso makerreview/text: I received this espresso maker for Christmas 2012. I've never used one before, but it didn't take long to figure out. The first pot that I made the seal between the top and bottom portions of the maker was not great, so some steam and residual water came out. I have not experienced that since, so it may have been the rubber gasket needed to be tempered by the first batch of espresso. This maker makes wonderful espresso--not at all bitter and I prefer it to most if not all forced-steam espresso. You can actually just drink the espresso as is, like coffee. Really very happy with product and would recommend it to anyone that really wants to enjoy espresso without taking out a second mortgage on their home.
