review/summary: Very steamy and waffles stickreview/text: It makes delicious waffles. Arguably the best waffle I've ever eaten at home. The only thing I don't like is the fact that steam constantly comes out the top. You need an oven glove to open the iron. I recommend that you use cooking spray because the waffles will stick or even tear apart. The non-stick surface allows for easy cleaning but it doesn't prevent the waffles from sticking.
