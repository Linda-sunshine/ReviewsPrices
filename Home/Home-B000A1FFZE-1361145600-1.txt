review/summary: Could've been engineered betterreview/text: I got this a year ago and I was so excited. It was exactly what I was looking for and it worked perfectly. Now, a year later, I dread having to use the toaster portion of it. The way it only has a little V-shaped bar at the bottom to hold the bread or whatever in there makes everything fold in half as it toasts and end up a mushy mess that I have to use toaster tongs to unlatch the bread from the bar so it will fall into the oven portion so I can open the door and get it out. And my food is now covered in all the burnt crumbs that have fallen onto the pan in the oven portion and continued to cook every time the toaster is used.Bread will sometimes work but frozen waffles, or anything else frozen for that matter, that will become pliable once defrosted will just become a soggy pile fallen into the oven because there are no sides to the toasting portion where the food is held while toasting. Very poor designing.However, the toaster oven does work well, except for the lack of timer. I use it so rarely though, so I will keep this unit to use for the occasional toaster oven needs, but I am buying a new, non-hybrid toaster. I just want to have toasted waffles again.
