review/summary: Comfortable and affordable chairreview/text: As a college student, a comfortable chair is a necessity. I bought this chair after reading the many favorable reviews. I can now say, after having this chair for a week, that I am completely satisfied with my purchase. The chair has four adjustments (back angle, tilt, height, armrest height) and the first three can be locked in any position in its range of motion.However, the cushion has a strong smell similar to that of memory foam. The odor has dissipated considerably, though.
