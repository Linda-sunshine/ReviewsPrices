review/summary: Absolutely amazing.review/text: I received this juicer as a gift from my husband for Christmas. I researched my options and after seeing the reviews for this particular juicer, I had made my decision. After using this for the first time today, I was so impressed with the product that I had to come on here to review.I precut my fruits and vegetables, turned the juicer on, and began to add the food into the basket. It was loud, but not deafening. Makes probably the same volume of noise a blender would. I started to add small amounts of vegetables in just to see what I was working with. I felt comfortable enough to add handfuls at a time and to my surprise it held up quite well. The juicer extracted the juice from the fruits and veggies effortlessly and there was no mess outside of the pulp container! This made me very, very happy. The juicer extracted approx. 14-16 ounces of juice, much more than anticipated as this was my first time using one.Clean up was a breeze. It comes apart easily and comes with a brush for cleaning. You'll want to clean this immediately or shortly after use as the left over pulp will stick to the unit making cleaning a nightmare.I'm beyond satisfied with this product thus far and will come back to update in a few months!
