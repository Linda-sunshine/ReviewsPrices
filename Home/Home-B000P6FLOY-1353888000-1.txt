review/summary: Cable not as advertised and fails after 4 uses.review/text: I purchased this thermometer after my Maverick failed after several years of use. I used the new item a total of 4-times and it already displays "Hi" on the temperature reading which apparently indicates a failed cable. I kept this item after receiving a plastic coating cable assuming that it would be equal quality to the metal version. I guess I will purchase a new cable for my old Maverick since that never had any issues. I'm just afraid to replace the cord on the Polder in case there is more to it than just a lower quality cable.
