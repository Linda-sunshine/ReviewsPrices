review/summary: Brita filters defects... bewarereview/text: Please note, other than this one incident I have been fairly happy with my Brita water filter.I purchased a 5 pack of pitcher filters from a well known home and garden store in Burbank, Ca. I open the pack, and started using the first filter I grabbed. I noticed that the water was filtering through at a rate quicker than I had ever seen with my Brita water pitcher. Upon closer examination, it turned out to be a manufacturing problem with the filter itself. The edges of the filter were somehow flattened (it wasn't perfectly round) and the unfiltered water was pouring through the cracks. I was angry, but understood that this can happen sometimes, maybe it was just a fluke. So I opened the next one in the box. This filter had the same problem, the edges of the filter didn't fit with a tight seal. It is past the window of returning the product to the store where I bought these filters. At over $5 per filter, I feel like my money is literally being poured down the kitchen sink...
