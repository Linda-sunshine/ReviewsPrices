review/summary: Great vac!review/text: I accidentally ordered this vacuum and Im glad I did! Never mind how I did that the point is this vacuum is great. It's light weight which makes it super easy to maneuver and for being small it has great suction power. I have a dog and a cat and it sucks up any hair left behind not to mention my toddlers cracker messes. The price of the vacuum makes it even better. I'm generally too lazy to write reviews but I had to on this product. Excellent buy!
