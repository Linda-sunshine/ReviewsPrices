review/summary: The Best Ever!review/text: We first bought a very expensive electric motor meat grinder and it wouldn't handle the job. We returned it and decided to go for a manual one..., a bit more updated and easier to clean. This is the best! We grind all our dog's meat from the butcher without incurring extra charges (at the store for grinding). It is super easy to assemble, easy to wash and you can suction this to any solid countertop (or maybe even a square tile?). We've used it 5 times already and each time it's a breeze to use and clean.
