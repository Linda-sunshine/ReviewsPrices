review/summary: excellent product!!review/text: I read the reviews before I purchased it and actually everything said was correct. It works in max. two minutes, only a few kernels did not pop out, easy to use a clean and the price is excellent.It is healthier than the popcorn to use with microwaves and you can add any combinations of ingredients or flavors, such as butter, salt, black pepper, etc.I recommend it without reserves.
