review/summary: Wonderful Coffee, Fantastic Coffeemaker and One LIttle Downsidereview/text: I LOVE THIS MACHINE!!! It is very easy to use and makes delicious coffee. My husband bought this coffeemaker for me with an Amazon gift certificate from my daughter and son-in-law. We are all frequent Amazon customers.I love the overall design and the retro toggle switch. I knew that the machine would be tall, but it is no problem to slide it out from under the cabinets to use it. The lid of the pot comes off for cleaning which makes it fine for the dishwasher or hand washing. There are two brewing settings -- one for up to four cups and one for the full twelve. Each makes equally good coffee. It even has a feature which allows you to select the carafe temperature. There is a faint chime which dings 5 times to tell you that the coffee is nearly ready. If you like to leave your pot on for longer periods, there is a feature which chimes twice and then turns the unit off after four hours. It also has the brew/pause feature for those who want to have a cup before all the cups are brewed.The only down side to the design of the unit, in my opinion, concerns the water reservoir. I have no problem with its location. It is easy to fill. The complaint I have is that there is no way to see how much water you have put in it. There is some type of step system INSIDE the reservoir which you are supposed to be able to see, but you can't see any of them except for the top "step" which is the twelve cup measure. They would be better off leaving a clear sleeve on the side of the unit with the cup measurements clearly displayed on the side of it, much like a thermometer.Other then that relatively small inconvenience, the I would recommend the Cuisinart DCC-1200 series to anyone.
