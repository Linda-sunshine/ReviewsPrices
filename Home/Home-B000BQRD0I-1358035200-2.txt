review/summary: WOW!review/text: Given the difference in prices of steamers, I was a little reluctant to try this one until I actually saw it in use at a friend's consignment shop. It does exactly what it's supposed to do. Heats up very quickly, produces a good flow of steam, is very user-friendly, and you don't need a degree in engineering to set it up! Some of the reviewers of this steamer commented that the unit is not as tall as they'd like, and find it somewhat awkward in terms of having to bend down to steam the bottom of a garment. Being quite small, this is not an issue for me. My friend who has the shop is very tall, and has gotten around this problem by hanging her items to steam on a higher pole rack. One thing that would be helpful--hey SteamFast, take note of this--would be a brake on one or both of the wheels so the unit doesn't roll so easily while using it, particularly on a tile floor. (I've fixed this problem by putting it on a small rug, which helps a lot.) But I have to say that given the price of this machine, you can't go wrong. I absolutely love it!
