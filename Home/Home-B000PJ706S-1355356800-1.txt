review/summary: Looks pretty but only worked for 2 monthsreview/text: I purchased this kettle for my mother who used it for months and loved it. She had no problems with smells or deposits and she uses it every day. When I visited her, she told me how much she loves using it. When I used the kettle, I found it to be quite wonderful too. Later, I purchased this kettle for my home. It worked great for the first two months. We use filtered water so there were no deposits or bad smells either. For no discernible reason, the heating element just stopped working. I called Capresso. Without the sales receipt there is nothing they could do for me. I did not keep the sales receipt and therefore can't prove the date of purchase. While I liked the looks of the clear carafe, I replaced this kettle with another brand.
