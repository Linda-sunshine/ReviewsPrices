review/summary: Thank you Amazonreview/text: This rating is actually 5 stars for the Amazon service, but less for the product. I purchased for a Christmas present. Unfortunately, the brushes in the front did not rotate. I tried several different non-invasive things, but no luck. The rest of the vacuum worked fine. When I contacted Amazon about a return, it was past the return window. My fault for not paying close enough attention, but when I explained it had been for a Christmas present, they were kind enough to refund my money. I appreciate that very much. So, this rating is actually 5 stars for the Amazon service and I will give the product 3 stars. Again, thank you Amazon.
