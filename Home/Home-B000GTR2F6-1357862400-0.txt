review/summary: Love it!review/text: Santa gave it to us for Christmas!!! Love it!!! My husband and I use it daily. Before, we always went out for our coffee! It smells so good brewing in the morning and the options for drinks is wonderful! Would highly recommend to anyone who likes hot chocolate, cider, or tea....it is so easy to use!!!
