review/summary: Do not purchase from this seller *Update- don't buy this item. Period.review/text: I have purchased this item many times from the store, and it worked fine. This was my first time purchasing the item on Amazon, and the product was damaged and did not work properly. I had a problem with all three filters- the carbon filter leaked out during the pre-soak step. They clogged quickly, so this was basically a waste of my $. After a short time, water would remain at the top of the filter setup. I wish I had returned them after trying the first filter instead of taking a chance on the other ones.*Update. Well, I just read some other reviewers comments and learned that Pur changed the design of their water filters. So I guess the other stores will carry the same item. Guess I'm going to have to trash my Pur water dispenser and buy into a different brand.
