review/summary: Meh...review/text: I have been using an Ingenuitea Teapot for a couple months.The Good:- Easily makes a fine cup of tea.- Lid keeps tea hot during steeping.The Bad:- The attached lid makes it difficult to empty the brewed tea out, clean the cup, and dry. Also, it won't easily fit in the dishwasher or drainer.- Tea leaves get caught in handle and hinge.- It's made out of plastic--yes, BPA-free plastic but plastic nonetheless.- Doesn't fit larger mugs. Work-around is to hold it over the mug and press the bottom of the Ingenuitea with the end of a spoon.- Not sure how this is any better than my ceramic infuser cup that cost $10 and has none of the above issues.
