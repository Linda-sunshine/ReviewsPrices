review/summary: Great buy for the Pricereview/text: I enjoy the juicer and it is great for beginners, which I was. It is a little noisy but it gets the job done! I am going to exchange it because it doesn't juice soft foods like spinach well, yielding very little juice and because I'm juicing everyday I realized I need a 1000 Watt juicer but at the price this one is sold and to be 800 Watt it is a great buy.
