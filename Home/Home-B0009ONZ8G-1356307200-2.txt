review/summary: Hoover Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuum, Baggedreview/text: The packaging of this product sucked! We received the vacuum cleaner via UPS three days ago in its original box, not double boxed. When we opened the box, we found a tool holder had been broken off so there was no place to contain the tool. There was not even any styrofoam nor any other packaging material to hold the product and its parts from rattling in the box! There is no way to replace the tool holder as it is part of the body of the vacuum, which appears to be made from cheap plastic. As to performance, however, the vacuum performed well. The suction is great and the vacuum cleaner is very easy to handle because of its lightness. I intend to contact the manufacturer and let them know they should improve on their packaging to avoid breakage on future shipments.
