review/summary: Juicing Like Canseco.review/text: The first thing I want to tell you is that this does fit on my countertop under the wall cabinets in my kitchen, which is a standard sized space. I thought I read one review that said it didn't, so that was my first concern. You must pull it front to use, of course. It's clean, easy, and simple to use: you can even juice right into a tall glass most of the time, although I wouldn't do that with beet juice just in case.It's a beautiful machine that says quality in every way. I suspect the clear plastic pieces will remain clear much longer if you don't put them in the dishwasher or use anything harsh to scrub them.You probably know already that a masticating juicer will get more juice out of most things - especially leafy greens and soft fruits - but will take much more time and not be as easy to clean. Also that one should juice immediately before consumption for maximum benefits. Therefore, one could probably get dryer pulp with a masticating juicer instead of this one, but this is faster and easier to clean. That said, it is fairly easy to clean, but it still takes some work. If you're not cleaning right away, you need to soak the pieces. In that case, be careful the metal pieces don't scratch each other in the soaking container.I mostly got it for apples, which make a great base and taste so much better than that corn syrup-infused crap they sell in the store. I also like the froth, so be sure to try it without removing the froth.
