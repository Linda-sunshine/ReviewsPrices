review/summary: Cheap, works as listedreview/text: Glass / ceramic cooktop with 9.25" burner (kitchenaid). If your burner is smaller you might want to get an separate burner. Didn't experience the foggy/condensation on the guage. I tightened it with a wrench.30min to get to pressure25min to coolYou 100% need the weighted rocker/regulator found here to ensure gauge is accurate and cuts back on having to constantly monitor the pressure:www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HMBVQ8/Canning 24/7 and/or using an outside gas burner - get the all-american 921("Caution: Do not use pressure canner on an outdoor LP gas burner or gas range over 12,000 BTU's.")Even heavy garden canning should have no problem with this. I'll eventually get the 921 but for now this works great.Cons:Can't be used outside on gas burnerRubber seal with eventually fail ($10)
