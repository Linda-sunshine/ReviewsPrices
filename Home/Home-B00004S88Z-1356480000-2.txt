review/summary: The bestreview/text: I was flip-flopping between this product and another well-known name brand: Presto. I insist on supporting US companies, and All American is still all-American. Don't let Presto fool you! They moved their productions to China years ago. I didn't want to spend this much money, but I'm so glad I did. I've had no issues with the Canner and would recommend it to anyone who has the money to afford it. My friend purchased the Presto and is regretting it. The pressure gauge was set incorrectly at the factory when she received it. She's had one problem after another. I didn't have the heart to say &#34;I told you so,&#34;...but I really did try to convince her to buy the All American. Don't make the same mistake she did! I'll pass my All American canner on to my daughter one day...she'll pass hers to the curb.
