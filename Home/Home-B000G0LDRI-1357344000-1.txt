review/summary: Humidifier Does the Jobreview/text: I looked around for a while before purchasing this humidifier. I read lots of reviews and when it came down to it I purchased this humidifier. This humidifier was a lower price and smaller than other units I looked at. It has two separate water containers. They each hold about 4.5 gallons of water. You do have to refill them frequently, sometimes twice a day, but that is expected to provider adequate humidity. We have wood flooring in the living room and den and were looking for a humidifier that would provide enough humidity to protect our flooring. The humidity level does feel comfortable in the house now and my nose is thankful for that! We did purchase a bacteriostatic liquid to add to the water to inhibit bacterial growth. I haven't seen any mildew yet. We have been using this for about 1.5 months. The only problem I have had with this humidifier is that the filter is now beginning to fall to pieces. I'm not sure how frequently they are supposed to be replaced, but I feel it should have lasted longer than this. All in all, I do recommend this humidifier.
