review/summary: Designed to failreview/text: This is the THIRD one of these that I've had fail immediately after the warranty period. I've used this 3-4 times per week with only bottled water. I've descaled it several times during the year and still haven't had any luck. This one failed two weeks after the warranty period ended.Taking into consideration the failure of these after the warranty period, I believe Keurig has designed them to last just long enough to get past the 12-month warranty. I wish there was a higher quality version. The upgraded and commercial models just seem to be fancier versions with the same unreliable guts.It's a great idea and convienent when it works, but they just can't seem to make them last very long.
