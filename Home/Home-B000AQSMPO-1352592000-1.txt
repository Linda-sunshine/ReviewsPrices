review/summary: K-Cuppingreview/text: I mainly enjoy the Keurig B60 on the weekends. It took no time to go through the sampler pack that comes with the unit. Most coffees were too weak for my taste, but still enjoyed the freebie.So far so good, working flawlessly. I wished there is an option to use a LARGE K-cup filter that would hold twice as much coffee grounds as the Keurig has LARGER brew sizes. I currently use the middle button for all my brewing.A friends B60 has stopped working after eight months and the retailer would not exchange it or give directions on how to get it fixed. Would think that they would exchange it, as Keurig makes their money on the K-cups.
