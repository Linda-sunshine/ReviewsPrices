review/summary: auto off?review/text: We just got ours a couple of days and for the most part love it. It makes great tasting coffee. My only problem is that for some reason it turns itself off even though we don't use the auto off feature. I went to the programming to be sure the timer on the auto off was set to 0:00. Any suggestions would be appreciated. We actually purchased this one because we could opt to not have it shut itself off.
