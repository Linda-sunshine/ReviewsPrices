review/summary: pleased with this pitcherreview/text: Pitcher is great for me as I'm a college student who got tired of using so many plastic water bottles in my dorm. Holds a decent amount of water for a single person or two. Its well made and filters moderately quickly. I gave it 4 stars because the actual white filter basin cracked slightly at the top within the first month. This might have been from pushing the lid on too hard but it doesn't affect the product. For the price I'm saving a lot of money and plastic water bottles.
