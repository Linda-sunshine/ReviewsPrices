review/summary: Bought this with great expectations, but was disappointedreview/text: I bought this canner with great expectations, but was very disappointed. It was expensive and I was willing to pay the price for a really good canner. The problem I had was that it was VERY heavy, which is good, unless you also cannot get the lid off, which is not good. I tried this canner several times and every time the lid was a struggle to remove. The biggest selling point to me was that it didn't need a rubber gasket. The biggest disappointment for me was that the lid didn't come off (because it didn't need a gasket).The upshot. Get a Presto canner with the gasket for lots less money. I now have 2 of them and they've worked well for me for years.
