review/summary: Best travel mug ever -- hot or coldreview/text: I love this mug! It keeps my tea hot for literally hours, for those times when I drive off with it in the car, leave it for a yoga class, and return -- still hot. And it keeps things just as well cold. In fact, I often have to remember to take the lid off so it cools just a little. And if I need to pop it in my purse, the cover keeps it sealed tight.
