review/summary: Well it works as advertisedreview/text: I read reviews about the automatic time set being a problem, etc. For me, I opened the box, plugged it in and it worked as advertised. I give it four stars for that reason. I realize it was not especially expensive, but the controls are really flimsy. I wish they had made it a little more durable and sturdy, it seems like it is really easy to break. Features are fine, I really like the adjustable brightness. Advice to Sony: Build a better product and charge a few more bucks. Put dials on it that do not feel like they are about to fall off.
