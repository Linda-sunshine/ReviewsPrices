review/summary: Lid does not fit!review/text: I purchased this for my husband for christmas along with a high power juicer. I wrapped it up and put it under the tree without inspecting it much. I sure with I had. The glass part of the jug is great but the lid does not work. You are supposed to turn it and the rubber gasket moves to "close" and "open". The one I got stay open no matter which way it is turned so the lid just lays on top and does not seal. Very disappointed that I can't return it because it has been over 30 days since purchase and my husband opening it for Christmas. Will not purchase this brand again.
