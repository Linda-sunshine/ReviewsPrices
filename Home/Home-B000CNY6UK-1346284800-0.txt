review/summary: Best Brewer EVER!review/text: Who knew brewing great espresso could be this EASY?! I've used other methods for making espresso and there was always a "trick" to it that just made it kind of a pain to do, plus the coffee always came out tasting somewhat bitter. Using the 6-Cup Bialetti Moka Pot could not have been more simple, and the coffee itself came out smooth and rich, no bitterness at all! Finally, an idiot-proof way to brew fabulous espresso, and it's been right here all along...Thank You, Bialetti!
