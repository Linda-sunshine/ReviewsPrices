review/summary: Awesome Coffee! Great Customer Service!review/text: We use our Keurig about 10 times a day and LOVE the coffee. After over a year's worth of this abuse the machine started to malfunction a bit by not always providing full cups of coffee. We spoke with customer service and even though it is out of warranty they are sending us a brand new Keurig! Now THAT is customer service and a product I LOVE!
