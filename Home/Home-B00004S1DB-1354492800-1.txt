review/summary: Great Product with Exceptional Durabilityreview/text: About a week after I purchased this Nissan French Press, I managed to knock it off the counter just after filling it with hot water and freshly ground coffee. While it took 1 1/2 hours to clean up the mess- it got into every nook and cranny- the pot itself came through with flying colors. It truly is nearly indestructable!A couple of reviews I perused before purchasing this press complained about problems with coffee grounds in the finished product, but I believe the cause is operator error. The top 1/2" or so of the interior stainless steel has a slightly larger diameter, which is undoubtedly intended to make it easier to insert and remove the press/filter unit. If you overfill the pot so that the water and ground coffee enter that depression, the press/filter does not have a chance to compress against the wall to create a proper seal as it is depressed.I do second a suggestion in one of the other reviews that the filter/press unit should be tilted while removing it from the pot. To make that easier, just lift the plastic top together with the knob of the press/filter, and removal is a snap.In summation, this is a great product, and anyone who can't make great coffee with it probably shouldn't handle objects with sharp edges nor attempt to operate a motor vehicle.
