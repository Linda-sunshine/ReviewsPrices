review/summary: Great addition to my kitchenreview/text: As someone who is new to wine drinking, this thing was just what I needed. I always seem to mess up opening wine bottles. I either have to try to open few times before succeeding or the cork breaks and little pieces fall into wine (I don't have to tell you why this creates a big problem for me). Now for this magnificent little creation.This wine opener has a little thing in the back of the charger that you use to break the little aluminum seal on wine bottles. You can easily hold it in your hand, slide it on top of the wine bottle, turn it one full circle (or two) and you are ready to open your wine.The actual wine opener is great. It comes charged a bit but I left it for entire night to charge it completely before use it. It is very simple to use. You place the device on a wine bottle, press the down button on a side and push down (not too hard). After a bit, you will feel like there is nothing happening which means the bottle is open. You press the up button on a side of the device and the cork comes off the little spiral thing that opened the bottle. It works the same way as regular, manual wine opener. Its just that it is easier to open wine with it. I used it few times and it worked like a charm.Overall, this product is great. I don't know how long it will last me before it decides to give up, but so far it works fine. It makes opening wine kind of fun and the whole process is pretty effortless. What more could I want. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do my fellow wine drinkers.
