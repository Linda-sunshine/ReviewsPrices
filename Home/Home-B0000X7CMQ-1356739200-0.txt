review/summary: almost perfectreview/text: When our coffeemaker bit the dust we reverted to manually pouring hot water through a cone filter into a carafe. Sure like the way coffee made this way tastes, but missed the convenience. We were looking for a thermal carafe coffeemaker with a timer to start it up in the morning.After a few days we're happy with the Zojirushi. Although it's made mostly of plastic it has a high quality look and feel. It makes good tasting coffee. If it keeps working well it will have been a good purchase.There are a few quirks to consider:When in use the carafe is meant to be the left side, not the front. It has a small footprint but is rather tall. Those might be problems depending on where you want to put it.Assembly is a little fiddly. The brew basket has a tab to make sure it's in correctly and a folding handle that needs to lay flat but #4 filters are a little too tall for everything to work smoothly. Not a biggie, just a little odd.The top of the carafe tightens up after the carafe is filled with hot liquid, so don't screw it down tight before brewing or you'll have a lot of trouble opening it to the pouring position. There is a separate, non-essential cap for the top and no place to store it. I guess you're supposed to put it on after brewing, if you can still find it.
