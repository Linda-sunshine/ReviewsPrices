review/summary: Great Steam Shot, Great Pricereview/text: I went to Bed Bath and Beyond to purchase an iron and was bewildered by the large assortment of irons there. So I went home and did some research online and this iron seemed well rated plus VERY reasonable at $40. I ordered one and the day it came, my college age daughter was home. She saw the new iron and asked if she could have my old one, I said yes. Then she used the new iron and we were both impressed with the 'steam shot' feature. And then she asked if she could have the NEW iron, lol. I said yes again. For $40, I'll order another one which I did.I've seen some reviews complain about the little cap that covers where you pour the water in getting broken off. It seems pretty secure to me, I can't see that becoming a problem.Great price, great iron. Don't waste your money on ones that are multiple times more expensive!
