review/summary: My all around skilletreview/text: I got mine for free when I was at friend's house and their maid had no idea how to clean it and made it nice and rusty. It was easy to re-season it, this is what I did, scrub out all the rust, then wash, dry, mean time heat the stove to about 350 F, when it's ready I rubbed bacon fat all over the pan and put it in there for 4 hours. After the 4th hour, I just turned the oven off and let it cool. Ever since it has worked perfect. I like to make eggs in it and always caramelize onions. Everything that comes out tastes so good.
