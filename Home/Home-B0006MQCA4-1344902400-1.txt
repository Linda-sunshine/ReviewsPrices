review/summary: Exceptionalreview/text: I should have bought one of these years ago. I have used others (in other peoples' fridges). This one fits in the fridge great because of its depth and narrowness. I wouldn't trade it for another. I use this in a smallish, top freezer Hotpoint fridge.I go through one fill up a day. It's easy to pull out and to fill for elder people like me.Also, my family and guests love it!
