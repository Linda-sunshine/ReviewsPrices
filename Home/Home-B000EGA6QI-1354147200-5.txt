review/summary: Super super awesomereview/text: I love this kitchen gadget and so will you! I am writing this review specifically to address the other reviews about it breaking after moderate use over a long period of time. Some say after 6 or 7 months you will have to get a new one. Well I am here to tell you I have owned mine for over a year and its just as magical as the first day I used it! And I use it at least 4 times a week to make "ice cream" out of frozen bananas and other frozen fruits. I even used it to blend walnuts and cashews for a vegan cheese sauce. Perfecto! And honestly if it were to go ca-put on me, I would gladly pay for another one because its the best darn $30 bucks I've spent/ will spend :)
