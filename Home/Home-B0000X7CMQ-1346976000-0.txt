review/summary: A huge disappointmentreview/text: I have several Zojirushi products, including a small coffee maker and a rice cooker. I have been extremely pleased with all of my Zojirushi purchases, so when my old large coffee maker started having problems, I immediately went to Zojirushi for the replacement. Unfortunately, this product does not match up to the level of quality of my other Zojirushi appliances.As others have noted, the lid of the carafe is poorly designed, the filter basket does not properly accommodate the #4 filters needed for the coffee maker, and worst of all, the reservoir leaks water onto the countertop no matter how much or how little water is in it.There's no excuse for such poor design, engineering, and build quality. This item is going back.Update: I ordered aMelitta 46894 10-Cup Thermal Coffeemakeras a replacement, based on comments from another reviewer. The Melitta is a much better coffee maker than the Zojirushi. No problems, no particularly weird design or usage quirks. So far, it's doing exactly what I would expect this type of coffee maker to do, and it costs less than the Zojirushi.
