review/summary: ???review/text: I used this to make smaller amount of tea than what I make in my teapot for a few times and poured the ready tea into a cup. The first time I actually used it to drink out of I realized it doesn't seal and poured all over myself in the car. I'm not sure if they are all this way or mine is just defective, but I'm thinking and hoping its the later because I read good reviews of this product before ordering.
