review/summary: Great for what it isreview/text: Bought this to make blended soups and smoothies. It does the job perfectly, and is super easy to use. The included cup makes is especially useful for making post workout shakes and frozen fruit smoothies because it is plastic (ie no need to worry about breaking it).Took off one star because the blade section is not that easy to clean.Overall, I love this purchase and have been using it at least 2x a week. Much better than Jamba Juice...
