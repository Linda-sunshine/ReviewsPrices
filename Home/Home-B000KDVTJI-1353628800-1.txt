review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: Unfortunately I bought this kettle as a gift for my brother and sister in law. After the first use, it failed to shut off when the water reached boiling point. Repeated attempts yielded the same result. The kettle will be returned. Needless to say, I am disappointed.
