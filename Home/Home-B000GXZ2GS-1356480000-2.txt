review/summary: My gift of choice in 2012!review/text: I purchased one of these in February, 2012 and quickly fell in love. My 3-year old Keurig croaked and I bought this as a quick fix to use until I decided what type of machine I would purchase next. I'm still using my AeroPress. I live in a remote area and we are subject to random power outages and sometimes we have no power for days on end. When that happens, I'm forced to drive 25 miles (no exaggeration) for my morning coffee. I came across a product this year called a "Kelly Kettle" that boils water and in conjunction with my AeroPress, I'm all set when the lights go out. This year, my gift of choice (for those I love) was the Kelly Kettle and the AeroPress. Both make a wonderful addition to the emergency kit but I never have to look further than my kitchen counter for my well-worn AeroPress. My only complaint is that it is made of plastic and over time, plastic cracks and shows wear. As long as it's working though, I don't mind that it doesn't look new. I boil my water in an electric kettle (when I have electric...lol) and I make my coffee VERY strong and push it through the press (about 3/4 cup) then I add more water from the kettle to fill the cup. Depending on the amount of coffee and water used, you can make it as strong or weak as you want. I previously used Gevalia but it is expensive and takes too long to ship so I've found a relatively inexpensive ground coffee that works well with my AeroPress. It is Cafe Bustelo. I'm surprisingly pleased by the taste but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't taste great in a traditional brewer. Aero take the "bite" out of it. AeroPress is a little expensive but I will definitely be getting another when this one wears out.
