review/summary: Convient and Clean Tasting Waterreview/text: Bought this to have cool, filter water ready without having to keep filling up smaller pitchers. It fits perfectly in my fridge and is very easy to fill up. Gave it 4 stars because it always does one extra drip after I use the spout, but not enough for me to return the product or have it be a major issue. I really enjoy having clean, fresh, cool water readily available!
