review/summary: AWESOME!review/text: First, this clock was purchased for my 9 year old son. The reception is great thanks to the fact that the power cord is also an antenna. there is an A and B alarm that are easy to set. The radio tuner and volume are located on the side, easy. there is a sleep timer that has different settings and is accessed via the button &#34;SLEEP&#34;. (the radio will shut off after a specified period of time when in SLEEP mode) Radio has an ON/OFF button. This is a simple, well made clock that is easy to use and gets awesome reception. I love it.
