review/summary: Why doesn't the vapor come out the nose?review/text: I'm so happy that a company makes a product like this--a dragon has _tons_ more character than a frog. I am really disappointed that the vapor comes out the eyes and not the nose. It's also a bit of a pain to clean--although my experience says that is true of just about any humidifier.This has run constantly in my son's room for a couple years. It seems like a quality product.Now if I could just hack it so it works like a &#34;real&#34; dragon :)
