review/summary: Broke after 5 loaves, terrible customer servicereview/text: After making only 5 loaves of bread the "D" slot in the mix/kneed paddle was worn so badly the paddle had almost 90 degrees of free play on the motor shaft. I called customer service and after ten minutes of explaining they still could not understand my complaint. I was told I would have to bring my machine to the nearest repair center in New Jersey to have it serviced. I live in South Carolina. The Rep had no idea how far away they are from each other. They refused to send me a new paddle.
