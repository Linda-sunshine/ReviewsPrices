review/summary: A MUST for your FoodSaverreview/text: If you have a FoodSaver with an accessory port, you really need to get yourself the jar sealer. The bags are great for meats and certain items, but are expensive and only good for a single use. With this gadget (either wide mouth or regular mouth, depending on your jars) everyday canning jars and their lids can be used over and over, sealing in freshness and extending the shelf life of so many foods. Nuts, marshmallows, grated cheese, crackers, and all your baking ingredients can be stored for extended periods of time. Super fast and easy to use, too! As a plus, they will help make your pantry look neat and organized.A brief tutorial: Just place the food in the canning jar, cover with a clean lid, and place the jar sealer over the lid. Attach the hose from the jar sealer to the FoodSaver, and press the vacuum/seal button. When it finishes vacuuming, quickly remove the hose from the jar sealer (do not remove the jar sealer itself just yet). You will hear a small release of air. Hold the jar sealer down on the jar for a few seconds and then remove the jar sealer. Your jar should now be sealed. You need just one jar sealer for all of your jars.Some pointers -Do not put the screw-on bands on the jars when you are sealing them. You can put them on afterwards if you must, but they are not necessary.Place a piece of waxed paper, coffee filter or paper towel over powdery food items such as flour to prevent them from being sucked into the tube.Be sure your jars are clean and free of chips or cracks.If a jar won't seal, try placing two canning lids on the jar and sealing again. If it still won't seal, try a different lid or another jar.Even after a jar seals, it may not stay sealed. Check lids periodically.Ace Hardware carries a full range of jar sizes, from 1/2 pint to 2 quart (1/2 gallon), which are hard to find.
