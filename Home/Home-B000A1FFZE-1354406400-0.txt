review/summary: Great at First But Doesn't Lastreview/text: Since I live in a small NYC apt with a small kitchen, this little toaster/oven seemed like a great idea. Got it two months ago and if I'd written review then it would have been a rave. Toasted evenly, baked efficiently and took up so little space! But after only six weeks the toaster part started to toast unevenly and the oven baked unevenly. After two months, only the top area of each slice gets toasted and the rest is just warm. I'm very disappointed and considering a return but don't know what to buy instead.
