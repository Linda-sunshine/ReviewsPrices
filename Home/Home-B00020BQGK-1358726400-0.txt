review/summary: Excellent Hardfloor Stick Vacreview/text: We have an Australian Shepherd in the home, and use this vacuum on about 1000 sqft hard floor. If you switch to carpet setting to dislodge the hair around the brushroll twice during vacuuming it will cut down on pulling the hair out of the brushroll. I gently wash the filter and the canister after each use. My 16 year old hoover stick has been retired to the upstairs baths. I'm so impressed I bought one for my daughter, who gives the tip on dislodging the hair.
