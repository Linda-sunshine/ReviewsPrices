review/summary: Good pricereview/text: The 4-pack was the best price I could find without being a huge package. Sure, you can buy 20 of them and save a few pennies, but it is worth it to use up an entire cabinet to store filters for 5 years? Since this one is only a few cents more than the 3-pack, you definitely should go with the 4-pack. It works fine.
