review/summary: Color is NOT ivoryreview/text: I recently received these sheets and as soon as I opened the box I could tell that the sheets weren't the color in the description or in the picture on Amazon. I ordered the ivory queen-size sheet set and what I received (though it says ivory on the package) is more like beige or tan. My understanding has always been that ivory is off-white but this is at least 2-3 shades darker than that. I'll be sending these back.
