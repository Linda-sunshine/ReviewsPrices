review/summary: Awesome little vacuum!review/text: I bought this to do my stairs and it works great! I have two cats (one is long hair) and it gets the hair up really well on the steps and on furniture. You do have to clean the hair out of the roller occasionally, but it's well worth it! The attached wand makes the whole process very quick and easy.
