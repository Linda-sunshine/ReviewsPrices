review/summary: Excellent choicereview/text: This is an excellent choice for my house. After using it, I actually wanted to clean a bigger area. This is a better option for my household. We would rather have our very own carpet cleaner than having to rent, borrow, or hire a professional. Professionals do a great job, but the representatives that they send out earn their money by up-selling various cleaning products and services. While borrowing you have to be extremely careful so that you won't possibly break it. Rental machines have no guarantee that they are properly maintained and ready for usage. Plus they are extremely heavy and cumbersome. This is marginally heavier than my vacuum cleaner which makes it a a breeze to use. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST!!!
