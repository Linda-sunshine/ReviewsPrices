review/summary: Beware, no long term storage of this item!review/text: The coffeemaker itself is wonderful. Easy to use and makes great coffee. However, I switch back and forth between espresso and brewed coffee every now and then. What I didn't know when I bought this item is that there is no way to fully drain the coffeemaker of water for long term (or even short term) storage. I looked online for ways to drain the maker to get it off of my counter while using my espresso machine. I tried every recommendation to no avail. Finally, I emailed customer support for Keurig inquiring as to how to drain the unit for long term storage and was told there is no way to do that. I was instructed to run a few water cycles through the unit after taking it out of storage. But yuck! Imagine if the water had been sitting in there for months! Running a few cycles might clean it to a degree, but clean, pure water tubing is such a big part of the success of a good tasting cup of coffee. A huge design flaw. I ended up giving mine away--my house is small with little storage. I'm back to my DeLonghi EC155 full time (an amazing machine, by the way, that has never done me wrong. Great price, easy to use, wonderful espresso. Only downside--I drink too much espresso when its on my countertop!).
