review/summary: So far so good - but where's the froth??review/text: Can anyone help me?? I'm using cold skim milk but I can't seem to get it to froth - it's just hot milk? I'm following the directions. The espresso making is great! I'm using Starbucks espresso roast and even bought the vanilla syrup. Love the machine.....I just want my milk to froth so I can enjoy a vanilla latte or a caramel machiatto. Thanks!
