review/summary: water spills into handle and then spills on the floor...review/text: It is amazing that someone thought of such a design! The top of the handle is open, wide open. Therefore, the water easily spills into the handle (which is hollow, BTW), and the bottom of the handle is not closed tight, so the water spills on the floor, in the fridge (your choice...) You do not even need to fill the tank completely, halfway is enough, just washing the thing is sufficient, et voila! water on the floor! Magic! Don't buy this!
