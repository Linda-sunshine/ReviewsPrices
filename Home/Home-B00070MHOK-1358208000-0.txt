review/summary: I love this product!!! Convenient and Efficient.review/text: I've read the reviews on Amazon before buying this product and I'm so glad that I went with my gut! I don't understand why other customers were bitching about this product, when it does such a great job in steaming my clothes, making them look straighter and smoother. Forget about the huge ironing table and the heavy steam iron, which could potentially hurt my child if it falls, while she's running around. You don't even need to iron your clothes in advance any more, because this little fabric steamer takes less 2 minutes to heat up. It works like a gem when you're running short of time in the morning but still want to look nice. Be sure to hold it up straight, you can tilt it a little bit to work with the line of the fabric but don't tilt too much because there's still water in there. It works best on chiffon, silk, cotton, and spandex fabrics. This steamer is actually smaller than it looks in the pictures, so it is perfect for traveling. After using this fabric steamer, I was so happy that I ended up ordering another one for my parents as a gift. Ironing has never been a joy for me before until I meet this little gem. Good-bye heavy iron!
