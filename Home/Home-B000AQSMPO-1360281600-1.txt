review/summary: I use it all the time!review/text: I love that I don't have to fill the water everyday. I like to use the water from my filter pitcher and it is nice knowing it has its own filter in the water bin. I actually just used the ekobrew for the second time this morning and it did a great job :). No problems so far.
