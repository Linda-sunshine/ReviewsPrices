review/summary: Easy Assemblyreview/text: The price and product are great! Many of the larger chairs are a lot more expensive but I'm not heavy in weight or large in stature so this chair fit my in nursery comfortably and its cushions are just enough. It is true to the imagine shown and the colors are true. My only concern is the chemical smell on the cushions. Otherwise between all that and 30 minutes or less assembly I am SOLD and would recommend this product to a friend.
