review/summary: Taylor 7506 Digital Scale purchased from Amazonreview/text: I purchased this scale from Amazon September 15 2010 and it worked fine until right after Christmas 2012 when it came on and then blanked out. I removed the battery, which they advertise as lasting several years, checked it and it showed 2.97V. I tried it again and it worked fine with a very dark reading. The next morning and for 3 mornings after that I did the same thing and it worked fine until one morning it would not work at all. I contacted Taylor for help in trying to find out if It could be fixed but to this day have not had the courtesy of a reply. Is this the normal life of this scale or was it just my bad luck? I was using a Borg scale that was at least 45 years old (I am 86 and have had it forever it seems) but thought it might not be accurate any more. Guess I will be better off staying with the old Borg.I finally received answer from Taylor (Brad from Support) and explained problems. He was very cordial and said I would receive a new one today (Jan 17,2013) which I did. It is the same model but appears to be an upgrade and works perfectly so far. I have upgraded from a 2 to a 4 star Thanks Taylor for your help in renewing my confidence.
