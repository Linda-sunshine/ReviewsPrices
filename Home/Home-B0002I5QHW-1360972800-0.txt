review/summary: LOVE IT!review/text: This is the first meat grinder I bought. I didn't want to eat the crap that is store bought ground beef. I got it because of the rave reviews but was leary because it was all plastic (except the blade and meat filters).I found it very easy to use. So far, I've ground my own pork and beef. I cannot get over the difference in the ground beef compared to the store. You will NEVER go back to store bought ground beef. I also made sausage for the first time last weekend and it was easy with the sausage stuffer. Mind you, the sausage casing grossed me out quite a bit :-DLove it!
