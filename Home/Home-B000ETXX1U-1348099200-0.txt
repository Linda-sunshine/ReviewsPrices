review/summary: Good buy....review/text: Purchased the bed to use on a trip and slept on it a month. I was prepared to see some stretching so filling it the first several nights was not unexpected. I guess I got carried away though, and it looks like it is now a king size bed. When we use it again, I plan to get king sheets with deep pockets I'm pretty sure that will solve the problem. I will also use either a memory foam topper or a couple of quilts to soften up the surface. It's not perfect, but it IS an air mattress and as a temporary, easy to store solution, I was happy.
