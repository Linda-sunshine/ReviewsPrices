review/summary: Awesome cheese shredderreview/text: I bought this for one purpose - shredding cheese. I've tried several shredders and was never satisfied with the effort and clean up. This machine is pulled out to shred cheese, then ALL the messy pieces are put directly into the dishwasher. They come out sparkly clean and the food processor is put back into the cabinet. It shreds hard cheese and soft cheese. We shred cheddar for Tacos : I like to use one chunk of sharp cheddar and one of 50% reduced fat sharp cheddar - no need to mix because I shred them together. Same with Mozzarella - one whole milk, one part-skim. VERY pleased with my purchase.
