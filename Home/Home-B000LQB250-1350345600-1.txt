review/summary: Not a replacement for foam mattresses, but...review/text: While this certainly isn't going to live up to the standards of a foam mattress, it certainly does its job well. I wouldn't do any jumping on it with heavily staining adult beverages on the other side of it. However, it will take a mattress that should have been replaced a couple years ago and give it new life and comfort beyond what you were expecting. This one was an enhancement for a futon mattress and the results were immediate and better than I expected.
