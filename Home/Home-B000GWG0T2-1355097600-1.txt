review/summary: Great nonstick panreview/text: Purchased this from all the good reviews and I'am very happy I did. I went with the 12.5inch pan because the older 9inch pan I had always felt like it was too small when cooking anything in and I love to have extra room. Have used it maybe 30 times so far from everything to browning roast beef before braising, sauted chicken and veggies to omlets and nothing has stuck to the pan at all, even cheese just slides around in it.The coating seems pretty good so far, has no marks or peeling and its is also non stick on the outside of the pan. The pan itself feels sturdy and well built, it has good weight for a nonstick. Heat seems evenly distributed throughout the whole cooking area, I'am using it on a gas range.Took me a few times cooking with it to get used to how slippery the pan actually is, when sauteing chicken and veggies I stirred it too fast and veggies flew right out of the pan lol. But I would recommend this to anyone and also buy it again.
