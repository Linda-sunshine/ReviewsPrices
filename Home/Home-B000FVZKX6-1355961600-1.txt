review/summary: Quality, Comfort...Great Sheets!review/text: The Pinzon Signature 190-Gram Cotton Velvet Flannel Sheets offer quality and comfort. They are very soft and luxurious. There was a bunch of lint after the first couple of washings, but that is likely to be expected. Just be sure to check that lint trap in the dryer. :) There was also a bit of a new smell that needed to wear off and they needed to go through the washer twice.The sheets fit oversized mattresses very well. I like using flannel sheets during the colder months, because they seem to keep the heat in better. The Pinzon Signature 190-Gram Cotton Velvet sheets are probably the best I have ever used. I have owned them for a month now and they are holding up very well. Very little lint coming off them, no strings coming apart. Overall, I'm very pleased!
