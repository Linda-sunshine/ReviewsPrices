review/summary: Poor Quality SteamVacreview/text: We previously owned a Bissell Steam Vac, and after 2 years of very minimal use and several replacement parts we tossed it out. This replacement was supposed to be higher quality, and the first year was OK, but now it has trouble sucking up the detergent and we're about to toss this one too. Very disappointing.
