review/summary: great cheap coffee makerreview/text: I had one and really liked but decided to get a keurig. The coffee was not strong enough so I went back to my Black and Decker. My daughter wanted a single cup maker so I bought her this Black and Decker and she loves it. Since you use you own coffee it is cheaper and makes a bigger cup that fits in your car.
