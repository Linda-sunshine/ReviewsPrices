review/summary: Problems began after only 3 mothsreview/text: I preface this by saying that I've had a life-time experience with electric kettles, having been raised with them in England and having purchased quite few in my adult life. I know my kettles and this one is a big disappointment.I purchased the Hamilton Beach 40898 kettle because it is made with almost no plastic. All was okay for a while; it boiled water and turned itself off, as promised. However at around the 3 month mark, the lid opening function became sticky and now doesn't open without assistance (and the risk of steam burn). At 5 months since purchased, the kettle takes longer to turn itself off (filling the kitchen with steam), the pour action is useless (leaking all over the place), and it has started leaking water from its underside, leaving a puddle of water on the counter.It was not particularly expensive but that's not an excuse for shoddiness and inferior quality. Needless to say I'm looking for another kettle and the hunt for an all-stainless steel one is going to be hard. How I wish I could use one purchased in the UK without doing major rewiring (did you know British kettles are faster and cheaper!). I'm hugely disappointed with this product. A kettle should last more than a few months, therefore I cannot recommend this kettle.
