review/summary: GREAT PRODUCTreview/text: I am taking time to review this product because it totally saved us from having to buy a new mattress. We bought a firmer mattress after spending the last 10 years on a sagging too soft plush euro pillow top. Unfortunately, our new mattress turned out to be too hard and my lower back would be very stiff in the morning even while sleeping with a bolster under my knees. My shoulders would get sore as well as I also sleep on my sides. I looked online for a long time to find a decent memory foam topper made in USA with good reviews + price.Look no more, this is it. we paid $150 for a Cal King!The mattress returns to its original size after shipping within 8 hours. It did smell of mint for a couple of days but the smell was very pleasant (I actually missed it when it was gone).This topper is soooooo comfortable I look forward to going to bed. It's like a cocoon. It does run a little hot but we live in Chicago and I welcome the extra heat in the winter! AT the same time we use year around and bought it when it was still hot and it was ok.I highly recommend this product. Our mattress was too hard and our bed is now very comfy while still having the support of a firm bed(minus the stiff top surface). For the price you can't beat it.
