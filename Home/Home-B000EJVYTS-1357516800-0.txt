review/summary: Product does not Workreview/text: The product simply does not work. I have purchased this product in the past elsewhere and it worked fine. Why spend $84 on something that doesn't work is beyond me. Why Amazon allows shipping of completely defective product is beyond me.Lid does not power on in any way shape or form ... two sets of new batteries later ... what a bloody waste of time.Now somebody from Amazon is going to tell me to return it ... I have no desire to find the packaging ... large ... pack it up and then tote it to a shipper and pay to send it back.Buyers beware ... do not buy this product ... and do not assume Amazon delivers products that work.
