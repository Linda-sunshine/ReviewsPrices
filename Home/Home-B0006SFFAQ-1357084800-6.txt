review/summary: Flashy but not Functionalreview/text: We purchased this to replace a 15 year old Mr Coffee, a simple machine without any of the programmable features that the Cuisinart offers. I'm a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong, this machine brews great coffee and has programmable features that we did not have or use with our old machine, but there are several design flaws that make it more difficult to use.First, it is harder to pour water into the tank without using the pot that it came with as the opening is very small. Second, if brewing 8 or less cups, it is difficult to determine if the water level has been reached or not (we were using a Brita pitcher to pour water into the tank until it became evident that we could not do it easily without spilling). Even when using Cuisinart's carafe, it typically fills to a point lower than the indicated level inside the tank. The level is not viewable without opening the tank, and it is not viewable from the outside of the pot like our Mr Coffee. Thirdly, the clock on the front face is difficult to read. It is an LCD readout black on greenish background, and not back lit. The clock faces directly vertical, so you need to be eye-level with it to read it. Much of the programming is based on the clock so it's a less than desirable feature.This machine looks much nicer/sleeker than our old coffeemaker, and the switch to turn the pot on and off is cool. I also like the shut-off feature and the beeps that indicate that the brewing cycle is complete. However, I prefer less eye candy and more functionality and I should have done more homework before buying. The negatives I mentioned can be worked around but why offer these features if they are difficult to use? If it lasts as long as our previous Coffee Maker, I would be more pleased but overall I'm disappointed in my decision to purchase the Cuisinart DCC-1200.
