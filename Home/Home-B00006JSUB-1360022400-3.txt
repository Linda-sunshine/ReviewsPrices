review/summary: Ours broke after only a few uses.review/text: Sadly ours broke after only using it maybe three times. We plan to buy another and try again. If we break that one than we'll know that we are just not meant to own cast iron cookware. We use cooking stones, and have for years, so we are not complete novices. Hoping this was just a defect.
