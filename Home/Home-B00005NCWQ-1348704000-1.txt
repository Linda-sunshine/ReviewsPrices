review/summary: Still Searching For the Perfect Brewreview/text: Like many other reviewers, I'm highly disappointed in this product. The measure marks are engraved on the "outside" of the pot, resulting in a poorly visible and reversed mark on the inside of the pot. I could understand engraving on the outside IF there was a clear window to see water level, but this is not the case. I'm also not satisfied with the fact that the clear knob for the lid is plastic. My main reason for buying this product was to get away from plastic and the uncertainty of BPA. Next, the construction is awful. There's a recession in the interior bottom as well as a lip on the interior top. Both make it very difficult to clean oil residues completely or to rinse and drain completely. Last, (I'm not sure where this is coming from) I notice a bit of a metallic taste in the brew.I may have to find a larger French Press to accompany the one we currently have when I need greater quantities of coffee to serve.
