review/summary: Great for someone who doesn't have severe allergiesreview/text: I love this air purifier, I've had it for about a year and a half. For me, I love that on high, it's pretty loud so I keep it running next to my head at night to drown out traffic noise. As for cleaning the air - I think it works pretty well. I have severe seasonal allergies though and nothing helps me. However, this is the one and only air purifier I've ever noticed a difference in the air quality with. One low, it's quiet, on high it's loud. If you keep the door to the room it's running in shut, you will notice a difference in the air within 30 minutes. No replacement filters! huge bonus. I would highly recommend this purifier to anyone with less severe to moderately severe allergies or asthma. Great product and the price - a steal!
