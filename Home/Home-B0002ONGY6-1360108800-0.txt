review/summary: They are really smallreview/text: I love the look and feel of these sheets, they are of great quality. They are not, however, large enough to fit on a queen size mattress. I would have returned them, but I am a single guy, and I thought maybe after a wash or two they would stop bending my mattress so I threw the packaging away. It's probably my fault for not returning them immediately, but I would buy them again if they actually fit because I love the way they feel. If you buy them hang on to the packaging and do not hesitate to send them back if they don't fit immediately!
