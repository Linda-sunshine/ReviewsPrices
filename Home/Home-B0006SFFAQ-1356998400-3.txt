review/summary: My favorite coffeemaker thus far!review/text: I researched various coffee makers, and I am still pleased to this day that I have this specific one.One of my biggest pet-peeves is coffee dribbling down the side of the coffee pot when pouring. (No problem here).It has an auto-shut off and stays on for awhile. It beeps when the coffee is ready too.Filling it is not really a huge issue. I fill it with the coffee pot itself, and the only issue becomes at the last drop or so when you have to tip it more. Other than that, I am not pouring water all over the machine.I have a neighbor who has the same coffee pot, and she agrees with me that she will never purchase a different brand again.It is easy to clean, change the filters, etc.I use the paper filters to keep the regular filter cleaner longer, although you do not need to buy paper filters for this coffee pot.3 - level temp for the coffee. Love it!I have no reservations recommending this product. I would purchase it again in a heart beat.
