review/summary: Great qualityreview/text: I am a fan of the Lodge products. I got this after getting the large griddle. We have used it numerous times and it is just bulletproof. The care is easy. Just clean with little or no soup to retain the non stick effect. Nice heat retention of even heat from iron.
