review/summary: Toast for the Toasterreview/text: The toaster oven is the perfect size for my needs. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 is that it heats up very quickly and due to its small size burnt the first item I placed into it. The food said 400 degrees for 20 minutes, after about 3 minutes the top was burnt and I had to put the temperature down to 300 and cook for about another 5 minutes. Just something new to get used to!
