review/summary: Best coffee maker ever!review/text: My daughter has this coffee maker, and it is going strong after 6 years!!! I love mine...I'm now on the second one, but for anyone worried about the warranty, this one has a good one! If anything goes bad in three years, just call the company, tell them what is wrong, and they will have you send your non-working machine back in the box of the new one they send to you!!! Be sure to register your purchase on line or use the card with the product....easy for them to check your model and when and where it was purchased! I have had many high end machines in the past, and most were hard to pour water into the top for brewing. This one is easy with no spills, and it's really fast at brewing the best coffee ever!!! The machine fits easily into a corner spot or anywhere on your counter top, and it is sharp looking!. The unneeded part of the cord stays hidden, tucked inside the base of the machine, and it is so easy to keep clean! My family loves this coffee maker!!!!
