review/summary: Breville Ikon Juicerreview/text: This juicer is a thing of beauty. Love the way the pulp is ejected into a separate bin.Very quiet to operate and I love the variable speeds. Such a step up from my old, noisyone speed model. Comes with a brush for cleaning inside basket, very helpful.
