review/summary: Nice tasting waterreview/text: These filters produce very nice tasting water. The only downside is that sometimes the carbon particles will leak through but almost always to the prefilter bowl area so it isn't that much of a problem.The one thing to be aware of is that the nature of pricing on Amazon means that larger packs are not always the cheapest per unit. For instance, when I bought this, the 4 pack was the cheapest per unit.
