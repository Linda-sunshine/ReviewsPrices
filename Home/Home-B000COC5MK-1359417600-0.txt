review/summary: I am so glad I bought this!review/text: I recently encountered my first stubborn bottle of wine. I tired to open it with a traditional corkscrew, you know the ones with the &#34;wings&#34; that are supposed to help you get the cork out when you press down on them? Well, it broke. The corkscrew just broke right off. It was time for me to invest in an automatic one anyways. After some looking, I found this product by Oster. I know my mom has had an Oster food processor for at least 26 years and I do trust the brand. I bought it and 2 days later, thanks to Prime it was on my doorstep.I plugged it in for about 20 minutes to charge and I couldn't contain my excitement any longer. I got that stubborn bottle back out and tried my luck once more. I put the bottle opener on the lip of the bottle and pressed the button.... with ease this opener took that stubborn cork right out of that bottle! I would recommend this to anyone!
