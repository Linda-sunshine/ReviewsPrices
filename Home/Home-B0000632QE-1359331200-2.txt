review/summary: Didn't live up to my expectations but does the job.review/text: The piece that you use to put on top of the item you are slicing is useless so you have to be very careful not to slice your finger off. I think I will being the gloves that protect you from getting sliced. I haven't figured out how to make it make super thin slices for stuff like ginger. It's made out of plastic. I kind of wish I spent a little more time shopping online before settling on this. It's actually more convenient for me to cut my produce with a knife then having to clean this thing and worry about cutting my hand while using it. Other than that... it does what it says it will.
