review/summary: disappointedreview/text: very disappointed - it can only handle things I could almost mix by hand. Very difficult to make a smoothie - the sole reason I purchased it. When I put frozen fruit in it gets clogged immediately. This happens even if I defrost the fruit first. And then, if I add protein powder and milk it just gets worse.
