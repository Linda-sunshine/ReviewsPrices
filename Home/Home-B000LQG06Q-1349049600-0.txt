review/summary: Uselessreview/text: Recent reviews are correct. I own a memory foam mattress and wanted something to top an airbed. Its worse than foam I bought from the hobby store for a project (which was also way cheaper). You're getting about 5 dollars worth of foam. I would rate this less than 0 stars if I could.
