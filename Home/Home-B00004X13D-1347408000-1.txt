review/summary: The perfect waffle maker!review/text: I was reticent to purchase this waffle maker since it did not have the flip feature like the more expensive models and was considerably less expensive than the Waring, Black & Decker, and Cuisinart. I made the leap after learning that my mother's tastiest waffles came not from her expensive Krups flip model but from a cheap no frills one like this. I am pleased to report it was a wise decision as this mighty machine produces perfect golden brown waffles that are light and fluffy on the inside each and every time even when using whole wheat batter. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
