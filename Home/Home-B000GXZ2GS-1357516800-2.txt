review/summary: Great new way to make coffeereview/text: Not really sure if you would call it espresso, but this coffee maker makes a very intense, expressed coffee with a little bit of what the Italians call "crema" and it tastes really good, is not half the work that a traditional espresso machine is, and the clean up is easy. I love mine.
