review/summary: It does the job well.review/text: I have read from someone in here that you can flip the filter around without having to replace it often. My best advise. DO NOT DO IT. I did it and it spits out that nasty smell. I ended up ordering a new one to replace it. Overall I happy with the unit. it's quiet enough at the low setting. It even keeps my whole house at normal humidity level including my bedroom which is on second floor (I leave the door open 24/7 of course.) My friends saw it and they want to get one but since then the price has doubled than what I paid for.
