review/summary: Ok steamer, good size for travelreview/text: I bought this steamer to bring on trips where fancy dress is required. It is small enough to fit neatly in a suitcase, however the small size makes it difficult to steam for very long before needing to refill it. Takes a fairly long time to steam a full suit or an entire dress, but it does get the job done. I would recommend this if you need something small for traveling.
