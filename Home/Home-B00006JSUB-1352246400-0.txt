review/summary: Made in the USAreview/text: I love this product. It exceeded my expectations. It was preseasoned, USA made, and heavy. Wonderful for omelettes, pancakes, or cornbread. I can use it in the oven or on the stove. Very versatile. I was pleased with the packaging and the speedy delivery as well.
