review/summary: Great Setreview/text: if your one of those Lazy people who use non-stick then this set is not for you. best to treat your set ( other then tops) in the oven just like you would a cast iron skillet. no need to have temps on high. And the best is you can transfer these from stove top to the oven. use rubber or silicone kitchen utensils, if you burn your pot put a little dish soap in it and let it simmer should clean right up, if it is a bad burn then it will take a while but it will come out
