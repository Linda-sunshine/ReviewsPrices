review/summary: Wow, wasnt expecting this!review/text: Our can openers kept breaking... we had the non cut type and they worked great for a decade. But in the last year, some can manufacturers changed how they seal the cans and our non cut can openers fail on them. So we needed cutting ones. I got this and another based on ratings and did not read very much into this one. But WOW! Now my 7 year old asks if he can open all the cans...Its plastic, but appears to be tough plastic. But it locks down on the can so you dont have to maintain a grip on it! This is great for my younger kids and my wife who had trouble with standard openers. Just close it down on the can and it locks in place. Turn to open, and when done press a release to let go of the can. Then there is even a little magnet on the head to pull the lid out!I never expected such ease in manual can opener... if you need a can opener.. get this one!Id rate it 6 stars if I could!
