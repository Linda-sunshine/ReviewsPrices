review/summary: Confirming and happy to have spent the money, which seemed high...review/text: Lots of great reviews, so it's not necessary to repeat what has been written, but to confirm that I'm very happy with this...I'm using the reverse upside down method, and with the metal filter, to allow the tasty oils to go through, and I must say, I've never had a cup of coffee this good - ever, and I'm a real coffee snob. The French Press leaves a sludgy, and is also hard to clean - this is just great coffee and a snap to clean.
