review/summary: Best investment I have made in 2013!!review/text: I decided to invest in a juicer after my recent visit to the doctor's where I weighed in 30lbs more than my last visit. WIth that said, I decided it was time to take action and invest in a juicer. I've never been the one to count calories (which is likely how I gained my 30), but I decided to take action.. swift action if i intended on making a lifestyle change to my diet. After reviewing a few juicers Amazon had, I bought this model (not the low end or extremely high end), right in the middle. I looked at other customer reviews, in which they seemed satisfied to guide my final purchasing decision.It was the best purchase I could have ever made. Take it out of the box folks.. Put it on your kitchen counter :-) That's what I did, I went to the grocery store, picked up a few veggies and fruits (lemons, limes, kale, oranges, apples, strawberries, ginger) to get me started. Its fun and easy, and I truly appreciate the wide opening so I don't have to cut my fruits and veggies to get them in.. Just wash and put it down the juicing chute!I just bought 2 books &#34;The Green Diet & The Juicing Bible&#34; to help guide my juicing menu but folks if you are looking for a juicer this is it! The clean up is rather easy just as much as putting it back together. I've never been the type to write a review for products I have bought on Amazon, but for this one I had to make an exception :-)
