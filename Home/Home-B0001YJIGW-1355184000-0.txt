review/summary: Bathtime is a great timereview/text: I got this while pregnant so the water would actually come up higher than my hips. We have a normal tub so it's kind of shallow and you can never fully submerge but with this, I can relax much more than without it. I didn't think it would work once it arrived, but the seal it great and it keeps the water from draining! Just don't forget to turn the water off or fill the tub too full!!
