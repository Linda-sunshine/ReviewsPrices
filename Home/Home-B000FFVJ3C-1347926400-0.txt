review/summary: Chrisssyreview/text: I love the Nesco FD-75PR 700 watt food dehyrdator. One of the nice things about this product is that it has controls for the temperature and you can stack up extra trays. I also love the fact that the air blows down from above not the other way around. My herbs dry at just the right temperature so that they retain all their enzymes!
