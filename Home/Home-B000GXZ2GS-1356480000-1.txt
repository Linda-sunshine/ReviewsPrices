review/summary: How does it make coffee so good??/review/text: So after reading the myriad of reviews about how amazing this coffee/espresso maker is, I decided to buy one. When I bought this it was only $25 and the filters are about $4 for about 365 so I decided to buy them also. Didn't realize that the press already came with a large pack of filters (300 I think). So big a big plus to that! I began using a very cheap fine ground espresso, heated up some water till it was slightly before boiling. Mixed the water and espresso, and very lightly pressed for about 30 seconds. The espresso was dark and had a dark caramel foam on the top. I added my caramel syrup to the hot espresso shot, mixed it, poured over ice and added my milk. Words cannot explain how delicious and flavorful this latte was. No burnt taste, no chemical taste which was occurring with my old coffee machine. This thing is the bomb, no doubt.
