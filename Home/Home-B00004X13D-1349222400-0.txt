review/summary: College kid's reviewreview/text: I paid $20 for one, used. And, lo and behold, it makes waffles. If you need something really fancy (i.e., something with a timer or something non-stick, or dishwasher friendly or whatever) then this isn't for you. However, I'm broke, and it makes good waffles. Just put a little coconut oil on the griddle before your batch and then clean it with a wet rag when you're done. It heats up quickly (and makes the entire room hot) and has worked great for me. I expect another ten years out of it. For $20-$30, it's a decent and dependable waffle maker.
