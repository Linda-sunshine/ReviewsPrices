review/summary: Bottom sheet wouldn't fit!review/text: I'm SO disappointed that the bottom sheet didn't fit when I got these sheets. I've put off buying nice sheets because of the cost, but I finally took the plunge. When I put the bottom sheet on my 14" mattress (supposed to have 16" pockets and fit up to 18"), I couldn't get it over the one of the corners. I tugged and tugged and barely got it over the top of the pillow top but I know it will pop off when I lay on it. I love the feel and weight of the sheets, but I'm so disappointed the bottom sheet doesn't fit. I would return them, but it's such a hassle because I don't have the original box and don't have time to box it up to send back. I may change my mind if I get too aggravated with it popping off. The top sheet and pillow cases are just fine. Why don't they have better quality control????
