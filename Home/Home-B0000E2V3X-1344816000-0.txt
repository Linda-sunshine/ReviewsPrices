review/summary: Too big for regular cooktop; Hard to cook Dosasreview/text: We bought this to make dosas (Indian creeps) after reading some good reviews for making dosas. But we did not like this product for making dosa. You have to add lot of oil to make dosas. My stove top is unable to cover and provide heat for the entire pan. it gets too dirty with the stuff sticking on the sides. My wife did not like it. So we are not using it anymore. For anyone looking to make dosas, I recommend a good nonstick pan.If you are using for making pizzas etc. it still may be a good product.
