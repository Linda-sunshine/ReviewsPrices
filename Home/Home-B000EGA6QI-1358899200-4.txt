review/summary: Works Great!review/text: A handy little blender with detachable parts. I have used it for pur&eacute;eing soups and for egg mixtures. It has only one speed, unlike most other blenders I have used, but it does work beautifully. The &#34;stick&#34; comes apart so that you can remove only the soiled part to wash. In short, it is easy to use, easy to handle, easy to clean and easy on the pocket book. Try one, you will like it as much as I do.
