review/summary: Leaky if using steam,pain to fill tankreview/text: I should have stuck to a new Rowena. This one leaks water on my clothes, even at high cotton temperatures. It is a pain to fill as you can't just poor the water on. It works. I was too lazy to return a cheap product. Buy something else if you want steam.
