review/summary: juice in 5 seconds flatreview/text: you'll have a newfound appreciation for what it takes to make &#34;one&#34; glass of juice. prepare to buy lots of fruits and veggies. there's alot of pulp leftover, but mb the pulp can be used as compost in your garden or in a blender drink? I don't know but either way, great juicer.
