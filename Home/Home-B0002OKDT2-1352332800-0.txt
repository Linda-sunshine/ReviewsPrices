review/summary: Wish I hadn't purchased thisreview/text: I had a Champion juicer for 15 years that finally wore out, so I bought this one. I've been using it for about two weeks. It's ok for juicing if you just want a little juice at a time, but I like to do juice fasts and drink 32 to 64 oz. of juice per day while on them. It will take me an hour to make that much (at least). It is also hard to take apart and put back together. For the price, I would have thought it would have more power. Very disappointed.
