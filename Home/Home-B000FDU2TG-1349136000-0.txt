review/summary: Epic Failreview/text: This review is more in sorrow than anger.Our first kitchen blender lasted ten years, before it gave up the ghost. Well we couldn't afford a Vita-mix and we had a good run out our first Kitchen Aid blender. It seemed like a no brainer, buy a new Kitchen Aid blender. So we did.It lasted all of thirteen months, before the circuit board failed. Eighty buck to replace that on a one hundred dollar blender. Not good value for money.Bottom line, circuit boards don't fail unless they are way too cheap. Kitchen Aid is letting its hard won reputation for quality slip. Sad, honestly.
