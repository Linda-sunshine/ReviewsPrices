review/summary: Works very wellreview/text: Can't get any more simple than this. Plug it in. Light goes on. Mix your batter. Light goes off. Lift the lid and pour. Close the lid. Light comes back on. Wait about 5 to 8 minutes depending on how think you poured. Light goes out. Gently lift out with a fork. Perfect!!Be sure to spray lightly with Pam for best results. When it cools, wipe with damp cloth. Don't immerse of course! Since I use mine every weekend I just wipe it down and store with a paper towel inbetween. (Every now and then will use a little soap to clean.)Very satisfied for the price. If it beeped at you when done I would have given this product 5 stars :)
