review/summary: Hot digitty!review/text: This is a replacement for a previous warmer that finally died after several years. It does an OK job of keeping my coffee warm, but not HOT which is what I would prefer. Keeping a lid on my mug helps. Next time, I think I will get a hot plate with a thermostatic control.
