review/summary: Love it!review/text: I read a lot of the reviews on this wok prior to purchasing and was hesitant only because of those reviews that said it burns everything. For those who said it burns, I believe this is user error. I have used this three times to make chicken stir fry and have yet to burn anything. When using a wok, it is necessary to keep the food moving therefore the chance of burning the food is less likely. If anything, I wasn't able to get the heat high enough on my stove to keep the juice from the chicken from forming and then needing to "cook" it off. This is because of my stove, not the pan. The same goes for those who burn their food, it's probably your stove, not the pan.
