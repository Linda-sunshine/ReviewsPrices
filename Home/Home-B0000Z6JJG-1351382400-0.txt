review/summary: Handy salad shooterreview/text: I wish now that I had gotten the smaller version of the salad shooter. I have had the smaller one for a long time and found it to be very handy, so I thought I would give the professional version a try. It works great for bigger jobs, but for my use, I find it to be more awkward for my uses. But, it is a very good product.
