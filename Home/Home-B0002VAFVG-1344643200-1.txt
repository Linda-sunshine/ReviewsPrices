review/summary: 1 Star Is Not Indicative Of This Productreview/text: In researching a juicer, I found something that may be beneficial to people trying to lead a healthy lifestyle. The comment below was from a blog and I am just passing it on, so I am not agreeing/disagreeing with the comment. However, more research may be due, esp. with the price of this juicer.The reason I gave this a 1 star, is not because of the juicer (and with reading the reviews, I am sure it is a hell of a juice), but because of the fact that most of the nutrients are lost, which defeats the purpose. Additionally, a lot of people search under 1 star reviews to see what major issues the item has, and so in serving that purpose it may be more accessible to persons weighing their options."Centrifugal Juicers like the Breville's Juice Fountain Elite 800EXL are the worst juicers you can buy. They make aerated oxidized nutrient killing juice with very low enzymes. You need a low RPM mastigating, single, or twin auger juicer to keep the nutrients in the juice. Professional Juicing even use a hydrolic press. Anything that cuts, not presses is bad.
