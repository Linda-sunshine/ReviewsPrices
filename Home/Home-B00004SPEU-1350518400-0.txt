review/summary: krups electric spice & Coffee Grinder-203-42review/text: I purchased this to make baby cereals. It performs beautifully and quickly. It ground my grains to the perfect grind for my baby's cereals ( Rice & grains). It is super easy to clean- just use a brush ( like a clean make-up brush) and a bit of blowing air and a quick wipe out. I highly recommend this product to others using it for the same purpose.I have not used this for coffee ( not until I am finished using it for baby food grains)
