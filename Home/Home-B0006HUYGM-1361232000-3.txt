review/summary: Excellent, surprising suction, but finicky power switchreview/text: I purchased this vacuum in May 2012 and have been using it on and off for the last 8 months or so. Here's some positives and negatives I've observed:Positives:- This vacuum really does have shockingly good suction, likely better than my full upright.- How the detachable hose wraps around the unit is pretty good engineering, and the hose and unit are easy and relatively light enough to walk around and use portably.- The hose is the same size of my upright, so I use my upright's attachments on this. Likely will be the case for you as well.- Long cord. This is a plus when vacuuming flights of stairs, etc.- The debris cup / filter are pretty easy to remove and clean, and as pictured, well-located so you can see when it's time to empty it or clean the filter.- The cup has a good rubber gasket that is effective at preventing dust from leaking out.- The filter gets super-dirty quick. You'd think this is a negative, but not at all -- shows the filter is effective at..filtering.Negatives:- My unit's power switch is slightly shorted or otherwise defective. I can't push the power switch all the way to the brush spot, I have to keep it slightly in between the two spots for the brushes to turn on. This alone took off a star, which pained me a little given the positives. Otherwise -- especially for the price -- this product is an excellent vacuum.
