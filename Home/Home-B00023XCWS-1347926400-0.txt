review/summary: Easy, Fast boiler!review/text: This little boiler is perfect for making tea and hot water for what ever you need. It doesn't hold a lot of water but is still enough for my uses. The water boils decently fast.Pros:- not to small- not bulky- fast boil- good feelcon:- the on/off switch is located in a weird place (where the thumb goes during pour). i should be placed somewhere else like bottom side or something. mistook it for like the pour/no pour latchoverall though can't complain much about this little boiler. Great for what im using it for (tea). I recommend it to all.
