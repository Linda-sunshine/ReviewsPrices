review/summary: Such a time saver!review/text: This slicer has saved me so much time!After years of wanting one, I finally decided to get a mandoline. I picked this one based on the reviews, and they dont lie. This slicer comes with a holder that keeps all the pieces together, is simple and quick to clean, and does the job it was made to do splendidly. I can cut a potato into uniform discs in less than 30 seconds with this. It's great for making party platters.
