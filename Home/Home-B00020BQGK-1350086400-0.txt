review/summary: GREAT SUCTION BUT WAY TOO HEAVY RUNS TOO HOT Flimsy power nozzlereview/text: UPDATE. JAN 2013 OK as an engineer here is my updated information on this item. The weight distribution is ALL WRONG! The motor (too heavy) is too near the operator and too far back on the handle. SOM not only is it WAY too heavy you must lift the handle at the smae time as pushing the vacuum. SO you get a gym workout at the same time you vacuum the floors. Not only must you be King Kong to use this but it does have an added advantage. The discharge air is so hot it actually raises the room temperature as you vacuum saving you heating costs. The superheated air has actually raised the temperature of my living room 4 degrees after 1/2 hour of vacuuming. WOW an added benefit. I work out at the gym every day and when I am done my back and shoulders do not hurt, BUT when I use this for 1 hour, my back and arms are KILLING ME! No lie, I must take advil after a vacuuming session. AND I have broken two power heads. The neck is so flimsy that the plastic snapped on two power nozzles.I know what you are thinking, why do I still use it and more appropriately, whey did I buy two of these. GOOD QUESTION. I do like the length of the power cord, and I do like the suction. Thats it, NOTHING else do I like about this vacuum. Whoever designed this piece of junk MUST have been on drugs, or high. Or was a mutant.ORIGINAL REVIEWOk first the good. The beater head works great and the suction is good too. The compactness and size are just right. Now for the bad. It is WAY TOO HEAVY. After vacuuming a small house my shoulder muscles actually hurt. This thing just weighs a TON. It takes my arms a few days to recuperate. Other than that it is a great vacuum for the price. Oh yes, one more thing, the motor sometimes overheats and trips the thermal breaker and you have to wait about a half hour for the darned thing to come back on.
