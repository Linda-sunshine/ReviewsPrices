review/summary: Great Productreview/text: This is my second PUR water filter. I loved the first one for years and years, until the door caught the tap and pulled it out and onto the floor. It was a very sad day, and it took me a while to pickup all the pieces as it shattered like glass. Thankfully, it was empty at the time! So, I went online and did what I always do when purchasing an item - read reviews on all water filter products from a variety of websites. In the end, I stuck with this one as it has the best rating, reasonably priced filters, and my family has been very happy with the taste of the water. I would recommend this product to anyone as the only water filter you should buy. I hope this helps others make a great decision!
