review/summary: Really does a great job!review/text: This is a great juicer. It's a powerhouse and will quickly macerate any veggie or fruit handy. The only flaw is that is a pretty extensive clean up, however, they do include an excellent brush/ tool that makes it much easier.I love having my own fresh juice everyday. I live that I can create whatever combo I want and it will not hurt my stomache because there's no added citric acid (that's what makes drinks tart/tangy.)I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
