review/summary: great valuereview/text: I use this water filter on my boat for drinking water. I have tried a few others over the years but this is the best. Very compact, inexpensive, easy to use and works great. No need to carry drinking water onto the boat anymore. Just filter the water from the normal tank. No matter what marina I get water from I know the result is tasteless and safe drinking water.
