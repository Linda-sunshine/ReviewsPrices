review/summary: If only it didn't Stick on the grill sidereview/text: The griddle side worked great. Made awesome pancakes. it puts a good sear on steaks but the meat stuck to the grill. I sprayed down the grill with Pam before use but it did nothing. My friend had the same experience with her same lodge grill/griddle. I refinished the grill by stripping it down and I am hoping it will be more nonstick with the new patina I added to it. I used the following website. [...] to refinish the grill.
