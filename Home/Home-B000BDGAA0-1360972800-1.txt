review/summary: Stuffed too full - so it's not soft enoughreview/text: Stuffed too full and cover is too small making the pillow too dense and hard. I bought it at 6am after a great night's sleep at a friend's house but once it arrived, I couldn't use it. I am debating returning it or simply removing some of the little white bubbles from inside with some creative surgery and sewing.
