review/summary: Noisy but it worksreview/text: From the reviews I know it is going to be noisy, and it turn out to be true. If I use it in the bed room at night, it has to be on the lowest setting and at least 10 feet away from my bed. But this thing works magic. My wife's nose is super sensitive and she can tell the difference immediately once it is turned on. In fact, my not-so-sensitive nose can feel the air getting cleaner and fresh. For the money, this is a great purchase.
