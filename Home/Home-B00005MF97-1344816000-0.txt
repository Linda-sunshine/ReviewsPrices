review/summary: Great product!review/text: I've only had this for a few weeks, but I love it so far. The blades are extremely sharp, so sharp that I almost over chop my food. It's easy to clean, pretty quiet, small and looks nice in the kitchen. For the price, its an amazing deal and I highly recommend this product.
