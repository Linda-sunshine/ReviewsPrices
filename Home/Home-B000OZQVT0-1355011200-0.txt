review/summary: Nice to impress company...not an everyday itemreview/text: These are nice to thrown in your fireplace when you have some company over to impress. They give off a decent amount of heat and they look real nice when they are burning. However, there are some downsides to them as well:- Price: these things are pretty damn pricey.- odor: they have a pretty strong chemical odor so you won't want to sit right near them.The advertised burn time is more or less accurate (2.5-3 hours.)
