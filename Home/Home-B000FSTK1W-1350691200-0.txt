review/summary: 3M Shower Caddy - GREAT!review/text: I must say, I can't imagine any shower caddy fitting my needs better than this. First I bought one and then, after liking it so much, I bought two more for our other two bathrooms. Just recently I bought a fourth for my daughter. It's a great size - you can fit up to four average sized bottles on the caddy (two on each side) plus a nice-sized soap dish that drains well. It comes with great instructions for easy mounting and the 3M Command Strips make it very nice if you'd ever want to remove or relocate it. Also, I love the feature that you can just lift it off its hanging brackets for cleaning and then slip it back on.
