review/summary: Go Green & Save Money!review/text: A long time ago I purchased one of these filters. And I have never bought paper filters again.... well except for craft projects.It's so nice to just be able to have this one filter and rinse it out. They last for years. are dishwasher safe, take up no space in your cabinets. And best thing is your doing your little bit to go green. I highly recommend everyone gets one.
