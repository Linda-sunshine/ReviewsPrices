review/summary: Good rice -- but time is a factorreview/text: I bought this rice cooker in 2008 because of all the great reviews on it, and I was looking for a high quality rice cooker. I don't need to write anything about how the rice turns out, since there are already plenty of reviews out there that talk about that.The problem is that I rarely use this rice cooker. The "quick" mode consistently takes 45 minutes or more (the manual says "27-39 minutes", but that's not what I've experienced). The normal mode takes well over an hour (the manual says "40-55 minutes"). Maybe it's just me, maybe it's the type of rice I use, but when I get home from work at the end of the day, I want to be eating in less than 45 minutes. So I first get the rice cooker going, then I start preparing whatever else I'm going to have with the rice (I'm trying to eat healthy and not eat too many prepared foods). I can usually get everything done in a half hour or less, so I'm usually left waiting 20 minute or more just for the rice to get done; and that's the "quick" mode, not the mode that produces the highest quality rice. By the time everything is said and done, meal preparation with this cooker often takes an hour or more.So practically speaking, I never use the rice cooker unless I'm not too hungry and I have a lot of time. As much as I've tried to like this cooker, it just takes too long for my purposes. This could be the perfect rice cooker for you, but know it's limitations.
