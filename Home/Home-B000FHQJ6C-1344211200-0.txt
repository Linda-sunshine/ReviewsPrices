review/summary: Good beginner juicerreview/text: My wife and I picked up this juicer in an attempt to get more raw fruits and veggies into our diet and to use as part of a juice cleanse, and it's definitely okay for what we paid, especially in comparison to some of the $200 juicers. It's a pretty solid build, and seems to give us a good amount of juice for the veggies that we put through it (it's the veggies that make juicing a pricy endeavor). Overall, it's simple enough to assemble and disassemble and get clean, but the trick is to throw your juice in the fridge and immediately clean up the juicer, especially the blade basket, since the pulp dries in there quickly.I think the most aggravating part of this juicer, and the part that gets two stars deducted, is the hole in the top lid (right where the pulp goes from the blade into the pulp bin) that sprays bits of pulp all over the kitchen, so in addition to already breaking down the juicer and cleaning that immediately, I find myself cleaning off the walls and the kitchen table every time I run the juicer. It blows my mind that there's a hole there, since there's no ready reason for it.This unit is also very loud, as in it wakes my wife up if I'm making juice while she's still sleeping. The brush that's included to clean the blade basket is also cheap, and I find it gets stuck in the mesh and pulls out bristles.Overall, it's perfectly passable, but could be better.
