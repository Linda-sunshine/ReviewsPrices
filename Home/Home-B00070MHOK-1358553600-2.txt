review/summary: Handy hand steamerreview/text: This steamer is compact and easy to use. The steam could probably be &#34;hotter&#34; - sometimes I have trouble with stubborn wrinkles in very thick material. But it heats up fast and is lightweight so I can easily use it with one hand and smooth fabric with the other. The cap seems a little cheap - you have to place it on &#34;just so&#34; to line up with the threads and securely close it. The tank is small and if you overfill it will &#34;spit&#34; hot water so you've just got to be patient and take breaks to let it cool down, so you can refill periodically. If you are a person that steams a LOT of clothing in big batches or tends to do it &#34;just in time&#34; and want to do it quickly- this might not be for you.
