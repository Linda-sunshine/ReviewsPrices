review/summary: Good but not heat resistantreview/text: I've used this for several cooking functions. However, one day I noticed that it had moister underneath the screen. I never immersed it water but rather wiped it clean with a dish towel. I'm not sure how / where the moister came from. The display started to blink and it has never been reliable since. I still have it, but I don't use it anymore.
