review/summary: This is the one if you want warmthreview/text: I have owned so many electric heaters due to the fact that I live in an older uninsulated home that's full of drafts. I ordered this one not expecting much since it was under thirty bucks but boy was I wrong. This heater can throw off some heat and has two settings 400 and 800 ( high and low). The low setting can heat up a medium sized living room and keep you more than comfortable. I love this one and am still amazed that it works this well for under $30.00. I've only had it for a week, but I'd buy this one again.
