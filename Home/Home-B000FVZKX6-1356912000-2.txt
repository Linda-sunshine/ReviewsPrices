review/summary: Amazingreview/text: These sheets are absolutely fantastic for cold Minnesota nights! They are very soft and breathable which makes them very comfortable!These could easily be used year round but are fairly heavy.Also make sure to clean the lint trap of your dryer after use because you'll have enough lint to make a small blanket!
