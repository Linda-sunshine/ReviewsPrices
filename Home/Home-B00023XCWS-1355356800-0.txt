review/summary: Wowreview/text: Very happy with this product. Functions exactly as advertised. I know others complained about a plastic taste, but I rinsed it out a few times before I started using, and empty out all unused water. As for the short cord, keeping it short is a safety thing. I think the cord is about 2 feet long. Is someone trying to walk to their bedroom with it still plugged in? As far as I'm concerned I just robbed Amazon. I would pay twice as much for this machine. It is WAY under priced for what you get.
