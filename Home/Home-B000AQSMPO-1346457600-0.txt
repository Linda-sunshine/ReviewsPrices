review/summary: Bad. Stay away fromreview/text: The Pros:Fast coffee making (when it worked)Nice selection of coffeeThe cons:Machine quite working after 5-6 months. Cleaned and parts replaced. Still quit workingBought another one (shouldn't have done that). 2nd machine quite the same way. It just get stuck and does not pour water thru the coffee container.Then my wife went and bought the newer model. That one also quite within 4 months.The coffee is way too expensive when you calculate (you are paying upward of $35 per lb).I would not use this BRAND again at all.
