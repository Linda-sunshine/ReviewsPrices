review/summary: Died after about a year of usereview/text: I have had a similar product for many, many years till it finally died. I purchased this one a year ago and used it moderately. I use it mainly for grinding spices and flaxseed. It worked great and I was very happy with it but cleaning is hard.I did not submerge the unit in water but I did use water to clean it about a week ago. Using just a cloth won't do the job. So maybe some water got in the unit, I don't know, but today it is dead, morte, not to be revived.
