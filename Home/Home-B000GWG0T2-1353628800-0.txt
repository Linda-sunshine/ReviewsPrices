review/summary: May have a bubble in the middle?review/text: So far I love this pan - cheap but the weight and look of the pan upon arrival shocked me. It had the same feel as a pan I almost paid $50 for. So definitely worth the price. I sauteed broccoli the other day on it and was very nervous putting the oil in the pan because it immediately ran to the sides and another reviewer had mentioned a bubble in the middle of the pan. But a few days later I made pancakes and had no problems so we'll see.
