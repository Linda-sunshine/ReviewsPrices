review/summary: This makes brewing tea so easy!review/text: Prior to this I owned a glass teapot. It was really cool watching tea brew through the see-through glass. After a year of use the glass infuser broke. I was still able to brew tea with it but the top part of it was sharp and dangerous.I had previously purchased the 16oz and 32oz versions of this teapot as gifts for two of my friends. They both seemed to love the convenience of it. After looking around for a new teapot to replace my glass one, I decided that it would be easiest just to buy myself a 16oz Ingenuitea. This teapot is words easier than my glass one. I no longer live in a constant state of fear. I don't have to worry about my teapot shattering or breaking. The Ingenuitea is vastly easier to clean as well. The pouring spout on my glass teapot would become dirty and was a hassle to clean.If you enjoy drinking tea this is the best investment you can make. It makes enjoying tea incredibly easy and hassle free. The only possible con I can think to mention about this is the fact that you can't stop it from steeping until you dispense it into a cup. 16oz makes about 2 cups so this really isn't much of an issue for me.
