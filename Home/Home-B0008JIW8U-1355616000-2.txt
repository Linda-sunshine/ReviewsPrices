review/summary: Best alarm clock everreview/text: While I prefer fresh ground coffee brewed in a Chemex, nothing beats waking up to the smell and sound of coffee brewing and lying in bed waiting for the pot to finish (I live in a studio, so the coffee pot is only about 15 feet away). I have stopped using my alarm clocks because I so dread their jarring beeps and buzzes and dings. The coffeemaker turns itself on by magic and the process feels so much more gentle. Plus I can pour myself a hot cup of caffeine free herbal beverage (gave up caffeine to reduce anxiety; this hasn't yet reconciled me to my alarm clocks) immediately after getting out of bed. Like a reward.The machine is adorably tiny. It works well, have had no problems.
