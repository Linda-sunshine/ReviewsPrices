review/summary: Awesomereview/text: If only it held a little bit more -- my husband and I are sharing this, we have 5 bottles between us, but can only fit 4 (2 on each side). For one person, this would be perfect. For two to share, not really. But it's holding up great after a month of use, and we're in a rental so I'm happy I'll be able to move it and reinstall in our next home.
