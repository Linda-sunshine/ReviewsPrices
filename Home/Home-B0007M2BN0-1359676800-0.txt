review/summary: Surprised by how well it workedreview/text: I purchased this product hoping for something that would quickly and easily boil eggs, but at the same time I wasn't expecting much due to the mixed reviews (I also had some money left on an Amazon gift card which made it only $4...I figured I couldn't go wrong even if it didn't work the way I hoped). I received this product today and have so far made six eggs with it. It makes hard-boiled eggs in only 7 minutes (package says 8, but my microwave's wattage does it in 7), and after cooling, the shells easily slip off. The eggs are soft with a great texture, just like stove boiling. No rubbery eggs! As I said, my leftover gift card money made it only $4, but it's definitely worth the (as of this writing) $11 asking price.
