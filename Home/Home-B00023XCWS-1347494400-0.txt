review/summary: 1 minor disappointmentreview/text: This product works very well. It was shipped and arrived with all of the parts and all of the necessary directions for use. the only thing I can say that I don't like is that the cord is on the short side, which to me as a college student is not a big issues because it's staying in it's on spot for a year.I recommend this to all college students!
