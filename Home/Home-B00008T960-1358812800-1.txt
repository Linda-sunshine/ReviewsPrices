review/summary: Perfect size for 1/4 size sheet panreview/text: These really help when baking on a 1/4 size sheet pan in a convection oven (the 8.25 x 11.75", also listed as 8 x 11.5" are a perfect fit for a 1/4 size sheet pan). They are easily cleaned with soap, and the pan can be likewise cleaned with a simple wipe, avoiding any baked on residue that otherwise makes a tough cleaning job. I highly recommend!
