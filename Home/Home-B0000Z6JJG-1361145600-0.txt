review/summary: Every kitchen should have onereview/text: I owned one of these years ago and lost it during a divorce. Every time I grated cheese I missed it. After years of torchering myself I decided to break down and replace it. Oh baby, I'm glad I did! Cheese is grated in seconds, vegetables are shredded nicely for the salad (it is called salad shooter for a reason) and the best part is cleaning is quick and easy. Every kitchen should have one!
