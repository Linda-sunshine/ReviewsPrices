review/summary: Mine is Finereview/text: After reading a lot of the reviews, I was a little worried, but I took the chance and ordered it... the price was good and some people had good experiences with it. I'm happy to say that it looks just fine. I tested it with a spatula, and I can't see any way it could get caught on the surface, as one reviewer complained. Apparently their quality control is not perfect, so probably some pans get out there that should not. But mine is fine. If yours turns out bad, I recommend you send it back and try another one. Amazon is usually pretty good about returns, from what I have experienced.
