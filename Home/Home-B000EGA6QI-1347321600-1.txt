review/summary: Horrible Screeching Noisereview/text: I bought this for basic kitchen use, mostly a smoothie a few times a week. After 6 months it began to make horrible screeching noises. They became worse and worse. The unit never ceased to function, but the accompanying noise made using it impossible to tolerate. I paid to have the unit exchanged ($10, plus me shipping the unit to them). The new unit arrived quickly and new in box. It worked great. For 5 months. The new one has begun to make the same god-awful noises and they are only increasing. I have other Cuisinart products that I love, but this is crap for it to happen twice. I will NOT be buying another.
