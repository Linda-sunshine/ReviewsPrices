review/summary: Funky smell/taste? You got a knock-off!review/text: I bought a blue set of trays from Amazon to compliment a set I had bought from a specialty store in Boston. The ones I received from Amazon were noticeably different: the blue rubber was not opaque, the material was thinner, and felt different too. I like many others just thought it was a re-design of some kind or another from Tovolo. I had been so happy with the prior set that I paid it no mind initially.Like many others, I noticed that the trays I purchased from Amazon created ice with a chemical taste and odor. I googled around and found various remedies like soaking in vinegar or boiling in water. But instead of risking it, I contacted Tovolo directly to ask about how to fix this issue:[...]contact-us, and to my surprise received an immediate response. It turns out Amazon has been selling knock-off Tovolo ice trays alongside the authentic ones, one would hope without realizing it.I like many people received one of the knock-off ones. Despite having purchased my trays in September, Tovolo immediately offered to send me replacements free of charge. They asked that I sent my old trays in for evaluation and provided a UPS shipping label.This is a great product, backed up by excellent customer service. I hope Amazon does the right thing and reaches out to people that may have been sold knock-off and possibly dangerous ice trays. If you think you may be the victim of a counterfeit tray you should go to Tovolo's website and give them a call or email. They'll do right by you too.
