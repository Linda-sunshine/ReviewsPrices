review/summary: Starts out greatreview/text: I was pleased initially, but then the bowl started leaking when I chop up soups for my baby. And the motor has started to sound like it's working really hard. I'm going to upgrade to something more powerful. I got about 6 months out of this one, using it only to chop baby food (cooked grains and veggies, some cooked chicken).
