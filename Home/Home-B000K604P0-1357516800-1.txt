review/summary: Surpassed Expectations at First, Then Failedreview/text: This is the best designed and functional travel mug/thermos I have ever come across. Everything from the pop top, spring-loaded cap which folds back far enough to not interfere with drinking to the excellent insulating properties to the stainless steal interior to the lockdown clip is of excellent design and apparent craftsmanship.My friend was having a problem with her thermos leaking at first until she realized she was not screwing the cap on adequately tight. As you are tightening the lid we noticed it will make a very positive and noticeable stop. She has had no problem since then. Only problem now is getting the screw on portion of the lid back off--it can be difficult--but I suppose this small price to pay for such an excellent insulation value and leak proof design.UPDATE: I purchased this product for a friend on 11/2/12 and come mid-February the rubber ring which seals the liquids in the main bottle had already failed. That's only about 3-1/2 months of regular use before it failed! Upon closer examination, the ring is a very unusual design. Rather than a simple o-ring, it has a very unique design that evidentially makes it more prone to tearing than a standard o-ring. Besides that, the ring itself is made of a very soft sort of rubber-like material which does not at all seem adequate for the application. My friend called Thermos and they are sending her another rubber ring FREE OF CHARGE, probably because they recognize this is a manufacturing defect. So 5 stars for customer service, 5 stars for the design and functionality of the bottle (when all the pieces are working properly), but one star for the "Achilles heal" o-ring which makes the product useless when it fails, even potentially ruining the contents of baggage in which the thermos might be stored at the time of failure.
