review/summary: Works just fine.review/text: After receiving this sharpener in a very timely manner through Amazon, I spend an hour sharpening all of our kitchen knives and some hunting knives. It worked just fine putting the edges back on. As with any instrument, it required some practice to use properly, but it sharpened the kitchen cutlery as if they had their original edge, and with my hunting knives, well, it put the edge back where I could do the fine tuning with my ceramic hand sharpener. A fine buy!
