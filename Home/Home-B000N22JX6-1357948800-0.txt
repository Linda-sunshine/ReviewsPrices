review/summary: It works and looks very nice! The remote needs a makeover!review/text: In typical Amazon fashion, I got my order quickly. Good for Amazon! :)This heater definitely has a more pleasing and decorative look to it than conventional heaters. Though I like to make sure most things I buy like this are Energy Star rated, I believe this is one is not. I had it plugged in to a wall outlet and it ran fine on the &#34;Low&#34; setting for a couple hours. The cord was just the slightest bit warm when I was done with it to unplug and move it. Then when I moved it to to my bedroom... I plugged it into a power strip which only had one other thing plugged into it that was off. Every 20 minutes I had to reset the button that popped from the power strip and turn the heater back on. So what is up with that? I a not sure if it is the power strip or the heater. It's just a cute little heater, so I didn't think it would trip that power strip....but yeah. And the remote... This was probably the worst excuse for a remote I have used for any type of electronics. It takes 2 AAA batteries just so you know. The remote is ALL black including the &#34;symbols&#34; for power, oscillation, temp control, etc. So good luck reading it! That and the buttons for the remote make you feel like you have to crush it for it to work. The remote totally sucks! Oh. and as I am writing this, my power strip popped and the heater turned off again so I took a star off my review...sheesh..
