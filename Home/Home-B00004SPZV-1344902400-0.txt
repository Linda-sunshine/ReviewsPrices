review/summary: Works good once you get used to itreview/text: I've been using this for a few months now and I am happy with the purchase. I use it mainly for coating a pan or grilling and I feel its saved me much more than its cost in olive oil. There seems to be a sweet spot for how many pumps you should do depending on how full the container is to get the longest spray time before it starts coming out in a stream. Once you get used to that, it works wonderful.
