review/summary: Not a fanreview/text: I bought this grinder with high hopes based on the positive reviews, but find that the static problem is a deal breaker. I grind at the coarsest setting for cold water process coffee since the acidity is lower that way. This grinder creates very fine flakes that fly around when I remove the holder, and that cling to every part of the grinder. Not only should I not have fine flakes, but the static makes cleaning very hard. I cannot imagine doing this every morning! I will be returning this one.
