review/summary: Very lovely, high quality sheetsreview/text: I was very nervous picking out sheets online - I'd always shopped in person before now. These sheets turned out to be fabulous and washed up very well on the first washing. They've been soft and sturdy and fit our mattress very well even with the pad we have added to the top (the pockets were deep enough). I love how the flat sheet is also a bit larger than a lot of competitor sets I've had and looked at. My husband is a tall guy and we always had a problem with the flat sheet not covering well with previous sets. This hasn't been a problem this time. :)The 400-thread count looks and feels true and the fabric appears to be very durable. I'm very sensitive to the feel of fabrics because of my fibromyalgia and I love how soft these sheets turned out. They're not like &#34;microfiber&#34;, so don't misunderstand, but if you like woven cotten, these are very, very nice. I'll be getting my next set of sheets from this maker definately.
