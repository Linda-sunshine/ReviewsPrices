review/summary: Proctor Silex Electric Kettlereview/text: At first I thought this kettle would take up less space on the counter top than the low round ones. It did. However, I always unplugged my other kettles. I know it is a safety feature to automaticlly turn itself off, but when I plug it in I forget to turn it on in case it goes off automatically. I come back to cold water. Also, it is not quite ergonomically well designed. If I pour too fast, hot water comes out of the lid instead of the spout. I am also a little concerned about the &#34;exposed&#34; electrical element inside the water container. It works okay, but I miss my old kettle.
