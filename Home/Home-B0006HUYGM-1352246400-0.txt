review/summary: Excellent value for price and performance!review/text: For such a small package and price, this vac does the job and easily beats out any dust-buster type product. I didn't beleive it as much until I tried it. I was impressed. It's like a giant shop vac motor compacted in a portable hand vac. You can visually see all the stuff it picks up and when it's time to dump so that you won't lose that suction performance. Seeing is believing. Definitely one of the best purchases I made within that last few years.
