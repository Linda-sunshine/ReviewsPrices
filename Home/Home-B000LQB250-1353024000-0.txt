review/summary: Love itreview/text: This product exceeded my expectations. It sleeps just like I bought a memory foam mattress. When it is shipped to you they package it with some type of green tea mint fragrance which I did not like, it took about two weeks or so for the smell to fade. Other than that it sleeps very well, it makes my common mattress feel like I spent a couple thousand on it. Well worth it.
