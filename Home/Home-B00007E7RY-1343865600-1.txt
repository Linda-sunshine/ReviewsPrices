review/summary: Honeywell 50250-3review/text: I had spent three days researching different air purifier's, before settling on this one. For those of you reading reviews before you make a purchase decision, it is a consumer reports top-rated product. It has a CADR of 250/450. It has two filters, a carbon pre-filter,which needs to be replaced every three months, and a HEPA filter, which needs to be replaced every 1-3 years. Honeywell does not recommend running the purifier without the carbon pre-filter, but they are not too expensive, so no complaint, just take note. I have seen some reviewers who said the HEPA filter has lasted ten years, I have had ine for just an hour, so i cant vouch for that, after 20 minutes i noticed a huge improvement in my room, i am excited to see the long term benefits.Setup is easy, all you have to do is put on the carbon pre-filter, took less then five minutes to unbox it and set it up. I do recommend this product, it is highly efficient and reasonably priced, with little maintenance
