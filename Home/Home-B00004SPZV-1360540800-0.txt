review/summary: Great Productreview/text: I have 2 of these -- one I keep at work for my rice cakes (spray them and sprinkle on a little salt -- yum!). I use it with safflower or olive oil to spray on popcorn and for spraying cake pans before flouring the bottom. It works great and is much better for you than Pam or other sprays.
