review/summary: Lodge Logic L10SK3 12-Inch Pre-Seasoned Skilletreview/text: I own my share of cast iron skillets from Lodge and other manufacturers. I got this as an add on to my collection of various sizes, at 12 inches it's the largest skillet i have so far. Overall okay, but the finish inside the skillet I received was the roughest I've ever seen as new. Honestly, I don't know how this left the Lodge factory. The inner bottom of the skillet was as rougher than 80 grit sandpaper. I used it a couple of times before I got tired of the spatula abruptly stopping on more than a few &#34;speed bumps&#34;, before it forced my hand with some emery cloth and a dremel. Seriously -What's going on with the Quality Control here? I'm amazed this left the factory. I'll keep it, just too much damn trouble to return.
