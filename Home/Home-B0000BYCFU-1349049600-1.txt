review/summary: Good Price but Don't Use Outdoorsreview/text: We bought this product based on the price. Our daughter wants to can fish so we thought we would buy this for her based on price and size.It is a good product but be aware that it can't be used with outdoor propane stoves. Canning fish can be a stinky business if you do it indoors. They don't tell you about the outdoor stove issue in the description but they make a point of it in the instruction manual. My wife and I have an All-American canner and the difference in quality is clear but so is the price. With the All-American we use it on our outdoor propane stove and we also use it on our natural gas stove in our kitchen. The Presto canner uses a seal that will probably have to be replaced at some point. Anyway, this is a good product for the price but you probably don't want to get it if you intend to use it on an outdoor propane stove or turkey cooker.
