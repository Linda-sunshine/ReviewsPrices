review/summary: Stops working after several gallonsreview/text: These replacement filters stop working correctly after several gallons. Initially, they'll work great, emptying the entire top (unfiltered) canister into the bottom section. After several gallons, the filter plug up and will only let miniscule amounts of water into the bottom section. My filter is now nearly completely useless since it not only filters extremely slowly (about 1 cup overnight) but there is never enough filtered water for use. I used to make one quart of coffee in my french press every morning... no longer. I used to use filtered water in my rice cooker... no longer. I used to bring a quart of filtered water with me to work in my nalgene, and another in the evening for the gym... no longer.I thought maybe I got a bad filter out of a batch, so I tried another filter, then another, until I've used all three. They all exhibit the same trend. I know this is not right since the filter that came with filtration unit did not do this.I am very disappointed in PUR for capitalizing on a poor product, and will never buy another product from them.
