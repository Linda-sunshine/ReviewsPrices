review/summary: Just OKreview/text: I've had this vacuum now for about a year and I'm underwhelmed. After all the positive reviews, I thought it would be perfect for our area rug and it just isn't quite good enough even for that small area. I need to do many, many passes with the vacuum just for the rug to look, well, vacuumed. Maybe I got a dud. I also found the hose on the short side.
