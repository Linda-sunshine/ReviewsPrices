review/summary: I never knew how handy this would bereview/text: After a year of nearly daily use, mine is still churning out full batches of boiling water in a couple minutes. No need to fire up the stove and break out another kettle for boiling water - ramen, tea, recipes of all kinds requiring boiling water are all made convenient and easy! Mine seems to require a bit of a extra push to get the lid popped closed or it won't shut off, but that's just a small annoyance compared to having convenient boiling water.
