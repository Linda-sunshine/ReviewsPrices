review/summary: Couldn't ask for morereview/text: First off, if you don't have a hand blender - you don't know what you're missing. I used to make hummus in a standing blender, and wow, have things changed. This cut the time down from about a 20 minute ordeal involving cleaning annoying appliances and wrestling with getting stuff to blend properly - to about 3-4 minutes and cleaning a mixing bowl and detachable chopper with this hand blender. WAY easier. Of course, you can use it for many other things.I have a hard time thinking of a product I'm more satisfied with than this one. I literally cannot think of a single downside. Maybe a retractable cord? Nah, it's perfect.My favorite features:- Quiet.- Easy to handle, grip is great for me.- Fast blending.- Cheap.- Easy cleaning.- Feels solid (not cheap feeling)
