review/summary: Very light weight sweeperreview/text: Bought this as a gift for elderly mother. She was carrying her canister up and down the stairs and I wanted her to have one for each floor. She didn't want the sweeper, she thought she had enough, but I left it at her house and I see she is using it but hasn't commented on it--My nephew tried it and he says it is nice.
