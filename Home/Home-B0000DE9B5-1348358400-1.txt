review/summary: Perfect milk bottles.review/text: I love the two Bormioli Rocco Frigoverre Jugs! They are exactly the size I wanted - lightweight enough to easily hold and pour from, even when full of milk. The glass is thick and feels sturdy. The lid seals very snugly for freshness. My only wish would be that the pour spout were more defined and had a slight upturn to completely prevent drips. But that is a minor issue. I would definitely buy these again and buy from this seller because they took great care with the packaging.
