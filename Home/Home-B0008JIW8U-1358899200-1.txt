review/summary: Going back for a secondreview/text: I've had this machine for almost 4 years. I've never had any of the problems some people have experienced... always great tasting, clock correct (only time i've adjusted was with power outages), no dripping spout, etc. The reason i'm getting a new machine is that the hot plate has lost it's warmth. I use the machine 2 times a day everyday usually, so not complaining it's losing something somewhere especially considering the price. I was looking for a slighter bigger machine (like 6 cup) but the review/price range ratio is sending me back to this reliable one.
