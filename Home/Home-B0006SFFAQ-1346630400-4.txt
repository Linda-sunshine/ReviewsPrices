review/summary: Not very pleased. Doesn't work after 2 yearsreview/text: Pros:1) Auto Timer - cup of coffee waiting for you in the morning2) Water filter3) Coffee filter (don't need to purchase paper filters4) 4 Cup setting works well when making small pots.5) Adjustable Auto off timer. Coffee Pot shuts off after 1-4 hours automaticallyCons:1) Carafe Lid does not flip up, you must remove it each time you add water2) Reservoir opening is really small3) If the Carafe is not seated correctly, get ready to have a mess to clean up.4) Display is really small & tough to see5) We've owned this for just about 2 years and it kicked the bucket. I've owned less expensive coffee makers that have worked better and lasted much longer with the same/similar "pro" features listed above.Because this pot only lasted about 2 year under normal/average use (once a day) I wouldn't recommend.
