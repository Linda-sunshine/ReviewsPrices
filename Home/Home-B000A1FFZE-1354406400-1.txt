review/summary: Going on 4 yearsreview/text: I just finished cleaning my toaster combo and it looks like it's brand new. We always keep fresh foil on the pan and shake it out when it starts to smoke from to many crumbs and every now and then will spiff it up like today. We usually toast bagels and bread slices for sandwiches. The toast is always uneven to some degree compared to our retired normal toaster and sometimes it will get stuck when it pops up on the inside edge but good enough is good enough. It works well using it to melt cheese or heat up pizza slices. I'll pop in a toasted bagel covered in Parmesan and its sizzling brown in just over a minute. We don't have room for both an oven and toaster but we're looking to get an under shelf oven and return the toaster to its rightful place when we can, Being we're still using it after 4 years counts greatly for its quality and fairness of what it does. My wife gives it 2 stars but I give it a four.
