review/summary: Got it right after first few usesreview/text: This makes the authentic expresso coffee that Europeans grew up with. Apparently it takes some skill or trial and error to get it right. Also, for some reason the first couple uses don't taste right just as other reviewers have noticed.It's a very simple way to make expresso too. I have a milk frother that with this unit makes it simple and reliable to make the best cappuccino every time. If you like cappuccino, you just need this unit and a way to froth milk. People swear by milk frothers and it does put the coffee made by the Bialetti over the top in terms of quality and popularity with people in the house.
