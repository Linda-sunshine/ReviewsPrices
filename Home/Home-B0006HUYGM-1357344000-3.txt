review/summary: Outstanding!review/text: Very powerful and versatile. Also, it's surprisingly quiet especially given how well it works. This is much more convenient than lugging my standup vacuum around to clean the stairs. Also, since the brush is powered by a dedicated motor, it is far more powerful than the air driven brush on my standup vacuum's hose attachment.A great deal!
