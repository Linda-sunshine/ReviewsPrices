review/summary: Great for Jerkyreview/text: Did a fine job on my first Jerky batch. I may have added a little too much liquid smoke but I'll adjust for next time. As others have mentioned the trays have small slots in them so they can do their job. I found that patting the meat slices after keeping them in the marinade mad for minimal clean up. Don't worry if you leave it overnight in the marinade it will still have plenty of flavor. I also put some plastic wrap in the very bottom of the machine which helped as well. Only used it once and it was able to make fantastic jerky from hand cut meat in about 5-6 hours. I pulled some of the thinner stuff out before it got too brittle, and left some of the thinker pieces in longer. So far great product.
