review/summary: Amazing flannel sheetsreview/text: These sheets are not like other flannel sheets. They are so incredibly soft and amazing. I hesitated to order them for a long time because of the price, but they are so worth it. Washed and dried great and were soft from the start. I have always used fleece sheets in the past, but they don't even compare to these sheets.
