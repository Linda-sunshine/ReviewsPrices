review/summary: No boil overreview/text: Best percolator I've ever tried. Impossible to boil over. The only problem is the plastic knob on top. It twisted off within eight months. The cover fits on very tight and and youuse the knob to lift the cover on and off--this loosens the knob causing you to constantlyhave to tighten it down. A replacement knob was available(also plastic so I ordered 3).How much more would a glass one cost Faberware for the resulting customer satisfaction??
