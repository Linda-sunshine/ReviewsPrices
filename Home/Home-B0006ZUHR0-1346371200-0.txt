review/summary: Leaks Terriblyreview/text: The very first time used this iron I put water in it and within 5 minutes every last drop had leaked out the back. I had to put the shirt I was ironing back in the dryer because it was so wet. Maybe mine was just defective, but this was such a disaster that I will not try another Black & Decker iron.
