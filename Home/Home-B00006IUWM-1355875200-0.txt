review/summary: Works like a champ!review/text: I wanted to get a good quality sharpening in the comfort of my home. I read all the reviews for this product and decided to give it a go. Once i received it, I put her to the test. I took some of my mothers oldest and dullest knives ( as I have a new set [victorinox 4-piece fibrox set] that doesn't need sharpening...yet). I was not disappointed...this machine gave my mothers old tired dull knives a razors edge. Anyone who says otherwise obviously has either a defective model, or they can't read/comprehend simple instructions....I HIGHLY recommend this item.
