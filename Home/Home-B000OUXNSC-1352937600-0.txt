review/summary: what it says it is, also not very thickreview/text: Well this is a queen-sized mattress topper. it does have the subtle striping pattern on it which is nice. seems like the right size, decent fit and finish, nothing to write home about. Has a pretty significant smell when opened, as do many things packaged in china (yes elsewhere too) and left to marinate in their phlalates. Letting it sit out a day or two, or washing will help. As others have mentioned, if you put it in the dryer just do so for a short period, but safest to just air dry it, which really isn't that much to ask we're just so stuck on convenience nowadays. What I don't like about it is how thin the actual mattress pad is; there's just not much filling in it, and brand new, it just seems like it's been lied on already quite a bit. Then again it was tightly packaged for who knows how long, so that could contribute. Maybe it will expand with time but, matter cannot be created nor destroyed, and there isn't much matter here to begin with. The price isn't too high, and it is what it says it is, so at this price level (15, i paid) if it's what you're looking for get it. I guess it's just not going to be as lofty as a down mattress pad or a similar $40+ piece.
