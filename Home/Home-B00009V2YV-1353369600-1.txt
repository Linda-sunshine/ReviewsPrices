review/summary: Worked for 3 weeks - then diedreview/text: I initially setup this weather radio and liked being able to program it. Everything seemed to be working fine.After about three weeks I checked it and it has stopped receiving the weather radio. I changed the position and even moved it right next to my 2nd upstairs weather radio, but had no luck.It appears some part has stopped working.I appreciate Amazon taking it back up to 30 days.Please check yours around the 3 week period to make sure it is still working.I won't buy this model again.
