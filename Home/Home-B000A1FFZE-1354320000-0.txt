review/summary: Good multi-purpose toaster.review/text: Hamilton Beach hit it pretty close to perfect with this toaster. I love the ability to toast from the top (like the conventional two-port toaster) and also toast in the little oven portion. Flexible? Yes.The toaster is well constructed and buttons and knobs are easy to read, easy to turn and the like. Everything is pretty sturdy and is relatively simple to disassemble (for cleaning purposes).Now on its intended function, toasting. For the most part, this is what I would expect out of any other toaster and then some. Put food in, and toast. The top slot easily fits a decent size bagle, halved, inserted side by side. It also does muffins, english muffins, bread, texas toast with ease. You definitely will not be fighting for space to jam a slice of bread, or two in the top. In all honesty, I haven't used the bottom part as much, but from the few times I have, it is on par with other toaster ovens.Now the reason I gave it 4 stars. I like it. It is pretty clever to fit a toaster oven and toaster into one instrument. I don't love it. It takes a fair amount of time to cook anything, and by comparison, my parent's have a traditional toaster that definitely &#34;toasts&#34; faster. You will be getting your money's worth with this but its ultimately just a unique, well-designed toaster. Nothing more.
