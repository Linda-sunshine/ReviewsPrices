review/summary: darn good radio.....review/text: .....especially for the price. I live in Joplin, mo, and survived the tornado. Bought this after much research and buying a new house. Works like a charm, and after programming, only wakes us when severe threat is in the area. 110v with battery backup....perfect! Recommend highly, especially for the price.
