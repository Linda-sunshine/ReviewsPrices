review/summary: As reliable as the Culligan name!review/text: We have owned the Britta system for many years. We simply got tired of replacing them! The working life of them was very short. I considered the other systems but after reading the reviews, we decided to try the Culligan system. We are so glad we did! It lives up to the name Culligan and is reliable and well built!
