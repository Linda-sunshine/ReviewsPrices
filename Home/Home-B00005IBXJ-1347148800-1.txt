review/summary: Great Pizza NO oven heatreview/text: I have been using my pizzazz for over 2 years, and it is the best! I have not put a pizza in the oven since I got it. Cooks just right, No preheating needed, and there are 3 different heat setting so self rising frozen pizzas cook up just wonderful. Great for gasrlic bread or lots of other things. This is a much used item in my kitchen.
