review/summary: Works well for the pricereview/text: I've been using this juicer daily for the past few months. I'm trying the GAPS diet on my son and it's an essential. The description says it's compact but I think it's huge! Are the other models even bigger than this? It takes up a lot of counter space. I found at first it worked really well, it extracted the juice and the pulp was really dry. Over time however pulp has become more wet. I'm not sure if it's because the blades are becoming more dull or it's the motor. It's not a deal breaker but we try to buy organic fruits and veggies, I'd like to get the most out of it. I also wish there was a tray at the top to make it easier to run the fruit through the chute. I don't know if any juicers out there have this feature but it would be handy. The brush that came with this for cleaning is sufficient, however I found that a Munchin Baby Bottle brush is much quicker. Overall I would recommend the juicer, I know this review sounds like I'm complaining left and right but it's given our family's health a boost.
