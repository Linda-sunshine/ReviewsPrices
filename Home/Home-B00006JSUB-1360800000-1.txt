review/summary: Good but confusedreview/text: I thought cast iron was black, no matter what. Then I clean this pan properly after a few uses (it was starting to get a weird smell and taste to the food) and up comes the black and there's silver underneath. Not really sure what this means, but I've kept using it and it seems to be better.
