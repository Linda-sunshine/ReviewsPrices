review/summary: Arrived without lidreview/text: Pitcher seemed nice, but it arrived without the lid. I was hoping they could just send the lid separately, but they require sending it back for an exchange.Update: I've received the new shipment with lid included and I like the pitcher a lot. I was trying to find a large pitcher made of glass that I could brew tea in. The lid is easy to use, simply twist to seal it. It is easy to pour without spilling. The pitcher is quite heavy, which I don't mind, and seems very sturdy.
