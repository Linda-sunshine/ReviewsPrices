review/summary: Love itreview/text: This mixer was a life saver. I made 1000 cookies over the holidays and this mixer made it easy. The high capacity helped me make double batches with ease and no mess. Mine didn't rattle or shake like other reviews said even with the large amounts of dough in it. Not a fan of the non dishwasher safe attachments or else I would have given a 5 rating.
