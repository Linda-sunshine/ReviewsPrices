review/summary: Good Juicerreview/text: After using this for a few weeks, this juicer works well and cleans up easily. and seems to have ample power.While it's nice to have the wide mouth, if you are juicing carrots one at a time, they really jump around as they go thru the blade causing the whole the unit shake and vibrate. So you need to feed several thru at once to eliminate this. However I think this unit is a good value for the price.
