review/summary: Make sure to put a towel down!review/text: This humidifier is awesome, and I thought I was being smart when I got one that sprayed FORWARD rather than up (most spray straight up). After the first night, I realized that on any settings other than low, the spray leaves a huge puddle, making the dresser it was sitting on and the carpet significantly wet. I have to put a towel down now, but I still think this is a pretty good humidifier, great for apartments that are dry or a kids room.
