review/summary: Exactly what I was looking for.review/text: Hard to find California King size mattress cover. Nothing fancy, highly functional, good quality. Washed well, fits my deep 8 series air bed just fine. The only negative I can say for it and I didn't deduct because I can't say I looked is that it's made in China. Size like this makes it hard to be selective on where it's made.
