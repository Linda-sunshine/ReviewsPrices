review/summary: Not Brita Filters!! But Velvet Sales and Amazon handled my complaint very well!review/text: I purchased a 10 pack of what i thought were Brita filters from Velvet Sales. They turned out to be generic filters made to fit the Brita system. I complained to Amazon and was given an immediate return authorization and my credit card charge was quickly reversed even before I had sent the filters back. I posted a negative review of Velvet Sales and was contacted by them. They apologized and asked me to let them know how much the return shipping charges were so they could issue a refund to me. I still feel the posting is misleading and they should make it clear on the web page that these are not the Brita filters that are pictured but they acted responsibly and did the right thing. I am very satisfied with their handling of the problem and would definitely try buying from them again
