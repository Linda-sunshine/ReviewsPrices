review/summary: Stays hot, no leaks...very pleased. (just don't overfill)review/text: In short, this is a quality item that delivers. Rest assured that as long as you fill it no higher than the top " ridge line " the liquid will not leak at all: Just add coffee, 2 sugars, close and shake to mix. I throw this in my computer bag alongside my laptop and iPad and have zero concern - hot coffee stays hot for hours and the last sip is as fresh as the first. Please understand that if you overfill the mug and liquid gets trapped above the black rubber gasket, then yes, it will (obviously) leak.....that is operator error, not a functional design flaw. I like the fact that the spring loaded cover stays open when drinking and doesn't fall back against your nose. Additionally, the raised lip around the drinking area is as comfortable to drink from as a regular coffee cup. This item just works. I own two (2) of them and highly recommend it. When in my car (BMW ) I use the in- dash cup holder as opposed to the center console because it is a bit tall and interferes with the shifter...but it sits solidly and has never fallen out (admittedly, I drive a bit aggressively and other thermal coffe mugs have been dislodged). I don't think that you will be disappointed.
