review/summary: Coffee-er-coffeereview/text: This highly polished stainless steel Farbenware percolator arrived in perfect condition, packed as if glass.As coffee percolates, the aroma fills the room like no drip method or press can. This is the way coffee should be brewed.The plastic handle is attached with a Phillips head screw (like Teflon fry pans) for easy tightening, if needed.An excellent value at any price.
