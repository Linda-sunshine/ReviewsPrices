review/summary: Great pans EXCEPT for the 15" skilletreview/text: I have the lodge Cast Iron Skillets at 6", 8", 10", 12", and 15". All of these are fantastic EXCEPT the 15" skillet which is not flat. The center of the pan buldges upwards like a hill and the oil trickles down to the sides of the pan. I have read that other reviewers have the same issue, but only with the 15". It makes cooking an omelette quite the challenge.
