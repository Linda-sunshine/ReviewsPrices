review/summary: Not Bad!review/text: Bought this to co-exist with a Verismo. I was pleasantly surprised as it has more features than was described on Amazon. I bought an eckobrew re-usable pod to keep my cost per use down. Set up is easy if you follow the instructions.You can register it online. I do recommend however that you run 20-30 full cups of water through the system to wash out the new taste before brewing your first cup. The coffee seems to taste better if you stay at the small or medium size cup. The large seems to taste a little thin. I like this brewer and will put the Verismo in to retirement! I do recommend this! I am very happy!!
