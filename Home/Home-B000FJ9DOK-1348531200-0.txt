review/summary: Keeps It Cold!!review/text: The bottle was working well for me. It keeps the contents cold even after a day or two, doesn't leak, no condensation and fits in cup holders. Everything I was looking for in a water bottle. After many uses, I gave it to my Grand-daughter who needed a larger water bottle to take to school daily and always wanted one like mine. The silicon grip makes the bottle easy to carry even for a small child. I bought two more for the other two older grandchildren. I'll probably buy the Thermos UnderAmour for me which holds more, has the a silicon grip, but costs more.
