review/summary: Made TERRIBLE noise while kneading!!!! (Video attached)review/text: Length:: 0:17 MinsI love baking all of our bread but work full-time so I love my bread machine. My old trustworthy Magic Chef finally died after 23 years!! After doing my research and reading TONS of reviews, it came down to the Panasonic SD-YD250 or the Zojirushi. The Panasonic actually had more favorable reviews and the price was quite a bit lower so I went with the Panasonic. I am soooo disappointed. I am hoping that I got a lemon and this is not normal as I read so many reviews that said the breadmaker is quiet. I thought about trying to live with the noise as the quality of the bread is awesome but I cant do it. There is no way that I could set the delay timer and have this kind of racket going on while we are trying to sleep. I am disappointed that I am going to have to return it! Has anyone else had these problems or is it just mine? I dont know whether to return for a refund or get another one. I have to tell you that this is on the Bake/Sandwich mode. I did make a whole wheat loaf and it does not do this on the Whole Wheat setting. Just completed this loaf and the yeast did not dispense :( (Sorry, I took my video sideways!)
