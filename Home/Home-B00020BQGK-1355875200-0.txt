review/summary: Great product only one problem.....review/text: Beautiful, I loved it! Product was exactly as described, good quality for an awesome price, and super speedy shipment! I LOVE AMAZON! Only one problem....this vaccum has an automatic shut off feature when it gets over heated the vaccum will run but no power bar or suction you have to unplug it and wait 30 minutes. This vacuum started over heating when i used it for longer than 20 to 30 minuites within the first week that i got it. I'm dissapointed in Hoover, I have always thought Hoover was a good vacuum but they messed this one up!
