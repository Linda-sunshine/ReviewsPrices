review/summary: LOVE this thing!!!!review/text: I got this for Christmas and it was an alternative to the one I originally had on my amazon wishlist. But, definitely was not disappointed. It pops up so fast and gets a lot more kernels that doing it in oil or an ordinary popcorn machine. The only thing I would complain about, be it minor, is that sometimes the kernels are blown out before they are done popping. Since they get hot, you have to be quick and throw them back in. Other times, too. when it pops into the bowl, I've noticed some kernels like to pop as they enter the bowl (which caused the entire bowl to just explode of popcorn. Actually was pretty hilarious to me but still...could have been the type of popcorn since I just use the yellow kernels). I've been hooked on using this thing and love the little cup on the top to melt butter in.
