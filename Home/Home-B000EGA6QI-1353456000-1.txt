review/summary: Cuisinart blender doesn'treview/text: This is my second Cuisinart CSB-76BC Smartstick blender. They both died prematurely from bad motor or stripped drive-housing. It's a great idea and wonderful to use during its short life, but this particular model is a waste of time and money. I'd recommend spending more for something durable; most likely not a Cuisinart.
