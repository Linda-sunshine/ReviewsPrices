review/summary: Amazing little sharpenerreview/text: I have been looking for a knife sharpener for some time now, and Have finally found one that works.I have J.A henkel knives and after 8 years they have become very dull almost to the point where I didn't use them anymore. So I seen this sharpener and the good feedback it got, so decided to use it. I must say it met my standards of sharpening a knife. I had to repeat the sharpening prcess about 2 times on one knife but it made it sharper than new. The process is very easy to sharpen, just pass the knife through both sides 3 times alternating and they are sharpened. I will definitely recommend this to people.
