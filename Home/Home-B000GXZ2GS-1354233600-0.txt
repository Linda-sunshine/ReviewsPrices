review/summary: Best cup of coffee I've ever had!review/text: I just tried this product for the first time this morning. LOVE IT! Seriously, makes the best cup of coffee I've ever had. I made it has it recommends. Made a 2 shot espresso and then added water, like an Americano. I honestly didn't have super high hopes while using it, and then when I tried the coffee, I was shocked. Had to go around my office showing it off. If you want some thing quick and simple to make coffee, this is not the machine for you. However, if you want the best cup of coffee you've ever had and can follow instructions well, GET THIS!
