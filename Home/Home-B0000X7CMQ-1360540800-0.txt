review/summary: Excellent coffee maker.review/text: After looking at dozens of coffee makers--I decided to try this one. I knew nothing about the company, but liked the removable filter basket--similar to the Braun machine I was replacing. As mentioned in other reviews, the thermos top does stick if you tighten it as directed when making coffee--so leave it a little loose. While easy to use--it is not as convienent as The Braun design. That said it appears to be well made and most importantly makes a great cup of coffee. I go to the trouble of roasting my own coffee beans, overall I am very satisfied with this machine.
