review/summary: Superb product and resultreview/text: This has been a fantastic buy for us. It is unbelievable how easy it is to make great rice and how much better it tastes. We primarily make brown rice. The rice is plump and full of flavor. I've started using the timer and it is such a treat to have the rice perfectly down at whatever time desired. I've used it to have porridge (steel cut oats) steaming hot for me at 5:30 a.m. when I get up. I can't imagine going back to the way we used to make rice.
