review/summary: Good working ironreview/text: I iron almost everything we wear and this iron does an impressionable job on everything from spandex to heavy denim jeans. Puts an excellent crease in jeans! Only gave it 4 stars because it leaves water spots at times and I cannot determine where the water is coming from. Also a minor inconvenience is that I keep having to adjust the steam level as the dial keeps moving with right-handed usage. I would not discourage anyone from purchasing this iron, especially if they could get it on sale.
