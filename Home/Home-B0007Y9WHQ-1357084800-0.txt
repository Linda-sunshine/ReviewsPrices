review/summary: Easy to use and cleanreview/text: I was in the market for a spiralizer, and this one had great reviews, plus the price was right. I was pleasantly surprised with how good it is for the cost. It is easy to clean. Simple to operate. I have only used one of the three blades so far, but it works perfectly. I use it mainly to spiral cut zucchini, as we are on the paleo diet, and I use that instead of pasta. It works great, and you can use the zucchini raw or steam it for a couple minutes. I leave the skin on. I do use organic veggies. My countertop is tile, and as long as I don't place one of the feet on a bit of grout, it is solid and works great. The uneven surface of the grouted joints makes it harder for the suction cup to cling. I wish they had more detailed instructions and maybe even some recipes with the product, but I am very happy with the purchase, and it appears to be very well made, so I expect it to last a long time.
