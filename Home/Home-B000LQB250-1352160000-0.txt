review/summary: Mattress Topperreview/text: This mattress topper is well worth the investment. I have back and sciatic problems that made sleeping on my left side difficult. This topper has solved the problem. I have been getting great night's sleep since I installed it . It does make the bed a little higher which gave my husband problems at first but he has gotten use to it and now finds it great as well. Would order another one in a heartbeat.
