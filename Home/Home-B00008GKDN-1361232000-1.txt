review/summary: Works Great Using Induction Cooktopreview/text: I purchased the Nuwave Precision Induction Cooktop (as seen on TV) a few weeks ago. I did not purchase the cast iron griddle for $40. I did purchase the Lodge cast iron griddle for $14. It works great. Grill sandwiches turned out the best I have ever made. Maintains exact temperature.
