review/summary: Love it!review/text: This is just your basis hot air popper. Now fancy bells and whistles, just good old hot air popped corn. A couple of the kernels do fly out, but I have had that issue with other poppers in the past too, I think it is just the nature of the machine. We stand back and use it with caution. The pop corn comes out great, tastes just how I expected it too, and the clean up is so eary. Love it!
