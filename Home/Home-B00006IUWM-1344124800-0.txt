review/summary: Just OKreview/text: I was expecting outstanding cutting from my knife set but I have to say that although they felt much better they didn't perform as well as I thought they would.Since I wasn't too thrilled about it I re-did the sharpening (as per the instructions) with little improvement.Note though that I don't think this item is bad, it really does sharpen the knives and improves over never-sharpened blades. I would still recommend this for someonethat wants to get out of manually sharpening.
