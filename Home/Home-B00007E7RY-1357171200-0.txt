review/summary: Efficient and quiet enough. Never slept better.review/text: Love this thing. Our apartment has water damage in the windowsills and walls, but we can't move right now (and the building Manager is useless) so we got this little guy. We wake up without sinus headaches, we sleep better than ever, and the whole room just feels and smells fresher. The low setting is quiet enough to act like a white noise machine while we sleep (something we actually need in noisy San Francisco) and do the job well (our bedroom is about 12x12). I imagine the higher settings would be too loud to sleep through, but if you have noisy neighbors and want to raise the noise floor, this is a great way to do it. Excellent purchase!
