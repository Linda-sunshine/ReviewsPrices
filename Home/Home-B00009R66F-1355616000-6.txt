review/summary: Had to have 2 replacements sentreview/text: I was quite disappointed in the quality of this machine. The first machine one of the rotator brushes broke off the first time I was using it. The second one the control mechanism was improperly installed at the factory and made the machine useless. I am waiting for my 3rd machine from Amazon. If the next one does not work right, I will just get a refund and get and different machine.
