review/summary: Makes good coffeereview/text: This pot makes good coffee. We set it up the night before and plug it into a timer, and coffee is ready in the morning when we are. Comes with square filters that have a hole in the middle and one on each corner. Slip the center hole over the basket's spindle, add coffee, then slip the corners on the spindle. LOL, we found that a square paper napkin does the trick, with only placing one hole, in the center.The pot has no settings for darker or lighter brewing, no ability to perk longer if you like your brew darker. We tried brewing a pot in the evening, unplugging, then plugging into the timer for a second perk in the morning. That is one way to get stronger coffee that, in my opinion, is not as bitter as simply using more ground coffee beans. Another method we've used on drip coffee makers but not tried on this pot is using two or three filters to slow the passage of water to allow the ground beans longer contact with the water.
