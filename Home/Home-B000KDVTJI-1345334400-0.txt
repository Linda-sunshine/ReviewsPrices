review/summary: Reading the manual may solve some of the previously posted problems.review/text: I just bought this kettle and the first time I used it I boiled water and left the remaining water in the kettle. When I woke up the next morning, my counter was covered in water. After some experimenting I discovered that the kettle leaked from the bottom of the handle by the on/off switch. I was determined to return it for another but first I thought I would see what I could find on Aroma's website. I found the manual at the website and after a quick read I discovered:1) the auto shut off won't work if the lid is not completely closed (clicked)--this may solve the problem that some are having2) water should not be left in the kettle after boiling--therefore it won't leak in between uses.Although, I still feel that this is a design flaw, a kettle should not leak, but as long as everything else works properly I could probably deal with filling the kettle before use and emptying after boiling to avoid water everywhere. Hope this helps other, here is the link the manual[...]*I contacted the customer service of Aroma and was promptly emailed back and informed that the water leaking from the handle was in fact a manufacturers defect and they would be happy to replace my existing kettle with an upgrade and there was no need to return my current kettle. I only hope the new kettle doesn't have any issues either!
