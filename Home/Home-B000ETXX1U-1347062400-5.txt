review/summary: Great bed BUT there are no fitted sheets that fit it.review/text: We often have company from out of town and we wanted to make sure they had a comfortable bed to sleep on that wouldn't take up most of a room when we did not have company. After much research, I chose a Wenzel. It was a very comfortable bed that inflated and deflated well.EXCEPTThe mattress, though advertised as queen-size is too big for fitted queen sheets, no matter the manufacturer, and too small for fitted king sheets. I figured this was sort of a scam by Wenzel viz., the company had made the bed such a size that you would have to buy sheets from Wenzel as well. I thought this was a bit cheesy, but since i already had the bed, i called Wenzel to find out how to get sheets that would fit. When i finally reached someone at Wenzel who was prepared to address the issue for me, I learned that Wenzel knew that fitted queen sheets wouldn't fit, but knew of no source for sheets that would fit!!!!???? I asked if Wenzel had any plans to see that such sheets were manufactured. "Not really," I was told.Of course people lived without fitted sheets for centuries: but the difference is with a regular bed, you can use a flat sheet and simply tuck it under the mattress, you can't do that with a blow up bed with a built in box spring.We've gone back to an aero bed. They don't last as long, but at least you can make the bed properly: the point of these beds is convenience, after all.WHAT WAS WENZEL THINKING?
