review/summary: Just Bought My Second Onereview/text: My husband and I use this iron daily. We bought our first B&D Digital Advantage iron exactly 4 years ago from Amazon. It finally just died on us this week. It has been used heavily and even took several dives off the ironing board and kept going. 4 years is a long time for an iron if you ask me. So, after looking at all the irons available, this one still has the best ratings. We love all the features on it and never had any problems with it until this week when it kept shutting off. The best thing is that the iron is $17 cheaper now than 4 years ago.
