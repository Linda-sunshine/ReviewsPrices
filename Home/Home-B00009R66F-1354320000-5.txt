review/summary: Hoover Steamvacreview/text: Back in 2007, I bought a similar machine from Hoover that was not good, at all. This one is very good. It cleaned a carpet (that I thought would have to be replaced) well enough to keep the carpet a little longer. That, by itself, made this purchase worth the money. There has been substantial improvements on this Steamvac in the last 5 years.
