review/summary: Needs Work - But Useablereview/text: I had previously owned a $20 kettle, bought at the Superstore in Canada, that worked like a charm. In comparison, this one fails in several regards: it is much smaller (I guess the liter capacity needs to be noted), but works for the average kitchen. I used my previous one to heat water for cooking, so loved the higher capacity. Another major faux pas is that the water capacity guage, the liter marker, does NOT work at all. I bought two of these, and on both, I cannot see the water level through the guage - Am I doing something wrong??! Finally, in my previous kettle, the lid came all the way off - and this had many advantages - including cleaning, re-filling and also basic use. On this, the lid stays on. Would I recommend this to other buyers? Sure. Would I buy another for myself or someone? Nope.
