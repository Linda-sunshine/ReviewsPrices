review/summary: Utopia Amissreview/text: As with "The Hunger Game Series," my thirteen year old grandson, Jonathan, had read "The Giver" and recommended I read it. My daughter also read the book, and Jonathan told me his mother and he could not agree on the ending. This piqued my interest so I bought "The Giver" to read. I enjoyed reading it, but can see why Jonathan and his mother disagreed about the ending. The village where Jonas, the main character, grows up is in the future. The people in it are highly controlled and it is a vanilla world where psychologically expressions of strong emotions have been eliminated. There is no love, hate, anger, or depression, and hunger and disease have been eradicated. It is a asexual world where birth mothers are chosen to have babies. Each family unit is allowed two children, a boy and a girl. Husband and wives are assigned to each other based upon personality and intelligence as well as your life's occupation. A ruling body of twelve elders sets the rules and controls the population. There are surrounding villages, but the people have little contact with them. Older people and new babies (if multiple births such as twins) are released. Only one family is different in the community, and that is the Receiver-Giver family who are identified by their light (blue) eyes. They are the family from which the current Receiver is chosen. This individual is the most important person in the village since he remembers what the world was like when their ancestors experienced war, famine, disease, and crises. Jonas is chosen by the retiring Receiver who is now old. I would recommend buying this book to learn what Jonas does once he receives the memories and what action he takes. Lowry does not explain everything, thus what has occurred and what is going to occur remains a mystery. The reader is left to develop his own scenario(s).
