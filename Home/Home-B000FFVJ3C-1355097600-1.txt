review/summary: Best dehydrator ever for the moneyreview/text: Works just like they said it would. I've had it for a month or so and I have dehydrated about 15 lbs. of meat with no problems. I also dehydrated some fruit and that turned out pretty good. I used some Naked juice and made some pretty tasty fruit roll ups.I would recommend to anyone.
