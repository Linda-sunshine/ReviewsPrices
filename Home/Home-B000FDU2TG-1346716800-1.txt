review/summary: Exceeded expectations!review/text: Bought this for smoothie's made with frozen fruit. Very happy with how it performs. Have also used it to chop vegtables and it does great. Love it as it has far exceeded my expectations! However,I did purchase the model with a glass jar. I personally hate plastic...especially when it comes to food storage and/or preparation. IMHO!!!
