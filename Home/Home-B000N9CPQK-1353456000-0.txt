review/summary: Does a great job for my little room!review/text: I am currently living in Afghanistan in terribly dusty conditions and my room actually has an opening to the outside which allows extra dust to enter my room. I kept waking up congested every morning despite cleaning my room consistently (it's a tiny 40 sq foot room of plywood). I decided to get this air purifier when it was a good price and have been so happy with it. Since getting it I've left it running 24/7 in my room and haven't woken up with any allergy issues at all. It's been such a great thing to have out here and I would highly recommend it for anybody living in regular locations who have bad dust/pollen/whatever allergies. I have no idea if it works as well in larger spaces, but considering my room isn't closed off from other rooms in my bhut nor closed off to the outside, it's doing a fantastic job. It isn't quiet, but the hum is consistent and hasn't bothered me sleeping. It's the same noise level as if you had a fan on. I've had it running for almost a month and haven't had to wash the filters yet either. Highly recommend this!
