review/summary: Ungainly but does the jobreview/text: The price on this product was great--much cheaper than buying in the supermarket! It works great. I noted that another user objected to the lid, which tends to cling to the reservoir. I've had a little difficulty with the lid, but find that most of the time it comes off easily if I press down on the little flanges on the reservoir top. My only complaint is that I can't fill it directly from the faucet; it's too tall. OK, I realize that the big benefit is that one can store it in the icebox door, but I can't because that's full of other stuff. I'd prefer a shorter, fatter pitcher, but this one has a certain elegance, enjoyed mostly by me alone.
