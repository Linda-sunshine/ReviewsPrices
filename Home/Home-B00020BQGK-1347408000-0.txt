review/summary: My search is overreview/text: When my old stick vacuum died I searched endlessly for another one with a power cord. All I could find in Macy's, Penny's, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Sears were battery operated vacuums which I do not like. I was thrilled when I found this Hoover Flair on Amazon. The vacuum arrived in two days and works great on both carpet and bare floors. The power cord is extra long which eliminates having to plug and unplug often as you move from area to area while cleaning. Highly recommended.
