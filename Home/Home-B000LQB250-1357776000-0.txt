review/summary: sleep studio sleep joy 3&#34;review/text: after intense and tiring research on memory foam mattress toppers my husband and I chose this one and have been more than satisfied! it is the perfect thickness, it fits our bed perfect and it has stopped the morning back aches. I was nervous about regretting my large purchase but honestly, I recommend this product to anyone looking for a great night's sleep.
