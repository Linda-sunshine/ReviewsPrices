review/summary: My search ended with my Amazon purchase of my Capresso 560review/text: I have purchased several different brands of grinders. I purchased from the "Top of the Line" to the low budget devices. The major problem with each was discharge passages getting clogged up or losing programing. The blade types are close to useless.Although the Compresso 560 has a manual timer, which isn't the most accurate in measuring the amount to grind, the grind is perfect and the drop-in hamper for the ground beans is clean, dumps clean and doesn't clog up.I am completely satisfied with this unit and highly recommend it to others.
