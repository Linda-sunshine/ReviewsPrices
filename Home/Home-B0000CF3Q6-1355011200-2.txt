review/summary: Decent, but leaks and handle meltsreview/text: My home has a gas stove so the flames lick at the handle if not positioned correctly. A metal handle would get hot but that would be better than melted plastic. Further, it leaks sometimes when heating up and leaks sometimes when it violently discharges the coffee. However, the coffee it produces is high quality.
