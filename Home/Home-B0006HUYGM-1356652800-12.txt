review/summary: dog hair destroyerreview/text: i really like that there are two modes on this vacuum. you can vacuum with or without the brush spinning. my have carpetted stairs and the dogs love to shed there more than anywhere else in the house. it was a pain to lug the normal vacuum up and get half the step with the vacuum brush and the other half with the hose and never get it all. other small handhelds that don't have a brush mode aren't good on carpet. this puppy does it all.
