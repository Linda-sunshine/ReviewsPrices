review/summary: Not for high heat cookingreview/text: The side of the wok is way too thin and it gets burn quite often while stir frying. In order to stir fry properly, high heat is essential to get the &#34;breath of wok&#34;, however, this wok cannot take the heat. well, I still like this wok for steaming whole fish. As long as you don't need to cook with high heat, this wok will be fine for you. (And if you do need to cook with high heat, get a carbon steel or iron wok. But they do require seasoning and maintenance)
