review/summary: Some Good, Some Badreview/text: We've had 3 different Crane humidifiers for our boys' rooms: Frog, Dog, and Dragon. The Frog lasted for 2 years running pretty much non stop. It was amazing. The motor finally started getting loud and not working as well as it had so we replaced it with the Dragon. The Dragon worked great for the first winter and then we put it into storage (after thoroughly cleaning and drying it out). Just took it out this week and it doesn't work correctly. The motor runs loudly and makes the water compartment to be very hot. Also no mist comes out. We checked and there are no clogs anywhere. So in the trash its going. The dog is doing fine despite having not having been used all summer. Very disappointed about the Dragon considering the life of the Frog. 5 stars for our experience with the Frog, 0 stars for our experience with the Dragon. TBD about the Dog.
