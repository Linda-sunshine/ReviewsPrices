review/summary: Affordable and efficientreview/text: This coffeemaker gets the job done quite easily, but you pay for what you get. The lid sticks sometimes and is hard to pull up, and setting the delay brew feature took me some time to master (due to my own lack of wanting to read the directions multiple times), but its easy to clean and use. Perfect size for my single person household, and the most affordable option I could find for the best ratings.
