review/summary: Great for the pricereview/text: I bought this when I moved to a 3-story house and my Dyson was too heavy and awkward to use to clean the stair's carpet. This little thing is powerful and does the job right. I like the riser visor to clean the vertical carpet on the stairs.The only thing I don't like is cleaning the filter - I'm used to the Dyson - but I guess an old toothbrush would probably help.If you have a good vacuum cleaner and are looking for a cheap but decent handheld for your stairs, this is the one.
