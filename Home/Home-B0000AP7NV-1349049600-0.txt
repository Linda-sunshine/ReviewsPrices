review/summary: Durable Pitcher Includes a Filter For Less Than $10review/text: I've bought three of these at different times over the years and it's held up very well. It is slim enough to fit into the side of most fridges. It is plastic so the side can get scratched up a bit over the years if you scrape it against something repeatedly but it'll take a lot of abuse before you start thinking of replacing for aesthetic purposes. I've dropped it from shoulder height before (bar height) onto carpeted floor and hard floor without it breaking or puncturing. If you factor in the cost of the filter included, the pitcher is pretty cheap.I have had no problems with the lid falling out when pouring. The lid fits real well and has a bit of "suction" when you try to remove it. But it isn't so tight that gravity has no effect. I bet that the people having problems with the lid falling out is trying to get the last bit of water out of the pitcher and pouring as if they are dumping the water out. It's like a pouring tea out of a teapot. It's just common sense to press the lid against the pitcher when you have the lid at an angle where the lid is close to being upside down.This review isn't about about Brita vs Pur. I like Pur more but Pur doesn't have a comparable slim pitcher either.
