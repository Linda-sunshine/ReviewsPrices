review/summary: Perfect for the single personreview/text: If you usually make one cup of tea at a time, this is great. It is no-frills but works great and heats very quickly. it's more difficult to heat two cups of water, though, because you have to wait for the steam to clear out to start it again. If you envision yourself doing that frequently, I'd recommend something else. Also, it is impossible to stop it before it hits boiling, so you cannot heat water to sub-boiling temperatures e.g. for more delicate teas.
