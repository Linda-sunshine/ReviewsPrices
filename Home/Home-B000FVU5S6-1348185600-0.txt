review/summary: Kind of Disappointedreview/text: First the good: I love the Maize color...a very nice yellow that was just what I wanted. The California King size fitted sheet fits my mattress perfectly. The top sheet is even Cal. King size.Now the not so good: The sheets are very heavy. They are not soft, but scratchy. They do not even slide with each other...they kind of stick together.Bottom line: I love the look, but hate the feel. Maybe they'll soften up with age.
