review/summary: Can't use this for the purpose intended.review/text: Just had new carpet installed, ordered this little vacuum from Amazon for quick daily once-over, in addition to my weekly large, heavy vacuum. To my dismay, I can't use this Hoover on my carpet, even though it specifically has a "carpet" setting. My new carpet is a low cut twisted pile, all one short length with no design. The Hoover Flair sucks right down and sticks tight to the carpet, and it won't glide. I can't either push or pull it. I believe if I had a loop carpet, a low "outdoor" type carpet, or a high-low looped carpet, it would work OK, but it does NOT work on my low-cut pile. I emailed Hoover, but they won't help. Sigh. A waste of money and time. Nice looking vacuum, and works great on vinyl floors, but doesn't work for the purpose I purchased it.
