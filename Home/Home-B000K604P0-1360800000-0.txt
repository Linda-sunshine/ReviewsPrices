review/summary: One Great THERMOreview/text: Was looking for a good thermo to replace my old cheap travel coffee mug because the damn thing gets cold in an hour and I have an 8 hour long shift.This little thing simply amazes me how it kept my hot tea still hot after 4 hours!I definitely recommend this to others. Decent size. Not so heavy (with liquid). Sturdy, easy to use top.Fits cup holders in the car, fits in my small work bag with out spilling.This little guy pretty much goes every where with me.If you're thinking about this, JUST GET IT!.
