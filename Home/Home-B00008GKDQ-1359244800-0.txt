review/summary: Okay, not greatreview/text: Very, very heavy, hard to lift. Difficult to clean. Everything sticks. Had to order special tools to clean this product. Cooks good especially for things like ke-bobs and burgers. Don't believe manuf. when they say &#34;already seasoned&#34; - reseason yourself FIRST.
