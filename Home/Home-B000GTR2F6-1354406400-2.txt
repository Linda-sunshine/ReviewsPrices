review/summary: Be Prepared to Keep Replacing ...review/text: Purchased initial unit in February of 2011 - it stopped working about 8 months later. Keurig did replace it, but what a hassle to actually get through to them and then wait and wait on the new machine. The new machine died after 10 months, I'm not going through trying to get it replaced again, just a waste of time and money.
