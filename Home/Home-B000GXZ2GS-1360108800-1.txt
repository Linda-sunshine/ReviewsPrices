review/summary: Simple but effectivereview/text: Great simple way to brew coffee. If you have hot water handy, this is a good way to get good coffee brewed. It uses a filter but quickly presses down on the brew, so the result is something halfway between a expertly dripped coffee and an espresso pull. Great for making espresso, lungo and americano.The cylinder pushes down and as it does it cleans the main brewing chamber so it's great for office use -- i use it throughout the day and wash it once at the end of the day.I only wish the plunger would be a bit longer so it extends more at the bottom so it's easier to clean, but otherwise great product.
