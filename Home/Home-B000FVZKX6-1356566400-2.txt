review/summary: Great quality, soft flannelreview/text: Two thumbs up for these sheets. The depicted color is accurate, and the sheets themselves are not too thick, and very soft. I use them as my only covering during fall and spring in Colorado. In the summer I switch to light cotton, and in the winter I use a comforter only. I could easily use these all year round and be fine, but already have the comforter and lighter cotton sheets, and I don't want them to feel neglected :)
