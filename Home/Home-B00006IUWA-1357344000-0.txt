review/summary: Great popper with toxic fumes still emitting a week after opening boxreview/text: OK, this is the &#34;best&#34; popper on the market, with a SERIOUS flaw. The box reeked of chemical/plastic solvents fumes upon opening. After washing the plastic top parts twice in hot soapy water they still smell like plastic solvents after heating. The body of the popper was aired out with 10 one minute uses to try to drive off the chemical fumes, but after a week it still reeks of solvents, smoldering plastic smell and chemical fumes, especially during and after use, with a lingering stink.This one is going back to the manufacturer directly if the fumes don't clear up in another week of airing out / venting. Sure wish I could trust it to pop me some unpolluted corn...More toxic products from our friends in China. Too bad the USA FDA is looking the other way - many small appliances share this problem as chemical vapor residue removal is not required for consumer protection prior to import.It would be better if Presto made them in the USA, Mexico or Canada.
