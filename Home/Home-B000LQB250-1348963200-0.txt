review/summary: really good purchase!review/text: i've had it for about a month now using it as a mattress not even a topper. the second i unrolled it it had a pepperminty smell that didnt go away for about a week or so. but it's faded away so it's not even bad at all. laying on it is amazing, i knocked out for like an hour before i came to and went back to doing my stuff but it's really comfortable, so comfortable it's bad because i dont wanna get out of it LOL.
