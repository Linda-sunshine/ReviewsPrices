review/summary: Just too easy!review/text: Yay, something I can drink from that I don't have to take apart and I can throw in my bag and not worry about leaking. Cleaning is super easy, and for some reason my milky coffee just doesn't seem to stick and stain like others I have tried. Only drawback is that the blue seal ring inside came loose (loss of one star) and I would have to watch for it in the sink, still I love it so much I bought another when I lost the first one.
