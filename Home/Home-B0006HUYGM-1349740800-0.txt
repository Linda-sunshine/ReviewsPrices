review/summary: GOOD FOR TODDLER'S MESS!!!review/text: Once I bought this I am able to keep my kid's feeding area clean after every meal easily. The bad thing about the vacuum is that the filter can't get wet and I vacuum everything and some fruits got the filter wet some how and a bad smell started coming out of it, hope I can fix this soon. Excellent to clean small areas!!!
