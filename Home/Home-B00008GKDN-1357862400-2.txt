review/summary: I love Lodge pans!review/text: They work flawlessly especially for crepes and Swedish pancakes. They hold heat well and once you get it to temp you don't have to continuously adjust the temp gauge. Nothing stuck, even on the first cook. Looks great and its easy to clean. slowly getting rid of teflon coated pans for all cast iron and iron pans.
