review/summary: WORKED ONE TIME - BAD PRODUCTreview/text: I got this item and upon receipt I tested it out and it seemed to work just fine. I did not use it again since I traveled all summer. I just returned after one month of travel and pulled it out to use on my clothes. The water was full and the machine started to heat up and then funny noises and sounds were made and the plastic tube was very hot but no steam ever came out of the head. I shut it down and tried again the next day and it did the same thing. I have only had this for two months and used it ONCE!! Stay away from this product. I now have to return it and because I am just past the return time I cannot return it.
