review/summary: Wonderful!review/text: Have had this little winner for 3 days and it is perfect for large, one cup of coffee in 2 minutes. I can blend a couple of different ground coffees for the taste I want. Quick, clean, small and takes little counter space. Do not use too much coffee or it will create a mess, measure first! Only possible drawback, the cord in not very long so it must be near the outlet, not an issue for me. Other than great fresh ground taste...biggest benefit there is no plastic container or packet to add to land fills!
