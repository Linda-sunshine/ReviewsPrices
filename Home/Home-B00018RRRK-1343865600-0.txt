review/summary: This grinder is fatally flawedreview/text: I bought this grinder a little over a year and a half ago, and right as the warranty was expiring it started to fail. It started with a weak grind and eventually burned out completely. I used it about 4 times a week for about 10 seconds each time. That's right, less than a minute per week and it burned out. If this were a $15 cheapy model no big deal, but I bought a model that is not supposed to be junk. Customer service cordially let me know about the 18 month warranty limit and indicated that in any case I would have to ship it, and send $7 dollars as well for them to return it. It was a moot point because I am out of warranty, but I think what is clear is that Cuisinart is making products that are poorly engineered. Very convenient for them!
