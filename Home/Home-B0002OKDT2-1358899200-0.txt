review/summary: great juicerreview/text: Replaced my old centrifuge style juicer with this one, and couldn't be happier. Easier to clean (my old one was a real chore to wash), does leafy vegetables too, and I am looking forward to making my own homemade nut butters. I find I am juicing almost every day now, and I feel like I have barely scratched the surface with what it is capable of. Definitely recommend this juicer.
