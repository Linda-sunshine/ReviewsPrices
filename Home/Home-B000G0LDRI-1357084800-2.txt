review/summary: great productreview/text: very well made, works well, dual water tanks makes for easy fill up and no need to shut the machine down. Filter is not the easiest to wash and clean, but besides being a humidifier, it also cleans the air which is a nice feature. So far, very reliable, and we are very pleased!
