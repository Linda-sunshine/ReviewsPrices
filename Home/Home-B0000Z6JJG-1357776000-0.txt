review/summary: Suuuuuuuuuuper loud.review/text: Well, it shreds cheese like it's supposed to so that's a plus.It's incredibly loud. And it can make a big mess since the cheese just kind of flys about. You'll have to stop and clear the tunnel if you're grating a lot otherwise it'll get mushed into a big ball of cheese. And, it wont grate all the cheese... you'll find a nice slice once you tear it all apart to clean... I don't mind that part as much because I just eat it. It's like it's rewarding me for using it to grate my cheese.
