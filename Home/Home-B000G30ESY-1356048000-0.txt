review/summary: Can a rice cooker be life changing?review/text: I debated buying this rice cooker for YEARS before I finally hit the order button. Now that I have had this rice maker for about 6 months all I can say it WOW.I use this thing at least once a day for steel cut oatmeal, and usually two or more times for rice, lentils, bulgur, and pretty much anything else under the sun. It is easy to clean, even when dried oatmeal sits for hours when I forget to wipe it down. The food in the warmer remains incredibly fresh tasting even after 4 hours or more. I once ate 24 hour old oatmeal out of this thing.. and although I can't confirm if it was safe it was still pretty good tasty.Rice comes out absolutely perfect every time, and it still amazes me just how perfect. The timer function, fuzzy logic cooking, and keep warm feature pretty much mean this thing stays in use many hours a day at my house and it never fails to impress. I am actually writing this review because I love it so much, that I am buying 3 for gifts this year. This has easily been one of the best purchases I have ever made. What more can I say?
