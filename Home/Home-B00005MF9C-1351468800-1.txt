review/summary: B&D coffee makerreview/text: I love this coffee maker, only thing I wish it were a little taller to fit the larger "to go" cups. I have been using this coffee for a number of years, it is probably my 4th or 5th one. and I always have an extra for when it decides to quit, which happens infrequently
