review/summary: Believe the Hypereview/text: First off - this arrived remarkably quickly. I don't know if we live near a warehouse or that's just normal for Prime. I opened the large box and found a crumpled box floating inside. Inner box had the slide tab to keep it closed and that and other damage on that carton made me cautious that this product might have had an out of the warehouse life before me. The side with the controls was smashed in. Didn't even have to plug it in. Amazon replied to my request for an exchange and must have mailed it out that day. The new one was packed the same but pristine. I must say that I've probably had more space heaters than I should, but this is just as advertised. I Googled the safety records and this has the best review for reasonably priced ceramic heaters. And its silent! Blissfully silent. The top gets very hot,cbut not the bottom where the simple but effective tipover switch is. The reviews are also correct in that it is not a whole room heater. So worth the price and with minimal hassle. Have had electronics return trouble in the past. So not this time. The review is not 5 today because we haven't really had a cold patch yet. Expected this evening. The cold snap that is.
