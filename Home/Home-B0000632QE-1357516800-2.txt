review/summary: Well-made product with great features--would buy againreview/text: I want to incorporate more veggies into my diet, but I hate prepping them, plus I cut them too big which makes them a chore to eat raw, such as in my salads. Hence, my desire for a mandoline. I'm scared of them, though, so I wanted something safe, but I can't afford the super expensive ones. So far, I'm thrilled with my purchase. First, the blades work great and give me four options: thick and thin slices, thick and thin juliennes. It slices most veggies very easily (except for sweet potatoes, but hey, I can hardly get a knife into them either).Second, the food safety holder is GREAT! Not only does it protect my fingers, but it has this button on top that I push down on as I'm getting to the end of the food item. It pushes the food closer to the blades, and I have very little to no waste of the veggies.Third, the design of the holder is brilliant! It is more than I expected, and it's why I gave this item 5 stars and came online to write to this review. The cool thing is that after washing, you can STORE the mandoline in the holder to dry. What a GREAT idea! I have two young children, and this holder keeps all the blades safely away from them, even while drying. The holder is very slim and takes up very little room, so I can store it upright with my pots and pans in the cabinet. It even has a safety holder for the main blade.I've sliced up carrots, cukes, bell peppers, and leeks and now I have them all prepped and ready to use in my cooking this week.I bought special gloves to protect my hands because of my fear of using mandolines, but I don't need them with this handy gadget. The most dangerous part of using this device is washing it.
