review/summary: Poor qualityreview/text: Bought this product less than a year ago and used it for a few months during winter at which time it worked without any problems. Recently, it stopped working for no reason. The motor inside started making funny noises and no vapor comes out. We stopped using it to prevent a fire hazard. It is a cute product but quality is very poor. Will try to contact with the manufacturer to see if we can have it replaced or get a refund (which I doubt!!!)
