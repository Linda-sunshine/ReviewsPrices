review/summary: Heavy and short livedreview/text: This machine is overrated. It is heavy for a handheld and incnvenient with the cord, and suction power was never impressive. After less than two years of light use it virtually died. My B&D cordless handheld is not fabulous but it is better. I will not be getting another one of these.
