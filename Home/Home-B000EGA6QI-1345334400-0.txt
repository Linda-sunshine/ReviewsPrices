review/summary: Use for cold process soapmakingreview/text: I love this stick blender for cold process soapmaking. Virtually no air bubbles with proper burping, very smooth and quick trace, easy to clean. However, I am now on my second one, due to the first becoming a tad loose around the plastic threading (where the two pieces attach). I wasn't too upset about purchasing another, as I was very pleased with this SB in every other regard, and I probably did use the first a bit more than is normal for everyday cooking needs. Hopefully this will not happen with the second.
