review/summary: Great little vacuumreview/text: This vacuum is amazing. I bought it because the cordless hand vacs I kept buying would die within a year and could not handle the amount of pet hair I needed them to suck up. The only issues I have are that the exhaust will tend to blow debris around on my hardwood floors, and the cord is a little too bulky to stay wrapped around the cord holder on the back. Otherwise a great purchase and I highly recommend it.
