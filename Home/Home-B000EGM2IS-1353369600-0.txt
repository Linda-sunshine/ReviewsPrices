review/summary: 4 years and still heatin'review/text: I've had my unit for 4 years now and it still works great. I use it primarily for tea at work. I have no complaints and would buy anther if it failed. For the price, it owes me nothing more after 4 years of faithful water hanging service. I recommend for anyone looking for quick tea-making in an office ( or hot chocolate).
