review/summary: Excellent Productreview/text: I was looking for a coffee maker that would make 1-2 cups of coffee. I read many good - great reviews for this product at various internet sites.This product is fantastic. It makes an excellent, consistent cup of coffee every time. The key is to FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS that come with the Aerobie !It is obvious to me that a lot of R&D; not only into the design of the device, but time and effort were spent on how best to use it.I think the people who don't like the device are using it incorrectly by either using too hot a temperature, pouring water too quickly, etc.- heat water to 175 degrees. I microwave water in a pyrex glass cup and used a meat thermometer to figure out the proper time.- use a fine ground- pour water in SLOWLY at first: this is very important and something I learned early on.You need to wet the grounds in order to keep the water from dripping too early- stir for 10 seconds- use gentle pressure and plunge ! Quite often I need to press hard or release pressure to get it to work on it's ownTwo major advantages of the coffee:1) It is definitely less bitter without losing taste2) You can drink it almost immediately; no waiting for the coffee too cool down since you are starting at 175.I have had several friends try the coffee I make and they love it.For $ 25, you can't buy anything near it's price and make better coffee.
