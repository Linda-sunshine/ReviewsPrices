review/summary: paying attention to reviewsreview/text: I put a lot of research into purchasing a humidfier through consumer reports. What I discovered is there is not a ultrasonic humidifier on the market that has over 50% of very good actual consumer reviews. This crane product had the best overall reviews I could find. After just a few days in began dripping water out of the bottom of the unit, which was one of the common problems in the reviews. My advice to anyone looking for a humidifier: If you have a forced air heating system invest in a april air unit attached to the furnace. Trouble is I now have a boiler system.
