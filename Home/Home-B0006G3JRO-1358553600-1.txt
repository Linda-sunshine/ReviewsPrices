review/summary: Great Kitchen Asstreview/text: Cuisinart CSB-77 Smart Stick Hand Blender with Whisk and Chopper AttachmentsThis is a great addition to my kitchen. The parts attach and remove easy. Very easy clean (thank you!). Just be careful when using bowls or pans w/ low sides... keep the blade low in the bowl or pan.. One morning i used a small mixing bowl and ended up dressed in pancake batter... But it was very smooth pancake batter....
