review/summary: Still loving it 1-year laterreview/text: I've owned this model 1-year and ready to give my 2 cents. LOVE IT and BUY IT! There are two flaws but here's how you work though it:1. It's true, the water level marker inside the tank is useless. It's really not a big deal to simply fill the carafe yourself and pour it in. I don't understand why reviewers are bothered by this. Primadonnas I guess.2. To avoid water dripping onto the coffee grounds when pre-loading for the next morning, just leave the carafe lid off when pouring water into the tank. This avoids the SLIGHT collision between the tank lid and carafe lid. Again, not a big deal since the lid is already off for filling.I purchased the all black model and glad I did. It still looks like it came out of the box. I will certainly re-purchase this product when the time comes, and I'm a pretty tough reviewer.
