review/summary: Stopped working after second brewing!!!review/text: After doing much research and reading countless reviews, I settled on the Zojirushi EC-BD15. In the past, I've had Krups, Cuisinart, etc., all of which had the warming plate feature. So I decided to forgo that idea and give the thermal carafe a try, sans warming plate. I am a daily coffee drinker and a self-proclaimed coffee snob so I thought maybe the warming plate was indeed impeding the taste of my coffee. I'm not sure that was the case. The first pot brewed using the Zojirushi was good, but not "bowl me over" good. Nevertheless, I was looking forward to a long love affair (well, maybe just "like" affair)with the Zojirushi. All hopes were dashed when brewing the second pot and the machine just stopped brewing mid-cycle. Stopped. After the second attempt at brewing. I only had the machine two days!By the way, I was willing to live with the ill-fitting filters although they required either folding over or cutting to size. I was also willing to live with the carafe cap that needed to be removed before brewing and tended to get in the way of my minimal cupboard space. I would have overlooked the little quirks had the Zojirushi lived up to expectations. Since it didn't, the quirks just became salt in a wound.While I normally am not a negative person and generally hesitate to write negative reviews, this seemed necessary. (On a brighter note, Amazon was fabulous with the return process and promptly refunded my money including shipping!)
