review/summary: Great Power and dependability at an affordable pricereview/text: I've had this vacuum for several months now, and use it on a fairly regular basis for situations that the standard upright vacuum can't handle. Unlike other handheld vacuums, this one has a cord. At first I thought this would be a bad thing, but the difference in power is immediately noticeable because it doesn't have to rely on a battery. I have 2 cats, and this vacuum takes care of everything they can throw at it, from cat hair, to kitty litter.The filter is a bit difficult to clean because you aren't supposed to use water on it, but this hasn't seemed to impact overall performance of the vacuum. I would buy this vacuum again, it's a great value for the price.
