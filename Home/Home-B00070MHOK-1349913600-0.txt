review/summary: Nice little steamer!review/text: I need a steamer for sewing with fabrics that can't be flat-ironed, such as velvet. This little steamer does what I need it to do. It allows me to remove wrinkles without flattening the pile.It would be nice to have some control over the rate of steam. However, for an inexpensive steamer, one "speed" is fine. I learned to avoid holding the steamer too close to the fabric, or too long in one place. These errors tend to saturate the fabric with water. With some practice and patience, I was able to get good results on velvet and silk charmeuse.The steamer is also useful for pulling wrinkles out of my business clothes. It's helpful to have an alternative to ironing that doesn't cause shiny spots on the shoulders and seams.
