review/summary: VAC YOU!review/text: This little guy rocks. Tons of suck, easy to clean, lightweight and portable. The tools are pretty simplistic, but then again, that's the point of this rig. I have a Hoover that has more amps and weighs a lot more than the Dirt Devil, but it can't hold a candle to its cleaning power.
