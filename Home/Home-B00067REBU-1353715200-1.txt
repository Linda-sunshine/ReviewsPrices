review/summary: Very good productreview/text: This Breadmaker was purchased to replace an old one which had simply worn out over several years of use. My wife has found it to be easy to use and very efficient in baking bread. Although it took several attempts to get use to the new model, because the instructions were different from the old maker, once she became used to the new one it was as easy or easier to use than the previous model. While we could not say it is an improvement over the other brand name it most certainly is as good and easy to use. One good feature is that it bakes the bread much quicker than the previous breadmaker. It runs very quietly, much quieter than the other unit,and you hardly know it is working.The cost of this new unit was very reasonable for the work it does and we consider it a good purchase.While not having it long enough to attest to the Sunbeam's longivity, so far it is operating as advertised and we are very pleased with the product.
