review/summary: Good machine !review/text: We love this machine. After reviewing we bought one almost 2 years ago and it's still working: Good espresso's and foam milk even with nonfat. There are better machines out there, but we consider this to be a great value (price / performance). IT IS VERY IMPORTANT (ESSENTIAL) TO KEEP IT CLEAN, all espresso machines need a constant cleaning.
