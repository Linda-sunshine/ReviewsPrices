review/summary: Well worth itreview/text: I purchased this chair to use while playing computer games and Xbox. Some days I will play for over four hours or more. I have never had a sweaty back or butt from this chair. Everything is adjustable and is made sturdy. Very easy to put together with included tools. It looks great too.
