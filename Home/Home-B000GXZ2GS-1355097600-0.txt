review/summary: Flavorfulreview/text: Though I still prefer the stronger flavor and better mouthfeel of French Press coffee, this device works as advertised. I have not noticed any dulling or cloudiness to the plastic like I've seen mentioned in some reviews. Handwash only.Grind your beans the night before (you really do need a burr mill grinder for consistent grind) and toss some water in the microwave, and this only takes slightly more effort in the morning than a automatic drip machine. After you press the water through directly into your cup, you're left with a near solid puck of compressed grounds. Just pop it into the trash and rinse the plunger and cylinder in the sink, and away you go.
