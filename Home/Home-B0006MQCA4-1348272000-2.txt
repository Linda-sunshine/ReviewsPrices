review/summary: Worth every penny!!!review/text: I purchased this product two months ago and I am completely satisfied with its performance. It makes my city water taste purely delightful. Very easy to use and takes up minimal space in my fridge. It has also improved the taste of anything I cook with the water and also coffee. The filter is still working good after two months as it states 3 months is usually standard filter life.
