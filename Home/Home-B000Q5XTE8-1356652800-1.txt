review/summary: Top Pickreview/text: Awesome purchase. Very satisfied with the comfort and adjustability. The arms and the seat height and depth are manually adjustable. The seat tilts from fully upright to several angles of recline. The front of the seat slopes down and flexes, so there is no pressure on the the thighs. Provides hours upon hours of comfort.
