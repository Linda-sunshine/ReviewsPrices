review/summary: Pizza Comes out great every time!review/text: I purchased this as a gift to myself and to save energy when cooking our weekly pizza. Instead of heating up the oven for one pizza I've used this more than a dozen times since receiving it and its a GREAT product. I usually cook a frozen pizza adding my extras such as pan fried onions, garlic, mushrooms, peppers or anything else we're in the mood for.Its a great product and cooks evenly.The only thing I wish was that the top unit swung to the side so I could place the tray on the peg and then swing the top unit back in place. Instead you have to feel around with your finger until you feel the peg and then lower the tray onto the unit. Doing this can be difficult when you have a pizza LOADED with topping since while trying to find the peg the topping at times touches the upper unit. Other than that I love it and that one issue is not enough for me to ever NOT buy another one or recommend this product.
