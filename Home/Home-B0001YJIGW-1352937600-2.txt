review/summary: Just what I needed!!!review/text: I live in the basement apartment of an old house and the overflow drain is in the middle of the tub. It didn't even cover my legs sitting in the bath! This was exactly what I needed and I'm so happy I found it! It works great! It adds easily 3-4 inches for me since my drain is so low and pretty large. I have had zero problems with the suction. Just get the surface and the suctions wet and they stay on without any issues. I absolutely love my bath time and now I can enjoy long, deep baths again! Highly recommended!!!
