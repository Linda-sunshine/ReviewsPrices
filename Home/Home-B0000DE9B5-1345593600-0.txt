review/summary: Refrigerator jugreview/text: I purchased this to replace an old sun tea jar that broke. It is a lot smaller than I expected, but is well made and stores in the frig well because of the shape. I had no trouble with the locking top,; it has a good seal. The handle is a bit close to the jar, and a bit short but it's fine. I wish it came in a larger one as well.
