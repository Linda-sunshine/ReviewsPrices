review/summary: Electrocutes You, Hard to Clean, but Cheapreview/text: Right, so this thing is pretty meh.Good: cheap, grinds things moderately well.Bad: It electrocutes you frequently, rusts easily, and has no good way of cleaning it.I use it to grind coffee and salt crystals. The salt crystals easily cause rust so it needs to be cleaned. If it's not cleaned it clogs and won't rotate-grind. Even without water near it, it electrocutes you.This thing still grinds but with the hassle of getting shocks (always having to unplug it) and that there's no good way of cleaning it, it's fairly rubbish. Only good thing was that it was incredibly inexpensive.
