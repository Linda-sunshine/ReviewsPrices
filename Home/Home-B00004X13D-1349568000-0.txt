review/summary: Yum!review/text: I asked my wife why she never makes me waffles and she replied that her waffle iron was horrible and she hated it. So, I bought her this one after seeing the stellar reviews. She loves it. I love it. I get waffles for breakfast. Everybody wins!They're nice and fluffy and look very impressive on a plate. The unit is also pretty easy to clean (and use)!
