review/summary: DO NOT BUYreview/text: I have purchased several Keurig systems through the years. After only a short while the system starts producing a half a cup of coffee. If you call customer service they will instruct you to do several things to try to correct the issue. Never happens. They have sent me two replacement units and to no avail within a few months...same thing. I currently own two systems and intend on disposing of both and buying another brand! I do believe Keurig has some issues that they are not telling!
