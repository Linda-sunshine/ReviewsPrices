review/summary: Good Product...Not Greatreview/text: I bought this product in mid June 2012. I use this water bottle all day each day, refilling at lest 3-4 times. I have been using for over 6 months. The lid works great. I has withstood several drops, so don't let the plastic top worry you. It keeps water cool for several hours out of the tap. If there is ice in the bottle, it will keep something cold for over 12 hours easily.I do have two complaints. The first is the o-ring inside the screw on portion of the top. It has split and if it pops loose when refilling, water will leak. I did not have this problem until after 6 months of use. I have searched for a replacement o-ring but have been unable to find one. The second complaint is minor. The outer grip can slid up or down at times and needs to be re-positioned. This is just a minor annoyance.All in all, I would recommend this product. If a replacement o-ring was available at a low price, I would consider this a 5 star item.
