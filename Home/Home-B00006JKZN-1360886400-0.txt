review/summary: Fast Wafflesreview/text: I have been using this for a couple of months now and it replaced an earlier unit that I have had for 20 or so years. I specifically wanted a classic maker and not the Belgian type. I use a wheat-free, gluten-free mix and add frozen blueberries. The first time, I didn't spray the unit with vegetable oil as the instructions didn't indicate using that - it stuck badly and I had to spend quite a bit of time carefully cleaning the unit and ended up loosing most of that waffle. The next time, I sprayed it and it worked very well on a setting of 4. The unit cooks waffles very quickly compared to my old unit - so much so, that I don't leave the kitchen and keep an eye out for the green light telling me it is done. Complaints: the slider control moves too easily, so is easy to bump and may thus not be in the same position when I go to use it again (minor); also, the cord storage involves wrapping the cord and &#34;plugging&#34; one prong to the top and one to the bottom (this holds the unit closed) is a bit &#34;hokey&#34;, but does work. Overall, I am very pleased with the unit!
