review/summary: Happy Sleep!review/text: I read what others said here--the good, the bad, and the ugly--and ordered these sheets. I washed them first, using a 'soak wash' setting. They're comfortable and a great fit (king size actually fits our deep, king size bed). YAY! And I LOVE this chestnut color. They aren't as soft as my old sheets yet, but they'll get there. Did you know that poly/blend sheets are warmer than cotten? In the summer, that is miserable. These are nice and cool. Happy sleep!
