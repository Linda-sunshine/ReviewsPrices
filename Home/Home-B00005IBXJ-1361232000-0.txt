review/summary: For cooking.review/text: These things are awesome! They cook a perfect pizza and the best part is they don't put out the heat an oven does so you don't heat your whole house up using the oven! You can also cook other things on them. We have used ours to cook garlic bread, fish sticks, & cheese toast.
