review/summary: Conair SU7 Clockreview/text: I will never buy this clock again. I like it the day I got it. On the third day my son pushed one of the sound buttons and I couldn't get it to turn off or change to another sounds. I unplugged it and when plugging it back in I hit the radio button and the same thing happened. Tried to use it for a week and ended up buying a different clock when the alarm didn't go off two morning in a row and I was late.
