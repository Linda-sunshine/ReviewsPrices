review/summary: great value!review/text: I've being juicing for a long time. more then 15 years. I tried about 5-6 different kinds. the most expansive was in the range of $400. when the motor on it blew up I saw this on at Costco for $69 and I told my wife: what the heck, lets try it.if you looking to juice on a budget, this one is great.it get a lot of juice and the pulp is very dry. I'll say almost like a top of the line one. and that's why I like it and will keep it.I don't care what kind of juicer you have, they all hard to clean! and all the same.this one is very loud and sometimes spins out of control but for the price, you cant go wrong.pros: price, efficiency, massive build.cons: loud, no speed control, big and bulky.
