review/summary: Love it.review/text: I love my new KitchenAid Artisan. I find that it does any task faster and better than I could do with my old, handheld mixer. The power of the machine is more than adequate for the batch sizes I work with in my home cooking. It is heavy, so it has a permanent home on my counter top, which is fine since I use it a lot. Besides, it is so pretty!
