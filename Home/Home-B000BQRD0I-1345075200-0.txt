review/summary: it does the work, but design could be better.review/text: PROit does what it should do.CONCannot hang heavy stuff on the steamer, otherwise it may flip over.it is not easy to keep it in the storage room because of the pipe.the head brush cannot attach firmly. Always fall off during steaming.Additional Note:My water tank cup is lost during a recent house move. I contacted the manufacture and they send me a replacement part for free. Great service!
