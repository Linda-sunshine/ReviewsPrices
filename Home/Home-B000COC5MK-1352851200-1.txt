review/summary: WINE BOTTLE OPENERreview/text: This is a great item. It attracts attention every time I use it with company. Thats fairly often. Mine was given to me as a gift about 3 years ago. A friend of mine saw me use it and loved the idea of it so I gave her one recently for her birthday. It made her very happy. Really, we're not &#34;winos&#34; but we appreciate a nice glass of Pinot Noir or Sauvignon Blanc and the wine opener makes it easier to enjoy (quicker) Just remember to remove the last cork before opening a new bottle. Even works on the new corks. Cheers!!
