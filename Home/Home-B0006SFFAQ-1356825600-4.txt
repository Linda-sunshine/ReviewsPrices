review/summary: Best drip coffee I've made at homereview/text: If you want actually good drip coffee, but don't quite have the $200 to buy a Bonavita, BUY THIS!I'm not kidding you, this machine makes the best cup of drip coffee I've ever made at home -- from store brand, run-of-the-mill grounds, no less. When I want the best cup of coffee I can personally make, I use my burr grinder and french press. But I am VERY IMPRESSED with the quality of brew I got from this drip machine. My store brand ground arabica canned coffee came out flavorful with actual body and mouth feel to it (using their recommended ratio of 1 T grounds:1 "cup" water).Worth the money if you want to upgrade from a $25 machine. Carafe holds 50 ounces, and is better constructed than the Mr. Coffee and Kitchen Aid glass carafes I've had.I regret nothing about this purchase!
