review/summary: Single serve Coffeemakerreview/text: I used this product for 4 to 5 cups. The water did not dispense completely. When I turned the unit upside down to empty the reservoir and add new water, a piece fell out. I tried to put it back where I thought it went and was not successful in doing so. When I opened the reservoir cover to clean the showerhead and snapped it back into place a little piece of the plastic clip broke off. So now the showerhead does not clip back into place on the cover. I am not at all satisfied with this coffeemaker. I should have put the $15 towards a better coffeemaker. I bought this online at Amazon Dec. 17, 2012. Since I do not have the original packaging would I still be able to return it to Amazon?
