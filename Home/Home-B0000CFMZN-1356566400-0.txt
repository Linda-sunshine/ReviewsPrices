review/summary: Nice quality, a tradition in kitchens for yearsreview/text: Pyrex has been around for ages making these glass measuring cups. The lettering doesn't wear off as easily as some of the cheaper alternatives out there so I stick with this brand. My mother still has her Pyrex from 40 years ago and the lettering is still there.
