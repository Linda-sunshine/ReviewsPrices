review/summary: Great Dealreview/text: I bought this grinder to replace my old Cuisinart Burr Mill. But, only after having bought a Nesco that worked horribly! I thought I would try a cheaper one, and that's exactly what I got, so back to Amazon to buy a very reliable Cuisinart coffee grinder. I'll never switch again!
