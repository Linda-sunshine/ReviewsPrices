review/summary: Great product, awesome color!review/text: I love this immersion blender and I wanted to get one for my sister. I ordered the turquoise color and I have to say it's much more vivid in person. It has a very cool retro look to it. My sister loved it and has already used it many times with great pleasure. I've had mind for over a year now and I use it quite a bit, never having any issues with it.
