review/summary: I'm not an espresso expertreview/text: I bought this to keep my coffee budget at a reasonable level. I was going to Starbuck's 4-5 times a week and it adds up. I LOVE being able to make my own lattes now. This machine is really easy to operate and easy to clean up. I use the 49mm Espresso Tamper Stainless Steel, a 10 oz frothing pitcher, and Lavazza inBlu espresso grounds. The steaming wand is very close to the counter top but we keep ours on a stand which allows me to keep the espresso machine close to the edge and allows for more room to steam. I could see this being a challenge if you did not have a short enough frothing pitcher (the Stainless Steel 10oz. Steaming & Frothing Pitcher sold on Amazon works great).
