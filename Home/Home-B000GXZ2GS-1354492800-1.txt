review/summary: Good product that deliversreview/text: Just like several reviewers here, I always try to extract the most flavor out of freshly roasted coffee beans. I like the fact that this tool produces very smooth and bold coffee. There is no bitterness nor acidity that is associated with a typical French press brew. It is nice that it is so portable and durable, so good coffee can always be brewed almost anywhere. This equipment is definitely a keeper.
