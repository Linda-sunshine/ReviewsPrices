review/summary: Where has this been all my life?review/text: This little modern helper chops right through everything I've thrown at it, so far, with a smoosh, smoosh so fast and smooth it's hard to believe I never thought about buying one. Our oldest son gave me a large one for Christmas one year, but it's way too large to chop up his dad's individual servings and do the clean up so I've been using a pastry blender to do the job by hand. Another son and his wife observed this attempt to chop up some Thanksgiving turkey at their house and introduced me to their mini-processor. After we got home I immediately ordered this one from Amazon. It's larger, but I chop up more at one time and freeze separate portions to reheat. It was shipped fast and came in about two or three days.
