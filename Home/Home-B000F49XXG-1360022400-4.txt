review/summary: Junkreview/text: I was excited to get my new De'Longhi Espresso machine as the pump on the DeLonghi we had been using finally went out after several years of solid use. I chose the De'Longhi EC155 as in appearance it was the closest to our older discontinued model. It had been rated 4 stars and I thought it would be fine. I wish I had read the 1 & 2 star reviews and not just looked at how many stars.When I first opened the box I was shocked to find water inside the bag that the espresso maker was in. I should have sent it back then but I decided to try it out anyway. I started out by going through the manual and cleaning it (making espresso drinks with no coffee as the manual puts it).Lots of steam poured out from somewhere near the filter basket. There was enough steam to obscure most of the front of the unit from my sight. The steam was not coming from the steaming wand.The Espresso never got any crema on any of the shots I pulled. Finally I looked at all the reviews (on other sites too) of the product and found people saying that if you followed some convoluted procedures that you could get some crema on your shots. I was never able to duplicate their apparent results so back in the box it went.
