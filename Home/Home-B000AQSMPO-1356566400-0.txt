review/summary: Does not make strong coffee.review/text: I bought it for the office at work. The coffee is expensive. The quality of the coffee is not as good as my Cuisinart grind and brew at home. The waste is incredible. The plastic that goes to the land fill makes me feel guilty. I will sell this one in a yard sale. Not worth the $175.00 I paid for it.
