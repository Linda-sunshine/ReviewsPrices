review/summary: Simple Solution and Great Valuereview/text: If you're someone like me who just wants to store their ties safely and not spend a ton of money doing it, this product is perfect. It's nothing fancy, just hangs up in your closet. It doesn't take up much space, and you can store a lot of ties on it. Plus, while it saves space, it doesn't make sifting through your ties difficult. I have barely noticed it's there since I bought it, which is exactly how I want it to be.
