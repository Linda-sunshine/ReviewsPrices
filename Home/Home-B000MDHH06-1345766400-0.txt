review/summary: Best appliance buyreview/text: I've been juicing every other day for quite some time now. This was a great buy. My only complaint is the waste goes into the ring around the blade so I have to stop to clean it every so often. Not a huge hassle but it does make up for it with the compact size. It is not a huge monstrosity on my counter, small enough to tuck away when not in use which I quite like. The motor works well and pulp comes out quite dry. I love it, one of my favorite kitchen appliances!
