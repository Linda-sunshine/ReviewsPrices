review/summary: No complaints from mereview/text: After reading other reviews on this product I was a little hesitant to buy it. One of the main complaints seemed to be that the hot kernels got blown out of the popper. I use a large bowl to catch the corn and place it on something to lift it up so that it rest right under the opening of the popper. A few kernels get blown out before the popping starts, but the bowl catches them. After the popping starts, the popped corn blocks the kernels. The end product is a nice big bowl of popped corn!! ready for a little seasoning and eating.
