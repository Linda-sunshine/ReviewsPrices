review/summary: Really easy to use, very efficient and its good for you!!review/text: Let me preface by saying, I am new to the whole juicing thing and was worried that I would not keep up with it once I started,,(like so many other things)...but not the case...This Breville Juice machine makes everything so easy, so ...whats not to love!!! Set up was under a minute.....veggies and fruits all go in super easy and juice comes out flavorful and abundant. I am doing this because, a:) I really do not like eating veggies and b:) do not get enough fruit in my daily diet......Well, wala!!! This has saved the day....I love it so much, I even talked my 34 year old daughter into buying one also, and she is loving it now!!! Clean up is a breeze, (under 5 minutes which includes cleaning the wire mesh strainer which takes 4.5 of those minutes)...very very easy!! I have had it over 2 weeks now and going strong...I make a drink every morning for breakfast which includes at least 3-4 fruits and 1-2 veggies.....cannot be happier with this purchase.
