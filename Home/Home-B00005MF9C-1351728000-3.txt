review/summary: Piece of Garbagereview/text: I bought this one cup coffee maker for my office. I can tell you it's garbage. The coffee grinds are forced into the coffee by the pressure of the water. Every single cup I have made I had to throw out. It has a built in fulter which is worthless so I thought I would cut down a regular coffee filter to swee if that helped and it did not. I tried another cup with a paper filter over the cup that sits under and it caught a lot of grinds but still awful. Wish I could return it and get my money back but I waited too long.
