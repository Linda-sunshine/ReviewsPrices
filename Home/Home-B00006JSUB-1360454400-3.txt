review/summary: Great American Productreview/text: This is a great American made product. If you already have used or own cast iron cookware then you need no advise. If you have never used this type of cookware then go to the Lodge website. They have vidoes on how to use and maintain the cookware. I would recommend buying the lid when you buy a pan. I didn't and within 2 weeks had to order a lid, many recipes I found called for one. Most recipies call for a 10 or 12 inch size pan so the ingredients should be slightly increased or the cooking time adjusted for the extra area the recipe will spread over.
