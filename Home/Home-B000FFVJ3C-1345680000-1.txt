review/summary: Fast Failurereview/text: While this dehydrator worked well for about 5 batches of jerky, the heating element failed within 7 weeks. The fan still works, but no heat. Unfortunately, I am outside of Amazon's return window by a couple of weeks, so I'm stuck with a bulky plastic downblowing fan. I also made the mistake of purchasing several extra trays. A $75 dollar lesson learned.
