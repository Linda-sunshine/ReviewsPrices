review/summary: I love this thingreview/text: I bought this back in March and have not regretted a single moment. I have made all sorts of jerky and various other things. This was my first dehydrator and it love still to this day it has not let me down. Nesco has a fine product right here and I certainly recommend it if you are in the market for a cheaper dehydrator that works well and will last.
