review/summary: Love itreview/text: Makes a huge increase in the shelflife of anything i've use it for. Nuts, crackers, goldfish crackers, gummy worms ect. I,ve kept some of these things for more than 6 months in a sealed jar with no loss of freshness. Gets a good seal every time. I also purchase the regular mouth sealer at the same time. Dont waste your money on the regular mouth sealer. Doesn't seal at all.
