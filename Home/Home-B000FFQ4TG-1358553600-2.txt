review/summary: Disappointingreview/text: I am a long time user of Bunn products. I decided to buy this unit last year and am so disappointed. It is slower in brewing than any other Bunn makers I have had. The carafe does not clip into the glass. So if you pour it too fast, even with your thumb on the "spot" they have on it, it dumps all over the place. I burned myself a couple of times while I was in a hurry to get to work. It also produces mold in top water chamber area. When you slide the lid to the side to pour in the water, we smell mold. And yes, I clean it and dump the grounds. This is definitely a high maintenance product. I have never had these problems with any of the other models I had. I will be more careful on the next one. I think Bunn still makes the best pot of coffee but I will never buy this model again.
