review/summary: Very Heavy and Quality Productreview/text: I've never owned an Iron Skillet before and I'm really glad I purchased this one. It's heavy and high quality at a great price. It does take a little while to get to the temperature required for cooking but that is a characteristic of all iron skillets so it can't be penalized for that. You do have to oil the pan before you use it to avoid food sticking to it and I think that is to be expected. There might be a better way to use it that doesn't require oil, but I'm a novice cook at best so I just do what works. Looking forward to cooking potatoes and other items in this!
