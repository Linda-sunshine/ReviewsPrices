review/summary: Does the jobreview/text: This handheld vac is GREAT at picking up cat hair, which is the main reason I purchased it. I realized the trick is to go slooowly over an area. You can't be in a hurry; it'll actually save you time in the end. Linger on a spot for a few seconds and allow time for the &#34;beater bar&#34; to do its job before moving on. I tried going quickly back and forth on my carpet and it just wasn't picking up as much hair as I wanted it to. Found that slower is better on my second use. :)I also found this vac is fantastic at vacuuming curtains. Again, the trick is to move slowly.
