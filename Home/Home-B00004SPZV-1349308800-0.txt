review/summary: Idea is good even if no longer so newreview/text: The object is badly and cheaply realized. I already shared an image where is possible to see the internal plastic part of the cap that came-off at the second pumps.Another problem is that part of the oil is 'sprayed too thin', more then spray it you atomize it, so that the atomized part is too 'light' and 'stay in the air' instead pf your food, and eventually fall off the dish and you can even breathe it!I had one I bought in Italy that was half the price of that one but worked well for 2 years, so no excuses, that works wrongly because it is cheap, cheaply done not cheap in price.
