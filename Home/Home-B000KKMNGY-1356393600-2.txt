review/summary: Works well for mereview/text: I got this to help me organize my tiny pantry. It has been great. I have to plan my boxes around the arms that extend on the shelf above, but that is ok. Plus, my shelves are so short that I have a hard time getting things in and out of the shelf under the basket. I just put short stuff under there that I don't need very often. Even so, it has been helpful for me.
