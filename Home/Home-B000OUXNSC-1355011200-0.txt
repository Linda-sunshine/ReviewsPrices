review/summary: Awesome mattress pad! Great quality!review/text: I have had my son's new twin mattress pad for about a week now. (Newpoint Home Deluxe 250 Thread Count)The first thing I did was wash and dry it. I washed it in delicates (I have heard some machines can &#34;eat&#34; the stretchy part of a mattress pad), and had no issues. Next, I washed it on low-heat and checked on it every 10 minutes until it was dry. I don't know about this mattress pad, but most will melt in the dryer. Just avoid &#34;cooking&#34; it in the drier if you can.The mattress pad came out soft and fluffy and was easy to put on. It might be a tad short at the end of my son's bed (standard twin) BUT my husband usually puts the bedding on since he can reach everything better. So I bet he can get it on there a little better than I can. The mattress pad fits very well over the mattress. It has a nice, tight fit and is super soft. It is thicker than I thought it would be. The quality is great.Plus, there was NO weird chemical/factory smell when I opened the packaging. (that happens so often these days)It was packaged well, and shipped fast.And you can't beat this price for this quality.I'll try to come back and add more, once I have laundered the mattress pad a few times.
