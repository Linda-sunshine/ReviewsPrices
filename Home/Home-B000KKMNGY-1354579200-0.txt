review/summary: Great if you have the shelf spacereview/text: I had high expectations for this rack. If my shelves were long (deep?) enough, they would've been great. It didn't fit in my cabinet so I had to return. You also have to make sure that whatever you're storing below the rack is short enough to not interfere with the shelf and the boxes.
