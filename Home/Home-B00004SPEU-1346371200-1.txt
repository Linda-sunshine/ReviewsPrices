review/summary: Excellent Productreview/text: I finally upgraded my coffee grinder after I lost my Compresso with its own grinder. Things work in wondrous ways. I got out a favorite old percolator to regain the flavor of perked coffee. However it needed to have a new grinder too. After doing a lot of research, I chose the Krups. What a great little machine. I love it. I now do a machine full of beans & they last for two days. It's well made, does the job perfectly and runs smoothly and quietly. I am more than satisfied with this grinder.
