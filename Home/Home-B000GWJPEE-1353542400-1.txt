review/summary: Efficient and Cutereview/text: Just the right size water receptacle: one-gallon capacity. The description '2.1 Gallon' refers to the OUTPUT, not the CAPACITY!I almost did not purchase this humidifier because of the misleading description. I wanted a receptacle no larger than one-gallon because of filled weight. Fortunately, the Crane website clarified the issue and I ordered it from Amazon.com.
