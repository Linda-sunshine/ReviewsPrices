review/summary: Great taste, convenience and an economical bonanzareview/text: Bought this as a gift for one of the kids because we love the one we have had for several weeks. Makes rich, great tasting coffee at a much friendlier price that the Keurigs or Nespressos. It is also much easier to clean than our French Press so it will probably earn a place in our small camper on the next trip.
