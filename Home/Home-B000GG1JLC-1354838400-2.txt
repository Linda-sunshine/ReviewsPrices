review/summary: Okayreview/text: I bought this for a belt & tie holder. it works fine and does its purpose, but when I overload it with belts it breaks. (the snap piece between the spinny part and the hook come apart. it can be placed back together but it seems that it keeps falling off more and more often. FOR TIES ONLY - GOOD.
