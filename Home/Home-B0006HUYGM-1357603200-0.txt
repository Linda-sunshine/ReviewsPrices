review/summary: Great little vacuum!review/text: I have had three hand held vacuums over the past 8 years in an, until now, vain effort to keep my carpeted stairs clean with three pets and two kids. This is a dream, quiet, light, brushes work great, the hose is simple and it just works wonderfully. Would recommend it to anyone.
