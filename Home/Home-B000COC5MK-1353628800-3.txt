review/summary: So far so goodreview/text: I give this product five stars because the concept is great....I title this review "so far so good" as this is my seond purchase of this product as the first one would not hold a charge after the first year of use. There were no restrictions in the manual as to charging so I kept it on the charger and the charger plugged in. It did not use it a lot either. Whether those two things contributed to the early demise I don't know. I may never know as I fully charged this new one and then pulled the plug and will recharge as needed risking a dead battery when I need to open a bottle for guests. So be it. I hope this one will not suffer an early death.
