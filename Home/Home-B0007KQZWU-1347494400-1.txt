review/summary: AMAZING COOKWARE!!!review/text: These pans/pot are BY FAR better than non-stick. Non-stick does have its place for certain things (like eggs over easy) but these pans are so much more versital! For those who complain that food sticks too much I suggest you take some basic cooking lessons or perhaps find the info online. You can sear amazingly well with these pans, meat WILL NOT STICK to them if cooked properly! I make amazing sauces with these pans because they retain all those tastey bits that stick to it once you've been cooking things on high heat. They are perfect for deglazing and it adds so much depth and flavor to reductions and sauces. They can be thrown in the oven to finish off cooking things like fish. I personally have done away with non-stick and gone back to cast iron cookware that I season myself. Non-stick pans are easy to clean, but they have a much shorter shelf life, these pans and cast iron cookware will last decades if used properly.If you find residue on your cookware it could actually be from the minerals found in your water and not a defect in the pans themselves!!! A little elbow grease and BAR KEEPERS FRIEND will have them shine like new. I find that scratches are just an aesthetic thing. These are kitchen TOOLS not decorations. Use them to make amazing meals not wall mountings.
