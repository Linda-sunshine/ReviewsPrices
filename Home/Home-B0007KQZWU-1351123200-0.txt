review/summary: Great product for the pricereview/text: Am very happy with this set. Have never owned ss cookware other than a large stock pot and was quite pleased with how it cooks and cleans up. The only complaint I have is that the handles do seem to get hot so be aware that hot pads may be needed. Very small negative for all the positives. Also happened to see a positive plug for it on America's Test Kitchen as a great alternative to paying big $$$ for All Clad cookware after I'd purchased.
