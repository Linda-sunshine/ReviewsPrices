review/summary: Good product at a reasonable pricereview/text: I am a regular coffee drinker. I like a good cup, but don't own an expresso machine. I generally brew at home using an ecobrew filter in a Breville K-cup machine. Many consider this sacrilege, but it works for me. This mill replaced a Mr. Coffee burr mill that died after a year. It was very noisy and produced a lot of dust. This machine makes about half the noise and a much more uniformly graded grind at a reasonable price.
