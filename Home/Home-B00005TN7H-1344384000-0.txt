review/summary: Nice productreview/text: This was purchased, along with a vacuum sealer, to package and store lettuce. Works exactly as it should, and I am able to take fresh lettuce, chop it, wash it, salad spin it, and store it for 12-14 days in mason jars. This has saved me time and money, as well as making it more convenient to pack a salad for lunch when I go to work. Excellent product!
