review/summary: The hose is a nightmarereview/text: I personally hated this vacuum. The only pros in my opinion were the powerful suction and low price, but I guess you get what you pay for because otherwise it drove me nuts. The cheap, very short plastic hose that has to be manually connected to the vacuum at both ends made me want to scream every time I used this vacuum. The first time I used the vacuum the hose popped off the body about 7 times. I had to duct tape it on. The hose and base suction are not separate, so to use hose, first you have to figure out how to get it to stay on the body (thus the duct tape) and then you have to disconnect the other end from the base to attach the accessory tool. Good luck managing to reach whatever you are vacuuming because it is so very short, stiff, and inflexible. Then there is an open hole on the base where the hose was connected that is still sucking up dust from the carpet while you are using the hose, and spitting the dust up in your face through that hole and into the air. My son is allergic to dust so this was not acceptable at all for us. We returned it and my family ended up pitching in to help us buy a higher end vacuum that I am much happier with. Beware- According to another review I found on this vacuum, the bulk of the 5 star reviews on this product, if they are dated pre-2012, are referring to entirely different vacuum altogether:"This is not the product you think it is. .... Hoover has changed the product but left the model number the same. The new revised unit is not the same old beloved vacuum to which all the reviews prior to 2010 are referring. This version is a cheap imitation of the former. This "revised" model features:- NO Headlight- NO Bag Indicator- NO hose coupling dust cover- CHEAPER plastic- CHEAPER carpet brush- CHEAPER hose- SHODDIER construction- INCORRECT user manual"
