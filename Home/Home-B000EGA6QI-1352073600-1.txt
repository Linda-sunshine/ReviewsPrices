review/summary: We'll Seereview/text: So far my thought is, don't take apart to clean.. After reading all the problems people are having with the broken gear it seems that the constant removing and reinstalling of the stem might be the cause for failure. We also have an older model that does not come apart and is still in excellent condition. The best way to clean any of them is to put water and dish soap in the measure cup or a glass and run the blender in it for a few seconds then rinse and dry.. So easy.. Hope to get the same excellent use out of this model as the old one...
