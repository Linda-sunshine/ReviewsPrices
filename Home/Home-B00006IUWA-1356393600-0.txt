review/summary: From 0 to 5 Quarts in 100 seconds. Amazing.review/text: In a third of the time it takes to nuke a bag of chemicals masquerading as a decent snack, I can have more actual popcorn than necessary using the suggested 1/2 cup scoop.The machine is loud but only on for two minutes. So deal with it.And yes, some kernels do not pop, a few of those stay in the chamber and even less of those may ricochet out at the very end of cycle - when they are most noticeable. But the claims of duck-and-cover from a barrage of rapid-fire corn nuggets are greatly exaggerated.Very happy with the purchase. Inexpensive, well-made, cost-saving, health-saving. Buy this thing. Do it.
