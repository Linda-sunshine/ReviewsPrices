review/summary: A big pitcher with a big pitch!review/text: This is a BIG pitcher, this thing is for you guzzlers out there who want a lot of water at once but without using a faucet filter that can detach, be messy, and ultimately be expensive. The Brita Grand in Purple is a perfect color for someone with Rett syndrome who wants to have a pitcher that really calls attention to its self on the table or in the fridge. You know where the water is always and you can get water filtered pretty quick through this pitcher. a full 80 ounces takes about 2-3 minutes depending on the condition of your filter.The only down side to this pitcher is that not only one fill of the reservoir will fill it, thats how big it is... that makes it a guessing game as to how many reservoir fulls it will take to fill this beast.It can overflow if you overfill so word of advice: underfill it.. you can always add more but if you overflow you got a messy situation to deal with.
