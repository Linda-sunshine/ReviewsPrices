review/summary: Good little heaterreview/text: I don't need to write an extended review of this product because others already have. I think this little heater does a great job for little cost. To save a few bucks, we have our furnace turned down to 65 and our computer room is shut off with no heat from the furnace at all. I use the Optimus heater under my computer desk to keep me warm while using the computer. It does a great job at the lowest setting. In fact, I bought a second Optimus heater for use in another place. For long distance directional heating, that is, if you want to set a heater at a greater distance from yourself while directing the heat at yourself, then the Presto parabolic heater would be better. I have one of those also and like it very much.
