review/summary: Awesome little blender!review/text: I had never purchased an emulsion blender before but you need one for certain recipes. This is powerful and was a great price! I think it works great. The only thing I wish was it came with a larger mixing cup. Works great for those morning breakfast drinks/smoothies.
