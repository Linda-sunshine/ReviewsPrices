review/summary: Bad shape - Needs a handle!review/text: The smooth egg shape is difficult to handle because there is no convenient place to grip it. It takes two hands to move it around. It gets too hot to handle and if you use a towel or pad to lift it out of the microwave, hot water leaks out of the seam between the top and bottom, soaks into the towel and burns you anyhow. Other than this problem, it works well. You still need to allow for the initial temperature of the eggs and the size of the eggs, of course.
