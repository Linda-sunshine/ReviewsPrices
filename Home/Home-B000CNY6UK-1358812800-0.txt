review/summary: A classic!review/text: When I got divorced and moved in to my own place I decided to skip the traditional coffee maker and use my old Bialetti I'd brought back from Italy years before. It really does make a wonderfully rich, smooth cup of coffee. Don't be fooled by the description though, 6-cups in the Bialetti world actually means about 10 ounces of coffee in the western world. I grind my coffee fresh each day with a burr grinder on medium grind and I get a perfect, rich taste.As far as coffee, I've found that imported italian coffee tastes best. Lavazza and Illy, even the pre-ground varieties, will give you as close to a real Italian flavor as possible.
