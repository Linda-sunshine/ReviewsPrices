review/summary: Does what it should do... make coffee.review/text: I have always been a tea drinker, but for sometime I have moved to coffee because it is lot easier and time saving to make a cup of coffee than making tea. The kind of tea I drink takes about 10 min to make.I have now accustomed to coffee taste and I needed something that makes a cup of coffee for me. I was looking for a cheap coffee maker and I got it for $21 at local store which was on sale. I have not tested the timer part yet and I hope it works as expected.
