review/summary: Not Awesome, but Pretty Goodreview/text: It's a juicer and it works pretty well. The basket is a pain to clean, but so are other centrifugal basket juicers. I like the foam separator and cleaning the basket is worth watching my whole family happily drinking fresh green lemonade. The feed tube says to turn on the motor before you insert the fruit- make sure you have your pusher ready to go or the fruit sometimes bounces up and out. Seems to be particularly an issue with lemons.
