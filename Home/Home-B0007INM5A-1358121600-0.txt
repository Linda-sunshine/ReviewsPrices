review/summary: refillable coffee filtersreview/text: I purchased these filters because I got tired of having to buy coffee pods and etc. Great purchase I have not had to buy any pods or cups since I got them I can use brand of coffee that I want and any strength. Would recommend them to any one that has a one cup brewer like the sensco. They are easy to clean and fill with your favorite coffee Cuts down on the cost of your coffee too
