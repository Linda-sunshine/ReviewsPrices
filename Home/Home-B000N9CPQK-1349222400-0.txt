review/summary: So far so good!review/text: It seems to be working great, be sure to read the directions! It is kind of loud, but I'm using it for my bedroom and the white noise doesn't bother me. Haven't tried to turn on the ionizer because of the warnings it has for people with asthma/breathing problems, but I'll have to do some more research because that's the first time I've read that... may be in rare cases, or so if such a problem does occur they can't be sued. Been using it for a week about 12 hours a day and I'm satisfied, noticed a reduction of dust in the air.Update: It provided a service light, so I removed the filter and cleaned it but the light remains... it still runs but I am going to take another look at the instruction manual.
