review/summary: LOVEITLOVEITLOVEITLOVEIT.......review/text: I am crazy about this thing!!! great styling, altho' I wish it came in white instsead of black.....a minor point! LOLI ordered the #1 filters as after one try just using the permanent filter, the cleanup was more than I bargained for......I had almost forgotton how GOOD brewed coffee could be, as I"ve used instant for many, many years, which I enjoyed, but this is SO much better!!!I use a plain old measuring spoon Tablespoon for each cup......why on earth do people buy those little steel spoons?When thru brewing, I rinse out the filter and the holder beneath it, set them aside to air dry, and leave the lid open so the inside dries out completely..........Penny-pincher that I am, I also squeeze the filter before I throw it out; always a few drops of coffee there - why waste it? and just think of how those few drops would add up in a years' time.......hey, you paid for it, you may as well use it.....And for those of you who use creamer, PLEASE don't use the commercial creamers; the first thing listed on them is 'corn syrup solids'.....another nasty source of sugar..........Instead, I use powdered milk; a little more expensive, but at least all you're getting is MILK and no extra nasty sweeteners!!So all in all I am VERY pleased with this product!!!!!!
