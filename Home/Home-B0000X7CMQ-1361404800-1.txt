review/summary: Made in China junk!review/text: Had the exact same coffee maker for about 3 years and had no complaints until one day it just stopped working. I bought this carafe off of Amazon 5 months ago and experienced the exact same problem today. The coffee pot heated up, brewed about 1/3 of a pot and then just stopped. After I cleaned it thoroughly I tried again and the water would not heat up and it didn't pump water. Luckily I can return to the company for warranty repair (at my own cost for shipping). But Zojirushi needs to bring their manufacturing back to Japan and the US and STOP exporting Chinese junk!!! Coffee is great when it works and the Zojirushi products I have bought that are manufactured in Japan are top notch!
