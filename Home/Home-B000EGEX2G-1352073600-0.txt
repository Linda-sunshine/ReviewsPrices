review/summary: Baby's Roomreview/text: The product is exactly as the picture depicts it. It is comfortable to sit in and it has a smooth gliding action. The price (we paid $129.00 shipping incl) was very reasonable considering that there are many comparable gliders available online for 2 and 3 times the price. Assembly was easy. We had it together in 15 minutes. It has roomy pockets built into each of the arm rests that are adequate for a book, magazines, baby rattle, baby bottle, bible, etc.The only point of disappointment is that product is made in China... but then so is most everything these days.
