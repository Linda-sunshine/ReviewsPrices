review/summary: Sheets arrived with a stain!review/text: These sheets are of good quality material, but after opening them we noticed a one inch diameter stain (possibly a blood stain) on the fitted sheet. We needed this sheet immediately, so we laundered it with various stain-removers. The stain remains. The question is ... how could a &#34;new&#34; sheet have a stain on it. I would not buy from this vendor again.
