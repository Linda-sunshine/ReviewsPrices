review/summary: perfect for my needsreview/text: i had a white plastic kettle that my daughter brought home from china. after hearing about bpa's i did my research via amazon and decided to purchase a hamilton beach. i love this kettle! i have 3 tenants sharing my home and i would say that we use it 6 times a day.(heavy duty tea drinkers)PROsAttractiveHeats the Water quicklyOnly thing plastic is part of the lid but the fill line is low enough that i don't think it is a problem.Turns off when the water is boilingPours nicelyIs not heavy or hard to holdCONsthe on/off tab compared to the body feels a little cheap and fragile.it doesn't fit tightly on the base so i can wobble it... but only slightly.
