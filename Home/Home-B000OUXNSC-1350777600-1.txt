review/summary: Melted - Even With LOW Heatreview/text: I purchased this item only 1 month ago. On my first wash, it was dried on low and a small bit of the inner liner began to melt. I just washed it today for its 2nd time and the entire inside liner is completely melted. I used the lowest heat setting on my drier both times. This item is extremely poor quality and I would recommend everyone to look elsewhere.
