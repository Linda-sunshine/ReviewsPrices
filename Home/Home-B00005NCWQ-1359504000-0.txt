review/summary: Wonderful coffeereview/text: I love, love, love this pot. It makes the best coffee ever. I put my D&D grounds in it and it is better then when I go to D&D. However - it takes a while - you cannot turn the flame up real high - I use about 6 heaping tsp. of coffee. If you have never used a Percolator you need to experiment. Some work mornings I actually get up early just so I can brew this coffee - after I have my 2 cups I take a thermos to work. Mostly I just do it on the weekends because it takes about 15 minutes and I don't want to not keep an eye on it.
