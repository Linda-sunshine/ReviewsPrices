review/summary: Simply the Best and Cost effective French Press on the Market !review/text: If you like french pressed coffee and if you like top notch quality products , do yourself a favour and get this press . You will not regret. This is made in Malaysia and with Insulated walls to retain heat, stainless steel parts ( except lid ) and completely glass free carafe ...all for less than $30...Its definitely worth every bit. The screen is not that great and it takes a while to work, but you can use a bodum or even a primula's old mesh ...But let that not stop you from buying this...Love it. Thanks Thermos for such an awesome product !
