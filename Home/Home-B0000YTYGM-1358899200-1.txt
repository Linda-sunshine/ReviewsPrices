review/summary: Keep the box . . . it'll help if you need to return it to the factoryreview/text: Makes great coffee, and the thermal carafe is excellent; keeps the coffee hot for a long time.But, we are currently on our 3rd unit, after having the first 2 coffeemakers fail . . . after 2 months each; heating unit just stopped working each time. To their credit, the factory service people were quick to send us replacement units, but it was still a hassle to pack it up, and worse, to be without a coffeemaker for a week! Since we live in California, there was no charge to ship it back; if you live in another state they charge you $10.The unit comes with a one year factory warranty, and I am curious to see if this third unit makes it to a year; I kept the box for the purpose of returning it when/if that becomes necessary.
