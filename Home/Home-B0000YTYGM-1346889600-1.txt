review/summary: Hot coffee. User interface needs much improvementreview/text: This Cuisinart coffeemaker brews coffee that is much hotter than the aging Krups model it replaced. The thermal carafe keeps the coffee warmer than the old Krups model, too. Hotter coffee was the main improvement I was looking for in a new coffeemaker. Coffee pours without dripping from the carafe if you turn the lid to the proper position as marked on the lid in hard-to-read letters molded into the plastic. Have now used for two weeks without issues with the coffeemaker leaking coffee all over the kitchen counter as reviewers see to report for any and all coffeemaker models reviewed -- but I have been very careful to properly thread and tighten the lid onto the carafe as marked and properly position the basket and carafe within the base unit. Downside of this Cuisinart model is the user interface. Operating/program buttons are very, very tiny, difficult to see and marked by difficult to read labels. OK for individuals with very good vision but those with vision issues might want to stay away from this model. Also, the water level gauge and its markings are positioned on the side of the unit in a way that one has to rotate the coffeemaker 90 degrees to read the water level. Very annoying. It seems that Cuisinart cut corners by disregarding human factors engineering during the product design.
