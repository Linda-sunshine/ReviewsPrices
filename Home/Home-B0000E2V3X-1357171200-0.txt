review/summary: Excellent Lodge Productreview/text: This is a typical Lodge cast iron product, meaning it is top quality and performs exactly as promised! You only need to preheat it in your oven before placing a pizza on it. Lodge Cast Iron always arrives pre-seasoned and to maintain that you just lightly oil it after each use. I have cooked several pizzas on this but mind you I have only used it at this point for frozen pizzas. They do come out with a nice crisp crust. I highly recommend this pizza pan.
