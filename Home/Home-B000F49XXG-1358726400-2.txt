review/summary: happy with it, but buy a handheld tamperreview/text: the built-in tamper is just silly. I paid somewhere near $100 for this thing. it wasn't until I got a $7 tamper to go with it that the espresso it produced started tasting like actual espresso.that being said, this is a very convenient machine, works like a charm so far, and once you have a tamper for it, the espresso's great.
