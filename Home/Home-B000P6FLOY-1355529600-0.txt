review/summary: Untested but...review/text: I received this today as a gift. Mine does have an on/off switch on the bottom so maybe the company has listen to the complaints posted here. The only temps I have test are room temp and my oral temp. Room temp seemed about right while my body temp showed 95. I can't wait to test it and will post back if I ever have an issue.
