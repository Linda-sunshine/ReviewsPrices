review/summary: Wildly appropriate productreview/text: This is a great little tea brewer. The price point is respectable; quality is very good. BPA-free plastic is a key safety feature. The order was received on time in excellent condition. The teapot is easy to use and to clean. Love the convenience - no muss, no fuss, works as advertised. I am very happy with this purchase. I subsequently ordered two for my sister to brighten her day.
