review/summary: failed after 10 monthsreview/text: It was fine until it suddenly failed one morning. We poured our coffee as usual, turned it off, and it was just blank and dead when we tried to brew with it a few hours later. 10 months is beyond the warranty. VERY disappointed in MR. COFFEE brand quality.
