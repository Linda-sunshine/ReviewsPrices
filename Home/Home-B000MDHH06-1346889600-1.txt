review/summary: Awesomereview/text: I own a vitamix and so I debated for a long time as to whether or not I needed a juicer. And I researched for quite sometime before purchasing this one. this juicer is great. it is fast and it cleans up so easily. The pulp is still slioghtly wet, but is quite useful in other recipes. I also love the compact design. It fits under the counter nicely and does not take up a lot of room. my holisitc pactitioner wanted me to conume large quantities of carrot juice....this juicer fits the bill. OH and I have to mention the awesom pitcher that comes with this. It actually skims off any foam that may have formed as you pour it into the glass. I even use this pitcher for straining things blended in the vitamix...I love it. Because of its speed, I have no problem making juice before work in the morning because it cleans up so quickly. I have no regrets.
