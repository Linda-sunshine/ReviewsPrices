review/summary: Great product, fair price, and UL Listedreview/text: I'm not going to say much, since there are already hundreds of reviews in front of mine.But I bought this when I wanted an upgrade to the cheap Proctor Silex plastic one I had.This one has a better switch and stainless steel construction, and has lasted over a year with no problems. My mom has one too, she uses hers probaby 10X as much as I use mine, and hers has held up well too.The spout is nice and thin, so it doesn't dribble when pouring.
