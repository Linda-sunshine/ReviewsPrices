review/summary: Lots of great tasting coffee!review/text: I bought this a Christmas gift for my husband. He used to have to make 3 separate pots of coffee in order for it to taste fresh throughout the morning. Now, it's just one large pot with hot, fresh tasting coffee.Beware, I bought the gold-tone filter basket and it takes a little longer to percolate down into the pot - we had a mini haz-mat situation when the basket overflowed with 12-cups of water; we use 10.
