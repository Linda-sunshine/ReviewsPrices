review/summary: Good Espresso but bad foamreview/text: Very cheap. I bought this because I love making my own lattes. I also work at Starbucks and know my way around a good latte. The espresso comes out alright but the frothier.. its horrible! I bought this one originally because it was the cheapest, best reviewed, espresso machine that had a milk frothier attached. I would just recommend getting a better quality machine without the foamer and getting a milk frothier separate.
