review/summary: Too small after 2 washingsreview/text: We bought the more expensive sheets, expecting higher quality but the cloth seems coarse. Washed in cool water and dried it normal. After one washing the bottom sheet was REALLY tight, but we decided to give it a try. We hate to send things back unwarranted. After the second wash (Cool and cool) it was even tighter - my husband the only one who could put it on - and it probably won't fit after another wash. We checked the mattress, which is a queen, memory foam, and it measures 79&#34;x 59&#34; and is well inside the normal Queen dimensions. The pillow cases also feel scratchy so we are sending the set back.Love Amazon's return policy.
