review/summary: Absolutely love it!review/text: I didn't know a coffeemaker could be such a joy to use. This one does it all and does it perfectly. It's very solid in its construction and all features work exactly as they should. The brew pause is exactly that. It's the first coffeemaker I've ever owned that truly pauses with no drip. I love the easy toggle on/off. The timer works like a charm. As I said I love it.
