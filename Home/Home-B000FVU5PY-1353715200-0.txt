review/summary: Best night sleep in a whilereview/text: Upon receiving these sheets I washed them all on cold/cold and then tumble dryed on low. I can see how some people would say they were a little scratchy at first but after sleeping on them for a couple nights they kept getting smoother and smoother. The scratchiness was hardly noticeable the first night and we slept great. Have owned for two weeks now and so far no pilling, they seem like very durable sheets. I like that they are a bit larger than normal queen sheets so no ones ends up being a sheet hog.
