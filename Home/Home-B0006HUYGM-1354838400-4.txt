review/summary: Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum - 71Breview/text: Wish I discovered this hand-held vacuum a decade ago. When I think of the frustrations I felt trying to find ways to remove cat and dog hair from furniture all of these years, and here's an excellent, easy to use hand-held vacuum cleaner that takes care of this easily and effectively in a matter of minutes. I've used it on furniture, along baseboards, on stairs and in my car and was really pleased with how easy it is to use and how efficient and effective it works. It's easy to convert to and from using the standard mode to the thin hand-held tool that gets into corners of rooms and furniture. Buy it today!
