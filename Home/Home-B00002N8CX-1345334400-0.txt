review/summary: Wow I am impressedreview/text: I didn't expect too much for an inexpensive canister vacuum. I was purchasing to vacuum cat and dog hair on my carpeted stairs and to vacuum my car. This little "mighty mite" packs a big punch. Superb suction, compact and light weight, but does not feel flimsy. When researching this purchase I found the other customer reviews helpful, and I also found other references to this model as being one of the better canister compacts. Would recommend to anyone looking for a canister vacuum.
