review/summary: Great starter juicerreview/text: I bought this juicer 6 months ago after deciding to go on a juicing diet after watching Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead. Now I make a large pitcher of juice 1-2 times a week for my husband and I and I am more than satisfied with the product. It juices fast, is easy to use and fairly simple to clean up. The cons are that its is quite noisy so I rarely juice in the morning when my husband is sleeping and the inlet is not large enough to put in whole apples. However, I think these are small details that can be overlooked. It is overall a great machine and I wouldn't spend the extra $100 bucks to buy a bigger inlet.
