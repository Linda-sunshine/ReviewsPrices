review/summary: Perfectreview/text: Thanks to the other reviewers I didn't spill coffee all over the place. The only thing I can come up with is that the coffee continues to come out of the spout for a minute or two after the finish beeping comes on. I have to wait a couple of minutes before pouring myself a nice hot cup of fresh coffee. So Instead of 8 stars I'm only giving it five.
