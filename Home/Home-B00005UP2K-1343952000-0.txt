review/summary: Another Happy Customerreview/text: Does Amazon need another glowing review for the KitchenAid Artisan Series 5-Quart Mixer? Not really, but I'm very happy with mine. I've had it about 5 months and used it many times on everything from cakes to meatloaf, it does a great job. I haven't had any trouble with it, it can handle whatever I've thrown in it and I love the classic look (as opposed to the new one where the bowl moves, that one's just ugly). I think if you're looking for a stand mixer and a trusted name, this is the mixer you want.
