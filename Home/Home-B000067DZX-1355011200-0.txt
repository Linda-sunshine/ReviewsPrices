review/summary: Filters wellreview/text: Pros:- Filters well, but I also live in SF Bay Area, so our water is fairly tasty and clean to begin with.- These actually seem to last for quite some time; I probably change my filter once every 2-3 years (which is probably disgusting, but it still seems to filter fine, or I can't notice any difference since our water is pretty decent).Cons:- Costly, but worth the investment if you need to filter your water on a daily basis.
