review/summary: Extremely efficientreview/text: Preheated with hot water and filled with coffee in the morning, this bottle keeps it hot well into the afternoon. I don't even bother buying a cup of coffee for after lunch. The only downside is if you want a commuter cup for the drive to work. Coffee stays much too hot for that.
