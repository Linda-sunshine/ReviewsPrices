review/summary: Fun for one and an issue to consider (flavoring)review/text: Fun to use however I took off a star because:* It only makes one serving at a time and if you have a family you would have to keep making bowls for everyone for movie night.* I didn't realize that finding a buttery tasting seasoning would be so hard to find. If you like melted butter, then using the cup would be fine but I find that soggy. If anyone knows a good seasoning please comment! If you like just plain pop corn no butter, it is really fun!
