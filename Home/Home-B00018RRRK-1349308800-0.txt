review/summary: Motor Burnoutreview/text: After the initial excitement about the purchase of this coffee grinder, reality quickly set when the motor burn out after about 6 months. I got a replacement unit from Cuisinart which then only took two months for the motor to burn out. I am extremely disappointed with the product.
