review/summary: Like a bag of cementreview/text: I really tried to like this pillow and used it for a month. If you use the pillow case it comes with it really is like a bag of cement. You have to use a looser pillow case, but it is still VERY firm. It would be ok if you always sleep on your side, but it is much too hard for sleeping on stomach or back.
