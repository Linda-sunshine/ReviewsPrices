review/summary: Replacement for a much appreciated food chopper.review/text: This product has been a favorite in our house for more than 30 years. It became our most useful item once we acquired an African Grey parrot. We dropped the bowl. It cracked. Our parrot, did NOT like the chopped food done in other choppers!She threw everything in the floor in protest! We had no choice but to find another. Some 30 years later, the food chopper is still the best. It has not been changed. We are using the motor from the old one,because it's still good,but we use the bowl from the new one. Now we have extra parts and our parrot is happy again. She no longer protests the food because this product is doing what it has always done. Chopped! We appreciate our chopped veggies as well!Thanks to Black and Decker, the seller and the services of Amazon.
