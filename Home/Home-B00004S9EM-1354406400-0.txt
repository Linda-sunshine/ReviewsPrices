review/summary: Excellent appliancereview/text: My BRAUN Food Processor broke after many years of use. I did some research to find the right appliance. I am very satisfied with the purchase. Very good quality, the size is sufficient for a small family, it is easy to use. The enclosed CD is very helpful and should be watched before using the appliance.I recommend this Food Processor.
