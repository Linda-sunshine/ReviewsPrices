review/summary: Get the 190 gram it is the warmest flannel everreview/text: Have had a variety of flannels. All of the department store variety which did not give the weight of the flannel. Looked at Bean but their prices were high. We saw the Pinzon at Amazon in both the 160 gram and 190 gram weights and ordered the 190. We are not sorry. The weight is not too heavy but provides plenty of warmth and the softeness is indescribable. The sheets felt so good that we ordered two more sets.
