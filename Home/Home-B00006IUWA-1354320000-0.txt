review/summary: The bestreview/text: Had the older sibling of this for about 25+ years, and often used it several times a week (we're big popcorn fans). When it finally popped it's last kernel, I looked at the different reviews/ratings. This was still strong and it was reasonably priced so went with it. As far as we can tell, it's identical to the old model, which is good - it wasn't broke so they didn't need to make any "fixes". Have had it now for a few months and it's great - perfect every time.
