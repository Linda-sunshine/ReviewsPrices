review/summary: Very good for its price!review/text: It's been exactly one year since I bought this product and I must say that so far I have no problems with it. I am using it basically for 3 things on almost a daily basis: onions, tomatoes, and walnuts. The blades cut exactly the same as they did the first day and it has never had any functioning issues.There are of course two major drawbacks:a) the motor is serving as the lid having as a result small amounts of food entering in the hole where the blades go (specifically when I chop tomatoes). The manual says to clean it carefully with cloth but there is NO way I'm putting food somewhere that is not at least rinsed with water! So far the moment I stop chopping, I am rinsing the bottom side motor very carefully with water.b) Since there is no actual lid, all juices spill if you keep on pressing for some time the button. And I'm not talking for big amounts; the tomatoes do not exceed the higher blade.I wish I could find the moulinex brand here in amazon. All my life I've been using both a moulinex blender and a moulinex mixer and they never let me down. But anyway, for simple use this mixer is just fine and at a very very reasonable price.
