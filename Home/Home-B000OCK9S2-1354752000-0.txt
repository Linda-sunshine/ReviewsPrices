review/summary: You get what you pay for.review/text: Easy to figure out without the manual (which is good since it wasn't included for some reason). Easy to utilize the sounds and set the clock. Nice FM radio reception.The bad: Sounds are only 10 seconds long and looped, and it's very noticeable. If you are putting in a child's room, probably not the end of the world, but we purchased it for our room (specifically for the white noise feature). Every 10 seconds or so you hear the noise track resetting itself with a light click, and it's annoying if you've used white noise on other devices where it's typically an uninterrupted noise source.The screen is crazy bright. It has two different settings, should be labeled high or extra high. The low setting just isn't that dim. I can see where the display could be difficult to read at certain angles, but this won't be an issue if you just set it level with the sight line from your bed, as most likely will.In the end, it's $20 so it's not likely to be comparable to a high end device. I bought it as an impulse buy on a lightning deal without reading reviews.
