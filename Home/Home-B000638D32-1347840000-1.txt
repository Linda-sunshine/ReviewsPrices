review/summary: New Knife Lovereview/text: I just wanted to add my love to the ongoing praise parade for this knife. Even though I've only had it a few days, I'm very happy with it and kicking myself for not buying one sooner. I have small hands and weak wrists and this knife is actually light enough to be comfortable to use. If it keeps its edge the way other reviewers have claimed, I'll be thrilled to pieces because I'm lousy at sharpening knives.
