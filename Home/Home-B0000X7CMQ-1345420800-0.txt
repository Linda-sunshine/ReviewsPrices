review/summary: I love it!review/text: I've owned LOTS of different coffeemakers over the years--the one from Starbucks was my favorite, until now. I did a lot of online and in-store research to find the Zojirushi and am so happy I did! This coffeemaker has all the features I wanted: a thermos (I've broken WAY more of my share of glass carafes), is easy to clean, simple to operate, the coffee produced is just the right temperature (I hate lukewarm coffee), it's not oversized, and the cost is affordable.From reading previous reviews, I note the "problem" w/ the filter--I also thought that the #4 was too large and actually cut it down a bit (because I had so many #4s on hand) but then found that some grounds wound up in the coffee. So, it's just fine if you hold the filter down when you bring the arm over it.
