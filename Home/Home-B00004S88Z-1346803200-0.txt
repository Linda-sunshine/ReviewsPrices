review/summary: Watch it carefullyreview/text: All American 921 21-1/2-Quart Pressure Cooker/CannerWe purchased this pressure canner 14 months ago based on the many recommendations. It is very difficult to get a good seal. You have to watch it constantly. We didn't and it leaked out all of the steam. The heat then caused the bottom to burn out. If you want to be very careful to make sure it does burn out all of the water, it should do a good job. For those of us not that careful, a pressure canner with a gasket is much easier.
