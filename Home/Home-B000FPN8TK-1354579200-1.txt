review/summary: Great teapotreview/text: I have used the Teavana version of this for a couple years now and decided I wanted one for the office as well. I decided to try this one to save a few dollars and am glad I did. It works perfectly and is easy to clean. My only complaint is that if I don't let the pot drain fully on the cup it can leak a few drops of the onto the table when it is set down. The Teavana version I have came with a plate that it sits on to catch the drips. But I found the if I just let the Ingenuitea sit on the cup for a few extra moments after I think it's empty it drains more fully and doesn't drip. Definitely a great product for tea drinkers who want an easy way to enjoy loose leaf teas.
