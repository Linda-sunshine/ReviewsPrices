review/summary: Interesting concept, but lacking in execution.review/text: Taking a look into a possible future eutopia is always interesting. The writing style didn't really catch me, but the concept made me want to read on to see what would happen. An ok book, but I can imagine the conversations one could have with young adults while reading this book.
