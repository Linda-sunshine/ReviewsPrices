review/summary: Simple package.review/text: I was kind of disappointed after I open the Amazon box. The knife package even does not have Ginsu logo on it, only plain paper box, not even includes an instruction of the usage for each knife. The knife is thinner than I expected, not easy to hold, I prefer the heavy and very quality feel of the other major brand. It is only a set of ok knife for the price you pay. You may get a better set in Ross, TJ about the same price.
