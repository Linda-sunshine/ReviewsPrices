review/summary: Not the best design....shop around some morereview/text: I was stationed in Germany (Brita's International HQ) and have noticed the US gets the sub-par designs compared to what is in Europe. Funny, since all the US products I got there were the sub-par versions. Anyhow, I don't recommend this water pitcher. The filters are ridiculously expensive for carbon bits in plastic (they are about 6x the price of the superior Euro design). I had to duct tape the top to the pitcher-body to keep the top from coming off. It didn't fall off when pouring, but instead it always slid off when my thumb made contact with the lid (I dare you to hold this pitcher without any thumb-contact). In my opinion PUR makes a better designed pitcher that is closer to Euro Brita.
