review/summary: exactly what I was looking forreview/text: This product is exactly what I was looking for when I wanted a mattress topper. To be honest, I was only really interested in 2 factors: high customer reviews and low price. This was the cheapest option with great reviews I could find, so I took a chance on it. So glad I did! It's a DREAM to sleep on. So comfortable. At first, it feels almost too soft, but after laying on it a couple minutes, it really forms to your body. It does make your bed softer, but mostly it just eliminated pressure, especially if you're a side-sleeper like me. Another great perk was the elimination of movement from your partner. My boyfriend tosses around a lot at night and I don't usually stay still myself, either. But this definitely cut down on how much you feel the other person move, a lot! I agree with other reviewers about the mint chocolate smell (I mean, it's identical to a York Peppermint Patty). My whole apartment smells like the stuff, but really, who would complain about such an awesome smell? I kinda hope it doesn't go away...Absolutely recommend this product!
