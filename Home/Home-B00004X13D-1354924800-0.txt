review/summary: Great Waffe Maker!!review/text: I love my waffle maker!! No bells and whistles, it just makes great waffles! My favorite feature is that it closes up and stands on end when not in use! I have very limited counter space and I can keep it out and it doesn't get stashed away and forgotten!! Price was great and I highly recommend!!
