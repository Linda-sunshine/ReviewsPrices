review/summary: Very Handy!review/text: I am so happy I purchased this product! It has been so handy to puree soups or mix things that are liquid. It was so cumbersome before this product to transfer soup to a blender to liquify it. Not to mention the potential of getting burned and messy spills. The hand blender quickly resolved those problems. It is very powerful and cleans very easily!
