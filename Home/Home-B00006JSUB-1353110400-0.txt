review/summary: Heavy but works goodreview/text: UPDATE***I've grown to like this pan more and more. I now cook meals in it. For example, at breakfast you can cook eggs, hash browns and bacon at the same time. It's all about the timing of when each ingredient goes in. If you are diligent about keeping it well-oiled and don't put food in until it's pre-heated, the pan behaves as if it were non-stick.I wish the main handle was longer. The pan is so heavy it's hard to move around when cleaning. It's much easier to clean if you do it while it's still warm. I pretty much have to leave it on the stove and wipe it out with a bunch of wet paper towels.ORIGINAL REVIEWI bought this after getting frustrated trying to cook sea scallops in a regular pan and not getting a good sear. This is the kind of pan you need for searing meats on a stove or in an oven.It's got a rough texture finish inside. Be sure it's hot and has oil or butter on it before adding food to prevent sticking. It cleans easily with just water and a sponge if you let it soak for a little while. If you clean it with soap you need to heat it and rub oil on it to restore the seasoning coat that prevents the food from welding onto it.It's really heavy! Imagine holding a skillet full of sand. They added on a handgrip on the opposite side of the handle so you can use two hands. If the pan is warm (and it stays warm long after you turn off the burner) you'll need potholders on both hands to move it to the sink for soaking or cleaning.I'm still experimenting with it, but I think it makes a great addition to the kitchen. I use it much less often than my non-stick Circulon skillet, but it lets me do things I never could before and that's sparking my creative juices.
