review/summary: It Cleans Carpetsreview/text: If I had rented a carpet clearer it would have coasted me at least 50. I bought this cleaner and extra detergent for less then 150. It is easy to use and removed a lot of dirt and stains from carpet. I could see the difference. The final result was very dry. My two cats sometimes vomit and shed a lot of fur. The cleaner even picked up the fur or made fur balls. The carpet looks newer.
