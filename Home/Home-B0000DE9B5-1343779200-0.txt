review/summary: WARNING: Dangerous product. It EXPLODED when making ice tea!review/text: I purchased this pitcher (the smaller version, not the 77 3/4 ounce) in late 2010. It worked well until today. When making ice tea (just like in the picture...) I poured in the hot water. It the LITERALLY EXPLODED. I was left with the top portion of the the tea pitcher in my hand. My leg was drenched in 48 ozs of SCALDING water. My leg is burned. If it's not for ice tea then they should not advertise it for ice tea.I am going to follow up on this product to make sure nobody else is injured in the future. I will see what Bigkitchen's response is. If I could give this ZERO or NEGATIVE stars I would. You are WARNED. THIS IS DANGEROUS.Update from above post. OK, this is dissappointing. To be clear, the pitcher was at ROOM TEMPERATURE when I addes the hot water and tea. It then exploded. I contacted bigkitchen, the company I purchased it from to warn them of the potential dangerous flaw. I neither asked for a refund or anything else. They told me it was "user error" because of the "thermal change". It is not tempered glass. It is not designed to contain ice tea. ...Look at the picture in the advertisement. How do they advertise it? ...with ice tea.The response ticked me off. They expressed "concern" but were not worried about other people getting injured in the future because of how they advertised this product. My pupose in this post and in contacting the company was so nobody else (for example, a little kid getting injured from the flying shards of glass or hot water) gets hurt. I'm now motivated by the lack of concern and will report this product to the Consumer Prolduct Safety Commission and other national and local agencies.
