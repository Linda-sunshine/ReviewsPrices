review/summary: BYE BYE STOVE! HELLO GRIDDLE!review/text: My wife wanted a new griddle after her cast iron one she had for the past 9 years finally had enough. We were debating between another cast iron griddle or electric. So we read the reviews all were great on the Presto and we said you know what for the price and the huge cooking space we can't lose so we ordered it. When it arrived we took it out the box and yep huge cooking space!!!!There are some reviews that say their griddle takes 10 minutes to heat up ours takes like 2-3 minutes so not sure what's going on with theirs. This griddle is the best you can make a feast and clean up in no time! Just cook & wipe off the easy clean non stick surface. My wife told me why did you wait so long to get me one of these lol!I don't think we will ever use our stove again except for sauces & stews of course but other then that its going on the GRIDDLE! Thank us later BUY IT!!!!!
