review/summary: Nice product, crappy packagingreview/text: I decided to start collecting the nativity set this year and ordered the wisemen and the set with the camel. I have to say they are beautiful and large. They look great on display and I'm really excited about ordering the rest of it. Same quality as every other willow tree product I've purchased.The downside: I'm normally not someone who is incredibly fussy, but the packaging is really lousy. I tried to get the wisemen out of the box first and the styrofoam disintegrated in my hand. I grabbed the other end of the box to try to get a better grip on the box and it tore the box. Finally, I just ripped the cardboard box apart to get them out of the styrofoam. The camel set was easier to get open, but the styrofoam still breaks off when you're barely touching it. There was styrofoam all over the floor. I vacuumed and vacuumed and I still found a good amount in my baby's diaper the next day. Grrr. I was happy with the product, but I will have to get my own box and bubble wrap to store them in because the stuff it came in was destroyed. You would think a company which charges a decent amount for their product wouldn't skimp so much on their packaging.Bottom line: Order this set, but open it outside lest you have mountains of crumbled styrofoam on your carpet.
