review/summary: Great for risotto and soupsreview/text: I bought this specifically to make risotto, since the bottom is a rounded shape it is best for stirring so nothing gets stuck in a corner. It is also very good for soups. I like the design with the big handles since these cast iron pots are heavy. I also have a 7-quart Staub cast iron dutch oven that I use for braising, stews and other cooking. With the affordable price on the Lodge it was reasonable to add to my collection.
