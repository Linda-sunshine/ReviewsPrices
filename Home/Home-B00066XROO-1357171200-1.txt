review/summary: Love itreview/text: First trick, DO NOT spray it with cooking spray. I just oil mine slightly from time to time and can cook eggs and/or pancakes with no problems. I particularly love that it is washable. I always hated how gross griddles got over time. I've been using this one several times per week for a year and it's still as clean as when we bought it.The surface is HUGE! and WARNING it takes up a lot of space. We did have trouble finding a place to store it because it is really big. But it is great to be able to cook enough pancakes for my wife and three kids in two batches. Or to do eggs, bacon, and pancakes all at the same time.
