review/summary: Adagio Teas Ingenuitea 16 oz Teapotreview/text: Love this tea steeper so much I ordered a second one. We use loose leaf tea quite a bit and this works great. Put it over a mug for hot tea, or over a glass full of ice for iced tea. Others have said the strainer floats up....so far we haven't had that problem. We don't microwave it; we simply add boiling water and steep for desired strength. It sits on a tile counter without leaking. The lid comes off (be gentle with the tips that snap into cup) which makes It so easy to clean out. I have put it in the dishwasher's top rack, from time to time, with no problem. I would recommend this tea steeper without hesitation.
