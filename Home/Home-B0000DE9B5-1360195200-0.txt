review/summary: Great Pitcher!review/text: I love this pitcher and just received my SECOND one today from Amazon.com.I love Amazon too but truthfully you would hope their warehouse personnel would be able to use better packing common sense; almost every book and glass item I have ordered from them arrives with damage. But with this product, despite precarious packing, it has arrived intact, TWICE!That means it is TOUGH! Good quality for an attractive and functional GLASS pitcher.I live in Hawai'i and we have lots of bugs so I cannot leaving a pitcher out without a lid which is why I bought the first one.The lid seals easily and is not designed to be on when pouring (I don't think it is) so for best results remove the lids when pouring and you should have no issues with the lid once you figure-out the seal which was easy for me but may be tricky for others.It is a great size for the fridge and making homemade juices or just cooling your drinking water.I use mine everyday and am thinking of buying more. I love that it is glass with a BPA free lid.The only other note I would make is that I am a big guy so the handle does not bother me but if you are a small or weak individual it might be hard to manage. It is definitely strong which is a plus but it is relatively small.
