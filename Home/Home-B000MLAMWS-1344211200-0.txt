review/summary: Jumbo jet soundreview/text: I have a cake decorating company. So I spend a lot of time baking. I have a kenwood but business expanded so I needed another mixer. I went for the Kitchenaid as I heard a lot of good reviews about the brand. However, I am using it for a while now and I'm totally not satisfied. The thing makes a noice as if a jet is taking off!!! I cannot hear someone talk if the person was standing next to me.Next to that the kitchenaid does not completely mix everything. It leaves a lot of chunks behind. Which you'll find in your cakebatter after your cake is baked.So I would nog recommend the kitchenaid 6Q. Instead go for the kenwood. You'll pay a bit more but it will be worth it. It is much more quiet, steady and it doesn't leave unmixed flower behind.
