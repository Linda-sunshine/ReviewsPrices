review/summary: It's amazing!review/text: Every time I go to use it I think - OMG, it's not going to work, there's just no way. And, whoa! Out comes popped corn. A modern marvel. Mind blowing. BTW, this is a nice small screen in the bottom, so it would work great for roasting coffee if you're looking for a unit for that. Pop on!
