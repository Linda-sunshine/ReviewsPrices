review/summary: Broke after 4 minutesreview/text: WARNING: if you intend to use this alarm clock with a in Europe/overseas with a converter, it will break! The clock worked for 4 minutes and then never turned on again, even when I plugged it into a US plug. Be aware and don't make the mistake that I made. I guess thats what you get when you purchase something made by Sony.
