review/summary: Height support failed winthin 6 monthsreview/text: Height support failed within 6 month of purchasing.No warranty listed?Is customer over 190 lbs and damaged this chair? nope, truth.Height support seem leaking gas or pressure, that normally happened on over year or few years old chairs, but it should not failed within 6 months. If this chair failed mechanical or broken part at least reach 1 year, I will not this unhappy.I bought a cheap version $99 chair(all in one piece if you go to frys)with same type of height support mechanical from Frys. A cheap chair can last over 4 years even after the cushion broken and peek off, the height support still good on the $99 chair.Please keep good quality control on a chair that cost over $140
