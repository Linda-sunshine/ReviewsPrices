review/summary: What a waste of money!review/text: I received the chair in good time. Had to put it together, which was no problem. The chair, however, wasn't worth the money. I could have gone to the local Staples (etc.) and purchased a far more comfortable chair for half the price! Not only is it uncomfortable, it clunks and pops when I lean back in it. I am not a heavy person...I weigh 170 lbs. It hurts me to have spent this much money and end up with a product that, quite frankly, sucks. Don't buy this chair. Better to go to Walmart or Target.
