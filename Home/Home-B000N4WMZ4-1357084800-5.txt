review/summary: Quality product and Quality companyreview/text: I have had my pot for six years now and I honestly cook with it 6 out of 7 days a week. I was horrified when I found that a piece of enamel came off (1/2 a dime size) on the interior bottom. I wrote Lodge and they worked quickly to get me a warranty replacement. Not many companies stand by their products anymore. They have won a lifer with me.
