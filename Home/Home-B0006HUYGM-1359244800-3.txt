review/summary: Great Suction, Easy to Cleanreview/text: I used this vacuum for the stairs and in my car and it works great. It picks EVERYTHING up. The best part was cleaning it after its first use. It was very easy and because of the clear plastic on the front, you always know how full the container is so there's no guesswork on whether its time to empty it or not.
