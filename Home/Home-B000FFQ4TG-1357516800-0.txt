review/summary: Great tasting coffeereview/text: I like the water temperature regulating feature (dispensing the optimal 200 degree water for brewing) and also the 6-stream water dispensing head that wets the grounds better. A lady at our local Trader Joe's suggested spraying water on the grounds with a mister before brewing, which I now do for every pot - using a small, $2 mister I found at Walgreen's. It seems to get a little more flavor out of the grounds - probably because the initial dispensed water saturates the grounds earlier/better. I brew about 8 cups daily and after almost two years, have had no problems. I do clean the maker with vinegar about every two-three months (as instructed in the manual), due to the calcium in our local water (even though I use water from an under-the-sink filtering system.)
