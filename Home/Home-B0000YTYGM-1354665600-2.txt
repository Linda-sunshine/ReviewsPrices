review/summary: Terrible and Dangerousreview/text: This Coffee maker is terrible.#1 The Carafe is incredibly finicky and will overflow all over your counter eventually... when you least expect it and start to trust it. It has happened to us 5 times since April.#2 It is incredibly sensitive to mineral buildup. We have had to run vinegar through it ever few months since we bought it.#3 Today it stopped brewing entirely... and then there was a loud POP... which resulted in my 4 year old getting splashed and all the water running out the bottom of the brewer onto the counter.Checking to see if I can get it replaced under warranty after less than a year.Skip this one...UPDATE: Cuisinart will be happy to replace my unit if I will pay exorbitant amounts for shipping both ways... They really know how to take care of their customers.I am writing their CEO:Attn. Phil SchwartzCorp Office150 Milford Rd.East Windsor NJ 08520
