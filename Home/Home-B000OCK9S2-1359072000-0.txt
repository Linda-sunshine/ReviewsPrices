review/summary: Bah! Phooie!review/text: This was a terrible experience.I had mistakenly ordered this product of four in the box when I only wanted one. Unfortunately, when I IMMEDIATELY realized my error, I canceled. However, I was informed that the items were &#34;already on the conveyor belt&#34; and being shipped out to me.It cost me $13 to return it, and there was a 30% restocking fee.Strange company, to say the least.
