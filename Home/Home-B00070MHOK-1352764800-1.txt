review/summary: Easy and fast!review/text: I was skeptical buying this based on the price, but it has been fabulous! It's compact enough for you to pack in your luggage on a trip, but sturdy enough to use regularly. It does need to be filled pretty often. Be careful not to tip it horizontally or the hot water will come dripping out.
