review/summary: Sooooo easy to use!....review/text: Presto has been around for years and I had one in the way back but was a bit afraid to use a pressure cooker. Now...many years later....I bought a new Presto and I don't know why I was ever nervous. This one is so simple and the instructions could not be more clear. I especially wanted it to cook dried beans. Not only are they much cheaper than canned beans they actually taste better. I cannot recommend this product highly enough! I trust Presto because of their longevity (I can remember when they were pretty much the only game in town) and because they are priced competitively. Have no fear......!
