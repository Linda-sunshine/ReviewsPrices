review/summary: Great productreview/text: I had my first Nesco given to me about 10 years ago and after literally hundreds of trays of deer jerky, it just stopped heating though fan still worked, so getting another Nesco was a no brainer, and they upped the power a tad. Have started another season of jerky making for family and friends and it is working flawlessly. I use 12 trays and be it 4 trays or 12, jerky comes out perfect once you know the time it takes which comes thru experience. Great product.
