review/summary: Cold Soup Makerreview/text: This thing is terrible at making ice cream. The bowl is completely frozen and even after 30 minutes (they state needing only 20 min) the contents within are soupy and runny. It should at least be the consistency of soft serve. Every attempt to make ice cream so we could eat it immediately after has resulted in waiting a day for the freezer to actually finish the job. But of course then it's hard ice cream.
