review/summary: This is the second time we are purchasing this coffee makerreview/text: I have concluded that there is not a perfect coffee maker out there. The first one we had of this model shorted out (my husband thinks) after 7 years of daily use. We have a preference for a thermal carafe. At the end of August I purchased a Kitchen Aid, a new model I was sure I would like. It had a removable water tank, thermal carafe, it said 12 cup capacity, looked nice. We kept it for a month and a half until I lost my patience with the dripping every time a cup was poured. I tried holding the pot and pouring right at the cup level and a little higher above the cup,still a drip down the front of the pot and more often than not dripping on the counter top. No way was it a 12 cup pot, it barely held 10 cups.After checking out the ratings on a number of coffee makers with thermal carafes (and not $300) we decided to purchase the same coffee maker we had. We were used to the somewhat tricky lid and even the annoying ding ding ding when the coffee is ready. It makes good coffee pretty fast and the thermal carafe is good capacity and keeps the coffee hot for an extended period of time. I also think the coffee makers with the larger diameter thin plastic lids don't do as good a job of keeping the coffee hot.
