review/summary: Great for Coffee!review/text: I will be using this popper for roasting green coffee beans, and as far as I've tried it, it works great. A few recommendations I have are to use an extension cord to keep the beans from roasting to quickly. Also, use more than the recommended volume. I use about 3/4 cup of beans for a bit extra mass to keep the airflow from blowing out and wasting some of the beans.
