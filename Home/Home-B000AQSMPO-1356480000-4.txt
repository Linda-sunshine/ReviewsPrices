review/summary: Returned it within a few days!!!,review/text: Okay, I received this one cup coffee maker recently and after a few days of use, I returned it. The coffee was so weak and watered down, I was so frustrated. I tried bold and extra bold, different coffee makers, using the smallest amount of coffee option, and it was if I was drinking brown water and when I added the cream, i was hardly able to taste the slightest bit of coffee. I even used two k cups for one cup of coffee and it was still very mild and watered down. I have never been so dissapointed with KeurigB60. I am a Starbucks lady and will continue with my gold level membership and enjoy my frequent free cups of delicious coffee. Nice concept, but alot of work to be done. These companies that measure coffee for the k cups need to revamp their systems, it can't measure up to the coffee houses.
