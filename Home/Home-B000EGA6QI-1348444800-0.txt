review/summary: Connector strippedreview/text: This is just like the other one-star reviews. The blender is great until the plastic connector strips. After that, it is of no use. I might experiment with gluing the motor unit to the detachable blade unit. Then it will be hard to clean, but at least it will be of some use.~ ~ ~I have now fixed the unit and used it for a few months.There is a blade assembly which has a shaft with the blades on one end and a rubber sleeve around the shaft on the other end. The shaft is held in the metal tube that gets inserted into a container for mixing.When the motor assembly and the blade assembly are connected together, the rubber sleeve engages a plastic coupler attached to a shaft connected to the motor. This rubber sleeve and plastic coupler provide the means for connecting the motor shaft and the blade shaft together in a removable fashion.The fix involved first pushing the blade assembly out of the tube by tapping on the end of the shaft opposite the blades using a wooden dowel and a hammer. Then I reversed the rubber sleeve and pressed the assembly back in place.The end of the sleeve that originally fit into the plastic coupler on the motor unit was worn down from slippage. By reversing the rubber sleeve, this placed the unworn end of the sleeve into a position to engage the plastic coupler attached to the shaft of the motor.The slippage happened suddenly and was caused by using the mixer in a narrow container, which apparently somehow increased the load against which the blade pushes. Maybe a sort of suction effect?
