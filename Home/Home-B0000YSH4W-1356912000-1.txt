Well inThe GiverLois Lowry takes you to this world.Everyone has the same colored skin so there is no racism. You don't worry about heart break because your spouse is chosen for you. Can't decide what color shirt to wear well no need everything is the same color. Even if you don't think you are good at anything a job is assigned to you. Physical and mental deficiency from birth? no worry every baby is up to up to par. Don't like today's music no need there is no music. Rude remarks are not tolerated.This book is a great example of how utopias don't work. A utopia is an ideal place with social perfection, but this cannot be achieved. When your job is chosen for you and you can't change it you don't always get something you particularly want. This book follows Jonas and his journey through this utopia.And don't for get this is a trilogy!The Worlds of Lois Lowry 3-Copy Boxed Set (The Giver, Messenger, Gathering Blue)
