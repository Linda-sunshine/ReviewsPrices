review/summary: excellent valuereview/text: we love this iron. even though some have said the water cork breaks off easily, we've not had this problem. I've been careful but not unordinarily so with it. It heats up fast has a good timer for the auto shut off and overall we are really satisfied with the value for money on this item.
