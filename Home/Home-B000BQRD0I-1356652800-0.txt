review/summary: Good for the pricereview/text: You can spend a lot on steamers. This one is perfect for what I was looking for. Produces steam quickly and easily removes common wrinkles. Difficult to press clothes, but if you're just looking to smooth them out, especially fine garmets, I recommend this steamer.
