review/summary: impressivereview/text: this pot is a lifetime purchase. It is heavy and very well made. It is large but if you are using it for canning, you will appreciate the size for the number of jars it will hold. Also for regular pressure cooking - the large size will come in handy for making extra quantities for the freezer or to pass on to others. Love the fact that you don't have rubber or silicone seals to replace regularly.Arrived at my door within a few days with free shipping. Thanks Amazon!
