review/summary: New, but like an old friendreview/text: I have a number of Presto pressure cookers of various sizes, used for both cooking dinner meals and canning. This is a very convenient sized unit, and one that was previously missing from my collection. It works exceptionally well with the DUXTOP 1800-Watt Portable Induction Cooktop Countertop Burner 8100MC, about which I also wrote a review.For anyone with experience using pressure cookers, there's nothing excitingly new about this one, just the same dependability and quality one comes to expect from Presto. For those new to pressure cookers, this would be a good size for a starter unit.With only a minimum of care, these cookers will last for generations, needing only an occasional replacement of the main sealing gasket.
