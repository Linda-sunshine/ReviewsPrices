review/summary: Sad to say goodbyereview/text: I received my late, lamented machine as a gift in December 2010. For the last 21 months it performed like a trooper. No problems with vibrations, dripping, leaking -- I loved it. A couple of months ago, it started dripping from the steaming wand when turned on, and then later, from the portafilter after the brewing was finished but while the steamer was in operation. I could deal with that. But, suddenly this week, it started leaking from the bottom of the machine, flooding the counter with water. I descaled it and there was no leaking during that process. But then while running clean water through it to flush out the descaling solution it flooded the counter again.It was great while it lasted, and I may purchase another one simply because it is the right size for my very small kitchen, but due to its relatively short life span, it's difficult to give a glowing recommendation. Based on my satisfaction with my machine a friend purchased one last December, but after relatively light usage it has started the dripping from the portafilter after the brewing operation has ceased but while the machine is still on for steaming. I fear her machine may not survive as long as mine. Since it is less than a year since the purchase, she may yet get to experience The DeLonghi Warranty Nightmare described by other reviewers.If I had written this review even two months ago, I would have rated the EC155 five stars. However, for breaking my heart, it gets knocked down to three.
