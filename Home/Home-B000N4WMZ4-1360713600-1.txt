review/summary: so far so good!review/text: We recieved this item quickly and in good shape. It is exactly what we wanted. We just purchased this in Dec 2012 and have used it a couple of times and see no signs of cheap manufacture(chipping, heat stress enamel fracturing, etc). We did keep the little rubber lid stands to keep the lid from chipping the enamel while storing. Not much more to say, time will tell if this dutych oven holds up..
