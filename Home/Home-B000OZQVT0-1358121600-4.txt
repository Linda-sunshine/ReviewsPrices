review/summary: Wowreview/text: Looks so nice behind my faux logs and new fire place screen. Nice size cans. I love this product. The ambiance from the flames was awesome and warming. The gel burned evenly and lasted a good length of time and no one could tell they were in cans until I told them. Will re-purchase again. In MY opinion, this is a great product.
