review/summary: Great buy!review/text: I was sort of dubious about buying a juicer; most of the blogs I found online suggested really expensive ones that weren't in my budget. And I'm not planning on going on a cleanse, I just wanted to try juicing as a new way to get in my fruits and veggies. The good reviews of this Breville eventually convinced me to give it a try, and I am really impressed! It isn't really that 'compact', but it fits nicely in one of my lower cabinets, so I'm not worried. It is very user-friendly, and none of the fruits or vegetables I've tried (apples, celery, carrots, limes, lemons etc) have needed to be cut into very small pieces at all. The chute is pretty wide, so I could actually fit a small apple in there if I wanted. Be aware that once it turns on, it is on! So make sure that you're ready with the pusher once you've put your produce in and turned the juicer on. The pulp seems very dry, which is a good sign, and the juicer comes with a handy measuring cup. Cleanup is a little tedious, but I think that is to be expected with any juicer. All in all, I'm a big fan!
