review/summary: What an upgrade!review/text: We have been using an older popper that required oil and had hone of those little metal arms that spun around the bottom of the bowl while heating up the plate. While that still popped the popcorn fine, this new Presto Air Popper is leaps and bounds better. It is so easy to make a bowl of popcorn...Just add 1/2 cup to the hopper, plug in, and in a couple minutes, PRESTO! No oily mess to clean up, just a good rinse and you are done. Popcorn tastes great too.
