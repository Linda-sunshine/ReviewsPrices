review/summary: This is just greatreview/text: Okay let me tell you my wife is Chinese and she knows good rice. I don't know why the heck took us so long to get a rice cooker. This makes all the rice tastes so much better. I used to not be able to tell the difference between rice cooked in microwave or stove top until we have this. (Though we never ever ate instant rice, my wife has too much pride and that's not how rice supposed to be) It seems pricey but if you like rice, you won't regret buying this.
