review/summary: SO FAR, SO GREAT!review/text: Only had this scale about 2-1/2 weeks. Read many reviews of many scales before making this purchase. So far, the scale is living up to what reviewers had to say. It was very easy to set up. Seems to be accurate based on my weight on another person's scale just prior to receiving my own. When I weigh, then wait 5-10 minutes and weigh again, the scale reads the same. When I weigh without tennis shoes and then with my tennis shoes multiple days, the difference in bare feet weight and tennis shoe weight stays the same. The scale looks great in my bathroom, it is a very attractive style. Actually for a scale, I am in love with the way it looks. When I step on the scale I have ample room for standing and the scale feels solid under my feet. The read out is very visible and the digits show up quickly. I did not think that the weight being shown in tenths would be important to me, but now that I have that luxury, I really like it.For the moment, I could not be happier with a new scale. Time will tell as to whether the battery lasts an ample time and whether the readings remain stable.
