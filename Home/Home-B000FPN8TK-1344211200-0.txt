review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I absolutely loved this teapot while it worked, but within just 4 months of receiving it, it now leaks all the water out. I walked by into my kitchen expecting a lovely cup of tea and found instead a huge mess. It had leaked all over my counter. My bread was sogged, my towel stained, my cookbook stained and warped. I am, of course, outside my return time as you only have 30 days. I feel this item is too expensive to be that disposable. Very disappointed in the quality of this product.
