review/summary: Love glass storage bowls but...review/text: I really like glass storage bowls and I am happy with these bowls for the most part. My issue is that one of these bowls had a broken rim just from being stored on the shelf. It was never even used. I washed them and put them on the shelf for storage with the lids on them. One of them was broken when we tried to use it- too late for the return period. Love them otherwise.
