review/summary: How did I go this long without one?review/text: I love to cook and I love collecting kitchen gadgets. I have wanted an immersion blender for a long time. I so hate pureeing soups in a traditional blender. It always makes such a mess. So when I saw this particular model as a lightning deal a few weeks ago, I decided my time had come.It is a beautiful little tool. And I love that the shaft can be removed from the top where the electric components are, and can then be washed in the dishwasher.I decided to christen my new tool by making cream of broccoli soup for the first time in years. I had two heads of broccoli and about 5 potatoes, chunked up and cooked until soft in chicken broth, and when I stuck the immersion blender in to puree it, it made quick, clean work of the task. In no time flat, I had an evenly smooth soup and NO mess. What a miracle!I am quite pleased with my purchase so far.
