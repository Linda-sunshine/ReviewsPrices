review/summary: Doesn't work on all tile surfacesreview/text: I'm sure these work great on flat tiles, but my shower tiles have a bit of an uneven surface to them and the sticky tape doesn't stick to them. I really wish they worked as this would have been a perfect, no-rust option to the typical hanging baskets that go over the shower head, but invariably rust or just end up getting nasty.
