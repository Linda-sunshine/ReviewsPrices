review/summary: not amazingreview/text: It's okay. It's not (NOT) espresso, and the resulting coffee isn't bad, but (compared to something like a basic pour-over system) it's more complicated and fiddly without an appreciable benefit. After a couple years I almost never bother to pull it out of the cupboard.
