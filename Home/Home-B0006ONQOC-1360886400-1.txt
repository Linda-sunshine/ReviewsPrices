review/summary: Qualityreview/text: The quality with any Cuisinat product is always good, they work as promised and last along time. I have used this item in the making of several diferent ice screams and a few sorbets and I have also made a few messes in the process. I like to try new things, change things up a little, in the process I sometimes make a mess. The Cuisinat ice cream maker works flawless and cleans up easily. The only thing that doesn't work as promised is the volume about a quort and a half is all I can make at one time, if I try to make more it runns out the top. Amazon shipping is always fast.
