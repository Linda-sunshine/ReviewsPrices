review/summary: Durabilityreview/text: This thing cooks a perfect Belgian waffle every time. Me and my wife used one that my mother gave us for the longest time, until we got this, and man we aren't looking back.The teflon on this thing make it a breeze to clean. Even after overfilling the maker it is a snap to clean up. Just grab a clean cloth/paper towel and wipe it off.It doesn't take very long to heat up either.
