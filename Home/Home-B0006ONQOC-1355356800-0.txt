review/summary: Great little ice cream makerreview/text: My husband and I received this ice cream maker as a wedding gift and it is pretty great. We have used it twice now. The first time the ice cream came out creamy and smooth and was delicious. The second time it was rather icy but I think was due to a low-fat recipe and nothing to do with the ice cream maker itself. It is rather loud, but as long as you freeze the bowl long enough ahead of time it doesn't take very long to make the ice cream. We are very please with this product. Just be careful not to overfill or you may have ice cream coming out the top as it churns!
