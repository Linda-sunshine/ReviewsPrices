review/summary: Not For Greens - Not for Mereview/text: This unit is a spinning centrifugal type so it just shoots greens out the waste unless you do some fancy footwork to get them to work. I moved onto the OMEGA and love love love that one mucho better than this. Also it does not add oxygen to your foods like centrifugal juicers do.
