review/summary: An honest reviewreview/text: I have had many juicers, the TV name brands, expensive ones off craigslist etc. Juicers, because of their mechanical high speed output only last a year or two, if you use it regularly. To buy a $300.00 juicer is not worth it. This is not an appliance like a refrigerator that lasts 10 years. So your first heads up is price. Anything nearing the $100 dollar range or more is a no no. This juicer's price is right on. In fact if they added $25 to it it would still be a bargain. When's the last time you heard that about anything? Next performance, this juicer performs the same as a $300 dollar one I bought off craigslist, end result: juice. Lastly: cleaning, cleaning any juicer is a pain, but some are less painful than others, you found it. There is no tricky compartments or hard to connect parts. This is a clean well designed machine that is efficient and cost effective. Here are some tips with juicing just so you know what juicing is about. Don't buy a juicer to make a glass of apple juice, this is not their mission. View a juicer as a tool you use to ingest things your body and your mouth don't regularly see. In fact I have given up juicing fruit altogether. Why? I love the way it tastes, why juice it? Just eat it. Here is my morning juice: half a beet, head of kale, 3 carrots, half of cucumber. My mornings start with more nutrients than some people see in a week. Because your body won't be craving nutrients it does not get from a fast food cheeseburger, you will begin to lose weight. I used to take pills for my knee pain, gone. It costs about $20.00 a week to juice. This machine is built solid, works great and is priced at a bargain. Tip: make the juicer the closet appliance to your sink. Any juicer, regardless of brand is messy. If you decide to buy a juicer this is simply the one.
