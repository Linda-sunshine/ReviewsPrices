review/summary: So much easier than a tea ballreview/text: This is the 2nd one I've bought - we use the 1st one so frequently that it will be nice to have a second so that we can make more than one cup at a time. Yes, we have a teapot for large batches of one kind of tea, but I like to use this for when I only want one cup or when we don't all agree on the same kind of tea.Toss in some leaves, pour in your boiling water, and when it's steeped, set it on your cup. Rinses out easily, and for thorough washing it's also very simple. SO much easier than a tea ball. The filter at the bottom pops out easily for cleaning but not when you don't want it to. Couldn't be simpler.
