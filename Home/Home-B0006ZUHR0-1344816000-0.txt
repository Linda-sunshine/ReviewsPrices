review/summary: Was skeptical but love it!review/text: I have to say I was VERY skeptical of how well this iron would work based on the low price, but boy was I wrong! I LOVE this iron!! I was disappointed when my old iron died and was expecting to shell out more than $100 for a Rawenta, but upon reading Rawenta reviews versus this iron's reviews my opinion changed. The iron heats up very quickly and is easy to program the different heat settings. I was extremely impressed with how well it actually irons and smooths out wrinkles - a job well done. The cord is pretty long, so I had no issues with that at all. I haven't experienced any trouble with the lid to the water compartment coming off, but I have only used this a few times. In summary, I would highly recommend this iron!
