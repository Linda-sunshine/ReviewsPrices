review/summary: prettty damn goodreview/text: This is my first juicer and it works very well. Fantastic in fact. 2 things i would change to make it better is a longer power cord (its very short like 2 feet) and while the jug does a very good job at removing foam when pouring, it would great if it could successfully remove a little more. Right now gets like 85-90% of the foam out but would be nice if it did like 95 or 100% of foam out. I mean this is really knit picking at details but overall great juicer.
