review/summary: After first use, VERY HAPPY!review/text: I bought this cleaner based on all the positive reviews and tried it out for the first time tonight. Our light tan carpets were filthy due to two kids and a dog. The last couple times I have cleaned the carpets I got one of the big rental units, but decided it would be better to own a machine I could have around for more frequent cleanings. Upon putting the Hoover together, it seems very well built for the price point. It is not a light machine for sure, but that most likely means the motor is beefy since plastic is certainly not heavy. Even with its heft it's still way more convenient to move around than the rental units.I was short on time tonight, so I did 1/2 the living room and two bedrooms. I can honestly say that it works every bit as good as the big rental cleaner. There are some small spots that didn't completely come out, and probably would have if I pretreated, but I'm too lazy for that. A vast majority of the spots and stains just disappeared. Even though we have the expensive yellow vacuum from England (which does a great job) and we use it at least weekly, the Hoover dump water was completely black. It was pulling up junk a dry vac just simply cant.Based on my initial use of this cleaner I would definitely recommend it to others. I cant wait to try out the attachments on the stairs and see how they work. If they are half as good as the main unit I will be thrilled!
