review/summary: Isn't easy to cleanreview/text: For the amount of money I paid, I would have expected it to be easier to clean. Also, I have to unlock the top, unlock the base then lift the thing every time I need to empty it out. It doesn't seem like a big deal until you have to chop a container of mushrooms and you have to empty it out twice and then the final wash. The blades are super sharp, make sure you keep them away from your kids, especially since it doesn't have any kind of storage unit with it. I like that it has a lot of different blades and I'm hoping I'll be able to use all of them. The directions were kind of confusing for the julienne and slicing blades, it wasn't making sense that I needed to turn the container upside down. Overall, a good food processor that works well, it's my first but I wonder if the cheaper ones are a cheaper because they are a better price or because they are just plain cheap.
