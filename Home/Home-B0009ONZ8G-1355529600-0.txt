review/summary: Three years old and going strong!review/text: I've been through many vacuum cleaners, most of which have failed within the first year. I've had this Hoover for three years and it's still just as good as the day I bought it. I've never had to replace the belt and the suction is still amazing. I have two little boys, and this Hoover has sucked up its share of Legos and cracker crumbs. It was easy to put together and replacing the bags is a snap. And what a great price. I couldn't be happier.
