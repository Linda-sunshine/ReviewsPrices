review/summary: Finally a non plastic kettlereview/text: As most here, I was looking specifically for non plastic kettle due to chemicals and smell. This kettle is great but there some cons to consider:- Small volume (4 cups of tea at most, depending on your cups, but no way 8 cups as listed)- Kettle mouth (tacky design, the water will poor all over sides and around the filter inside, you have to poor the water slowly)
