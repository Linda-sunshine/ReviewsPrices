review/summary: Great little coffeemaker!review/text: This is the second one I bought. I love this little coffeemaker. It comes with a reusable filter which saves money. It makes coffee fast, around a minute for each cup. My only complaint is I wish they made the entire thing out of stainless steel- I would gladly pay more for the upgraded value. The coffeemaker is made out of plastic so I'm not sure how long it will last. I've had mine for a year now and it hasn't broke yet, but you never know. Regardless, it is worth the price and keeps impatient coffee drinkers happy in my house!
