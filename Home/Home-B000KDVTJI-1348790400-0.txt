review/summary: DANGEROUS MERCHANDISEreview/text: I ORDERED THIS KETTLE FOR THE HEALTH CLINIC IN ONE OF THE SMALL VILLAGES WHERE I OCCASIONALLY WORK. I AM HERE THIS WEEK AND FOUND OUT THAT THIS KETTLE LEAKS BADLY FROM ITS BASE MAKING IT A POTENTIAL ELECTRICAL HAZARD. THIS IS THE THIRD SUCH KETTLE THAT I HAVE OWNED. THE OTHER TWO (ONE IN MY HOME AND THE OTHER AT MY MAIN OFFICE) ARE WORKING QUITE WELL - NO LEAKS, ETC. I DID NOTE THAT THE TAB WHICH YOU PUSH DOWN TO HEAT THE WATER IS OF A MUCH THINNER PLASTIC. THIS CAUSES ME TO THINK THAT PERHAPS THE COMPANY IS CUTTING CORNERS ON QUALITY - NOT A GOOD IDEA. I WOULD LIKE AMAZON TO INVESTIGATE THIS.
