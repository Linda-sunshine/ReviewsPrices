review/summary: Great Set!review/text: This is a great set for my husbands lunches! I bought two paying $14/ea and free shipping. The small round bowls are perfect for a dip or sauce when serving appetizers which I made this weekend for my family. They are durable, stack nicely, and hopefully will be around for a long time to come providing my husband or 3 kids don't break or chip them. The other sets out there seem to be priced a little bit higher so for the money this was the best buy for us to use for work lunches. Price here on Amazon was less than Walmart! Ordered these on a Friday and the arrived in perfect condition Tuesday. No missing lids or cracked or chipped pieces. Packaging seemed to work perfectly! Great Buy and love this set!
