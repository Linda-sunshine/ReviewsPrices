review/summary: Not memory foamreview/text: We bought one of these toppers in December of 2011 and LOVED it! We just bought another one and it is not the same quality. We took it out of the box, left it for 24 hours and it had no memory foam capability. We are returning and looking for a new memory foam topper, so disappointing. Based on some other reviews of recent, I have to agree that they have reduced the quality of their product and it is not up to par. I do have to say though, Amazon is awesome about their return policy!
