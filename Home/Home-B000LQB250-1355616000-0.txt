review/summary: We'll fight our in-laws for it.review/text: Originally, we got this to put on a 40-year-old mattress in our basement so my in-laws could sleep in better-than-air-mattress comfort and I wouldn't have to give up, you know, access to the master bath. I'm selfish like that. Then, after they left (&#34;Give it a chance,&#34; said my father-in-law; my mother-in-law just gave me the mystical, &#34;You didn't have to do that.&#34;), we moved it up to our 10-year-old mattress (with access to master bath). For the first couple of nights, we were uncertain. Now, though, we love it, and the next time my in-laws come to town, I guess it's back to the air mattress for them.
