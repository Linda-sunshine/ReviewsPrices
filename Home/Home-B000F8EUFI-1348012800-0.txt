review/summary: This machine is uselessreview/text: I purchased the Dirt Devil based on the favorable comments but after only one use, I find that it does nothing but spread the surface dirt around and create more of a mess than when I started. No debris goes into the cannister and as far as I can tell, the only debris being picked up is that which gets caught in the brushes.Do not waste your money.
