review/summary: JUICER with MIGHTreview/text: So I bought this juicer after watching the Movie Fat Sick and Nearly Dead (Its not often that one gets movies named after his life story). All the same the juicer was well packaged and was easy to assemble.At first it appears to be light duty due to its plasticky feel, but do not be fooled folks, this machine isa work horse. I rummages through apples, carrots, collards, lemons, etc without breaking an electric sweat.Simply put, it does the job as advertized.The cleanup is pretty straight forward, due to its plastic composure, its easy to rinse through after use.I would have given it 6 stars if I could, but perhaps next time.I highly recommend it for anyone looking to enter the juicing lifestyle.Oh, did I mention that its priced to sell? Check it out You won't be disappointed
