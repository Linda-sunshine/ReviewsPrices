review/summary: Great!review/text: I recently live in Barcelona and they served basically espresso for coffee. I loved it so much that when I cam home to America ours just couldn't cut it so I bought this stove top espresso maker. It's affordable and makes great espresso, I just wish I got the bigger size, since it doesn't make much, but not bad for one person.
