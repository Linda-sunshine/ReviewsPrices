review/summary: Cheap and sufficient for a household of 2review/text: We have a smaller fridge, so I purchased this slim model over the other Brita pitchers. Also, it was so cheap I felt there was little risk in the case that I wanted to upgrade to a nicer or bigger model later. After 7 months of use, I have zero complaints. It looks nice and for two people holds enough for two people to re-fill once daily or every other day. Water tastes as good as any previous pitchers we've used. The Brita Slim Pitcher is definitely worth the price, and is optimal for those who do not have a full sized fridge or do not want a huge pitcher taking up so much space inside.
