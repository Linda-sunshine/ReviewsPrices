review/summary: Great Bedreview/text: Previously I had purchased a Queen sized Aerobed... but these are WAY better. This was the size of a real bed!!! They DID lose a bit of air overnight, but these filled up quickly and did very well. I bought THREE of these, so I was very happy with these purchases. Our guests even thought they were the most comfortable beds they ever slept on. You can actually SIT on the side of the bed, then get up. The aerobed, you have to roll off onto the floor then get up. I think I am going to replace that one too!
