review/summary: Excellent product.review/text: I like good coffee, but haven't ever spent much on making it myself. This is just as fast as instant, and tastes better than drive-through espresso. Using Costco fine ground (the huge tin they sell for $12), this makes the best cup of coffee I've ever been able to make.
