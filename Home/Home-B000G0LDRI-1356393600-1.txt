review/summary: Terrible!!!! It runs like the energizer Bunny!!!! NON STOP!!!!review/text: This unit worked great for the first week. Don't get me wrong. The Humidifier Runs and Runs And Runs............ When I first put it into the room I wanted to stay at 65% humidity it ran for about 1.5 hours and that was it. The unit shut off. Bing,Bang,Boom!!!! Great just what I was looking for!!!! After a week I noticed that it never stops running!!!! The room is not reaching the humidity level that I need (65%). I have a control panel that regulates the operation and I have gauges that read the relative humidity. So there is no mistake!!! This unit for some reason is not pumping out the moisture that it did the first week. It worked so great, that I thought it may have been a little over kill???? Not any more. I also noticed that I do not need too add water as often. The unit runs and the fan is on ?????? I do not reccomend this. The wick may need to be changed???? That is all I can think of but it is brand new. Even with muddy swamp water I would expect this operate for a week. I use Spring water, so if the wick is shot in only one week???? Give me a break!!!! So I got my room to 65% humidity in 1.5 hrs. All things remain constant and now it just runs all day and does not acheive that level of humidity. It does not make sense... I am very upset with this unit.Not sure if I can return it now? If possible I will. Good Luck.
