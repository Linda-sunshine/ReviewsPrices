review/summary: I love it!review/text: I read several reviews of different ones but this one got the best results, yet even this one had less than 5 star reviews because people say it doesn't get hot enough. Well trust me it does. It's hot enough that you can't leave your finger on it for more than a second. I pour myself a cup of coffee, add cold creamer and it will stay that temperature for at least an hour and a half. It's perfect. It's not meant to heat up a cold product but it does a great job of keeping your perfect temperature cup of tea or coffee.
