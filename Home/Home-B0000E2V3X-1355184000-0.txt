review/summary: Great surfacereview/text: I love this as a pizza cooker, a cookie pan, a stovetop griddle for non rendering items.Just say no to chemical treatments on non stick pans, get yourself and your friends a few sizes of cast iron and have pans that you can pass down to your children, without all those unknown chemicals that are such a part of pans for the last few decades.
