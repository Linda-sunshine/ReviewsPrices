review/summary: Just the specs we wanted, but it leaks.review/text: UPDATE 12/31/12: "Leak" is an understatement. This kettle POURS water from the bottom under the handle; we've tried all kinds of different tricks because we like the specs. Oh well, I'm giving up and returning it today.I'm hoping that it's user error, but the kettle leaks (a lot). I'll contact the seller to see what my options are. We used to have a cheap one, and while it wasn't as attractive, I didn't have the same safety concerns.
