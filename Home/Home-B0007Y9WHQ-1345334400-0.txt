review/summary: Not just for raw foodies. The best addition to my kitchen in a long timereview/text: I bought this particular spiralizer on the recommendation of several raw foodies I know, and the feedback in a couple of recipe books where products are recommended. The stainless steel version of this product is used in may favorite raw-food restaurant, but the owner told me this is the one she's had in her personal kitchen forever. That seemed like a good recommendation to me.I'd been debating whether to get this or a mandolin and decided that while it's a pain to try and thin slice things, I can do that on my own, but the long curly strips I can't do. I think I made the right choice (though a mandolin is still on my wishlist.) This particular spiralizer is really easy to use, cleans up very easily and quickly and has the option of three different blades for cutting. I like that.It has been an amazing addition to our kitchen, really jazzing up food prep, and making tasty recipes look out-of-this-world as well as taste good. After years of slicing veggies into tiny strips for various dishes, to be able to spin out a bowl of zucchini "noodles" or spiralize a cuke or carrot is amazing. Really makes me smile every time I use it. I've found that it provides new and pretty ways to slice ingredients to add to a salad, and for making skinny curls of seasoned sweet potato fried (oven baked) it's been great -- the best addition to my kitchen since I married my husband.
