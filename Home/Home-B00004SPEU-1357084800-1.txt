review/summary: Awesome grinder!!review/text: I have used this daily for a few months now and it works great! It can turn a whole pot's worth of beans into powder in seconds. The powder is pretty fine (more so than when you purchase coffee grounds) and helps to really milk the coffee for full flavor. It is loud as they all are, but I am not sure much can be done about the noise of a coffee grinder... lol
