review/summary: Small but does the jobreview/text: I was happy with the looks and size of the kettle, but it seems to take longer that I thought to to boil. I am comparing it to one that I used in France, it would heat up in a flash. But, from what I heard the electric current is stronger over in Europe and that is why it heats up faster.It does the job and I am please with it and the price is very good for what you get. I would recommend it.
