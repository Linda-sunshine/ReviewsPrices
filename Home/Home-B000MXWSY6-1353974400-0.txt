review/summary: Snooze or Off: Goodluckreview/text: I hate this thing. The off button is located so close to the snooze, if you are a snoozer, you will probably mistakenly turn the alarm off if you aren't careful and you will be late for work. This is a major design flaw. I would recommend RCA clock radios.
