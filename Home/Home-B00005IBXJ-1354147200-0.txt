review/summary: So much more than a pizza cookerreview/text: We have had ours for nearly 10 years and use it constantly. We use it for nearly all of our leftovers. French fries & breaded chicken, pop back up to nearly fresh from the fryer condition. We will put left over hamburgers on there without the top bun. Just heat it up & a minute or two before serving, throw the top bun on by itself to heat. My husband has even made nachos on there. It's without doubt my favorite small appliance!
