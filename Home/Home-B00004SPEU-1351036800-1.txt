review/summary: Best Of Its Kindreview/text: This is the second KRUPS 203-42 that I've owned in 25 years. The first unit lasted for 23 years of daily use. I use this tool to grind coffee beans to any consistency desired. It's quick to grind all types of beans and is a snap to clean. Over the years, I've learned that the best way to keep the coffee grind consistent is to fill the stainless steel hopper to the top of the reservoir, only. For me, a three second grind (while shaking the 203-42) yields a coarse texture that's perfect for French Press coffee makers or drip-type machines. I would not hesitate to recommend highly this grinder for its intended purpose and design.A side note: A family member purchased the KRUPS GVX Burr Grinder two years ago as a replacement gift for my first 203-42. In theory, the concept of the Burr Grinder is great! Simply add coffee beans; set the grind coarseness; choose the number of cups of coffee desired; press the power button and walk away until processed. The problem with this unit is that it does not perform at all in the expected manner. The grind is always too fine; the quantity of ground of coffee is wasteful and copious for the desired number of cups; and the GVX is monumentally mess. Moreover, unless the top and grind basin are carefully engaged to trip the safety nodes, the unit will not operate. In my opinion, the 203-42 is a far superior product for grinding coffee beans.
