review/summary: Excellent purchase!review/text: I bought this and had it shipped to my son's house so that I could sleep on it during my Christmas visit. I've slept on air mattresses before, so I was prepared for 1) morning backache and 2) pumping it full again every morning. To my surprise and delight, neither has happened. This is the most comfortable mattress (air or otherwise) I have ever slept on, and I'm 65 years old. I'm actually considering purchasing another one for my home and replacing my Serta with it. One suggestion - be sure to purchase king size sheets if you don't have them already because the bed is quite high and you need a king fitted to cover the entire mattress.Look no further - this is the one you want.
