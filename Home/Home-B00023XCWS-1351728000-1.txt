review/summary: LOVE THIS THING!!!review/text: I drink tea every day for dinner and before bed. I also make my son's oatmeal/grits in the morning for breakfast.This kettle boils up to 6 cups of water in less than 5 minutes.And that "plastic" taste/smell? It went away after three full uses (filled up to max line, let it boil, dumped, repeated 3 times).I have a metal stove kettle, that took FOREVER to heat up even 2 cups of water...WHY did I not get one of these sooner??
