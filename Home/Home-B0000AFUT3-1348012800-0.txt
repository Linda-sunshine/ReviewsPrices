review/summary: Wanted to Love it -- But Very Disappointedreview/text: When I was looking for a makeup mirror and came across the Jerdon Tri-fold, I was so excited as I had a very similar model that I loved many years ago. Although I never used the different light levels, preferring just the brightest lights, I really liked the fact that it also had an additional outlet for a curling iron or rollers along with the large tri-fold.But, that's where the excitement ended. I used the mirror the next morning, did not have nearly enough light even with additional lamp light to complete my makeup. I finally went back to the bathroom mirror to finish my makeup. I tried again the next morning checking my makeup in the bathroom mirror when I was done and I actually looked like a clown. The light was totally off, and gave a very different picture from the makeup mirror to the bathroom mirror.I cannot use this mirror, and I cannot return it without the packaging. I'll donate it and try out the next makeup mirror BEFORE I buy it. Sadly, this one is not for me.
