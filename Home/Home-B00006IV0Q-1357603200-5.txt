review/summary: Sturdy and heavyreview/text: Makes great coffee. The spout is designed well; it keeps coffee from being spilled when pouring.The inside of the pot doesn't collect coffee stains like most pots do.I started off getting the smaller pot and then immediately ordered the 12 cup pot.One more thing, you can actually see where the line for water is.I threw out the two faberware coffee pots out, both of the heating elements went out. I understand that unscrewing the bottom and putting a piece of aluminum between the heat sensor will fix the problem.But I was so over it, Faberware used to make a coffee pot that always heated even after I had it almost 20 years.
