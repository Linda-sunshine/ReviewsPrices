review/summary: As good as previous oreck xlreview/text: Very pleased with this vacuum. Had an oreck xl 10 years ago that finally died and which did a great job. In between , we've had a Eureka 4870MZ Boss Smart-Vac Upright HEPA Vacuum Cleaner, and a Hoover Windtunnel, both of which continually broke belts and various plastic parts and consumed many bags and have since gone out with the trash. This Dirt Devil is excellent, and cleans up massive amounts of dog hair on visually clean carpets, and the lack of having to deal with bags is a bonus as well. Very powerful suction and light as well. Hopefully it is durable as well (had for only a few months so far).Definitely recommended over anything I've found lately, and probably as effective as an oreck without the cost of belts and bags.
