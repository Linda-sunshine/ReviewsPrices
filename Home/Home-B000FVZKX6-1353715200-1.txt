review/summary: sizing smell is strongreview/text: I bought Queen CREAM Pinzon sheets. They are wonderfully soft but sizing smell was really strong when I opened the package. I washed sheets 6 times in cold water on delicate cycle. It took 3 times with 1 cup vinegar for each wash cycle and 3 times with a small box of baking soda for each wash cycle for the sizing smell to come out---and there's still a faint smell on the sheets.
