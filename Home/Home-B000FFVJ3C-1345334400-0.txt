review/summary: A great dehydratorreview/text: I've been using the Nesco FD-75PR 700-watt dehydrator for over a year now and am very happy with it. The only down side I've found is that it doesn't have a switch and I have to pull the plug to turn it off but that is a small detail. I mainly use the Nesco to dry fruits such as apples and bananas. It usually takes about 6-7 hours to dry apples although I often leave them in for 8-9 hours just to make sure they are good and dry. The fan does an excellent job of drawing out the moisture and I don't have to rotate the trays like I used to do on my older dehydrator. There's also a selector to determine the temperature so you can customize the dehydrator for different types of foods.
