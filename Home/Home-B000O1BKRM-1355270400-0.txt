review/summary: Just what I needed!review/text: This ice cube tray makes large, dense (no bubbles), cubic ice cubes that are easy to remove individually from the tray. They last much longer than ice cubes from other trays I've had. I have had no issues of flavor transfer from the silicone to the cubes, and am very happy overall with the product. The cubes are easy to remove individually without dumping out the whole tray. I could see how people would be annoyed when trying to get all the cubes out at once. In that case, you should probably get a hard-plastic tray.
