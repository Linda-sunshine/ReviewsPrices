review/summary: Nicereview/text: It has digital options for everything; wool, cotton, acrylic etc... Then, it is safe if you apply them. But be careful, ones I used cotton adjustment instead of cotton-blend for my t-shirt and it stuck. Trust on &#34;its&#34; adjustments, instead of &#34;yours&#34;.
