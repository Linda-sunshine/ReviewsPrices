review/summary: Best Blade Grinder Next to a Burrreview/text: This is the next best thing to a Burr Grinder. If you don't want to pay for or can't afford to get a burr grinder this little gem is the next best thing. I have had this grinder for almost 4 years. I use it religiously every day, twice a day on weekends and more during holidays and when family is visiting and it's still performing at the same level it did on the day I bought it. It will blade grind your coffee to a nice fine grind and is the closest to a burr grind you will find in a blade unit. It doesn't have settings so you really have to rely on the amount of time you depress the switch to get the type of grind you want, longer for finer and shorter for coarser. If you're looking for a quality, affordable blade grinder I highly recommend this unit.
