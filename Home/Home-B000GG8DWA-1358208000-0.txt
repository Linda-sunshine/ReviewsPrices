review/summary: uselessreview/text: I don't understand why this unit has so many good reviews. I set it to 800w and put it in a 15x6 bathroom. Both heat bars were glowing red, but when I checked two hours later, it was still chilly in the bathroom. With my hand two feet in front of the unit, I could barely feel any warmth. If you need heat, there is no point in plugging this thing in.
