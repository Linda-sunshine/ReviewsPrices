review/summary: Died after 1 usereview/text: Disappointed. While there are many reviews that show this product didn't work for long, I didn't imagine that the second time we tried to use it - no luck. The motor burned out. Amazon provided a refund. Sadly, I have not had luck with Cuisinart coffee products. The mill worked great the first time, too bad. On the hunt for a more reliable replacement!
