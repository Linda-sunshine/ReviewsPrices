review/summary: plastic tastereview/text: I bought this to make tea at work. It heats water quickly and turns off when the water boils. This is a nice safety feature if you don't babysit the tea kettle-but you will have to babysit this kettle if you don't want the kettle to flavor your water with plastic.Another bummer about this product is the ear on the plastic screen that strains the water when poured broke on first use. Now my kettle splashes water if I try to pour too quickly.This tea Kettle might get donated to the work lunch room. My next tea kettle will be metal with a detachable base rather than detachable cord. YGWYPF.
