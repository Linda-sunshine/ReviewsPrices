review/summary: Best i have ever usedreview/text: This thermos rocks. I have an hour commute to work and was using those disposable coffee cups that while convenient, did not keep my drink hot for long. I'm not an all-day long coffee drinker, i have one cup a day but i love my one cup. Prior to using this mug my drink would be lukewarm at best by the time i got to my car. Not anymore. I prep this mug by pouring boiling water into it before i go to bed. Since i use a keurig brewer, i have to brew into a measuring cup and pour into the mug as it is too tall to fit under my keurig.I have never had this mug leak and i do transport it in my handbag. My coffee stays hot and fresh through my commute. The spout is comfortable to drink from. Cleaning takes a few minutes at the end of the day. I am extremely happy with this Thermos.
