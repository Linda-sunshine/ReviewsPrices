review/summary: literally sucksreview/text: I bought this to use cleaning out my car. Used it once and it didn't work worth a darn. performed just like most handheld vacs I've owned, a waste of money. Back to using my big vac. Have put the hand held vac in the storage shed and will give it to anyone who wants it. Don't believe all the reviews that say it is rated real high.
