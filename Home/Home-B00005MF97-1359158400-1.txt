review/summary: Alas, this one was a disappointment!review/text: Took me a while to get around to writing this review. I use this machine sparingly for the fact that it does not chop evenly, forget fine chopping. Typical use includes chopping vegetables or nuts, sometimes fresh ginger. Te stainless steel blade was moderately sharp and the 150-watt motor could not chop dates!!! Finally, the shaft under the blade comes off, unbalancing the assembly which now won't work until correctly reassembled. As a result of all this, the machine sits at the back of the drawer. I wish I didn't buy this product.
