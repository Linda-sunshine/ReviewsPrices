review/summary: Excellentreview/text: I just received this dehumidifier yesterday. Plugged it in in my bedroom last night. Accumulated about 1.5&#34; of water in the reservoir overnight. Working better than I hoped!. For $45, it's an excellent value. No, it isn't a super-duper, make your air like the desert dehumidifier, but it definitely sucks some moisture out. Couldn't possibly ask for more for the price. Oh yeah.....it's pretty quiet. No problems sleeping with it next to the bed.
