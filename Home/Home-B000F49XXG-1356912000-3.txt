review/summary: Works great for a basic espresso machinereview/text: I am making espresso and cappuccino a few times a day with this machine and overall it works very well. Water heats up fast and plenty of steam is available for foaming milk. Very easy to clean up. The only drawbacks I see with this unit is that you can;t use tall cups with it .... even a 2 oz shot glass will not fit under the dispensor without first removing the drain grate, I would really like to see this unit with an ajustable height (or at least higher). Also the angle of the steamer can't be adjusted at all (it only swings out and back in) but that is not a big deal since you can always alter the angle of the pitcher.Overall, for the price, I would buy this unit again.
