review/summary: ease of usereview/text: Small kitchen. I have always preferred opening cans on my counter, rather than hanging them on an electric can opener. My hands, at 67, are becoming weaker. This Zyliss is easy to grip and turn. Also, it is no heaver than other manual openers with coated/covered handles. Very pleased.
