review/summary: It's been goodreview/text: It lasted a year until I discovered the flow of water or the bump's pressure just gave up, it was still under warranty so the local store from the De'Longhi's list of local service providers took it in and fixed it at no charge, then a repairman on my way out told me that with this machine I should make sure the coffee grounds are fine and not pressed too hard or the machine starts to lose it's power to push hot water through it. It's been a good investment so far, the water is plenty hot & the shots have beautiful crema.
