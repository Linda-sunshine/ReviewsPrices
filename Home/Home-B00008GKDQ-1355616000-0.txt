review/summary: Better than sliced breadreview/text: I wanted something that I could use on my gas cooktop inside as well as on my grill outside. This is it! Opened the box and washed with water only and dried. I wiped it down with olive oil on both sides. I first cooked bacon with it. after that I cooked eggs. Ever since it's been a better non-stick surface than any teflon pan I've ever used. (Several years ago I threw away all my non-stick pans.) I found clean-up to get VERY easy after the 2nd and 3rd use. I made fried eggs this AM. My wife didn't see how I cooked them and told me they were the best she's ever had. These were followed by pancakes. I made 4 at a time. Food just seems to taste better when cooked on this. I'm thrilled with this product and find it to be a great value at $38.
