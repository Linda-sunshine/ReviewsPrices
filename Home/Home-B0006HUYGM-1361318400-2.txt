review/summary: Excellent little vacuumreview/text: I bought this for my carpeted stairs. The central vac is too much to pull out every time the stairs need a quick vacuum. This little guy has plenty of suction ( I was amazed how much dust and cat hair were in the cup after my first use)! It is not too noisy. Light weight easy to maneuver. Long power cord. All around fabulous love it!
