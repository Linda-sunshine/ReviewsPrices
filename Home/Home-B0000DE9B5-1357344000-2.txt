review/summary: Love it!review/text: I bought 2 of these jugs because I'm reducing the quantity of soda I drink and making natural lemonade and herbal teas (organic), so I wanted a glass jug. I was at first reluctant to buy because of the reviews from folks saying the lid didn't fit and that it dripped. But I did see other reviews explaining how to use the lid.The others were right. The lids are very easy to use. You hold the outer rim and turn the inner handle and they fit tightly and do not drip. You just have to know how to use them, and it really isn't complicated at all. You do remove the lid to pour, but is that really an issue?The glass handle is not a problem for me at all and I was able to hold it and pour my beverage without dripping or spilling. Do not listen to the naysayers, this item is well worth the money. Boppy says buy!
