review/summary: Machine is Ok If You Don't Mind Cleaning Up the Messreview/text: The Big Mouth Juice Extractor does what it's supposed to (extract juice from the pulp). There is a lot of foam produced on top of the juice. So use a spoon to scoop it out your cup before drinking the juice. So it performs well so what is the problem? The thing is I rarely use it. The strainer requires patience to clean. It's like one of those appliances from the 1990's you buy and use a couple of times then it sits around until you give it away. Don't get me wrong, it is a wonderful product provided you like cleaning it thoroughly every day you use it. That gets repetitive though.
