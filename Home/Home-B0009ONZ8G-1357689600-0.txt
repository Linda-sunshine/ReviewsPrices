review/summary: Replacement new vacuum cleaner.review/text: Our prior Hoover vacuum cleaner was a very much older model and was no longer doing a good job cleaning our carpets and rugs and had never done a good job on our floors. The Hoover Tempo Widepath is doing an excellent job on our carpets, rugs and bare floors!
