review/summary: It Leaked!review/text: The first time I used it, it worked great. My son's chocolate milk stayed very cold. The next day, the chocolate milk was all over my bag. It had leaked out of the the lid where it screws on. My husband said the gasket must be faulty. Very disappointing after only one use! This had potential.
