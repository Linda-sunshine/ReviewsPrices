review/summary: Was Great Until...review/text: We bought this pot and loved it! It was the best thing for making our daily pitcher of tea. How dissapointing that less then 2 months it started leaking from the base.Walked in the kitchen and wet tea was pouring off my countertop. And we cant get anyone to do anything about it. So Sad! :-(
