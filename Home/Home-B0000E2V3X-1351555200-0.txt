review/summary: Not much to add... it is GREAT!review/text: I had been trying to decide between a pizza stone and the Lodge Pro pizza pan, and I am glad I went with Lodge Pro. I've made about 5 pizzas on it in the week I've had it, and they seem to be improving each time.I'm having the best results so far by preheating the pan, throwing down some semolina flour and then the rolled out dough, letting it cook for awhile and then adding sauce + toppings.As pretty much everyone else before me has said... buy this pan!
