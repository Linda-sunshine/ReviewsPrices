review/summary: Super effective but heavyreview/text: This hand held vacuum is incredibly effective! I knew that it would be heavy from reading other reviews but I was using a vacuum before that was very lightweight and not very effective. The extra weight is worth it for the great job it does. I have pets and vacuuming furniture and stairs is a frequent hassle. The Eureka does a great job on pet hair.
