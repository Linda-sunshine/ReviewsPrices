review/summary: Great Low Light Alarm Clock!review/text: I purchased this clock because I wanted to be able to adjust the brightness level and I wasn't disappointed. I like a totally dark bedroom and putting this clock on the lowest brightness level works perfect! Very easy to set up and keeps accurate time, the clock's radio has great reception as well.
