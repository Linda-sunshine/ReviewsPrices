review/summary: So Far So Goodreview/text: Very good hand blender. Easy to use and clean up. I had to learn to to immersion blend at first. You don't just cram down on the items being blended. There needs to be a little room so that the suction draws material up into the blades and allows for the material to circulate around. That was operator error on my part. The product itself blends very quickly and thoroughly. Very smooth smoothies.
