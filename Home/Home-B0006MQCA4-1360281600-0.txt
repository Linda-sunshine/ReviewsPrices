review/summary: Absolutely love this filter and shipping is quick as lightning!review/text: I've purchase this water filter twice now, one for my family and the second one as a gift for my mom. We definitely love this product and I highly recommend it. We've had it for almost a year now and never had any problems with it. All you have to do is just refill it every now and then. It definitely changes the taste of tap water here in Phoenix. This product saves us a lot of time and money.
