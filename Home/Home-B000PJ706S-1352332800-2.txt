review/summary: Don't buy. Had TWO, auto-shutoff failed on both. Company not helpful.review/text: This kettle LOOKS beautiful. I really wanted it to work. The first one I had, the auto-shutoff stopped working after a few weeks. Sometimes it would stay on till all the water boiled out. Also, sometimes it wouldn't work at all when it turned it on. It would start to work, Just totally inconsistent. I lived with it for a few months and then was worried that some day it would stay on and start a fire. I had paid $70 for it at the time, and I wanted my money back. Capresso sent me a second kettle instead. It had the EXACT same problem. Sometimes it won't come on, sometimes it won't shut off. This time, Capresso disavowed all knowledge or responsibility, would not give me a refund OR send another. For that reason alone I would never buy from them again. You could tell they know it''s a problem from the way the first guy dealt with me and sent another. They KNOW they have this problem and they won't stand behind the product. I lived with it until, within a year, it stopped working completely. I finally bought a different brand.
