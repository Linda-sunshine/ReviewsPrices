review/summary: great little coffee potreview/text: Besides making a great cup (or 2) of coffee, I love this little coffee maker because it's faster to fill, clean, and brew. I originally bought it because I needed a smaller machine to fit under my old cabinets. Plus, it limits the amount of coffee I consume (half and half too).
