review/summary: Coffee remains inside potreview/text: This is the second time that I returned the Moka express from Amazon. Both times I received that pot and found black dusts inside the pot. There're also scratches on the outside. I highly suspect that the pot has been used and returned to Amazon, and they never check it. I wonder if anyone else have the same experience.My friend has the same product and I'm convinced that this is a great coffee maker. However, Amazon is preventing me from getting what I paid for!
