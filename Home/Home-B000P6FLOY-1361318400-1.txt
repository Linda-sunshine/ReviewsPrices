review/summary: How is your meat?review/text: Bought this to cook large chunks of meat, roasts, prime rib ect. It has worked perfect. The external probe is a good length about 2 /12 feet I guess.The only thing I wonder is how long the battery will last, we'll see. I would buy this over a standard kitchen timer.
