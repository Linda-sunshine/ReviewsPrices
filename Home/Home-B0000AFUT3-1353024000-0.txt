review/summary: Product is only as good as the bulbsreview/text: When I first bought this mirror, I thought it was great. The lighting and magnification met my needs perfectly. I had no issues with this mirror until about 3 months later, the bulbs went out. At first I thought its no big deal, I'll just replace the bulbs. Then I realized, it's impossible to get to the bulbs without taking the mirror apart. Once I could get to the bulb, I realized there's no way to get it out without breaking the mirror. So I ended up throwing the whole mirror in the trash.
