review/summary: Great for starting outreview/text: Purchased myself this Nesco food dehydrator for my b-day and have been very happy with it. I was simply entertaining the idea of begining to dehydrate my own fruit but then I thought I'd go for it with this machine. The first fruits I dehydrated were kiwis, peaches, bananas, apples, strawberries, and even raspberries. Everything turned out great. The informatioin and recipe book is a good source for starters. The internet was also a good reference for me. The dehydrator itself came well packaged and in a timely manner. The dial at the top has many different temps to chose from, so it's pretty easy to start dehydrating. I like that it came with several trays as well as a few fruit roll up trays and sticky delicate fruit drying trays. The one con about this machine is that it does not have a on/off button and you have to unplug when checking the fruit for doneness. This might not be a big deal for pros but for people like me who don't have the experience, we check fruit probably too soon or too often and an on/off button might be helpfull. Once I gain more confidence in the home fruit drying business, I may not have the need for an on/off button (not sure). One other thing I should mention is that I don't dehydrate too often, maybe 3-4 times a month max. Overall I am very pleased with my dehydrator and plan on dehydrating on a regular monthly basis throughout the year.
