review/summary: First Rate Manual Can/Bottle Openerreview/text: I buy a lot of OXO kitchen items and invariably review them positively on Amazon. This can opener is no exception. It has a nice weight to it, but more importantly it is very easy to use. It cuts through cans like they were made of butter. It is comfortable in the hand and can handle any size can with little to no effort. It is well made and easy to clean, though as the manufacturer points out it should be hand washed. It has soft hand grips which adds to the comfort factor. My only gripe is that this is on the big side so it isn't even remotely compact but it is very easy to find.Since I am not a fan of electric can openers due to cleaning issues, this is a nice alternative. It Is also great for anyone who might have arthritis in their hands or lack upper body strength since it requires very little effort.
