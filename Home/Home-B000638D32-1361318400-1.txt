review/summary: This thing is SHARP!review/text: I was looking for a chef's knife, and the reviews on Cook's Illustrated rated this highly. I concur. It is sharp, it is lightweight, it was relatively inexpensive. Just what I was looking for. I'm sure I could have gotten a pricier one, but why? This slices tomatoes easily, even soft ones. Warning, it is sharp, so pay attention to your fingertips (my husband complained of this one)
