review/summary: Pur 18 cup dispenser and filtersreview/text: We've had this for at least 2 years now and the taste of the water after filtering compared to the straight from the tap municipal taste is well worth the cost; as well as potentially safer - I don't believe municipal water is contaminated, but there are miles of pipes from the plant to my house. It is also FAR cheaper than bottled water and always tastes the same, until near the end of the filter's life versus one type of bottled water's taste versus another's. We've found the filters last from about 55 to 58 refills and then you can taste the difference noticeably. The filtering does slow over the 40 refill mark. Very occasionally you'll get a bad filter that will degrade/slow down faster, but we've only seen that twice. And yes, in the desert (where we live) we do sometimes have to fill it more than once a day for two people, but for the taste and almost no trouble, this is worth it. We are waiting to see how long the spigot lasts before it starts leaking; so far so good and that's not bad for the use it gets either.
