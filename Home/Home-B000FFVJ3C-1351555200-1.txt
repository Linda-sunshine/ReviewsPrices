review/summary: Highly Recommended Food Dehydratorreview/text: Don't hesitate to buy this dehydrator . . . Had an abundance of fruit this season and wanted to preserve it. This unit is a true workhorse . . . Works really well. Other reviewers note the lack of built-in timer. I find this to be an asset--less complication, less can go wrong. Need a timer? Plug it into a external timer that costs about $5 . . . like the one you use for lights.Hint for cleaning trays . . . If you don't have a big sink, use a large round plastic tray/saucer intended to catch water under potted plants. They are available at garden & hardware stores (call first to be sure they have the size-at least 14" in diameter at the bottom). Soak the trays in water for a few minutes. The tray/saucer can be stored under the dryer!
