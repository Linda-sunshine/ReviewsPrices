review/summary: Good Chair, Just Wish It Would Lean Back Morereview/text: Coming from Walmart office chairs, I was really blown away with how heavy and well built this chair is. I imagine it will last a very long time. The seat cushion is very comfortable and the chair size fit me well. (5'10" - 165 lbs). I like having a tall back, but I'm not able to really use it all that much with the way this chair is set up. My main complaint is that the chair will adjust to lean WAY forward but only slightly back and it seems spring loaded to launch you forward as soon as you release the lock like it's a catapult or something. This effectively make the seat rocker useless unless left locked. I miss being able to sit in my walmart chair and lean back as the chair would just kind of follow me back into whatever position I wanted. This is overall a very good, sturdy chair that seems well worth the investment.
