review/summary: OK while it lastedreview/text: I bought this model elsewhere (Macy's) a little more than a year ago to replace a similarly priced Krups that never gave an acceptable grind. It was better while it lasted. On Christmas morning I ground some beans but when I went to empty the basket nothing was there! So I cleaned it up and checked to make sure nothing was jammed or interfering with the beans dropping to the mill. Nothing. Plugged it in again and tried and this time there was simply no power; wouldn't turn on at all even though that receptacle put power to other appliances and it didn't work in other receptacles either that had power (i.e., no tripped circuit breaker).So one more item for the landfill. I am fast coming to the conclusion that those manufacturers who0 are trading on a name and prior reputation but have shifted to mass marketing simply don't deserve to keep their former reputation. Cuisinart, Kitchen Aid, and Krups are several to which this comment aptly applies.
