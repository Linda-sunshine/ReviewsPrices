review/summary: Just What I Wanted!review/text: I love this percolator - it's exactly what I wanted. Something simple, clean, and nice. It makes the perfect cup of coffee and I also use it to heat up water for tea. The only thing I can suggest is clamp the bottom part of the spring down so it doesn't fall off - making it permanent so it doesn't get misplaced. I don't foresee myself ever having to purchase another coffee maker or paper filters ever again! Enjoy! -sb
