review/summary: Best wine bottle opener on the marketreview/text: I have 3 brands, and this is the only brand that also extracts synthetic corks. They all do a good job on cork corks, but this product extracts synthetic corks. I have to use a set of pliers to get the synthetic corks our of the other openers.
