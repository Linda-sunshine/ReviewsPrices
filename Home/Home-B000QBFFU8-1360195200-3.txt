review/summary: Great Juicerreview/text: I have never owned a juicer before this one, so unfortunately I have nothing to compare it to. It suits my needs perfectly and is a lot quieter than I imagined it would be, especially on the low setting. The clean-up can be kind of tedious, there are 7 pieces total you have to clean, but it is totally worth it! Definitely a juicer I would recommend to anyone interested in juicing!
