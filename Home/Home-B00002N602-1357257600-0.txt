review/summary: defective itemreview/text: for the first few times i used it, the lid was very difficult to close compared to the other pressure cooker i have used. and then very soon, the security valve wouldn't come up by itself when the pressure increases, so it keeps leaking the pressure and I have to keep an eye on it and manually lift the valve. so bad i found this problem right after the return window closed.
