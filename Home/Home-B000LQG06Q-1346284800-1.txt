review/summary: Like sleeping on a cloud...review/text: I should have bought this foam mattress topper a year ago. Being in Afghanistan on a military base and sleeping on a worn out mattress (box springs only) with springs poking into you all night long is the pits. Out of sheer desperation for a good night's sleep I took a chance on this mattress topper and can't believe the difference! Now I look forward to going to sleep at night instead of dreading it. The shipper was really quick in getting it here too which is appreciated. This is a good quality mattress memory foam pad and a great buy - well worth the price.
