review/summary: not good for the long haulreview/text: have owned 3 of these units in the last 2 years, one developed a noisy fan and now our 3rd unit developed a leak 10 days beyond the amazon 30 day return date. Generally units seem fine for a small room but now with 2 of 3 down, reliability becomes unacceptably low.
