review/summary: Love it!review/text: So easy to use - that about sums it up. Just lock the opener onto the can and easily turn the large knob to open the can, push the red lock-release, and you are done. It has a small magnet on the end to help lift the lid if needed. You can open multiply cans and your fingers or hands won't be hurting - it is that easy. Fits perfectly in my drawer. Like it better that my battery operated opener.
