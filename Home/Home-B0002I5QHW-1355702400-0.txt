review/summary: Works finereview/text: I was surprised how well this unit works considering it is almost all plastic except for the cutters and handle. You do have to have a nice flat non porous surface to attach it to with the suction seal. I use a 12x12 inch granite tile I got at Home Depot for about $3 and clamp it to a table top. I have only used it to grind beef and it works well for that purpose.
