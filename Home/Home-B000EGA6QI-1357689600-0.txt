review/summary: Unique injury experience, Still my favorite kitchen item!review/text: So I've had the Cuisinart Immersion Hand Blender for approx. 2 years now? On Christmas morning I apparently decided to be stupid (only word for it!), and ended up with the blade of this thing stick on my finger. I do not blame this product AT ALL, as it was totally and completely user error on my part. ie, One should not stick their finger into the bowl of the product to clean cream cheese out of it; one should not stick any digit near the blade while it is still plugged in; if one is dumb enough to stick a digit into the bowl near the blade, UNPLUG IT FIRST and maybe you'll only end up with a scratch instead of around 6 hours in the ER. End result, my finger is perfectly fine, with pretty much no scar, and I still love this thing.So other than my idiocy, this thing is great! Prior to my injury, I used the immersion hand blender at minimum of 4 times a week to make a smoothie for breakfast. It is also great for helping out in making dips (my Christmas attempt gone wrong!). Plenty of other times I've used it as well. I kept it out on my counter with the container at all times so it was within easy reach. I cannot WAIT to get another one.I did purchase 2 additional blenders, as gifts for both the ER and the Fire Dept. that helped me out getting the thing off of my finger on Christmas morning. (I thought it was funny. :) ) The fact that the ER had to call the Rescue Engine to the ER to use the fancy saw thing to cut this sucker off personally proves to me how well made and strong this thing is. The steel construction on this wasn't going anywhere. The ER tried everything...pliers, 2 different type of ring cutters that barely made a dent...the only thing that cut through it was this big 6in diameter blade normally used to cut cars. Good piece of equipment in my book! I cannot WAIT to get another one for myself!
