review/summary: Not a room heaterreview/text: I can't believe there are 280 plus five star reviews. This hardly puts out that much heat. I had it in my 10 x 10 office and couldn't tell if it was on even at 800 watts. The temp outside is currently low 40s. It is a bit flimsy so don't kick it. It looks ok and is a nice compact size. It has a nice big dial but it's on the side and you have to bend down to see if you turned it off or what setting you set. Of course it doesn't make any noise as it doesn't have a fan or other moving parts. No smell either even the first time used.Now it may work in a room at night when you are sleeping and the furnace is turned down to 60 and you want to "take the chill off" but I'd recommend a thicker blanket. Think of it this way, 400 watts = 4 100 watt incandescent light bulbs. Actually the light bulbs might put more heat... I was hoping to save some money and noise over my 1500 watt heater with a fan but that ain't going to be...
