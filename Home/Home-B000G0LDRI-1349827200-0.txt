review/summary: Picture misrepresents the colorreview/text: Since this product has been so thoroughly reviewed I have only one thing to say: It's not gray or silver as the picture portrays. IT'S WHITE! I kept it because I didn't want to wait for another order to ship but white seems so institutional, like it should be in the infirmary of a nursing home. I asked if I could spray paint it but Honeywell said that that would probably void my waranty, so white it is. They also said that the picture does look gray/silver but that white is the only "color".
