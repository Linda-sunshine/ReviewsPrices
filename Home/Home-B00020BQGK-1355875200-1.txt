review/summary: lots of power, and a lot of heatreview/text: lots of suction and power in this vac. the powered beater bar really gets rugs clean, and in regular mode it does very well on hardwood floors. it does get hot though. after 5 or 6 minutes of use i could already feel the heat on the section above the clear portion. it did not shut off, but i would be if used longer than 20 minutes or so it would overheat. but, i use this for quick cleaning -- nothing heavy duty.i did purchase this via amazon...but i'm not getting the option to show verified purchase on my reviews.
