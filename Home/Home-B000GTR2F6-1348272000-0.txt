review/summary: Great while it worksreview/text: It is the best coffee maker I've ever owned. The trouble is it does not last very long. The first one I bought stopped working in about 20 months. Since I really loved the way it worked while it did, I bought another one. This one stopped working after 14 months. (The warranty is for 12 months.)I may go and buy another one but I'll buy an extended warranty at the same time.
