review/summary: one product flawreview/text: I bought this unit and was very surprised by how well it worked. It made great bread in a simple, easy way and I appreciated its design and manufacture. However my unit recently broke, due to a design flaw you can avoid. What happened to mine is that the paddle became stuck and the motor burned itself out trying to turn it. You must oil the underside of the pan and use a vise-grip or other wrench to make sure the shaft the paddle attaches to will turn easily. When mine broke it got part way through the kneading process, but at some point the paddle shaft just stopped moving. The flaw with the machine is that it should detect the shaft is no longer being turned and shut the motor down; instead mine just kept trying to turn it until the motor destroyed itself.I have contacted sunbeam via email 4 days ago and haven't gotten a reply. If I don't hear back by monday I will have to call them. I hate how amazon has nothing to do with this process. If Amazon was involved in the warranty process, this would go a lot quicker since collectively Amazon buyers have massive power in the market place. Amazon is failing us by not facilitating this process.
