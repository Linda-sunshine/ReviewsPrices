review/summary: Great for the looks and price.review/text: I believe quality of the humidifier actually matters, but I am not really trying to spend more then $50 on a humidifier because I've bought an air purifier along with my purchase. This humidifier has the looks for a great presentation and atmosphere in your room depending on what kind of animal you adore. Humidifier was easy to set up and made in a very simple style for easy use. A worthy buy for the price and quality and I cannot ask for any better.
