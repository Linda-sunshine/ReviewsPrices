review/summary: My Precious 3 Kings!review/text: These were larger than anticipated, but muchly appreciated. A real welcome to my Willow Tree Nativity. I like this set even without faces carved because I have my own impression of how they looked. These are quality pieces and I will be able to pass down to my family. I like them all one color, because they don't compete against each other for color, and I do love color! The only color are the black sheep and a camel, which are muted colors so they don't compete also. These Kings express love, respect and reverence! A real gift to your set!
