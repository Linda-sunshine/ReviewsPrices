review/summary: Don't bother.review/text: I've had this for less than a year, and the inner gear that attaches to the motor is completely stripped and won't turn the blade anymore. It was used lightly, for soap making (no chunks to chop, no ice, just smooth, thin liquid to blend) about twice a week. I suppose I got my money's worth out of it, but the last one I had, same make and model, lasted 5 years under the same conditions. I guess they just don't make 'em like they used to.
