review/summary: Very large diameter and heavy but super usefulreview/text: I bought this because I've always wanted a cast iron skillet and I've heard good things about how great they are to cook on.Good:-Easy to clean-All iron with no breaks or weird designs on it means the heat spreads across it evenlyBad:-REALLY Heavy!!! It's a man skillet IMO. You need a good strong arm to pick it up with one hand. A large, wide object that has been super heated is not a good thing to be just barely carrying around the kitchen. Keep in mind the handle gets hot too so you need pot holders to grab the handle.-Oiling it up every time is somewhat annoying. Have vegetable oil on hand if you plan to use it.Is it worth it?:Yes, everyone should have at least one of these, if anything just to try it out. The Lodge Logic pan is a cheap option for a great solid iron pan. These are expensive but amazon has a good price on them.
