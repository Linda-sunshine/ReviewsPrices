review/summary: 5 Stars Says It Allreview/text: I bought this product 2 years ago, February 3rd, 2011. I wanted to wait to put a review in to see how it holds up and well, it has! There's not too much to say about this product other than it's terrific! I push the button and a *few minutes later I have hot water for tea. *(time dependent on quantity of water)When I was first contemplating the purchase, I read some reviews about the button breaking. Not that I'm one to slam down the button, but I've still been a bit more conscious how I hit the button.On average, I've probably used it 5 times/week for 2 years. and I've had no problems.To summarize, this has been a great product and am pleased I made the purchase.
