review/summary: Old-School is Just Finereview/text: My mother had one of these, and gave it away some years back. Hers would be about 60 years old now. It was a heavy-weight stainless steel, with the original glass top. When I saw this, I thought it would be fun to try. Now, not many things are made the way they were 60 years ago. The stainless is not as heavy, and it has a plastic top from which to see the "perks." That said, though, I am very happy with this purchase. It makes a considerable amount of coffee -- enough for me to pack a thermos and for me and my husband to have two to three mugs of coffee together before work. The coffee is delicious! I put it in the dishwasher (perhaps coffee scholars would not agree with this!), and it washes well. Old-school is just fine with me!
