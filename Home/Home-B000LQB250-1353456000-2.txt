review/summary: //wonderfulreview/text: This topper is great. My back was hurting from sleeping on a new mattress that was a little too firm. This topper completely solved the problem. I know other people mentioned a strong odor, but the one i got had very little odor at all, and what it did have went away in a very short period of time. In addition the topper assumed it's proper shape in just a few minutes, and was put on the bed within an hour or so. All in all I'm very happy with my purchase and will buy the same item again if we need another.
