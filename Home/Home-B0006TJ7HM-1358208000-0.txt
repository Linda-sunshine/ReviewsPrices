review/summary: What a difference!review/text: Received these knives as a Christmas present. I thought I had good knives, until I received these. Very sharp, well balanced, not heavy at all. Even the scissors are great to use. After using these knives for about a week, I got rid of all my other knives. I have used most of them, except the steak knives. I can highly recommend this set.
