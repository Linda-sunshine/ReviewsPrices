review/summary: Back to the real thingreview/text: After 3 years of trying to find the least inexpensive gel fuel, I have finally come back to Real Flame. While this product is more costly it burns with more crackle, is thicker, burns to the bottom of the can. I love Amazon`s site so I could find the best deal on this product.
