review/summary: So Very Disappointedreview/text: I grew up thinking KitchenAid was an excellent brand. I have never been so disappointed in an appliance. Within a year with moderate use my pitcher is unusable due to a lousy blade assembly.The way it is made makes it impossible buy a replacement unit that might cost $10 at the most and instead requires that I buy a whole new pitcher at close to $50. Not going to happen. The fact that reading other reviews tells me this is very common I would end up buying another pitcher for another $50 in another year. I would rather find a blender that will not cost me $50 a year to use.
