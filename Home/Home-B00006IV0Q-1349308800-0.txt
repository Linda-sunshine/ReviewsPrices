review/summary: Worked great for 2 weeks, then just weak brown water.review/text: Thought I had found a good product, now I am going back to a drip coffee maker. - - - - - - -Perfect, quality little 6 cup percolator. This seems to have quality & finish I hadn't expected. We always try to buy America made first, but couldn't find coffee percolators made anywhere but China. The coffee doesn't touch plastic in this pot, which I like. I connected this to a GE digital timer and have fresh coffee every morning not processed through plastic. We shopped local stores like Macy's and couldn't find anything like this or even a 6 pot percolator. Very satisfied with this product.
