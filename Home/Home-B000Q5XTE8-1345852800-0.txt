review/summary: You call it lumbar support, I call it THE RACKreview/text: The good:1) Only took a few minutes to assemble.2) The seat is padded and goes up and down.The BAD:1) The back is not adjustable. The lumbar curve is so deep, it pushes my stomach forward. Your shoulders will never touch the back of this chair unless you can bend like a pretzel.2) Anything more then a few minutes in this chair is painful. I spend more time adjusting an fidgeting then sitting. My upper back has started hurting just typing this review!I'd pass on this and find a chair with and adjustable back.
