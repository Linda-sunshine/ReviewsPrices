review/summary: I Heart This Productreview/text: What is there NOT to love about something I can sear my roast in, add ALL the rest of the ingredients to, and then pop in the oven to slow roast all day long, then drop dumplings into at the last moment? ONE pot, an entire feast! Treat this right and you will be willing it to your children and they will fight over it. It is everything I had kitchen lust for, and it will be that for the reminder of my life. Lodge cast ironware is an investment and this gorgeous piece is every bit the work of art as well as that.
