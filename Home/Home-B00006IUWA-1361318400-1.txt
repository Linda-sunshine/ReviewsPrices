review/summary: Love itreview/text: Although some debri flies around a bit at first, this popper is soooo simple, and it definitely has less kernels in the bowl after it is done. If there were complaints it would be that there is no power button, and I am not sure why the design is to plug the cord in to turn the unit off and then to pull out the cord when you are done popping. In theory I guess that could be a safety hazard for keeping sure that the popper is not on and popping when you are asleep or not home, but most items have a power button and some sort of safety shut off.Still, WELL worth the money!
