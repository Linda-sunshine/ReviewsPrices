review/summary: Still love this blenderreview/text: I've been using my blender for over a year - mostly for smoothies. It works great. If you have leaking problems, etc., you got a lemon. Return it and start over! Isn't that how the manufacturing business works nowadays? There's always going to be some lemons in the mix. Clearly, the majority of the people who use Kitchenaid products are well satisfied.
