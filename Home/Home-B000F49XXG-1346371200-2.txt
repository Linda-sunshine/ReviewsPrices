review/summary: Vibrates cups out from under the coffee drip spouts!review/text: The pump action causes a vibration that moves cups out from under the coffee drip spouts as others but suspiciously not all have noted in their reviews. I have tested this unit sitting on the floor and counter tops to make sure it was level and each time the vibration moves the cups out of position and the coffee fills the suspiciously deep overflow tray, did they know that this would happen? To remedy this problem I have to wrap a wet paper towel around and under the bottom of the cup to keep it in place. I would bet De'Longhi a pile of money that their R and D department knew of this blatantly obvious design flaw and greedily dumped it on the market anyways. Regardless of all the other negative reviews made here this one alone should send buyers fleeing to another coffee maker. Dishonesty will bring them bad karma and I am not one to refuse them their just reward of a one star rating. I hope and pray they lose business because of this review!
