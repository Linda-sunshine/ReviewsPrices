review/summary: On third unit and keeps breakingreview/text: I am now on my third unit. I have a problem after 6 months of use it keeps giving me a prime message and won't brew. I do clean with vinegar and clean like they instruct you to. They have replaced my unit each time after walking me through the cleaning process to be sure I understand it. I don't think I will get another one this time going to try a different brand of coffee maker.
