review/summary: This is the best blenderreview/text: I tossed my $200 Cuisinart into the trash (it completely died after 4 months of light use & Cuisinart refused a refund, would only 'replace' IF I paid to ship it to them "in the original packaging," and that's just BS). I returned my $400 Breville (it was unbearably loud and smelled like burning plastic even when making a simple milkshake ... not OK for $400). So, finally I bought this KitchenAid since I had owned an earlier but similar model for years. And it works like a charm! I wasn't sure I'd like the new polycarbonate jar, but I do, totally. Easy to clean, though I do understand that the blade nut on the bottom needs tightened once in awhile. The best thing is the jar shape... it sucks EVERYTHING down to the blade, consistently, no matter what's in the jar. I paid $79 at Fry's and I'm completely satisfied after near-daily use for 2 months. Crushes ice perfectly, too, even big chunks.
