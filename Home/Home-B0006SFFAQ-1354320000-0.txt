review/summary: Fire Hazardreview/text: Repost -Decent coffee maker, but we've had ours for two years and it just caught on fire. Glad we were in the kitchen when it happened or we might not have a house now. Check out the federal consumer product safety commission's website to see the 87 other people that reported this issue. This thing should be recalled.
