review/summary: Great product, based on the negative reviews I hope it lasts!review/text: I love the stick blender! I got it the week of Thanksgiving and took it with me to my friend's house on Thanksgiving day. I blended all the gravy and even my homemade cranberry sauce. We have used it for blending frozen fruit mixed with yogurt, pureeing veggie soups right in the pan, I even used it today to puree some pot roast potatoes into mashed potatoes for a change of pace. I have used the processor to blend avocados and mince garlic, it did a great job. I have not yet used the whisk.You can make a puree mash of veggies and then freeze it in small containers or ice cubes, then defrost it later, season it and add more broth to make it more like soup.I read the reviews about the plastic falling apart, I have not had any issue yet. Blending the frozen fruit with the yogurt was pretty hard-core, and we had no problem.The best thing is that it has a cord. I thought I wanted cordless, but then I used my cordless carving knife and when it ran out of juice before I was finished, I realized that I don't want to be limited by a battery charge.Great product, I would buy it again.
