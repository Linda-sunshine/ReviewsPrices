review/summary: Preppers, Buy this Canner!review/text: Presto 01781 23-Quart Pressure Canner and CookerMy old canner had seen better days. I purchased this new Presto canner to replace it. It does a great job. The taste difference between home canned foods and store canned foods (With all their additives and preservatives) is huge. If you want to experience this for yourself, I am very pleased to recommend this quality Presto Canner. MRE's are OK for a while. But, if you want great taste, can your own! This canner is a bargain at this price! This item is a must for all you preppers.
