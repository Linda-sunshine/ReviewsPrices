review/summary: Nice when the brushes spun...review/text: Well, worked great for 3 cleanings... then brushes stopped spinning... cleaned everything out to no avail... perhaps just a defective unit. Looked into replacing brush unit, or belt, but is non-serviceable (can easily pop brushes out but the part that causes brushes to spin is no longer turning).All else worked like a champ. Rating 1 star as was hoping it would have lasted more than 3 cleanings, or about ~2hrs worth of running...
