review/summary: So SWEET!review/text: This juicer is very well made and works well. I bought it about 2 weeks ago and have used it almost every day. The motor is strong and components seem like they will last. Cleaning is easy and it's even dishwasher safe if you're real lazy ;)One downside is that it can spit minimal juice back out the top when it's processing. You just need to make sure to chase what you put in with the plunger as quick as possible. Not a deal breaker by any means though.
