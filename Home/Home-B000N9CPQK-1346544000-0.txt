review/summary: Great product and a great valuereview/text: I've had allergy problems for years, and this air purifier is really helping. I've had it in my bedroom for about two weeks an I can already feel a difference. Some of the other reviews complain about the noise, but you don't notice it after a few minutes, and I actually find it soothing. I also love that I won't have to replace the filter. Definitely worth it!
