review/summary: This works greatreview/text: For less than $20, I gave this a chance and have to say that I am truly happy with this. The cutting tool works easily to help expose the cork and the unit has flawlessly opened every bottle I have presented to it. If you want a simple device that looks good and makes opening your bottles effortlessly, then choose this.And as a tip, once we have charged the unit, it holds its charge for a really long time so that we don't have to keep it plugged in.
