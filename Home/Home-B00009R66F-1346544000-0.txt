review/summary: Hoover Steam Cleaner F5914-900review/text: This cleaner worked well (3 1/2 stars) for about 2 years, but now multiple small (cheap) plastic parts have broken after common household use. Therefore, we are purchasing a new one(not this model). We have a home with dogs and children so we have used it on a frequent basis. I am not purchasing this model again and would recommend someone look elsewhere.
