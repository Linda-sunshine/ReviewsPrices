review/summary: Absolutely unreliable. Cheap fan breaks into loud buzzreview/text: I bought one of these five years ago and it worked well for a long time. Bought two recently and both of them after a while started making a loud buzz. The first one after 5-6- months, the second after less than two months of actual use.It is clearly the fan, the only moving part, and when it starts making noise there is nothing one can do, just turn it off. It is loud enough to wake up children and adults and definitely too loud to stand even when awake.Clearly the components are not up to the task and the manufacturer is putting garbage into these things.It is disappointing because of the waste of money and because we like it when it works but is definitely too expensive for playing hit-or-miss or replacing it after two months.
