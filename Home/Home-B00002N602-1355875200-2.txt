review/summary: Bought as a replacement and I LOVE it!review/text: I love this pressure cooker. I have a very large Presto Pressure canner, so I'm used to the kind with the jiggling vent weight already. A few folks have commented that the handle is difficult to close. Since I'm used to the pressure canner, I guess I'm a little more used to the little jiggle and push I need to give the lid on this one too. It's really a great item and priced VERY reasonable. I use it at least once/week.
