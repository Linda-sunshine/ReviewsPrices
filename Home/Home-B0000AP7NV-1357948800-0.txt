review/summary: Water tastes worse after filteringreview/text: Straight tap water tastes better. I did as instructed. Soaked the filter for 15 minutes, and ran a few pitchers through before I drank any. Water tasted bad, so I ran a few more pitchers through. Still tastes like chemicals, or plastic. I tried filtering the water into a glass pitcher and it still tastes bad. The compartment that holds the filter even smells like chemicals or plastic. I thought Brita water was supposed to taste better than tap water. At least I didn't waste too much money, but this experience is not going to make me want to go out and buy any more Brita products.
