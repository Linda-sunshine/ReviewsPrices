review/summary: Lost prime after a couple months, but seems to be working ok now.review/text: I love the convenience of the k-cups. I'm still experimenting with the sizing options because (predictably) the strength of the brew changes with the size of the cup. I didn't really care for most of the cups that came in the sampler pack. Fortunately I bought some Folgers Black Silk, Green Mountain Black Magic, and Coffee People Donut Shop for further comparison. All three made a pretty decent cup of coffee (IMHO) although I tended to like the smaller more concentrated cup size when using Black Magic, otherwise it seemed watered down.After about a month, the light under the reservoir started blinking and the LCD indicated "Prime". I looked it up online, and this means that the pump that pulls water into the unit has lost prime. The problem seemed to go away by occasionally removing the reservoir and re-seating it on the base. It would only happen after the first cup of the day, lasted approximately a week, then the problem just went away.Pros:ConvenientCleanCons:Loss of Prime.
