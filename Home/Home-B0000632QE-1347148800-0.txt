review/summary: A real winnerreview/text: I took a chance on this mandoline and now give it very high marks. It takes a bit of time to get used to as I've never had one before but I love the way it slices. Heirloom tomatoes never tasted so good as a result of my new-found ability to closely slice them. My salads are turning into works of art. But be careful; this sucker is really sharp (as it should be). I bought some mesh gloves and encourage you to do the same.
