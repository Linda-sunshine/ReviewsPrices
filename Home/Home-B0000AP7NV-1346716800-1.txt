review/summary: Water For One, Please!review/text: Ordered this slim model as I live by myself. For guests I aim to set some aside in a gallon container. It is the perfect size for one person. I set at least one refill aside in the bathroom for my puri pot and oral care. It is so quick and easy to use. As I rent I cannot install any inline filters. But this filters the chlorine and limestone from my tap water so I don't have to buy bottled water to:1. get tasty water,2. insure appliances don't clog and3. germ proof oral and nasal care. (ewwww! IK)Plus it is so good to have simply clean, clear, water to drink and to make beverages; not to mention ice cubes with. I just refill and refrigerate after each use and I am good to go! Thanks
