review/summary: Terriblereview/text: All three of these filters stopped filtering water within a week of use. The water just sits at the top of the carafe and slowly filters over days (DAYS!). I found that I could temporarily fix this problem by taking out the filters and shaking them, but the problem comes back shortly after. I researched this problem and found that many other people seem to be having this exact same problem with PUR filters. I purchased a Mavea pitcher and filters to replace my PUR pitcher and won't be purchasing anything from PUR in the future.
