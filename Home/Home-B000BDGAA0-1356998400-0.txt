review/summary: Extremely hardreview/text: this pillow is not for the faint of heart. 20 years in the Marine Corps may not even condition a person well enough to sleep on a pillow this hard. Seriously it feels like your head is laying on a cement block. If you like extraordinarily firm pillows it will be great. if not stay away.
