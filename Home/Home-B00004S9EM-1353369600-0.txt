review/summary: excellent kitchen tool has become a mainstayreview/text: Purchased the 7 cup Cuisinart food processor a couple months ago and find it to be an excellent tool. It's indispensible for our vegetarian lifestyle as it makes it so easy to create many wonderful dishes. Cleanup is easy too. This size unit is good for 1-2 person households where you're making smaller meals. For a family I'd recommend the larger unit. I highly recommend watching the DVD that comes with it before you use it!
