review/summary: Bought as a Giftreview/text: This was a great gift for two reasons:1. Because I'd asked the recipient what they wanted for Christmas and I got a straight answer2. Because it's a very decent machine for the priceI used to have a really cheap and really horrible espresso machine. The shots pulled OK, but the steam want just sprayed milk everywhere. This machine is really solid and the steam wand does a decent job of frothing/steaming. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good machine without costing an arm and a leg.
