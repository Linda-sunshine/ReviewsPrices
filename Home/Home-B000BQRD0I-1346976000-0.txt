review/summary: Works well enough. Good for things you don't want a crease in.review/text: There is a fair amount of a learning curve to get used to it. I don't use it on anything I want a crease in because it is too difficult for me to do. I bought an "Oveglove" to see if it would be easier for me to use it to try to get creases and it wasn't. Heats up fast, goes thru a fair amount of water and the hose gets hot to touch so be careful when using it.
