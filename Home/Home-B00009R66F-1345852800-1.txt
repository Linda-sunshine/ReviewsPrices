review/summary: Does the job!review/text: In July I shampooed the carpet using the Rug Doctor. I had rented that product for years and was completely satisfied with the results. This time, however, the carpet just didn't have the just shampooed smell or look. So, instead of going back to try another Rug Doctor, I thought that I would try the Hoover. WOW! This machine picked up so much dirt. I could hardly believe that much was left behind by the Rug Doctor.The Hoover is quiet (for carpet shampooers), cleans amazingly well, and has good coverage. I would suggest not to use the quick assembly set-up sheet. It will totally confuse you. Use the manuel. The instructions in the booklet are so much simpler to follow.
