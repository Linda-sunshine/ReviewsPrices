review/summary: Super Easy to Usereview/text: I bought this to use when cooking fudge over the holiday. The thermometer was easy to use, and seemed acculturate. I like that it comes with a case/cover, so it's easy to store in my silverware drawer, without being a hazard. Definitely worth the money--a great buy!
