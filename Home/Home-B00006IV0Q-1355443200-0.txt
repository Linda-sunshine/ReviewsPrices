review/summary: Makes great coffeereview/text: We love our Presto stainless steel coffee maker. The coffee is always hot and tastes great. We always use the filters and found that they are readily available in supermarkets. The only other comment that I have is that when it starts to make the coffee it makes a moaning sound. The first time we heard it we laughed and wondered if we had made a mistake. We now consider it to be an audible sign that great coffee is on the way.
