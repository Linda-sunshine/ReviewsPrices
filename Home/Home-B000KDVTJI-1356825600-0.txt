review/summary: quick and tastelessreview/text: I've seen other pots reviews that say they add a funny taste to the water. This one doesn't. Heat up is very quick. I origianally bought this for my office and did a test at home. My wife loved it so I had to buy another one &#34;for the office&#34; (you know why). Since we do herbal coffee and tea that are available in individual steep bags this may replace our coffee pot (regular coffee is avaialble in steep bags also).
