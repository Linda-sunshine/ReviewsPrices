review/summary: top doesnt stay onreview/text: I have a slim brita pitcher and decided to buy this model for more water capacity. I bought it at target. I took it home and filled it up and the lid and the flap covering the filter kept falling off. The design is cheaply made. lm so disappointed. I'm returning the pitcher and may just have to buy from a different company.
