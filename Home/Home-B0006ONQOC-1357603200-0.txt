review/summary: great product!review/text: nothing but good things to say about this product. as long as you leave the bowl in the freezer overnight (instead of only a couple of hours) the ice cream comes out perfect. i like that you can put a spoon inside while it's running and no danger of it getting caught in the turning mechanism. well thought out product. highly recommend.
