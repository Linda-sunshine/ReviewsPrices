review/summary: Cast Iron Rules!review/text: I own at least half a dozen different cast iron cookware pieces, among them is one identical to this skillet and I have to say, NOTHING, can even come close to these true workhorses. I purchased this skillet as a Christmas gift for my step-son because he is always in need of a new pan for one reason or another. Hopefully, this skillet will be the start of a collection for him that will last a lifetime. An it goes without saying, Amazon had the best price out there and their service, as always, exceptional. Happy New Year and Thank you Lodge and Amazon!
