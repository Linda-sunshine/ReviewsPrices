review/summary: Owner for one monthreview/text: Everything works as advertised. Once I started trying their various coffees, I realized just how bad the coffee I had been buying was. Yeah, I know that at ~60 cents a cup it ain't cheap, but once you find a coffee you really like, you're not going back! Oh, and it spoils you, too. No more cleaning up messes from coffee grounds. So for all the aggravation a lot of us go through to make our daily (or hourly for some)coffee, I'll have to say I'm glad I bought it. Just pop in your K-Cup and you've got your drink in under a minute. Then just throw away the used K-Cup. I knocked off one star for the high price. Be sure to register your machine for their deal.
