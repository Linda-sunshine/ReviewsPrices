review/summary: very, very goodreview/text: Had a Mr Coffee, and it just never seemed hot so decided to try this and we love it so far. Only beef would be using the carafe for fill/water level indicators but it really is not a big deal. I am using the hottest setting and no complaints so far. I do use a filter inside the basket for ease of cleanup. Like the looks and especially liked that Amazon offered it in different colors. Pricing was also good. Its a keeper.
