review/summary: Bad qualityreview/text: Bought this steamer in March this year after reading all the positive reviews. Unfortunately, 6 months on and the hose has snapped! I tried sourcing a new hose online and found nothing - so I'm now left with a totally useless machine! I have not been put off steaming my clothes, so I will invest in a more expensive steamer, one which will last more than 6 months!
