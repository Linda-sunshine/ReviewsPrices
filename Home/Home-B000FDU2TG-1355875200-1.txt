review/summary: Lots of power.review/text: Love this little workhorse. This was my compromise between a pricey blender and a mid priced blender and am very satisfied with my purchase. It handles ice effortlessly. I love how the blades are attached to the blender as it is so much more sanitary and a breeze to clean then those that come apart. No more rubber gaskets!
