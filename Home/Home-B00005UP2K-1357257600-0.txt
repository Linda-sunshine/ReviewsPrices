review/summary: Great mixer.review/text: This is a great mixer with a lot of options and accessories that make it a good value. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because of the way it was packaged--it came with a couple of big white scuff marks which more-or-less buffed out but are still visible. Not a problem as it relates to functionality, but when you give it as a gift, the big obvious marks lessen the happy-gift factor.
