review/summary: Like a Champ!!review/text: Had been using a &#34;C*******n&#34; product for a number of years and it was not up to the recommendations. Seemed like everything stuck to the pan...........especially eggs. Very hard to clean. The first time my wife used this one nothing stuck and was so easy to clean. We will buy a larger one soon.
