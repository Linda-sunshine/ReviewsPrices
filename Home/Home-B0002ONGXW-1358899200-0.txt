review/summary: Very Poor Qualityreview/text: These sheets were an utter disappointment, there is no way that they are 600 thread count - they are coarse and cheap feeling. The sheets I normally buy at Costco are much nicer quality at a similar price.I would not recommend that anyone buy these scratchy sheets. The only reason I didn't return them was because I threw away the box when I washed the sheets, hoping that they would soften up during washing - they did not.Terrible sheets.
