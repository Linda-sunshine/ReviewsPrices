review/summary: A Great Plastic Grinderreview/text: This is a great little kitchen tool, not to be confused with the much more expensive aluminum and stainless steel models. It's plastic, and it's fully functional and fun to use. If you're a survivalist looking to turn an elk into ground meat, buy something else. If your doing pasta or specialty grinding or mincing for Christmas ... this is the tool for you!
