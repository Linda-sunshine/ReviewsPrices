review/summary: Does it's job, good for the pricereview/text: I've used this a few times since I've gotten it and while it does it's job, the cord could be a little more secure. That's really the only downside I have to it. The cord is rather short, but you should be okay on a counter. I use mine at my desk and thankfully have an outlet very close. Anyone using this outside of the kitchen, perhaps in a dorm, may have an issue with the length.
