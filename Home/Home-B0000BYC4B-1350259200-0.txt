review/summary: Works for mereview/text: I often drink out of my mason jars and needed a lid I would pop on quickly if I had to take my drink out the door with me. I could not find these in any stores so Amazon can through again. Some of the other reviews are correct that these do not have a complete seal, but if you aren't tipping your jars upside down, these should work just fine. Overall, I'm satisfied.
