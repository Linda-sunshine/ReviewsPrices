review/summary: vibrationreview/text: The plate that the cup(s) sit on vibrates to the point that the cups move. I'm working on isolating the plate using surgical tube as &#34;feet&#34; but the vertical distance between the plate and the nozzles is minimal allowing the plate to be minimally elevated. Any ideas would be appreciated.Also there has got to be a better way of fixing the coffee ground &#34;nest&#34; into the handle, maybe a simple 1/8 or 1/4 twist rather than the &#34;flip lock&#34; thing. Would actully be cheaper to make. Makes excellant cappaccino!
