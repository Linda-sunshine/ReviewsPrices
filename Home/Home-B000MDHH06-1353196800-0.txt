review/summary: Decentreview/text: With all of the raving reviews and the fact that this juicer was used in "Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead", I thought this juicer was going to be wonderful.The Pros:Juices **HARD fruit / veggies pretty wellMore quiet than some juicers** Hard fruit / veggies : Apples, Pears, Cucumbers, Celery, Ginger Root, CarrotsThe Cons:Any soft fruits or veggies; like Kale, Citrus Fruits, leafy greens, strawberries, blueberries, mangoes, plums, etc, do NOT juice well at all, it all gets thrown into the pulp.Cleanup is not that easy, in fact, without a dishwasher it becomes more of a hassle to clean it due to its "compact design". Rather than dispense pulp into a bin, it houses it within itself.Pulp produced is not very dry, lots of potential juice material gets chucked into the pulp housing.The pulp housing fills up really quick, so you can only make about 17 oz of juice before emptying it out.Summary:For my daily juicing needs, it does an alright job.For others, this juicer may be more of a hassle than a useful device.This juicer was the first one I had ever purchased, and now I am waiting until I have enough money to buy something better.
