review/summary: Good ole popper!review/text: We got a Presto PopCornNow air popper about 1979, if I'm not mistaken, for our wedding! We had never seen such a popper before and loved it! It's been so many years that I'm not sure of the year! (In any case, we had it in the house we moved from in 1986.) All these years it's popped away. Finally, this last year, it finally has slowed down! Hate to throw it away, but somehow it's finally worn out. Certainly, I'm here to buy the same brand, although much updated.If you ever try an air popper, you'll never go back!You can pop with no oil or butter, if that's what you like!My personal favorite is to pop dry corn, melt half a stick of Braum's real butter in the microwave, then dribble the butter slowly and thinly all over a big bowl. A little dab of sea salt tops it off!Yes, the air popper pops much fast than the microwave and it's all perfect, big, fully-popped corn, with no singed kernels like a microwave tends to make!Certainly ours worked for years and years! Perhaps 33 years, if I remember right!
