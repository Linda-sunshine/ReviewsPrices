review/summary: Always gets the job done!!review/text: This wine opener is a life saver. I bought this last year for a stocking stuffer to give to my boyfriend, which actually turned into a gift for myself, and I LOVE IT. The product delivers exactly as promised. I am not the brightest when it comes to manually opening a bottle of wine...I actually have never successfully manually openend a bottle of wine without destroying the cork. All my problems were solved when I purchased this product. It also comes with a wine chiller which I have never used because we have a wine cooler. But it is one of those things that is nice to have just in case. Great product, please get it because it will make your life SO much easier.
