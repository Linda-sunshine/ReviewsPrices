review/summary: Better than expected.review/text: Wasn't quite sure what we would get for $25 but so far Not bad! Do not like noisy fan type heaters & this puppy is as silent as they come.We have a Presto Heatdish that is a decade & a half old & going strong - in fact too strong. Couple years ago the thermostat went out & now it goes full blast all the time. I have to be about 10 feet away from the Heatdish to avoid getting cooked. Great for heating the entire basement TV room though. Ten minutes after clicking buy on this Optimus we found scratch & dent Presto's on eBay for $55 (with shipping), almost canceled the Optimus.But the Optimus has performed very well so far & sitting on the floor 5 or so feet away in the PC room (bedroom too) it delivers just the right amount of heat. Of course no where near the type of heat the Presto is capable of. So we'll see how long it lasts. Doubt we'll get 15 years (think we just got lucky with that Heatdish) but hey if the Optimus lasts half that long then it's a great buy. Optimus & we are Prime members. Perhaps we'll call it Optimus Prime?
