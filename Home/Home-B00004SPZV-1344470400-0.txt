review/summary: I love this damn thing!review/text: I waited a few months to do my review, making sure I had quite a bit of use. So far so good though. I use this every time I'm in the kitchen, and have even used it on wood furniture. I personally use olive oil, but it seems like you can put any oil in there, which if used with canola, would be a cheap replacement for expensive non-stick cooking spray. Great product, definitely worth the buy. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 (since I doubt they make these in America).
