review/summary: Gets the Grinding done & Pours Well tooreview/text: For the price a great value. With this KRUPS its only a quick buzz for a very adequate grind & I really like the angle where the clear lid attaches that makes a pour spout. I didn't know I wanted this feature till I first used it and realized how helpful it is to have aiming assistance before that first cup of coffee in the morning:) The motor does have a little odour for the first while but this is normal for breaking in new electric motors from what I've read. (they have oil that gets on some parts during manufacture & needs to burn off)
