review/summary: More than I expectedreview/text: I love coffee... but my grind and brew coffee maker died. Everyone was pushing to get a Keurig... and I was reluctant, as the reviews are mixed. I am glad I took the leap. The coffee is fresh and a delight. Hot coffee and made fast. I would definitely recommend it and it was delivered in a timely fashion...fast just like you'd expect from Amazon...
