review/summary: love it!review/text: I originally bought the Ronco dehydrator and immediately sent it back. After much review and checking out other models i ordered this one. I saw reviews that they are loud. Mine is very quiet and works so well!! I am very pleased!! I would definitely recommend this.product to ajyone. I dehydrate veggies and have made a ton of jerky.
