review/summary: makes excellent crispy wafflesreview/text: Great waffler. Heats up fast, heavy so the lid stays down and cooks the top of the waffle, easy clean-up (I spray it w/cooking spray for the 1st waffle and that's it...all the rest pop right out). Stores upright like a book so needs minimal shelf space.Before I bought this I watched an old Alton Brown/Good Eats episode on buying the right waffler, and this fits the bill.My only complaint is I have to put the setting lever all the way to 5 (darkest), yet I still have to leave the waffle in for another 20-30 seconds to get it the darker, crispy golden brown my family likes.
