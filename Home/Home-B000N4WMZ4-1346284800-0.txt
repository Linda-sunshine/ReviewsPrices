review/summary: Great quality cookwarereview/text: I just got this a few weeks ago and we've already used it to prepare three delicious meals- sauerkraut and kielbasa, and yummy pork loin and chops. The pork loin was perfect, if I may say so. Seared it and then baked it inside this with veggies and grapes, and it turned out perfectly.The lid on mine was a silver material, so it seems like that's what they're shipping with now.The blue color looks great, and it's a breeze to clean- just wipe with a soapy sponge and then towel dry it.
