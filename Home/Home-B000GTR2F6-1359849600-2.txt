review/summary: Keurig is Simply the Best!review/text: We upgraded to the B70 from the B60 after having that model for a couple of years. I really like the design of the B70 Platinum significantly better. The tank is a little larger and much easier to remove and fill because of the shape. The additional features and larger screen menu system are great. Even the drip tray is easier to pull out and replace. It's overall a great improvement over the B60. Much quieter too. Love this unit and would highly recommend it. Keurig is the bomb.
