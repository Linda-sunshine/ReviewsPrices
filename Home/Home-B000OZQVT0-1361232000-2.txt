review/summary: Quality product - last longreview/text: I have tried the cheaper fuels. Real flame is the real thing. Well made, burns well & lasts long. My wife saved money on the first four or five cases. She bought the cheaper brands. This case was a name brand & a bit more in cost. She has been obviously happier with this product. Try them all but in the end you will like Real Flame Gel Fuel.
