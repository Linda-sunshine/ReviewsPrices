review/summary: Really powerful for a handheldreview/text: We recently upgraded to this because the Hoover Platinum LINX Pet Cordless Hand Vacuum, BH50030 we previously owned was terrible and so expensive compared to this unit which is far superior. We've had a couple cordless vacuums and have not have success with either. We keep this Eureka in our motorhome which gets dirty very fast and it is so fantastic. It is powerful and pulls out at least 50% more than any of the other vacuums we've owned. The nozzle is one of the best parts if you want to get those nooks and crannies where dirt and crumbs tend to like to hide. I don't mind that it is loud. It is a vacuum after all, aren't they supposed to be? And other reviewers have mentioned that it is heavy and it heats up. Yes, it's a little heavy, but it doesn't seem to bother me. And it does heat up after about 20 minutes of use, but that is usually all I need it for. It is a handheld and wasn't designed to do very large spaces.
