review/summary: Love it - use it all the time!review/text: This juicer is fast and the machine is sturdy. It is definitely restaurant quality. Easy to clean which makes it so you do not hesitate to use it day after day. It makes pulp-free juice effortlessly. It is much better on harder fruits and veggies that soft ones, but still does fine with those.
