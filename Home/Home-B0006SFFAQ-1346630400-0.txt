review/summary: Still working well!review/text: I've had this coffee maker for almost two years now. It's excellent. I love the timer function. Like some other reviewers mentioned, it doesn't light up (so it's hard to see the time) and as a 5'1" woman, it's hard to pour into the narrow opening in the back, but it's really not that difficult. The gold filter included works great. It keeps coffee evenly hot and brews nicely.
