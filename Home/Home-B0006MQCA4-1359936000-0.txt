review/summary: I love how it saved me so much money on water bottles and moneyreview/text: It fits in my fridge perfectly and its so simple to use. The tab to draw water is the best feature. I love it.I do have to say that the water tastes fine when its cold. But once you leave it out for a bit, it does have a funny taste. I live in NYC and use tap water. Maybe I should boil the water first, and then pour it in? NYC tap water is supposedly very clean and safe water to drink with little taste so maybe its something else. But I won't complain too much.I recommend it!
