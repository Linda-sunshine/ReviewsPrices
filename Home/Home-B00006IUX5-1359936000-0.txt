review/summary: Powerful little monsterreview/text: Got this machine and pulled out of the box worried that it would be too small to do much. But wow, it can grind up coffee faster and more effective that the Black and Decker one I borrowed from my friend to see if I would like grinding my own coffee. It has a wind tunnel effect that makes it faster and more effective then the last one I used. I am very happy with it so far.
