review/summary: Great for the individual householdreview/text: I returned some wretched electric grinder I had bought on Amazon a week before that couldnt cut warm butter. This cuts very well and is pretty quick with a small volume of meat. Only negative feedback is I did a first grind on the larger blade and put through a second grind on a the same grind, and given there is no logical way to put meat into the grind other than manual it can take a bit of work as well as overgrind. Still, first grind with frozen cubic centimeter sized meat was perfect, and for the price and functionality, a great buy.
