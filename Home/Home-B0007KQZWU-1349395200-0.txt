review/summary: Oh heck yes! Unbeatable quality and value!review/text: I like the set that we bought when we bought Fisk Mansion East so much that I bought another set for Mansion west. Its a little harder to cook steaks and burgers on stainless until you get the hang of it, but the health benefits, and getting pan fond for sauces, make it a better choice than nonstick. The one All Clad pan I owned in the past was a paella pan. The lid warped the first time I made paella in the oven. I consider these pans to be superior.
