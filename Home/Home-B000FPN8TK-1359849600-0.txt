review/summary: Nicereview/text: This is nice device. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the round bottom part that supposed to go on top of the rim of the mug is pretty small. My mugs are regular size but still this don't fit on top of them. But I just press my finger against the bottom of this teapot for the tea to be poured into the mug and it works great.
