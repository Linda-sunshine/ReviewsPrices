review/summary: So far so good!review/text: I've not had one issue with this juicer thus far *knocks on wood* I've been using this daily since it shipped and absolutely love it!If I had to change one thing about this Juicer it would be adding a bigger sized barel to trap the pulp, otherwise it's fantastic for the price, you just can't beat it. If you're juicing leafy green veggies and such, you don't have to clean this product after every use, only if you add in fruit.Cleanup is relatively simple, the screen takes a little scrubbing with some soap but cleans up nicely, I haven't had an issue with particles being stuck in the grating, it's all come out very easily with hot water.Anyhow, if you're looking for the perfect juicer, it doesn't exist but for a centrifugal, this is definitely on top.
