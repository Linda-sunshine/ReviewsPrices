review/summary: Review of Capresso 560.01 Burr Grinderreview/text: I purchased this grinder to replace the &#34;beginning model&#34; Capresso grinder I've had for at least 8 years. The only reason I replaced my old Capresso was because the plastic catch bin for the ground coffee cracked over time and eventually a piece broke off. Other than that the old machine still worked. I did a lot of research and really didn't find very good reviews of many of the burr grinders out there - except for this one. Having had a Capresso previously I figured I couldn't go wrong, and I didn't.I'm very pleased with this machine. It is significantly more quiet than my old Capresso (which sounded like a jet taking off). It produces a nice dense grind on the finer setting where we keep it set - we like strong, flavorful coffee. It is much easier to clean than my old machine, in large part because the burr mechanism easily lifts out. Removing the burr in my old machine was a real challenge because as it rotated, it tightened down to the point where even my husband had difficulty removing it. This Capresso also has a wide array of grind settings.The few negatives I read about this grinder all referenced static build-up when coffee is ground. I have found this to be the case with all grinders, not just the Capresso. My new Capresso builds up some static but I work around it by operating the grinder on a sheet of paper towel so any wayward grounds end up on the paper and not my countertop. So clean up is a breeze.Overall I am very happy with the Capresso and recommend it. Its performance relative to its price make it a great value.
