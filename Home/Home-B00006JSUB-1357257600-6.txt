review/summary: Same great quality as Lodge has always madereview/text: I just got this skillet from Lodge and I am happy to say that it is the same great quality as the cast iron I have bought from them in the past and as the cast iron my grandparents have had since long before I was born.We use it on a woodfire kitchen stove so the thickness and evenness is crucial. The heat coming off of a woodfire stove is almost always uneven and inconsistent. Other pans - even good quality pans - don't distribute the heat and provide an even consistent heat like this Lodge skillet does.I really appreciate the pre-seasoned and will buy this type from now on.Getting such a heavy item shipped for free makes me love Amazon Prime even more :)
