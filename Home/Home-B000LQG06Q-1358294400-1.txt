review/summary: Perfect to use on top of futon mattressreview/text: I bought this to help cushion a futon mattress, and I couldn't be happier with it! It's super comfy and a great deal!! I would recommend this topper for anyone that's looking for a something to add cushion! I read some reviews about the mattress topper being too hot, but this one has holes for ventilation and it isn't making anyone who sleeps on it too hot or warm for that matter. (Phoenix gets hot)Well worth the price!!
