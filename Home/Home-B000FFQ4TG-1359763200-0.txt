review/summary: Love this maker.review/text: After trying several makers by different companies, and having all of them let us down by puking hot coffee all over the counter and making a huge mess, we finally bought a Bunn.While the &#34;wake up timer&#34; available on some units is a nice feature, the ability to prep everything the night before, and pour in the water and close the lid and have hot fresh coffee in about 3 minutes is awesome.We have had our maker for about a year and a half. The first one crapped out after 6 months and Bunn's customer service was outstanding. I called their number and received a new maker no questions asked overnight FedEx. They included a return label so I could send back my broken unit.The replacement has run flawlessly since.Sure, the unit keeps water hot all the time and therefor uses more energy, but it is negligable. If you are that worried about your carbon footprint or whatever, you shouldn't be using using an electric maker anyway so shut the hell up and quit your bitching.
