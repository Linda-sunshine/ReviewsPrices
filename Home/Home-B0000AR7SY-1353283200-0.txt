review/summary: Quiet and Effectivereview/text: I'm going to keep it short. In the world of coffee grinders, every coffee snob (not necessarily bad.. you know who I'm talking about) will tell you that you need to spend 300 bucks on a grinder... blah blah blah. This thing is a head above anything you'll find in its price range, and is great at what it does. I would advise to cleaning often if you do espresso grinds with any sort of regularity, but that's a step up from some grinders where I've literally needed to clean after every grind. Works great, and best of all, its very quiet as grinders go!
