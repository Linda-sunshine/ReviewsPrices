review/summary: Good while they lastreview/text: This adorable unit quietly puts out a nice cloud of moisture. The yellow-green light can be turned off.The big drawback is that the water tank is not well constructed. I have had to return one and have to keep patching the second one to keep it operational. It even ships with a notice and sticker warning you not to fill it beyond two-thirds. The water tank handle breaks the first time someone forgets and holds the tank by it. When it crashes to the floor, you will probably spring your first leak. Always hold the tank, not the handle or arms.
