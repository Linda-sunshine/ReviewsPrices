review/summary: A Great gift, I just dont like the colour!review/text: I recieved this a couple of weeks ago from a couple of friends. They bought it on VenTribe and I absolutely love it! It's as strong as they come, and makes mince meat out of any tasks... Its much better than any other mixer I've ever used, and way more quiet than Im used to... I'd recommend.
