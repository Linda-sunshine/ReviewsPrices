review/summary: Cast iron is the best!review/text: Gave away all of my teflon/non-stick pans and switched to using stainless and cast iron. Never looked back. This oversized cast iron pan is really good for cooking pancakes, eggs, and anything else you need a lot of room. Cast iron also heats much more evenly by allowing to slowly heat up. No more hot spots. Plus, still made in America! There's a reason our great-grandmothers and grandfathers used this. It works! This pan came pre-seasoned, but I recommend adding some coats over time. It will make it virtually non-stick.
