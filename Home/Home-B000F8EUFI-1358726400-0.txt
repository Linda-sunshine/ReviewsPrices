review/summary: This to sucks in exactly the right way!review/text: I finally bit the bullet and bought a vacuum to deal with two wool rugs which shed like a mother all over my apartment and hard wood floors. I also have a hand held dirt devil but in over a year of having the rugs the initial shedding has not stopped because the hand held is just not up to the task - or rather with the effort involved I'm not!I couldn't be happier. It sucked up all the residual wool from huge rug A and then after an empty did the same thing for rug B.Yes, it is noisy but so is the hand held. Yes, the small canister fills up quickly because it sucks so well! Yes, you have to remove the filter before tipping out all the rubbish but it's no biggie. Yes, it does blow piles of dirt around but it also sucks up the mess. Did try it on my kitchen mat with tassels and it likes eating the tassels so I only made that mistake once.It's light if you need to lift it and it's small so I remove the handle and shove it in the cupboard where it fits nicely.So so happy though I did notice a weird burning rubber smell when I first used it... Only used it the once so time will tell.
