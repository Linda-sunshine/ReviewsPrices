review/summary: Quick readreview/text: Excellent story about the most perfect society, and the darkness required in order to keep people &#34;happy&#34; all the time. Brings up some interesting questions. Read it will your kids, it can easily create a lovely discussion about the themes represented in the book. (PS: there are two (I think) sequels out. Also good, but don't read them if you like the way this one ended)
