review/summary: Well worth the extra moneyreview/text: I usually buy flannel sheets at a major warehouse outlet for less than half the price of these sheets. I've replaced them every year because they are a thinner material and develop holes from constant laundering. The Pinzon Signature flannel sheets are so much heavier in weight and very soft. The fitted sheet has extra-deep pockets that easily fit my thick pillow-top mattress. I've washed these sheets several times, and they still feel velvety soft with no shrinkage. I absolutely love these sheets and would recommend them to anyone looking for a quality flannel sheet that won't need to be replaced every year.
