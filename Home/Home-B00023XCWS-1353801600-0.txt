review/summary: Loud kettlereview/text: I use this kettle in my office so that I can make hot tea while at my desk. It's very convenient and it heats up water relatively quickly (a few minutes). I give it only 3 stars because the kettle is extremely loud while it is heating up the water. From time to time, it disturbs other people in my office. For example, if someone is making a phone call in the office, I have to turn off the kettle to avoid disturbing the call.The take-away: Because the kettle can get pretty loud while it's heating up the water, I'd suggest buying a different electric kettle.
