review/summary: Totally excellent dual alarm clock radio.review/text: This product completely filled the niche we needed. My wife has two different wake times depending what day of the week it is. Changing the wake times back and forth was annoying at best. The large dimmable numbers are easy to read and do not illuminate the room. The sleep button has many sensible options of time to fall asleep to. The choice of alarm tone or radio are good options. I would recommend this product to anyone needing its combination of features.
