review/summary: Well I want to give 5 starsreview/text: So I have wanted a Keurig for FOREVER!! But the coffee it brews is just sub par (I'm using the free cups it comes with and my Kcup). I have the &#34;upgraded&#34; one that comes with a built in water filter system...well that water taste disgusting which in turn makes my coffee disgusting. I have only tried it about 5 times hoping that the filter taste goes away. I'm honestly missing my Hamilton Beach right now. The reason I am giving 4 stars because the product works great and it looks great on my counter. I guess I'm just use to my coffee tasting a certain way. I'm praying it gets better or else I have to return it.
