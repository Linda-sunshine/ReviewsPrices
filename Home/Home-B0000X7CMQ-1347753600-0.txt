review/summary: Keeps the coffee warm longer without additional heatreview/text: Keeps the coffee warm longer without additional heat. I broke 2 glass carafes before starting over with this stainless steel carafe.Updated 2/2/2013.Still Perfect for me. I am copying and pasting the following since these mirror my thoughts precisely:"It has a carafe instead of a heating plate." "And I have not been disappointed. The machine brews an excellent pot of coffee every morning. And then keeps it hot for [at least 3 to 4] hours".I also "had a week where the pot kept over-flowing and spilling out on to the kitchen counter while brewing. Turns out this happens if you twist the carafe lid too tight. Now we know and haven't had that problem since"
