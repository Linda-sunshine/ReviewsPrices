review/summary: So glad I got this!review/text: This mini processor is the perfect size for making meals for two people, which is great for me and my fiancee. I used it daily to chop onions and garlic but it is great for chopping and grating so many items. When I make pizza (which is at least once a week) I buy large blocks of mozzarella, tear it into chunks and throw them in the mini processor. It shreds them it to a perfect size for topping a pizza. Make sure you follow the instructions on how full the work bowl should be, and be very aware of what this chopper can and can't do. After 8 months I've noticed scratches inside the work bowl, but they haven't affected performance. For little jobs it's great, and I would buy this again if given the choice. I'm even giving some to friends for gifts, I highly recommend this.
