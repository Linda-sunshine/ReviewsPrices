review/summary: The HOOTMIDIFIERreview/text: This "hootmidifier" is adorably functional. Every time I walk in the room its deeply caring eyes make me feel like I am loved. Apart from the enchanting gaze, this humidifier also provides any room with ample vapor. The water is released in two very cool and visible streams that can be quite fun to play with. Also, if you loose the cap for the reservoir like I did, you can buy a demineralization filter to replace it and soften your water at the same time.
