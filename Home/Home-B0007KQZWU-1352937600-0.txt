review/summary: Just Awesomereview/text: Bought this set last year for the holidays. Overall, just a great buy. Read the simple instructions especially regarding temperature ranges. You really don't need to crank the heat way up with these to cook your food. Cleaning is a breeze with Barkeeper's Friend Cookware Cleaner-12 oz which really works great and keep this set looking like new. This cooking set is just an excellent product and a great value!
