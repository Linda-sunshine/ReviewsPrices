review/summary: small, and top comes offreview/text: It definitely does the trick, but it could be better. It's a little on the small side and you need to wait for the water to go out of the top part and fill it again in order to get a full pitcher of water. But don't try pouring before it's finished filtering...the top will come off and water will spill all over you!
