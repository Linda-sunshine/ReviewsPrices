review/summary: Life saverreview/text: I should have bought two!! I hate lukewarm coffee but as a busy mom it is inevitable. This little device actually keeps it hot as I make everyone breakfast. I move it to my office when they go to school so it stays hot while I work. I wish it had an auto off after a few hours. I'm constantly leaving things on that should be shut off. Other than that I love it
