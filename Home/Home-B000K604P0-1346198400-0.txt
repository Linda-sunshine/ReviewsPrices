review/summary: Works Great--- But Leaks A Lotreview/text: Thermos works really well--- I'll make myself a cold drink with ice at 7 AM and upon returning at 5 PM there's still ice in it. The problem is, however, that it manages to leak out the front every time I close it and, somehow, it also gets a lot of liquid in the threads between the lid and thermos. Taking the lid off ALWAYS results in a massive mess and every sip I take causes liquid to run down the front of the thermos, usually on to me.I wouldn't buy again.Update 1/5/13:Raising to 4 stars. Turns out there's a line you can't fill past. It decreases the amount of liquid this thing can carry by quite a bit, but keeps all the liquid in it while drinking. It should be etched somewhere on it not to fill past the line OR the line should be clearly marked on the inside.
