review/summary: Bialetti Stovetop Espresso Makerreview/text: Coffee tastes just like the great coffee in France and Spain. Easy to use and to clean. It is not automatic, so you do have to watch to see when it is finished. I leave the lid slightly open so I can look inside and see when it has finished bubbling out coffee.
