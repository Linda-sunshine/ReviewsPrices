review/summary: Total junkreview/text: What a disappointment! This coffee maker failed totally on the first start up and leaked the entire amount of water all over my counter, in the cabinet drawers, onto my wood floor as well as damaged multiple cook books and other written material on the counter. I've never had a product fail so miserably on the initial start up. I would definitely not recommend this item to anyone. Despite it's high price, it's quality is as poor as any product I have ever purchased.
