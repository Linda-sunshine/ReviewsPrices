review/summary: low output sprayerreview/text: I was about to return this item because it did not work, but found that the sealing ring had fell into the bottle during shipment. This may have been a problem for others. Once I turned the bottle upside down and got the sealing ring, it worked.Filled the bottle about half way with olive oil and pumped 15 times. The spray output is about half or less of the oil bottle sprayers found in supermarkets, which makes it easier to control the amount of oil used in non-stick pans. If you are still on a low-fat diet, and haven't learned about low glycemic load diets yet, this sprayer will help to keep you struggling to lose or maintain your weight. However, if you are losing weight while using more oils in your diet, and use stainless steel or other &#34;sticky&#34; pans for frying in particular, you may need to do a second pumping to get enough oil from this product.In addition, as the oil is depleted in this sprayer, so will the output. In sum, if you are concerned about the environment and/or saving money on oil, this sprayer is a fair alternative to the gas filled ones
