review/summary: Comfortable rockerreview/text: I bought this for my daughter, who is expecting her first baby. Her and her husband had no trouble putting it together but found that after a couple of weeks, it started squeaking loudly. Her husband sprayed a lubricant on it and it hasn't been a problem since. She loves it.
