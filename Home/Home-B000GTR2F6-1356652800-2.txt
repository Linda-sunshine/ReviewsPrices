review/summary: Missing items from a sealed box!review/text: I bought my wife this item for Christmas. I was going to get a sample pack of k cups for it, but the item description (and the box) both say it includes a 12 cup sample pack. Once received, in a sealed shipping box, the item inside had been opened, the k-cups were removed, and the cord had also been unwound. Not amazon's fault since they ship in a sealed box from keurig, just poor QC on keurigs part. Not a good first impression!
