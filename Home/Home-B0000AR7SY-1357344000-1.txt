review/summary: Too much Staticreview/text: No matter what I did, the static using both oily beans and less oily (all very freshly roasted &#60;2 weeks), the drawer would spew grinds and chaff all over my counter. I am guessing that the drawer itself created too much static when grinding. The grinds for french press and drip were OK, not perfectly consistent but good for the price. Would not do espresso or turkish grind though in my opinion. Nice timer and relatively quiet. If you are wanting an inexpensive grinder this at least beats a blade...
