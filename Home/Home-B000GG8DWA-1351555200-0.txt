review/summary: optimus infrared heatersreview/text: I purchsed this heater last year for my office, and I love it. It sits next to me in my office and instant heat, I usually only need the 400 it does the job very well, my boss authorized me to purchase two more one for her office and one for mine! It is also very quiet which is a BIG plus for me, no smells! Really awesome for the price.
