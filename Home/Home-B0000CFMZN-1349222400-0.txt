review/summary: Won't buy another brandreview/text: I've tried other brands, which were not as durable. Pyrex has been doing this for a long time, and they know their stuff. I had this sucker fall of the countertop on to the handle without breaking, which is exactly how I destroyed my last one. Easy to read markers that won't wear off for a long time.
