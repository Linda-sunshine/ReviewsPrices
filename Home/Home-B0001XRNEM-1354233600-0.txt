review/summary: Surprisingly needed!review/text: I bought this having read reviews stating that the tamper with my espresso maker was sub standard. Those reviews were correct. 2 quick &#34;door knock&#34; tamps with this and the coffee is nicely set ready for the machine to do its thing. Definitely worth buying....really!
