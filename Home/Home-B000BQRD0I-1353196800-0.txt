review/summary: Wonderful!review/text: We have had this steamer for about two months. We bought it when our previous Conair steamer gave out. We like it so much better than the Conair. The steam is more consistent, the hand mitt is quite helpful, and the telescoping feature is awesome for storage. I almost wish the Conair would have bit the dust earlier and we wouldn't have tried to fix it so we would have gotten this one sooner!
