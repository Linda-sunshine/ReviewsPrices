review/summary: Best Popcorn Ever!review/text: Popping corn in this popper is fun and rewarding. Using the same corn I've used in my stainless steel Dutch oven, I get twice the yield and crisper, fresher tasting popcorn. It might not last forever as some reviewers have complained but for the price I'd be satisfied with replacing it every couple years. I'm planning to order more as gifts.
