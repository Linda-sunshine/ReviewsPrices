review/summary: Been wanting a ice cream maker for a while!review/text: I watched America's test kitchen recently and they recommended the smaller model. I read through the reviews and most said it was too loud. I decided to go with this one because it is 2-Quarts. I decided to use the recipe's and chose to do the vanilla bean ice cream (custard). The process to make the custard is a little time consuming, but worth it. I cooled it in an ice bath and it worked faster than expected. Poured the mix into the bucket, frozen for 24 hours and had no frost on the outside, put the machine together and everything worked great. The machine didn't turn off, nor did the mix get super hard, but had a nice creamy texture. I poured it into a container and followed the suggested instructions and stirred the mix in the freezer every 15 minutes. Amazing ice cream! Texture is perfect! I look forward to making frozen yogurt next.On clean up, the parts are easy to clean, including the bucket. I really like the clean and simple design and don't foresee any future problems.Update:I have made two more batches of ice cream with one not being a custard and the second being the original custard. The first non-custard had similar results where the machine did not turn off; however, texture was great and froze just fine. The second run with the custard I let the custard cool overnight and placed a cup of the custard in the freezer to reduce the temperature of the custard even more. This reduced the time a bit; however, the machine still didn't turn off. Moral of the story, keep an eye on the machine. I am still very pleased with the machine and would recommend it.
