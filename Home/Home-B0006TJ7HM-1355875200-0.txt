review/summary: Very happy!! Excellent set!review/text: We are in love with these knives! The combination of wood, stainless steel and black really give the set a sharp and elegant look... and, the best part is that they work awesome!! We've had these for the better part of a year now and they are still wonderful!Only thing I wish they had included was washing instructions. I have never put these in the dishwasher because I do not feel comfortable doing that without the expressed okay from the manufacturer. Unfortunately Ginsu did not include directions one way or the other about how to wash them.Anyway, they are awesome - and very much worth hand washing them all!
