review/summary: Lifesaverreview/text: I am a wildlife rehabilitator and this scale is standard issue for all of our rehabbers to carry with them in their cars for when they pick up baby wildlife. We have to weigh them in order to know how much to feed/hydrate/medicate, and this scale works perfectly and fits in a purse, diaper bag, pocket, glove box, etc. Plus it's SO cheap! I have never had to replace the batteries even once, and it has never needed recalibration. It just works.
