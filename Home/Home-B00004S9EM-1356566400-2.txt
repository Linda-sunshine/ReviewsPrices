review/summary: Great Quality, Daily Usereview/text: My family bought this as a gift for our mom as a replacement to her older Cuisinart food processor that she had had for years. She has had the new Cuisinart for about 8 months now and it is still working great. She uses it almost daily for everything from making hummus to chopping up vegetables for salsa to shredding cheese in large quantities. She makes most all of the family meals from scratch so this machine gets tons of use, and she loves how easy it is to use and to clean.
