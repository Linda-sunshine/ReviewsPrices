review/summary: Could be a five-star without much more effortreview/text: Love it. Cannot complain at all, really. Used it alot during the 2012 vegetable season here in Ohio when I was a member of a CSA. Now that Winter is in full swing, we are using it less. I don't like plastic...y'know --- it's &#34;chemical-y&#34;, which is why the stainless steel construction of this thing attracts me. I think it should come with a glass pitcher and a bamboo disposal bucket...that would make this slick! Imagine: as I admire my delicious, nutritious juice from the fruits and veggies I took great pains to get as fresh as possible to get the best juice quality, I have to look at it in a plastic pitcher that is just ever so slightly stained from months of carrot juice and beet juice instead of a crystal clear glass pitcher recently sanitized in my dishwasher. Ah, well...almost a home run. Yeah, everything else is as great as you've already heard from others. Works great, pretty dry waste, easy cleanup (although cleanup will always be a pain), love it!
