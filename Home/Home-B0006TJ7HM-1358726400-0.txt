review/summary: Nice to have knives that cutreview/text: After having the same set of knives for over 12 years I finally decided to get a new set and I'm very excited about these. They were a decent price and they cut very nicely. They are super sharp. I don't put them in the dishwasher so I'm hoping they will hold up over many years as my last set did. I would recommend these, they are definitely worth what I paid for them!
