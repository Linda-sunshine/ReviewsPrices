review/summary: Unbreakable is nicereview/text: I seem to always drop or otherwise destroy my glass coffee maker pots. I was really glad to come across this one on Amazon. I've noticed that French Press coffee tastes the best and it is great to have a French press that keeps the coffee hot, too. I've not had any problems with how it works. The inside fits well and it is easy to clean. Recently I've had to switch from real coffee to coffee substitutes and this works well for the brands that I have tried. I'm very happy with this product.Thermos Nissan 34-Ounce Vacuum Insulated Stainless-Steel Gourmet Coffee Press
