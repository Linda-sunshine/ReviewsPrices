review/summary: Lots of suction with brutal brushreview/text: Our upright was not getting our stairs as clean we wanted, so we bought this to do the job - and to take care of occasional spills.Things we LOVE about this Vacuum:+ Front guard is adjustable, making it great for our stairs.+ Rotating brush has it's own motor.+ Very Powerful. Our stairs have never been so clean.+ Holds a lot of dirt for its size.+ Nice long cord+ Works very well on both our carpeted stairs and wood floor.+ Handy crevice toolTHings I wish were better:- Loud- HeavyNote: Even though this is loud - most vacs are and a little heavy for its size, it does an swesome job. HIghly recommended.
