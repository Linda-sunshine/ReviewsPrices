review/summary: Looks great for the price but was a waste of money.....review/text: I was glad to see most of the reviews for this product were fairly good and for the price it almost seems too good to be true.... sadly it was too good to be true. The vacuum is small and light weight and very handy to have for the car and cleaning up pet hair. The first time i used it l couldn't have been happier however it worked once then the roller decided not to work after that. Suction started getting weaker and weaker. By the 3rd time of using the vacuum it failed to pick up anything and it now makes a nasty burning smell when i turn it on. i have tried cleaning out the pipe and the brush but nothing helps. l had high hopes but it was a Big disappointment. Save yourself 40 bucks and put it towards a decent vacuum is my advice.
