review/summary: Poor taste, much money.review/text: It's the first time I buy this brand of coffeemaker, and think it's the last. The coffee tastes like anything but coffeemaker, makes a horrible noise and is the first time I have to heat a pot for later use. For the money we pay, hubierse could buy two cheaper and better quality. Not recommended
