review/summary: Very Nice!review/text: These are very nice quality, thick flannel sheets. I love flannel, but it must be thick, not the flimsy stuff you find in most stores. These are lovely and plush, and do feel velvety to the touch, even after washing. They have all-around elastic and are deep enough to easily stay on my extra-thick mattress. They did shed a fair amount with the first washing, but I did not have to empty the lint trap halfway through drying. I did get shedding during the first use--little pills of flannel next to the bed. They shed less with the second washing, and so far, no shedding during this use, and the flannel remains smooth. I can't speak to how they hold up over time, but so far, they are well worth the money.
