review/summary: Great tasting coffee!review/text: I am not too picky concerning all of the fancy coffee beans and grinders some people use, but I know the taste of a well brewed cup of coffee and this little coffee maker comes through. This Presto coffee maker is ALL stainless steel, even though I saw a review stating that the stem was made out of aluminum. The stem is stainless steel as is all other parts of this item except the base and handles. I know metals very well since I was a buyer for metal fabrication manufacturing and there is nothing in this coffee maker that allows your coffee to be exposed to dangerous plastics or aluminum alloys. The coffee maker comes with a set of disposable filters which are really not necessry to use. Just put your coffee grounds straight into the basket and it brews the coffee just right. There is a very little bit of sediment on the last cup, but really no issue for me. I usually brew two cups in the morning and this is exacty the coffee maker I needed. No waste, no paper filters and no coffee that tastes like plastic like all of the drip coffee makers have. Highly recommended!
