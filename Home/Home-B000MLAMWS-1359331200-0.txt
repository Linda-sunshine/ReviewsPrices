review/summary: a superb machine; best tool in our kitchen!!review/text: We had a low-end KitchenAid mixer for 12 years. It was used nearly everyday, often more than once in a day. When time came to replace it, I simply asked my wife, &#34;What color do you want?&#34; She answered, &#34;Fire-engine Red!!&#34; I ordered it to arrive before Christmas baking time, 2012. My wife continues to exclaim daily, &#34;I love my machine!!&#34; There is nothing she cannot mix, and the mixing is superb - total down to the bottom and across the sides ... thorough. There is nothing more (as yet) that she can ask for.
