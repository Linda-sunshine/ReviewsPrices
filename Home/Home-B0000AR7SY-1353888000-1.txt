review/summary: Good on paper, poor manufacturing/quality control and had to returnreview/text: I really wanted this to work since I bought it after doing a lot of research. It's a nice solid and heavy piece of equipment. Tried some test grinds as soon as I unpacked the machine, since I would be using it for espresso and wanted to make sure it ground fine enough. Tested coarsest grind (just for the heck of it) and sure enough was extremely coarse (too coarse to be useful for anything). Then tried the 6th-finest grind (out of 16 possible)--too coarse for espresso but OK for filter though on the coarse side. Then tried the finest setting and surprise--it was super-COARSE (same as coarsest setting!!). Thought perhaps that the burrs weren't seated right (but it didn't make any strange noises which I would have expected had this been the case), so I reseated the burrs and tried again. This time finest setting was in fact finer than needed for espresso, so I thought the problem was fixed, but in the next try on the finest setting, it again came out much coarser (like for drip setting).Clearly this was a defective unit, and while I could just have returned it right away, I thought I'd try customer service of the manufacturer. Called and got voicemail(!), left a message and 2 hours later no response. So processed a return on Amazon (make sure you buy directly from Amazon.com, not "fulfillment by Amazon," if you decide to try this model anyway, since they pay for return shipping) and am trying the Baratza Virtuoso 586" (more expensive). Will review that one in due course.
