review/summary: Miserable to clean; only does a decent job grindingreview/text: I was so excited to get a conical bur grinder; I did a ton of research and settled on the Capresso because of cost and quality. And, at first, I was pretty happy with it. The grinder produced consistant grounds and made some excellent coffee. However, after using it for a couple of months, the cleaning became unbearable. You can't rinse any of the parts with water, and the little brush that comes with it just doesn't do the trick. In addition the design of the internal grinder is ludicrous - there are plastic tabs sticking out all over the place preventing you from actually cleaning all the grounds out. The final kicker came when I realized I was having to use %25 more whole bean coffee with this than my old grinder because so much gets stuck in the grind chamber and it doesn't come out until you take it apart (and it's getting worse the more I use it).To be clear, I have cleaned the grinder after each and every use; I have followed all of the instructions. It's just a poorly designed device. Stay away!
