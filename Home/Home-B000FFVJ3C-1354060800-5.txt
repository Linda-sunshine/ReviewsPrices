review/summary: Awesome machinereview/text: This dehydrator is my first dehydrator, it is great and lives up to its expectations. One thing people complain about other dehydrator is the fan noise, this one made very little noise - almost similar to turning on a mini oven.The cleanup is really simple, usually will some warm water and soap, and you're good to go.I made some beef jerkey on my first batch and it only took 4 hours to dry 5 pounds of beef. It's fast exactly as its advertised.Im a very happy customer and look forward to getting another one
