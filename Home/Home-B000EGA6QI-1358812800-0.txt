review/summary: 1st one died after 6 mos, 2nd one lost blades in my son's foodreview/text: The first one, almost 6 months to the day, just stopped working after routine use--started smoking, the connector housing suddenly stripped and suddenly it was done. Then this morning, the one I replaced it with, which gets daily use making babyfood and smoothies for my kids--the razor sharp serrated blades came off while making their food. Thank god it was just as it started--if it had stopped blending when most of it was blended up, I could have unknowingly served the blades to my kids. Shame on me for even buying a second one, but shame on Cuisinart because these are truly pieces of crap.
