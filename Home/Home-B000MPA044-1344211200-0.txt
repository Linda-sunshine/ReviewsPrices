review/summary: This Is Wonderful Even When I'm Not Rushedreview/text: I've always had a certain reluctance to use a pressure cooker because I figured I'd suffer massive burns to my face and upper extremities, but I finally bit the bullet and decided to try this. It's been a really good experience except now I have no reason to make reservations because my husband knows I can make dinner fast. No need to defrost foods, say cooking is too messy to be bothered with, or even that I am not much of a cook. If you can read an instruction book to learn the basics of operation and have just some creativity or even just have a pressure cooker recipe book you can do this.Using this pressure cooker is pretty much a no brainer as well as well as a one pot operation. In prepping a meal if you need to saut&eacute; or braise meat or vegetables this pressure cooker has those functions. When everything is ready, add any additional ingredients and your off and running in pressure cooking mode. You can make Mac and Cheese, Beef Bourginon, dixie style BBQ shredded beef or pork, ribs, beans, chicken and rice with veggies, pot roast, Italian beef. The only limitations are your imagination or having shot through your cookbook. You can throw meat in frozen and you can use cheaper cuts of meat since the pressure breaks down the fiber in tougher cuts.This is also good for making homemade stocks with little to no sodium, soups, stews, etc.Clean-up is easy. A simple soap and water wash will clean the stick free interior pot and as well as the cookers lid.While this doesn't do everything, such as deep frying, it is a healthier way to eat as well as a money saver. It is a low maintenance appliance that is fun to use and doesn't heat up the entire kitchen. Last night we had stuffed peppers. Before it was a 4 hour cooking process but it now takes about 30 minutes.My only criticism is that I wish this were a little bigger for the times when I entertain a crowd.
