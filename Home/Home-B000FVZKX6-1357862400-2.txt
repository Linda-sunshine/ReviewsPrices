review/summary: Perfect for any season!review/text: We had a set of queen, chamois color for about two years and wore them out. Just ordered a set of smokey blue. These sheets are perfect in both summer and winter. It's hard to believe, but they really are! Durable and no pilling either. They do shed a lot of lint in the dryer, but that's hardly a complaint. I can't wait to get the new set :)
