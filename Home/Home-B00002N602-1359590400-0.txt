review/summary: Cheap Chinese Manufacturereview/text: Handles are held on by one screw which will crack the cheap plastic if you tighten to much. Presto used to make a fine product ... then they shipped manufacture overseas to create a larger profit and you guesed it, cheap chinese product. Period.
