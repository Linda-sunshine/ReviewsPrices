review/summary: Where is the true espresso experience and taste?review/text: I love robust coffee and wanted to have a true Italian espresso maker and its corresponding taste experience. What a huge disappointment. The coffee is easy to brew, but the taste is anything that one would expect in an espresso. The recommended amount of coffee (and I used the Italian Espresso) is either too little or simply lacking in robustness. I would not recommend this coffee maker or it's corresponding coffee.
