review/summary: Love my new juicerreview/text: This juicer does a great job. The only complaint I have is that the manual says, "with the motor running, place food into the feed chute and use the food pusher to gently guide food down." I wind up putting the food in first and then turning the motor on, otherwise the food shoots out onto the counter even when putting the food in and quickly covering it with the food pusher. Easy to use and easy clean up.
