review/summary: Great for various liquids but more directional control neededreview/text: One contribution that I can add the existing 800 reviews is that the Misto can be used for more than olive oil. For example, if you need to spray lemon juice juice on certain foods before baking, the Misto is a great tool. Regardless of viscosity, liquids used in cooking can be applied with Misto, saving time and money.Overall, the Misto will pay for itself in olive oil savings compared to drizzling. Yet the mist created tends to float where it is not wanted, such as onto countertops. Some additional control over the direction of atomized olive oil would be appreciated. Misto might consider a plastic pipe that attaches to the nozzle as is often the case with industrial oil spray cans.
