review/summary: Wonderfully simply in todays complex world.review/text: I often do not write reviews, but I love this little electric tea kettle. Heats very rapidly, water is an excellant temp for tea. I debated between 4 & 5 stars because the negatives that I have are not a big issue for me, although some might want to know. It is a good thing the pot is simple, because the directions for use are almost non-existant. I may be slow, but when I took the little pot out of the box, there was a clear plastic flipper on the top of the handle. I could not figure out what it was for and the directions did not say. I plugged the pot in with some water and there did not seem to be any indication it was heating, until I flipped the clear tab to see what it would do and it lit up. Oh, so you pull up the little clear flipper on the top of the handle to turn on. Okay. It would have been nice if the directions stated that. The only other possible issue that is not a concern for me is that when the water boils the clear plastic flipper trips down and the heat stops immediately, but there is no whistle or other indicator unless you hear the snap of the flipper as it trips. It is not a big issue, because the water boils so rapidly and if I do forget, it is a quick heat up. I love it.
