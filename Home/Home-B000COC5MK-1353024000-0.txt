review/summary: Sleek looking and works greatreview/text: Went to Consumers Reports for recommendations - this one came out on top. Works quickly and efficiently. I sort of miss the more elegant looking openers I've used in the past, but they broke (which is why I bought this one). Looking forward to years of use.
