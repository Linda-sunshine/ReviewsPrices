review/summary: SteamFastreview/text: The SteamFast met all my expections. I had to dress tables for awedding shower. My only suggestion, don't expect to do all thepressing once the tables are dressed. Do your "ironing" first,then press out the wrinkles from the travel. The SteamFast worked,but it takes much longer to do the complete job. I would certainlyrecommend the SteamFast.
