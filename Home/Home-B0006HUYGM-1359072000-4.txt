review/summary: Believe the great reviews!review/text: Bought this to use on our boat. Almost got a cordless, then saw the reviews on this little guy. Reasons to buy over cordless are suction power, beater bar and not having to toss it in a year or two after batteries no longer charge. Nice compact size, although it is not tiny. AMAZING suction power! Picked up much more than our upright and the beater bar actually pulled up the carpet pile much nicer too! Vacuumed the whole boat in about 10 minutes. Love how the hose works just by pulling it out - no switch to flip or valve to close. Be nice if the hose could be longer, but then it would not be as compact. Easy to empty. Oh, it is pretty darn quiet for this powerful of a vacuum - quieter than all the other little vacs I have ever used. Only thing I noticed was that on deep pile carpet, I had to use two hands when the beater bar was in use as it wanted to bog down going forward with it. Very happy with purchase here on Amazon with Prime!
