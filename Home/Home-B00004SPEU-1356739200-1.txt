review/summary: Does the job and is affordable.review/text: I've had a Krups for years with no problem at all. Before the Krups, I had another brand and the blades broke. I bought this for a gift, just right for someone who likes coffee. Also, it is less expensive than most others. In this case, THERE IS a difference when you grind your own beans. It only takes a minute and the outcome is much better coffee. Go Krups. You won't be disappointed
