review/summary: Absolutely love mine!review/text: I've had my Cuisinart for about 6 months now and love it - the chopper really works well and its nice not to have to lug out my big food processor to chop just a little bit of this and that. The immersion blender works really well with soups too, I made carrot soup with it and it was really well blended and pureed. Milkshakes, smoothies are a breeze with this little gadget and it is small enough to fit right in on my kitchen countertop. Like I said before, I love my Cuisinart.
