review/summary: Fantastic!review/text: This little meat grinder is fantastic. We moved to a country where ground beef tends to include cartlidge and bone. To cope, we decided to grind out our own meat. I decided to go with this little meat grinder since it was inexpensive and seemed to be scaled well for our needs.When I first received it, I was suprised and disappointed at how small it is. It's could probably fit in a ladie's shoebox with room to spare. However, it has been beyond sufficient for our needs. We've had this meat grinder for about 4 months and been consistently grinding about 2.5 lbs of tough beef every couple of weeks. I've even used it to grind meat that was still partially frozen and it took it like a champ. I haven't seen much wear or tear, but the handle is getting a little loose.I would definitely recommend this little grinder to anyone who is looking for a cheap and easy meat grinder. Be warned, it is made almost entirely of plastic except for the grinding blade and grate. I do expect it to wear out relatively quickly compared to higher quality grinders. However, if it wears out from use, we would probably buy the same grinder since it's the perfect size for us.Note: I haven't used the sausage or pasta making attachments so this review is for the meat grinding aspects only.
