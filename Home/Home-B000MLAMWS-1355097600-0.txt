review/summary: Good machinereview/text: My wife swears by this brand and this size is the one to get so you will always have room for all your ingredients without worrying about them spilling over the top of the bowl. The power is excellent. Haven't had any problems so far. Have owned this for about 3 years. It does sound like it is laboring when doing heavy dough but never noticed any smell from overheating. So far so good. I think it's just normal for this machine to make a somewhat whiny noise when pushed hard which may have to do with it being a direct drive motor. No regrets here except it should have come with the rubber bladed mixing attachment. My wife uses that all the time but we had to purchase it separately. For your consideration I will add that we have never made bread dough with this machine and my wife states that none of her recipes result in a particularly stiff dough. Many of the negative reviews here seem to focus on stiff bread dough and making multiple batches of it at once.
