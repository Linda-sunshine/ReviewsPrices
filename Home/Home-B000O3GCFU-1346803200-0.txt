review/summary: Good for packing baby food. Clean and safety.review/text: This Jar could hold warm food for five hours and cold food for up to 7 hours. So its easy for mom to preparing the baby food first as going out. Also I like the stainless steel which is much safe than plastic one and glass one. It's small so easy to put in the handbag and I like the color as well. Very easy to clean it. Highly recommended!
