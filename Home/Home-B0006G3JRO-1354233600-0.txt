review/summary: Great for smoothiesreview/text: I have been using the hand blender every morning to make smoothies. It just takes me seconds to blend various fruits. Like the product so much. Be careful with the push button though, you may press it without realizing it. I directly unplug the cord whenever I stop the blender.So far I only use the chopper once to chop onion, garlic and chilli and it worked well.
