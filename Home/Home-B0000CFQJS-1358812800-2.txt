review/summary: Great Itemreview/text: I drink a lot of coffee. I bought this, because I feel that paper filters tend to take some of the flavor away from coffee, when it brews through. Paper filters might be cheap and easy to dispose of. But in the long run, you'll save. Keep this filter clean and it will last forever.
