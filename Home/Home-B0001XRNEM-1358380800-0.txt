review/summary: Tamps Well - Remember, Hand Wash Onlyreview/text: I use this tamper with the De'Longhi EC155 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker and the Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker. The smaller side fits the De'Longhi and the larger one is just a tad smaller than the Bialetti basket. It works as intended - I love the versatility of having a smaller and larger tamper together. It's a big improvement over the piece of plastic that sticks out on the side of the De'Longhi EC155.The Terry's Tamper is intended to be washed by hand - and it says so right on the label. It is NOT dishwasher safe, so ignore the manufacturer's directions at your own risk. I found all it needs is a quick rinse and dry - the tamper touches dry coffee grounds only, and it really does not need any scrubbing.
