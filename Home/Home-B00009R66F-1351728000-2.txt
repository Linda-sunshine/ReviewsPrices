review/summary: Best of the home machinesreview/text: I have used several home carpet cleaners over the years and this model although not ideal is the best of the lot. I have owned this one for 4+ years and clean my carpet about every 3 months due to a dog who is half pig.Thumbs down:The machine developing a spray pattern that is erratic and leaves too much water in places. However the water is visible and the suction will clean it up.Thumbs up:Some of the plastic on this model is a little more durable than what is on some of the other models(try to be careful with all of these things).The 2 main advantages for me with this model are 1) that it enables me to get my carpet cleaner than other machines as I can use a cup of white vinegar in a tank rather than any commercial soap solution (I have found that those soapy cleaning solutions actually attract dirt unless you take the added steps of rinsing the carpet a couple of times after cleaning. And 2) I have also found that if you use extremely hot water in the tank, the solution will come out of the machine warm rather than tepid which aids in getting the carpet cleaner.
