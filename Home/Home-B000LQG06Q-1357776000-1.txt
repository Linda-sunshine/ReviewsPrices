review/summary: Sold itreview/text: I had it on my bed for less than 2 weeks. My girlfriend bought it from me for 50 bucks just yesterday. I was oddly having breathing problems. Never had that feeling before, doctor said to lose it. Had let it air out for a few days time prior to sleeping, but the mint smell is atrocious. It did fade, and it mostly gone now. My friends 10 year old daughter used it last night, and she loves it.
