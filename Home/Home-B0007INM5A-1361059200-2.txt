review/summary: Did not work for me and my Senseo machinereview/text: I was really excited to be able to re-use these filter pods and use whatever coffee I wanted in my Senseo machine, but I never achieved a satisfactory cup of coffee. I ground fine. I ground medium. I over packed. I under packed. All the cups turned out weak and undrinkable. Great idea, but does not work at all. Maybe I will try making my own filter, like one of the reviews on this page described. But for so much mess, I'd almost rather just keep buying the Senseo and Melitta pods as long as they're available.
