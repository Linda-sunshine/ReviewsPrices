review/summary: It's a winner!!review/text: As a long time firm believer that there is no such thing as a "non stick" cooking surface I have finally been proven wrong by T-Fal. I have used this item almost every day and can't believe how nothing, not one thing has even come close to sticking to it. No oil, no butter, nothing is needed unless of course you prefer to use a little for flavoring. Clean up is a breeze and I swear it comes so clean with so little effort I could re-wrap it sell it as new. I have had little to no luck at all with so called non-stick cooking surfaces through the years but now I'm a believer, well in T-Fal anyway. Now for the "cons" which to me are not really that much of a draw back. As other reviewers have stated this pan is big, it's large but at least there is plenty of room to maneuver whatever it is you're cooking in it. Also, as others have stated once the pan heats up it develops a slight crown in the middle (which prevented me from giving this item a five star rating) which makes oil and any other liguid run to the sides. Some might find this feature annoying but it really is no reason not to purchase this cooking item. The "Thermo-spot indicator" is a great feature when used as directed, it really is a great cooking aid. My family knows how much I laugh at the idea of non stick cookware but thanks to this T-Fal pan I can no longer laugh. Well except for the other junk I've purchased through the years.
