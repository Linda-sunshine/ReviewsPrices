review/summary: Great Value!review/text: We received our 6-quart, washed it, and immediately put it to use cooking a roast. The meat was perfectly cooked to the same consistency throughout. The clean up of the enameled dutch oven was quick and easy. We will definitely be looking at Lodge for our future cast iron purchases.
