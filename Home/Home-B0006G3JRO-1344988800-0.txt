review/summary: Works Better Than I Thought it Wouldreview/text: I'd bought this mostly for the hand blender part, with the other pieces mostly being extras I hadn't thought much of and didn't think I'd use. When I recieved it the whisk seemed especially flimsy.The whisk has a lot more power to it than one would think, easily beating up some cookie dough I'd been working on. The processor also worked much better than I'd expected (no having to constantly re-dice things after removing them from the processor), and the hand blender is excellent for smoothies!
