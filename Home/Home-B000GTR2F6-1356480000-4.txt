review/summary: 150 degrees - NOT 191 degreesreview/text: Got a new B70 because the older model never got the water hot enough. I was told this one would DEFINITELY get hot enough.Set the machine to 191 degrees and not one cup (of the first three cups brewed) ever got above 155 (with three different thermometers).So, if you don't drink your coffee in 7 minutes....you're drinking a warm cup.JUNK JUNK JUNK.I hate friggen wasting money.Back it goes tomorrow.
