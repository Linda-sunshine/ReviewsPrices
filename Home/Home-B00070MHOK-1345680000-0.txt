review/summary: Did I get a used/refurbished one?review/text: I've only used this steamer twice, and both times it did what it is advertised to do and that's to get wrinkles out of clothes. I have not used it several times to allow it opportunity to leak and spew hot water over everything like some of the other reviewers suggest. I will say this thing is not feature packed. There is no on and off switch or button to control the steam flow. The description of the product is entirely accurate. Once plugged in, this steamer boils water and emits the steam byproduct. There's nothing fancy about how it works, so make sure you buy the product knowing what exactly it is, and be sure not to criticize it for what it clearly is not. It's a simple and compact device that produces steam without other functionality.** On a side note, when I received this product from Amazon, I noticed the heat plate inside looked to be losing its finish. It looked patchy and inconsistent, almost as if the finish had been worn off with use. Has anyone else who received this product noticed this, or did I perhaps get a refurbished or used unit? Thanks in advance for the info.
