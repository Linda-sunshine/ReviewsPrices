review/summary: Nice Little Coffee Makerreview/text: I received this from Amazon in just a few days. It was nicely packaged to prevent any shipping damage. It is well made and makes great coffee, and quickly too. I like the small footprint so that is doesn't take up much counter space. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants just a couple of cups of coffee at one time. I would even recommend it to my fussy sister who likes her coffee just right.
