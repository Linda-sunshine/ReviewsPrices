review/summary: one of my favorite kitchen toolsreview/text: My old salad shooter's shredding cone finally cracked after many years of hard service grating block cheese and vegetables. This is a bigger & more powerful model. It grates, shreds, slices...saves money because I always buy block cheese & shred it fresh myself. Clean up is a breeze. Goes in the dishwasher. Easy to use and isn't heavy or cumbersome to drag out from the pantry. Use it all the time...love it.
