review/summary: dudreview/text: I bought mine in 2006. I had the older 5qt model for 20 years, and was excited for an upgrade--well, I should have kept the old one. I do a lot of baking: breads, cookies, cakes. Now,I avoid using my 6qt 575watt pro series. The very first day I used it, it overheated making brioche, which requires 15 minutes of kneading. The old one never did. Should have sent it back then, really stupid of me, but given the Kitchenaide name, I gave them benefit of the doubt. Since then, it has only gotten worse. It smells when it runs, it drips grease from the seam at where the motor head meets the vertical stand, it makes a scraping sound when it runs, and it constantly overheats. I have called Kitchenaide repeatedly over the years, to no avail. The latest thing they told me was that I should "run the mixer on high speed for a minute, once per week" because the motor is "intentionally overpacked with grease," that, they claimed, would stop the dripping. It did not. Terrible product, cheaply made for the money, and poor customer service as well.
