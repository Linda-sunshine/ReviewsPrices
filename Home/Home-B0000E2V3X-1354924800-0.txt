review/summary: Lodge Pizza Pan is perfect for Beginner or Proreview/text: I always thought you had to be a great cook to make good Pizzas but now after having the two Lodge Pizza Pans we now know the truth that just about anyone can make great Pizzas. I seasoned the pans a couple more times and now the Pizzas just about slide right out of the pan with no sticking at all in most cases and they just wipe clean ready for the next Pizzas Party. My wife gets the Pepperoni and cheese at Costco so our price per Pizza is very low so even though $70.00 seems high for two pans in the long run they pay for them selves. We first tried making Pizzas in our large cast iron skillet and it was good but we like making them in the Lodge cast iron Pizza Pans much better.
