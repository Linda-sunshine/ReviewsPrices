review/summary: Illiterate or duplicitous?review/text: Just bought it, haven't used it, but no matter how well it works, I gave it the lowest rating available.The package, the ads, an the instructional enclosure it tout "FREE" stuff, BUT, when you register, to get your FREE stuff, you must pay $5.15.Not much money, but, then, not FREE, as implied.There is a footnote in their enclosure that "clarifies" what they mean by "Free," but the type is small enough to be written on the edge of a dime, and two lines would fit the edge of a nickel. Legal, perhaps, but not what I would consider open an honest regarding their intent.This is unethical and perplexing on many levels, and certainly an insult to customers.On a positive note, it works quite well. Though the mechanism appears a bit fragile, careful handling should enable it to last quite a while. The thin, aluminum pot does have the advantage of transferring heat quickly yet not retaining heat, so a medium high heat source enables one to pop corn without scorching or even discoloration. As others have suggested, and as recommended by the maker, avoid high heat. I would further suggest erring on the low side and working up to an effective level for your heat source.J
