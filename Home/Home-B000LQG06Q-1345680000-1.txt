review/summary: The best mattress topper I've ever bought!!!!!!!review/text: My son just started college two days ago. We needed to purchase bedding to make his dorm room more comfortabe so I went on line to find items that would make the transition a little easier for him. This mattress topper is amazing and fits the bed perfectly. Everyone knows how uncomfortable a dorm bed is, this makes all the difference in the world. He had a terrific night's sleep and loves his bed! The only down side, is that his roommates are a little jealous. hahaha
