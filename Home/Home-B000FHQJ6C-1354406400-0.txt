review/summary: Good starter juicerreview/text: I juice several times a week. Easy to clean - it is a juicer so it does take time to clean, but it's not difficult once you get a system. It has been a couple of months and it is holding up well. It works best for harder vegetables/fruit - apples carrots celery. Not super at extracting from leaves - spinach, etc.
