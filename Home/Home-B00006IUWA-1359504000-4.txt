review/summary: great popperreview/text: Replacement for the same popper I have owned for years, it made at least one full load a week if not two for at least five years. It just recently started to over heat if I tried to make two loads in a row. I tried another brand, but really wasn't near as good as the Presto. I susequentlt bought the Presto and it's just as good as the first one was. I recommend it to anyone in the market for an air popper.
