review/summary: can't beat it for the pricereview/text: does what it's supposed to...we bought it to use as a spice grinder. so far no complaints! it's cheap, and you get what you pay for, but it gets the job done, and the wind up power cord is a nice touch to keep the wire out of the way since we don't use it all that often.
