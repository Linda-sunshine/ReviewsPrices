review/summary: This is amazing!review/text: I love my Pizzazz. My wife makes fun of it all the time but it makes great frozen pizzas. I haven't used it for anything else but need to try. It makes great frozen pizzas in about 12-15 minutes. No preheating time needed. I don't understand some of the complaints about this unit. Defective units can happen but other than that, anyone should be able to make a frozen pizza quick and easy. The cooking tray is easy to clean too.
