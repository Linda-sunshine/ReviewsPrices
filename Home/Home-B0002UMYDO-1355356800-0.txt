review/summary: It was nice while it lastedreview/text: I like the design of this can opener. The size is right for a small kitchen. Unfortunately it stopped working after a year. I've given up on electric can openers and bought a very high grade hand opener. It actually handles easier than any electric can opener I've ever owned.
