review/summary: Amazing difference in my bedroomreview/text: After using it for just 2 hours in my bedroom, I started to noticed that the air I breathed in was clearer and I felt easier to breath! Only con is that it's super loud, even on the lowest setting. I leave it on during day when I'm at work and turn it off at night, so the noise doesn't bother me. I've used many small air purifiers before, but they didn't have the same effect as this large! I'm so glad that I decided to step it up with this larger unit.
