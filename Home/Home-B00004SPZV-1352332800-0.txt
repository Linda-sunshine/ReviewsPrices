review/summary: Love my Misto - A Little Troubleshooting Helpreview/text: I bought my Misto in July 2011. I still love it! There are guidelines to using it, though. You never fill it more than half full. Also ALWAYS make sure to de-pressurize it after you're done with it (simply untighten the lid to release pressure the screw back in place). If you don't do so, it can cause problems. I only this past week, for the first time, neglected to do so and left it sitting on the counter for about 20 minutes. When I went to use it again, it would not mist! The oil came out in a stream. Panic attack! I first tried filling it with hot water and a little soap. It misted fine, but when I emptied it and replace it with oil, it still sprayed in a stream. So, I found a recipe for a natural degreaser and tried it. THIS IS WHAT WORKED: I filled the can halfway with equal parts white vinegar and ammonia. I pumped and sprayed, pumped and sprayed until it was completely empty. I repeated this step again. I then filled it halfway with hot water, pumped and sprayed a few times, cleaned and rinsed it out well, then emptied the can and filled halfway again with my olive oil. I pumped and sprayed and voila!! It works and has been working fine ever since! I'm so pleased! I would have purchased a new sprayer if I had to, but thankfully, after this little procedure, it's working like a charm once again!!
