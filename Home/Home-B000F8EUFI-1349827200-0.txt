review/summary: Doesn't come with a filterreview/text: The vacuum shipped with no issue. When I turned it on to vacuum it was picking up dirt, however dust came flying out of the front of it. The picture displays a filter and my assumption was a filter would come with it. I then went back online to find out what filter it should have and it suggested the F1, so with an immediate need I ran out to get it. The filter didn't fit, so I order it online, and the F1 still didn't fit. I should have read the directions, or called dirtdevil instead of relying on Amazon to lead me in the right direction, because an F2 filter is needed, which is half the size of an F1. I called dirtdevil and found a local dealer to purchase the F2 filter.
