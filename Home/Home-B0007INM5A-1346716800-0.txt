review/summary: Not for Hamilton Beach machinesreview/text: I tried these with my Hamilton Beach One Cup pod brewer and they do not work. The "coffee" that came out was weaker than tea. I ended up tossing the pod filter into the hot water into the cup (which actually did work).As other reviewers mentioned, it seems the hot water has to be forced through the filter in order to extract the flavor. The Senseo machines do this; the Hamilton Beach machines do not. The name does state "for the Classic Senseo".Believe it.
