review/summary: Poorly Seasonedreview/text: This product is &#34;pre-seasoned,&#34; but after only one use the seasoning came off and the inside of the lid rusted. I used it to make a one pot meal of black beans and rice. I browned salt pork on the range, added the beans, rice and stock, and baked at baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. The food came out great but the pot was ruined. I think the pot might have been OK if I stripped it down to bare metal with oven cleaner and seasoned it properly. I don't like it enough to invest that much effort in it so I returned it.
