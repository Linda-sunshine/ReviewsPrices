review/summary: Pyrex in name only, not materialsreview/text: Just had one of these 'modern' 'Pyrex' measuring cups shatter with little to no temp change. It is dangerous for them to call this soda lime glass Pyrex it is not borosilicate like pyrex was originally... this means it is NOT temp shock proof. WARNING this is not pyrex in materials, only in name.
