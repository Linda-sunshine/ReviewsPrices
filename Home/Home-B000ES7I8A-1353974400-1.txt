review/summary: Looks over performancereview/text: As a Brit, an electric kettle is an essential piece of kitchen equipment for me, and I've used many brands/models in my lifetime. This is the worst in terms of function, with several curious design flaws. For starters the swivel lid is counter-productive in at least two ways. 1) It dumps accumulated dust & debris directly into the kettle. 2) It reduces potential kettle capacity by about a third. Secondly, the auto-shutoff takes an excessively long time to activate, and worse, when you lift the kettle off the base it DOES NOT SHUT OFF. That's a basic safety issue, as once you've emptied out the water it should not be possible to put a "live" kettle back onto the base to boil dry. Lastly, the spout has a very broad pouring area, much wider than is suggested by the small channel that looks like the spout. This does make a difference if you're aiming boiling water at a small aperture, for whatever reason. Again, a safety issue.So, if you're looking for stainless-kettle-as-eye-candy, then this one will look pretty in your kitchen. However it's definitely form over function for this item, and I can't recommend it.
