review/summary: Brita Slim Pitcherreview/text: Love this pitcher!! Slim style really works for my overstocked refrigerator. I've owned full-sized pitchers, but when full are too heavy and take up too much space. This really has given me incentive to drink more water. I usually only drink ice water; but then the ice gives me an off-taste. But not since I don't need to use the ice anymore. I've been recommending this to others, and the price was great too!
