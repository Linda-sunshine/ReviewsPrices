review/summary: Terrible pilling after several washes and a month of usereview/text: These sheets look nice and were quite soft after the second wash, but after the third wash and approximately a month of use, they began to pill all over. They now look and feel cheap. I'm very disappointed because I have purchased similarly priced 600 thread-count sheets on Amazon before that lasted for many years before wearing out. I feel ripped off.
