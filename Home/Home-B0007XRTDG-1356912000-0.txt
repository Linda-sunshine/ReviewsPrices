review/summary: We Keep Buying Presto'sreview/text: We've used skillets for years and though we've tried others, find that the Presto is the one we keep coming back to. Being dishwasher safe is a BIG plus.Usually hand washing is fine but every so often you just need to get all the gunk off all over. Non-stick works well though we know that we'll be getting another one on or about May 2014. Highly recommended.
