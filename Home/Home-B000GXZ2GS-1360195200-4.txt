review/summary: I'm convinced!review/text: I was very skeptical about the AeroPress because I was devoted to my French Press. Curiosity go the best of me and I finally put the AeroPress to the test. Put me down as a convert. The AeroPress is astounding. This strange looking, plastic contraption makes a fantastic, marvelous cup of coffee. It's simple, easy to use, so easy to clean, and an all-around joy to have. I roast and grind my own beans - I'm very fussy about my coffee - and I am now a true believer!BTW, different coffee lovers have different ideas of how to use the AeroPress, and I am having a great time experimenting with different methods. I can do this, because the amount of control over the process is fabulous.
