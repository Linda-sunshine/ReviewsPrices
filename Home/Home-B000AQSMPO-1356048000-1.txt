review/summary: Taste like instant coffee.review/text: I was so excited to buy this machine, once I tried it, I was very disappointed. It tasted like watery instant coffee. When I took it back to the store the cashier said he had heard the same thing from other people. e said the Keurig Vue was much better...plus, the coffee is too expensive.
