review/summary: Unhappyreview/text: If you use this vacuum on a carpeted floor, carpet fibers stick to the hose and the base. I have to vacuum the vacuum to keep from getting carpet fibers on everything. This did not happen on my old Eureka Boss. It is also very loud. I really don't like it, but I waited too long to say this so I'm stuck with it.
