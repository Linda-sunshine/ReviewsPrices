review/summary: Fast, efficient juice extractorreview/text: This juicer is great - powerful, easy to clean, and efficient. I recommend lining the bin with a bag before you start juicing. It makes cleaning a breeze! The only complaint I have with this unit is that it's really loud, but it does do an excellent job of getting most of the juices from all the different kinds of vegetables and fruits that I juice. Great price too!
