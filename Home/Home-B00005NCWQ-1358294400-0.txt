review/summary: good coffee, cheaper than electric percreview/text: I would have got an electric perc though as the design of this pot requires the entire amount of water to be in a rolling boil vs other designs only need the water at the bottom of the pipe to be boiling for it to start percolating. This is probably due to the large flat design of this pot. Average time to make a pot with this is about 7-10 minutes on coil burner
