review/summary: Wouldn't know how to live without itreview/text: I remember when my mother got others, she wished she'd gotten it much earlier. She thought about all the holiday cooking that could have been done easier, so when I moved into my first home and was planning my first time cooking Thanksgiving, I asked for my own.The beautiful thing about having a stand mixer on your counter, is it makes any recipe that involves mixing seem easier. I never shirk from whipping up a quick batter anymore, because my tools are already at hand. Speaking of whipping, whipped cream couldn't be easier, and whipping eggs to stiff peaks is child's play. Could you do this all by hand? Sure, but being able to let the machine do the work is brilliant.My favorite side dish, smashed potatoes, is made into child's play with the mixer, I just put in boiled potatoes with skins on, pour in the cream, and let the blade do the work.The best tip I ever got for using it comes from Cooks Illustrated. You can just toss in a head of garlic with the papery skin taken off, after you've pressed it to the counter with your hand to loosen the cloves, and then let the paddle blade mix the head around. This will remove the peel and separate the cloves.Tips:1) Keep it on the counter. If you don't you will never use it.2) Get a beater blade of some kind. I adore mine from metro blade designs. It's well worth it.
