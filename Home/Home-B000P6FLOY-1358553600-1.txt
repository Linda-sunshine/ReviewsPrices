review/summary: Good thermometerreview/text: Bought this to use for my homebrew making. The one I had that came in the kit was pretty useless and wouldn't be good in boiling water. You can set the temperature you want to reach and leave the thermometer in the water and it'll notify you when you do. The cord it comes with is plenty long enough, about 2 feet long, i think. Would recommend.
