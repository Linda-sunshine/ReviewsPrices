review/summary: Open a Wine Bottle in No Time!review/text: I loved this purchase! I haven't used the wine chiller yet, but I love the opener. It is so easy to use and the cork comes out so fast! You do have to use some strength when pushing the opener against the cork, so it took me a few tries the first time to be able to get it right. Love it!
