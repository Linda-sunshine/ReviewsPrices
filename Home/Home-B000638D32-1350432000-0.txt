review/summary: Sharp, well balanced knifereview/text: This Victorinox Chef's knife is sharp out of the package. The knife is well balanced in hand. The handle is comfortable to hold. Cuts cleanly and quickly (keep fingers away!) Cuts vegetables, fruits and meat equally well.Swiss-made, this knife should provide years of service.
