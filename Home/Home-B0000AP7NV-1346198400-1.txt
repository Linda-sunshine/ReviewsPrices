review/summary: No frill pitcherreview/text: I got this for myself, for a single person apt. The slim pitcher is perfect for such use, its compact, so doesnt take huge space if you live in studio, it stores only enough water for 1-2 people, so you dont end up drinking stale water. The filters work well. It even comes with tiny sticker with reminder for replacing the filters.
