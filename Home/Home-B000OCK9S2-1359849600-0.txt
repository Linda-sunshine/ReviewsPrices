review/summary: Not as good as I hopedreview/text: I was really hoping this would block out the rest of my family when I want to go to sleep early and they want to watch tv. Unfortunately the volume doesn't work well and the channels keep wavering. The blue backlight is extremely bright and I have to put something in front of it to block the light. Kinda defeats the purpose that I bought it for.
