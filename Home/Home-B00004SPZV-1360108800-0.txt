review/summary: Won't be buying Pam Olive Oil Spray anymorereview/text: And at $3.60 a can that's good. This a neat little item to have in you kitchen and looks good too. Works just like it's advertised and is easy to use. I was a little confused when I got it because I thought it was a pump spray, but it's not. You actually pressurize it by pumping the top about 10 times and then it sprays just like store brands. Plus you get to choose what kind of Olive Oil you like, how good is that?
