review/summary: Great Grinderreview/text: This is an awesome grinder for the budget concious. Although you can't measure anything it's simple - Press the button and it grinds. Want coarse grind? Give it about 6-8 pulses. Open it up - not ground enough? Give it another pulse or two. I use this for coffee in my french press and I have minimal grounds in my cup when I'm finished.I love this thing - it's been used practically every day for the last 8 months and it still works great. I personally do not use it to grind spices but it certainly could be used in that way. Mine is for coffee only! Really great product, really great price.
