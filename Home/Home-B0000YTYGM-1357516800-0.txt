review/summary: Not very good....review/text: After using it for a week or so it totally fell apart. The coffee did not keep hot for as long as it should have and I think that has to do with the locking system on the lid. I love the principal of keeping the coffee hot and have used other brands of thermal coffemakers. The main reason I went with the Cuisinart was the 12 cup Thermal. At the time there were not many 12 cup Thermals to select from. I have always loved the Cuisnart products but this one fell short.
