review/summary: Wish it had a smaller lever mechanismreview/text: I drink a lot of water, typically at least a gallon a day. My husband was always complaining about needing to fill the Brita so we thought this would be a great alternative. I'm actually pretty disappointed. I can't for the life of me fill a glass of water with one hand! I wish the lever were smaller so that I could hold my glass and just use one finger to pull the lever down. This is a big deal for me since I just about always have my infant son in my arms. I wish I had stuck with the Brita.....
