review/summary: Work well although priceyreview/text: For the price, I figured these would be a little thicker and more substantial than they are. As I use them, they're acceptable. I still think they're a bit too expensive considering you can get something in a jar with a similar plastic lid for a buck at the grocery. Now having said that, I like that I can set 1/2 gallon Ball jars on the counter and keep common dry goods readily available in nice looking jars with an easy-to-use lid.
