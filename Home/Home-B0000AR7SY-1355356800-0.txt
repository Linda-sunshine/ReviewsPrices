review/summary: Great burr grinder!review/text: I have had my Infinity grinder for about a year now and I use it almost every day. I grind anywhere from 8 grams to 60 grams of coffee beans; this grinds them with ease. Every grind has been very consistent and very precise with the grind fineness and the different settings available. Very easy to clean and maintain. Worth the buy and would definitely buy again.
