review/summary: coffee grinder (Krups 203-42)review/text: Hey...I've never had a coffee grinder before (other than the antigue versions I have sitting around my house), but from now on I'm buying beans and grinding them myself....why? ...freshness....you can smell it when you grind the beans ...plus...I don't trust processors. I figure this way I'm getting the real thing...this little unit works great, I guess (as I said, I've never had one before)...since it's a dry process, I just wiped it out and washed the lid...nothing to it...only takes a few seconds to produce enough coffee for two full pots....it's fun !!!
