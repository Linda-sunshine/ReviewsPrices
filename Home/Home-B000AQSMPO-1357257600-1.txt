review/summary: No stars for Keurigreview/text: If a company calls their product a coffee maker, call me crazy but it should be able to make a decent cup of coffee. We received a Keurig for Christmas about three years ago and now, the only time it comes out of storage is when the people who gave it to us visit. After getting our Keurig, we went through the pods that came with it fairly quickly but I was not at all happy with the quality of coffee that came in them and actually was looking forward to using the single cup filter that came with it that is supposed to allow brewing any kind of coffee. Only after trying several times over a period of days, all resulting in weak coffee with grounds in it, did I come to the conclusion that the people who actually designed the Keurig coffee makers apparently really didn't understand anything about what is necessary to brew a decent cup of coffee. As a result, the system they designed seems to shoot a stream of water through a container of coffee that, whether in one of their pods or their "re-useable" basket, simply does not let the hot water soak into the coffee enough to deliver anything but a weak, comparatively tasteless cup of coffee. As far as I am concerned, while Keurig sounds like a great idea, product execution and what it delivers are terrible. Don't waste your money. This review post requires that at least one star be given to publish the review but, IMO, Keurig deserves none.
