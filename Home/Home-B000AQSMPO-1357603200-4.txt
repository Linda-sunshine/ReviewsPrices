review/summary: Incredible Appliance!review/text: The Keurig is an incredible addition to my kitchen!This model allows you to choose the size of your cup, with 3 choices. We bought the B40 model for my parents and it only has 2 cup settings.There is a nice big water reservoir so you can make several cups before re-filling. And the refilling is super easy.It keeps a cup of water hot so it makes your cup of coffee in seconds.There are K-cups available in every flavor of coffee you can imagine. So that's really nice if you enjoy a different flavor than the rest of your family.I do recommend purchasing the 'reusable filter basket' as the K-cups are pretty expensive (you always have to pay for convenience!) With the reusable basket, you can use your own coffee and it helps with the price per cup.
