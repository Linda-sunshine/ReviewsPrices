review/summary: Fantastic tasting water!review/text: I live in a condo and the water here tastes and smells a bit odd, so we've been buying jugs of water from the grocery store. This is a pain in the ass as the jugs are heavy and a pain to buy every other week. After purchasing the PUR 18 Cup, I gave the misses the taste test between our favourite brand of water and the filtered water and she couldn't tell, but chose the filtered water! It fits nicely in the fridge, no leaks on the spigot, and looks great.
