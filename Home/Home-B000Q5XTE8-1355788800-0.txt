review/summary: Good chair - great customer servicereview/text: I'm very happy with this chair. It is a comfortable chair and a great value. When I first received the chair, a plastic piece that covers the bottom mechanism was cracked - presumably during shipping. The piece was not a functional part of the chair and I did not want to pack it back up and return it over such a small thing. I called the customer service number, fearing the worst, but was greeted immediately by a friendly voice. She promised to ship out a replacement piece and took my information in just a few minutes. A few days later the correct piece arrived. Easy to assemble and looks great. The no-nonsense customer service was refreshing.
