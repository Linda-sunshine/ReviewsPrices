review/summary: Good productreview/text: I have been using this on my boat over the last few weeks. During the winter it is damp and cold. I also leave a radiant heater running to keep the temperature above 55. The EDV-1100 does well. It seems to gather 2-3 ounces of water every day. If I was able to keep the boat warmer it would likely do better. From advice on a boaters forum someone suggested removing the top fan exhaust grill. It seems to have higher wind throughput by doing this. The power adapter only gets mildly warm, no issue here at all. I would really like to buy the EDV-2200 but there are bad reviews on it due to the hot power supply. I "might" just buy another one of these for the boat. We only use this while the boat is docked, not underway.
