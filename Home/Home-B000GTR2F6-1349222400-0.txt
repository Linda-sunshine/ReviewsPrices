review/summary: LOVING IT!review/text: This is my second Keurig.After almost 3 years I had to replace the first.Amazon was the best value including even with the discount from Keurig.I order a warranty from SquareTradeWarranty.com for almost all of my appliances and electronics.My one year warranty for the first Keurig was over from Keurig but, because I still had a warranty on it, I got back the complete purchase price, allowing me to buy another just before my 3 years had expired, without extra cost.And, I would have gotten another Keurig anyway. I love the convenience and once you find a coffee to your taste, you will be VERY happy.
