review/summary: I like it very wellreview/text: This ended my quest for a stick blender. I've tried 2 other brands, and neither one worked for more than 2 uses. This one stays together, and yet it is more convenient to wash than older one-piece styles, since it can be taken apart. The button makes it so easy to fasten and unfasten the 2 parts. It is nice and long to fit down into a pot of soup or soap, or.... It really works well mixing peanut butter or banana slices into chocolate milk! I'm very satisfied with the way it has performed for various jobs in the kitchen.
