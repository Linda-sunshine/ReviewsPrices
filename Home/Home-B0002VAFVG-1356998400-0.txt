review/summary: Best Investment!review/text: I have now had my Breville 800JEXL Juicer for almost a year now. I was hesitant to buy it a year ago because of the price tag-but so glad I made the leap. I use it everyday and it has never failed to perform-fabulously! Compared to other juicers, it is much easier to clean and the opening for your fruits and vegetables is so large that you don't have to cut your food into little 1 inch cubes like other juicers. Cut an orange in half and you are good to go! I would buy this juicer again in a heartbeat-easy to use, easy to clean (only 5 large pieces to clean), and easy to prepare your foods quickly to process.
