review/summary: nicolereview/text: I've been using brita for about 2 years now. Filters have never been a problem bu with this pack of 4 the water has been tasting like chlorine, tap water, and sludge. The water goes through the filter too quickly and I think this is what's causing the water not to be filtered. Brita doesn't even have a recall and I have no way to send it back and get filters manufactured from a different batch. Very disappointed.
