review/summary: Finally got a decent mixerreview/text: Finally got one of these after pining for one for a while. I was concerned that the 5 quart bowl might be too small, but this thing is deep enough to easily mix plenty of cake batter or bread dough.I like the tilt-head design over the lift bowl design as it allows me slide the mixer under a cabinet. I especially like this model because it has a pretty small footprint and can be left on the counter for easy access.The motor is plenty powerful and can be left running to knead pizza dough for 20 minutes without any major heat.The paddle attachment has good coverage, but you do need to scrape down the sides every once in a while. Not much to do about that. If I was using it daily, I would consider trying out one of those scraper paddles but I'm not sure I can justify the purchase right now.I really want to get the glass bowl so that I can move straight from the mixer to refrigerator to microwave or vice versa.
