review/summary: Super soft winter flannel sheets!!review/text: After reading the wonderful reviews for Pinzon sheets, I had to try them. I was not disappointed. We live in Colorado & heat mainly by a fireplace so getting into a bed where your feet do not stay freezing cold was such a pleasure! The softness of these sheets is, a huge plus, I had just ordered flannel sheets from L.L. Bean & these are soooo much softer that I only want to use them! If they have them available in other colors, I will order more. Definitely recommend these to everyone - do not pill, plenty large enough for deep mattresses, & so VERY VERY SOFT!
