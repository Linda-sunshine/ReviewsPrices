review/summary: If the thought of perfect ice cubes makes you smile...review/text: I admit it: I had never really thought about the shape of an ice cube (is there anything more utilitarian than an ice cube?)but this tray makes any cold beverage just look more appealing. Price point is also good considering this is BPA-free and a lovely green color. Some have made comments about the difficulty of dislodging the cubes but, in my opinion, there are worse things than 1-3 seconds of momentary inconvenience if it means no more cracked, chemical-laden trays or remnant "ice-splinters" sliding along the kitchen floor and best of all, if I want three ice cubes I can get just three--instead of five, seven or the whole dozen (half of which inevitably end up in the sink). Not disappointed in the least.
