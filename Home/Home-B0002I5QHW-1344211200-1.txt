review/summary: horrible productreview/text: I purchased two of these, one for me and one for my son. We were both very excited! I read all of the instructions carefully before trying it for the first time. I made the pasta dough and tried to put it through the machine and what a mess! It wouldn't go through and the machine wouldn't stick to the counter. Every time I tried to crank the handle it would come off. And the few moments it did stay there I couldn't get the dough to come out of the attachment. I thought that perhaps my dough was too wet so I added more flour and kneaded it and it still stuck inside of the machine. I promptly washed it out packed it back up and sent both of them back. This was very disappointing!
