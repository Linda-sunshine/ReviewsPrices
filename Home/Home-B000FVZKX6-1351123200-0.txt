review/summary: The softest flannel I've EVER ownedreview/text: If you are looking to buy quality flannel sheets, these are what you want. The graphite color is perfect with our white comforter, it looks classy and you wouldn't ever know they are flannel. Most people think of flannel sheets with tacky Christmas or kids designs on them--these are NOT your typical flannel sheets.My husband was reluctant to buy these because he gets really hot at night, but he hasn't complained yet. They keep me very warm at night.Some more pros:--I followed the washing instructions *exactly* as the label says, and these sheets are just as soft, if not softer, than the day we bought them.--I can't emphasize enough how soft they are...its like sleeping on a cloud!--Don't let the brand name scare you off--these are an Amazon specific made product, but they are super high quality "Portuguese Flannel", which I have already seen offered at high end stores such as Pottery Barn and Land's End. Portuguese Flannel is the next biggest thing in flannel.
