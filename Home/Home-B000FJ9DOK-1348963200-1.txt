review/summary: Designed to failreview/text: The good news is these are the best water bottles on the market. The bad news is that in short time the O-ring seals and spring loaded tops will fail and you will not be able to get replacement parts. You will have to take these expensive stainless steel bottles and throw them in a landfill and buy all new ones. Planned obsolescence.
