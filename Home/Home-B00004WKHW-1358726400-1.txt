review/summary: It only worked once!review/text: I love the Cuisinart products. However, I used this processor once to make salad dressing. I washed it and put it away and 2 weeks later, I pulled it out of the cupboard to make salad dressing again, and it didn't work! It was dead! I sent it back to Amazon (which I might add is incredibly easy) and had it replaced with another processor. Todate I have not used the 2nd processor.
