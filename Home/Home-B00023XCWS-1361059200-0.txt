review/summary: Decent for the moneyreview/text: As a cheap kettle, it's fine. A few comments:--I've certainly owned faster kettles. It's still faster and more convenient than a pot on the stove, though.--As noted by other reviewers, the lid has to be closed for the auto shutoff to work. (This is not a bad safety practice, though.)--There's a stupid little mesh filter in the spout that falls out easily. On the other hand, I'm really not sure what the filter is supposed to accomplish.--Every other Proctor Silex product that I've owned has failed after a few years. This suggests that it would be smarter to pay more money for a better brand, but I've had equally dismal experiences with better brands (Sony and Cuisinart come to mind, though I don't think either of them make kettles or toasters.)
