review/summary: "Drink up" these great replacement filtersreview/text: The gold standard of all water purification pitchers, Brita, will serve your home well. These filters are fantastic and a pretty good deal. Is $5 per 40-50 gallons of water a good deal to you? I guess you COULD buy 2 bottles of bottled water for the same price, so the economics make sense to me.We bought the filters so we can provide high-quality drinking water for our cat. Is that weird? Yes, it is. But she's a really great cat and the water in LA is sketchy.Make sure to follow the helpful directions for ultimate water fun times.
