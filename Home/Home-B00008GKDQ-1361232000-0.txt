review/summary: Lodge Griddlereview/text: Nice quality griddle. A little narrow for me due to built in drip well but is as described. Used on my gas grill several times for fahitas. Primarily though I bought to replace the cast aluminum griddle with non stick coating that came with my electric range for use with burners bridged. Did not like the nonstick coating on the old one, that stuff scares me. This one is safer to use then that toxic non stick stuff and performs better. The new cast iron Lodge one worked well for multiple pancakes at one time without sticking. Also do multiple grill cheeses at one time. No complaints from the kids.
