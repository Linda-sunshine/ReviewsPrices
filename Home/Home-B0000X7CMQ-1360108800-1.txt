review/summary: Coffee done right!review/text: I researched this unit very carefully and it is the only coffee maker at this price level that starts and continues to perk coffee at the required (for good flavor) 200 degrees. If you haven't used a full heat coffee maker you will really notice the difference. I have two of these units and one did fail after about a year. Maybe an exception since the quality of the unit appears to be very good. The coffee is so good that I would (and will) buy a replacement unit.
