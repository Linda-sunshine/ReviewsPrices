review/summary: Great coffee but broke downreview/text: We have had this coffee maker for six monthsIt makes a great coffee and we love the carafeHowever it stopped working completely after six months. It can be replaced under warranty but it would normally take 7-10 business days to get a replacement and they are on back order so it will take longer plus I have to pay the shippingFor a couple that likes and needs their coffee, this is a joke!!
