review/summary: Fun, simple to usereview/text: Such a simple product to use! Took a bit to get the feel of how much to push in while turning but this is perfect for making veggie &#34;pasta&#34; noodles, apple slaw, sweet potato curly fries, etc. What a great way to get more veggies and fruits in our diets.Wish they had a recipe idea book though, finding lots on-line at least. (lots of YouTube videos too)
