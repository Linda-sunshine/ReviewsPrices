review/summary: Fantastic for the pricereview/text: I ordered this little beauty to heat up water quickly and efficiently for cup of soup and oats and quick things for breakfast before class. I've had it for a while now and it has never failed me, it gets the water so hot in just a few minutes and then I can conveniently pour it into whatever I need to. I don't get the plasticky taste that some of other people on here talk about even from the first heating. The automatic shutoff is really convenient as well I would highly reccomend this item for any dorm room not only for the price but also the quality and convenience.
