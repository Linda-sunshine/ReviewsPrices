review/summary: Had for two years before it quit.review/text: I had this brewer for almost two years before I started having problems with it. Then once they started, they just kept coming.At first the brewer wasn't pulling full cups, so I tried descaling it as per the owners manual. It didn't help the situation. A few weeks after this started another problem developed where after putting in a K-Cup and pressing "brew" the machine would continuously say brewing, but then it wouldn't actually brew for about two minutes. After about a week of the delayed brewing, the device wouldn't brew at all unless I would unplug it for a few minutes then plug it back in. Finally it just stopped brewing all together.When the Keurig was new it worked excellent though and definitely was convenient. I just feel as though for the price that it should last a little longer than just shy of two years, but that's how most things are made today. Overall, I would recommend this product to someone with the disclaimer that the life of the unit was a bit short.
