review/summary: Holy Molyreview/text: I had another blade grinder and it left such inconsistent grinds I just up and got this one based on price and reviews. Let me tell you for the price the grinds from this Krups is CRAZY amazing. From french press to drip to pour over all my beans are even sized and quickly achieved! I would say this makes grinds comparable to a burr grinder it's just fantastic! And for what it cost you can't beat it!
