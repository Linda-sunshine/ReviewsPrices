review/summary: It's cute but...review/text: I bought this fellow about a month ago to help with the usual dry weather issues, dry nose and such. He performed admirably for most of that period. I had no issues with white powder everywhere. No mold to speak of (and I didn't clean him nearly as often as I should have). And he kept the air moist-ish without turning things into a sauna, like my heated mist humidifier. However, I have two issues with this particular humidifier. The first is just a mild complaint; I wasn't aware that he'd be as large as he is. I'm living in a pretty small space right now, and I guess I wasn't expecting this fellow to take up as much counter space as he did. He's much larger than most of the other humidifiers I'd acquired in the past. So, something to keep in mind if you plan to buy. He ain't small. More of a great horned owl than an elf owl, if you catch my drift.My next complaint is more serious, and the real reason for the three star rating. Just recently, sir owl started leaking water randomly from the base. There was no warning, just some odd bubbling and then the discomforting sound of dripping as he peed all over the carpet. I checked to assure myself of the leaks location by emptying and refilling the base and it leaked yet again from the bottom, beneath the plate that sits over some sort of vent. Obviously a seal failure somewhere. I've written the company to see if they can help. Hope so, he's pretty cute.
