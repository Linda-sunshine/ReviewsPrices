review/summary: Taylor 7506 Glass and Chrome Digital Scalereview/text: What I don't like about this scale is the first time you step on this scale it is off about 4 lbs. Once you step on it again the 2nd time it is accurate. There is no light under the digital read out. I don't like to step off and on a scale to keep getting an accurate reading. And it takes about twenty seconds to reset, which is annoying. The battery to replace in this scale is very hard to put back in. I will be returning my scale.
