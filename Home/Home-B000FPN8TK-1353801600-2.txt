review/summary: NOT microwave safereview/text: Purchased the 16 oz size for my own personal use. Generally it is truly ingenious and easy to use. However, two slight quibbles:1) Amazon lists this product as microwave safe. After examining it and testing it out, I went to the Adagio website for more product information (the teapot does not come with a manual). Suspicions confirmed: the Ingenuitea is NOT microwave safe. See link here for more info: [...].2) I believe there was a previous model that had a removable mesh filter which allowed you to essentially pull all the used tea leaves out. The filter on the model I purchased on 18 November 2012 does not come out. This is convenient because it eliminates the prior issue of the filter not fitting/sealing correctly; however it is inconvenient because you can't remove the tea leaves except with a spoon/spatula/your fingers or by rinsing it out and dumping the leaves, along with the water, into the sink. This is less than desirable for those of us without garbage disposals unless we feel like clogging drains.Otherwise, I enjoy my new teapot very much and can live with these two flaws; I don't know if I would have made the original purchase had I known that the teapot was not microwavable--but I plan to keep it anyway because of its other virtues.
