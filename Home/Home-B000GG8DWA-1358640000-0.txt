review/summary: Made so cheaplyreview/text: Just took this out of the box and was not happy with the look of it, looks and feels too cheap. We thought it was made out of meatl being it is a heater but it is not. This heater is very light in weight and is made with mostly plastic, I hope it does not melt? The only reason we ordered it was they had a 3 heater package deal and this was one of the three. So far it is working pretty good and is very quiet but I am worried about the plastic used to house the heating elements.I would not recommend this heater if you have pets or little kids since it can be tipped over so easy due to not having any weight to it. I would send it back but since I got it with the package deal I guess we keep it. I do not expect this heater to last too long as I think the heating element will melt the plastic after prolong use. I will say it is heating and it is very quiet so it does have a few things going for it.
