review/summary: ordered MS-500, got MS-600review/text: First, oder was placed at 2 AM on 12/29/12, just got it 1/2/ 13 (I live in the NE of US).Second, weighs a nickel at 5.0g, then, before I could breathe, 5.1g-steady, tare-4.9g; a penny became 2.6g, dropped to 2.7g then tared and got 2.5g sliding to 2.6g.Third, as the title states &#34;ordered MS-500, got MS-600&#34;, literally.All things considered, great price, quick shipping, item was described 98% accurate (new in box, instructions, warranty, etc.)Really want to give item/seller a 4.7-4.85555555555556, obviously can't.
