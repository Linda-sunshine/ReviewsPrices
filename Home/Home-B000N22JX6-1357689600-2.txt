review/summary: A gift for my 37 yr old son. He loves it!review/text: My son lives in the Rocky Mtns. When he gets home from work he usually has to fire up his wood burning stove right awayto take the chill off. I ordered this for him for Christmas. I was afraid he would think I was nuts, but he called me and told me how much he loves it. Puts out lots of heat, heats up the room fast and he has stopped using the wood burning stove.We have many of the 3 ft. long Lasko heaters, but I'm going to order myself this one which takes up a lot less space!
