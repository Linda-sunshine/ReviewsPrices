review/summary: Works like a dreamreview/text: I've been suffering from post-nasal drip, excessive phlegm build-up etc. for years. The pollen in the area where I live aggravate the problem no end. Dust build-up throughout the house is uncontrollable. I irrigate my nasal passages daily and get some relief but this finally did the trick. I have it on low at night in our bedroom with closed door and don't have near the problems with heavy phlegm secretions as before that would persist throughout the day. It's quiet, effective, attractive and sits unobtrusively in the room. Great product!
