review/summary: Sturdy, handy - just as advertised!review/text: This caddy has been in our shower for about four weeks holding large shampoo, soap and sponge without a wiggle. Who would have thought someone would build a shower without even a soap dish? Well, someone did and we have it. So, a caddy has been indispensable.Granted, we weren't believers at first and were almost tempted to buy one of those old fashioned caddys that you hang around the shower water pipe. We only had unhappy memories of those as they slipped and slid down the pipe. Nothing but good thoughts with this caddy.It adheres firmly to the shower wall - just recommend that you follow directions to hang it and wait the recommended amount of time before using.Sign us Clean and Happy
