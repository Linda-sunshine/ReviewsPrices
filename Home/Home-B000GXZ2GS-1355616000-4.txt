review/summary: MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHINGreview/text: I FIND THIS PRODUCT ANNOYING TO USE FOR ONE SIMPLE CUP OF COFFEE NOT ESPRESSO. THERE ARE TOO MANY PARTS: CYLINDER, PLUNGER, BASKET, FILTER, MIXER STICK AND COFFEE SPOON.YOU FIRST PUT A PROPRIETARY COFFEE FILTER IN THE BASKET--THEN SCREW IT TO A LONG TUBE AND TRY TO CAREFULLY POUR COFFEE DOWN A NARROW TUBE. THEN YOU NEED TO POUR 2 INCHES OF HOT WATER DOWN THE TUBE AND THEN TAKE A MIXING STICK AND MIX THIS COFFEE SLUSH AROUND. NEXT YOU WET THE RUBBER GASKET ON THE PLUNGER AND THEN ADD REMAINING WATER TO THE RECEIVING TUBE AND INSERT THE PLUNGER DOWN THE TUBE SLOWLY OVER A COFFEE A MUG. AFTER 20 SECONDS YOU GET A REASONABLE 8 OZ CUP OF COFFEE.NEXT COMES THE ANNOYING CLEANUP. COFFEE GROUNDS ALL OVER THE PLUNGER, CYLINDER, BASKET AND MIXING STICK MUST BE WASHED OFF RIGHT AWAY.CONCLUSION: GROUNDS FOR DISMISSAL
