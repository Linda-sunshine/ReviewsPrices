review/summary: great grinder for the price. can be used as a stepless grinderreview/text: For the price of this grinder, I don't think there is much to complain about. It works great, but it isn't perfect. like others have mentioned there are quite a bit of grinds left inside the grinder after use. Wish they had a real on/off switch rather than having to twist the bean hopper all the way around the other side (I use fine/extra fine grind setting). As for static, I don't have any problems with it, probably due to the fact that I only grind enough for a single or double shot. Also I found that the 16 grind setting isn't enough, The coarsest of the extra fine was a little too fine, while the finest of the fine setting was a little too coarse for my espresso machine. After some experimentation, I found that this is actually a stepless grinder inside, and the 16 steps are created only to hold the setting in place when machine is moving/grinding. If you search the internet you can find instructions on how to convert it to a stepless grinder or to add more steps in between. Although converting it to a stepless have some draw backs. If the setting ring isn't tight, you might have to hold the bean hopper when grinding. But if you are creative enough, you can probably figure out a way to tighten the ring a little to create a little more friction. Luckily for me, my grinder's setting ring is very stiff, enough so that it will remain in-between settings even during the grinding process.
