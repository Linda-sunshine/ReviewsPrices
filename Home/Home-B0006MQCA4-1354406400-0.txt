review/summary: Convenient and tastes greatreview/text: I love this product because it's just so convenient. It's great to be able to open the fridge, press a lever and have nice cold great-tasting water come out. I work full-time, so I'm only using it in the morning, evening, and weekends. With that schedule, I need to fill this up about every 2-3 days.I think taste is going to vary widely by region, but I like this better than water right from the tap.
