review/summary: Best coffee I've ever had!review/text: If you've heard about this product, believe the positivity. It is relatively simple to use (I say relative because obviously brewing a simple pot of coffee is easier). My fresh ground coffee made with the AeroPress has absolutely no bitterness, it just tastes good. I've never been much for coffee, just drink it for the jolt. I actually enjoy a cup of AeroPress coffee on the weekends. Once you buy this, you will be amazed. Coffee as good as a coffee shop without leaving home, and about 10% the cost.When it arrives, go to YouTube and look at videos for how to use the Aeropress. Different people grind the coffee and steep the coffee different for personal taste. Watch a few vids and try them all, then use the method you prefer.If you want to see a good review, look up Julio Ojeda-Zapata at the St. Paul Pioneer Press (Twincities.com). He did a review in 2011 that sums up the product very well.
