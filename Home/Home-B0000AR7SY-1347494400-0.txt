review/summary: A great grinder, until it broke.review/text: After much research, I decided to purchase the Capresso 565 Infinity as it came highly reviewed and seemed to be the best tradeoff for price/performance. Overall, I was pleased with the consistent grind results the infinity produced. I used it once a day for a little over a year, alternating between a coarse grind for a french press and a medium-fine for an auto drip machine.A little over a year after I purchased (just outside the warranty) the motor on my infinity burned out. Capresso's customer service took quite some time to get back to my emails about the issue and told that I could ship the machine in for repair. However, given the short life span of the infinity, I decided to purchase another brand for my next grinder.As some reviewers have mentioned, the infinity does leave quite a bit of coffee in the chute. This is obviously and issue, as it can lead to the dreaded stale coffee in subsequent grinds. One solution I found for this was to keep a can of compressed air nearby to blow out the machine between uses. I would remove the plastic hopper and the top burr, hold the machine upside down (over the trash) and use the air to blow out any grounds that were stuck.For those experiencing static issues, I found the best way to avoid this was to wash the grind container with very hot water and soap, rinse it, and then dry immediately with a cloth.Bottom Line: Great product when it worked, but lasted just over a year.ProsConsistent grindStainless steel gives a nice, durable appearance and feelFairly quietMinimal static (see above)ConsLasted a little over a yearLeaves significant amount of coffee in chute (see above)
