review/summary: So far, so great!review/text: We've had a number of drip coffee makers, which we were usually happy with in terms of coffee taste. The last one we bought was quite expensive (for us) but we thought it would be worth it because the coffee went into a thermal carafe rather than a glass coffee pot which stayed warm via a burner (we've scorched more than a couple of pots). Unfortunately, the coffee from this brewer always had a weird chemical taste to it no matter what we did. So we decided to try a percolator. So far the coffee has turned out wonderfully. Wish we'd done this originally rather than wasting so much money on the other one.
