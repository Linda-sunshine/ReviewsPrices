review/summary: Crap....review/text: I wanted to like this bed, the reviews were great, no hand pumping and inflated fast. I used it for exactly 33 days and it was great! I am moving so been living on this thing and was pleasantly surprised how good it was. HOwever this evening I went to inflate it a little more as it was slightly down and I felt a rush of cold air. I glanced down confused to find that no matter what I did it would only deflate. The pump was stuck or something and no matter if I switched to deflate or inflate it would only deflate. I unplugged and re-plugged..... Better yet, there is no way to manually add air in! What's up with that! So now I'm $120 bucks out and Amazon Prime Customer Service stated that it was outside the 30 days and wouldn't do anything. I protested and then they stated they would take it back if I paid to have it shipped back... Needless to say I'm infuriated as I no longer have anything to sleep on and even more flabbergasted that Amazon wouldn't help. I immediately asked her to cancel my membership with Prime and sadly... This will be my last purchase from Amazon ever... I expected better.
