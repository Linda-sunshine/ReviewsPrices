review/summary: not fancy but just what i needed!review/text: My tub/shower has a ledge on top that extends 4 or 5 inches off the wall. The shower head is installed just above it into the wall, so it made it difficult to get a regular hanging type of shower caddy that hooks onto the shower head. This holds some heavier bottles quite well. If you have a lot of products, you may need more than one but I am trying to simplify so one is fine for me. I've had it about 3 months now and it seems very secure.
