review/summary: no suctionreview/text: I tried it out for about 20 minutes and then went to empty the dirty water and the container was dry. Reviews suggested wiggling the door on the suction tank. I did and got some suction but it seemed pretty mickey mouse. I am returning it after less than a day's use.
