review/summary: With timer set, coffee station is waiting for you in the a.m.review/text: Bought this system for each of our adult children. Very nice gifts and they were so excited to get them. As old dogs, never thought we needed more than our Mr. Coffee. House sat with granddaughter and within no time decided it was time for hubby and I to move to the next century. Like having an inhouse Starbucks. No fretting over filters or left over coffee in pot. Good for the self esteem as well, because we now know &#34;we are worth it&#34;.
