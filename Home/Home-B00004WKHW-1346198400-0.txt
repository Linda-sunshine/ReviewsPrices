review/summary: The Cadillac of mini-processorsreview/text: After using cheap WalMart "disposable" mini-processors for years, and waiting, waiting, waiting for the little guy to chop fresh parsley for a Gumbo, or whatever... I was introduced to this little Cuisinart model at my sister-in-law's house. What used to take a full three-five minutes now takes about ten-seconds. Wow!You would think that without an automatic switch you don't have to hold down, this unit would be a pain. But the reality is that it finishes the job so quickly that it simply doesn't need it. Try this amazingly efficient unit and you'll never have to buy another mini-processor.
