review/summary: Hot Air??? Really???review/text: We bought this popper, due to the good reviews it received. Opened it, popped the kernels, thought to myself, pretty outstanding!! Well, you get what you pay for maybe????? Used it two more times, then, on the third round, the top decided it was too hot and began to warp/melt.....a bit of a safety issue there maybe??? Amazon no longer carries, jeez, I wonder why??? Anyway, they refunded and I ordered it again, maybe it was just as defective lot??? We'll see what happens with the second one. If we have the same thing happen, then, we are done!!!! I'll be back with follow up!!
