review/summary: Keurig B60 Special Edition Brewing Systemreview/text: I bought a Keurig at Sam 's club for my son and his wife for Christmas. They couldn't wait until Christmasto use it. I liked it so well that I ordered the B60 special edition from Amazon for myself. I love it. No moremessy coffee grounds to deal with. The coffee tastes great. You have to be careful when buying the k-cupsas I bought some that don't fit. The package said they would, but they were for a different model and they have a soft net like cloth that holds the coffee. I purchased these at a food store. The only complaint I haveis the coffee is not as hot as I would like.Brenda
