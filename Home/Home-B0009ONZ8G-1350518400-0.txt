review/summary: Decent Vacuum Short Hosereview/text: I bought this about 4 years ago. I use it only about once a week just for couple of rooms as my cleaners do the cleaning every other week. It has been working fine. Just one problem that it has a very short flexible hose and even using the hard extension pipes it is not long enough for many tasks. Belt got broken couple of times. Construction is not very sturdy but if you are not doing heavy lifting it is a good value. I like the on/off switch location, lifting handle, lightness, and bag indicator.
