review/summary: sprung a leak in no time; think twice about buying so much plastic!review/text: Think twice before buying such a bed. I slept on this bed while waiting for my furniture to arrive in my new home, a couple of weeks. Eventually, I started waking up on the floor, in a big hollow in the middle of the bed. I found the hole, a separation in a seam. I tried to patch it using the patches they provided (following the directions) but they couldn't hold back the force of the escaping air. I called the company, who are very helpful and nice. They forced me to destroy the bed -- cutting out the logo and sending them a photograph -- and then sent me a new one. They told me to &#34;recycle&#34; the old one. I called my town's recycling center and they don't take airbeds made out of PVC plastic, so I ended up throwing this out and now it's in a landfill *foreverI!!! They sent me a new one, which I don't want to use. I don't want to dump another airbed in a landfill. A real dilemma.
