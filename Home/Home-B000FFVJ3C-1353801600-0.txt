review/summary: Good Qualityreview/text: I use this all the time. It is the best one I have owned. I have some deer meat drying in it now. Deer jerky is our favorite here but we use it to dry all kinds of things. Fruit, ornamental plants and flowers for crafts and many more uses. The quality of this item is very good also. Def. a good purchase.
