review/summary: Damaged upon receivingreview/text: Two separate times we received thermoset with damaged seals. The first one we sent back for an exchange. The exchanged item was also damaged with a bad seal. I never got around to returning the damaged replacement...honestly, with 5 kids I don't want to be back and forth from the post office! I'm disappointed with the results.
