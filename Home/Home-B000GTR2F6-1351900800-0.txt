review/summary: Near perfectionreview/text: I love the timer, the speed, the coffee that it brews. The only thing is that it doesn't fit many of my "taller" travel mugs under it. I realize that making a taller unit may look a bit awkward, but that is the only criticism that I have. All around a terrific unit.
