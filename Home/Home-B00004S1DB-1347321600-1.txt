review/summary: Great coffee, very durable.review/text: Love French Press coffee, don't like the fragility of glass presses. This works perfectly and keeps the coffee hot. I've replaced the screen once, as the edges do get worn over time and start to let grounds past. I bought a Bodum 8 cup screen, and it fit perfectly.
