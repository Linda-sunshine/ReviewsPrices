review/summary: Perfect for personal coffeereview/text: I like big cups that can drain a coffee pot in 3 rounds, but the problem I started having was that I would drink one or two cups and end up throwing the rest out. This coffee maker uses much less coffee and only makes one cup at a time, so I've stopped my wasting. It takes a bit of getting used to, and you may burn some coffee before you figure out you CAN NOT let it boil or it will be ruined. Does not require a gas stovetop, electric will work just as well as a bonfire.Good coffee from a simple device.
