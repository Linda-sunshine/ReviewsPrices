review/summary: Worth more than what it's costreview/text: The price is really good for what it does. Convenient and fast.The cup it comes with is not really a thermo cup, it's just thicker than regular cups because its double layered and it has a lid. It's not sealed tight though.It doesn't grind, so you have to use coffee ground instead of whole beans.
