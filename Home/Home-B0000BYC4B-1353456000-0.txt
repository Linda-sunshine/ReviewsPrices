review/summary: Excellent price for a necessity in our housereview/text: We've moved away from plastics to glass for food and homemade drinks storage, and these lids allow me to use Ball jars that way. This is an excellent price for wide-mouth lids. I don't can, but I buy the jars whenever I see them at yard sales for cheap. then I get these lids and have great food storage--perfectly sterile after a good home sanitizing and with new lids.
