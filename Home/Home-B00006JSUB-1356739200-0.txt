review/summary: Pros and Consreview/text: Large pan (bigger than I expected, and way heavier too!). The handle seems a little short for the weight of the thing, and there is no 'pouring divet' along the rim as advertised in the picture. Seems very sturdy but it arrived with a 1-inch long chip along the rim near the handle. I am going to get a replacement.
