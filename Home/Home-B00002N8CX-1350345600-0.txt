review/summary: Canister Vacuum... Where have you been all my life?review/text: Our ridiculously expensive "bagless" vacuum gave up the ghost not long ago and I was looking high and low for a replacement. I hadn't considered a bagged vacuum since bagless/cyclonic/wind tunnel has been "all the rage" with the hot vacuum set over the last few years.My plan was to buy something inexpensive for tight spaces, under the bed, etc. and eventually get a higher-end bagged vacuum down the road, but I'm so happy with the value and performance of this Mighty Mite that I have no immediate plans to get anything else.Let me be blunt: This vacuum sucks. In a good way.We have a lot of hardwood and tile bathrooms and it works as well in those areas as it does on carpet. It comes with a nice set of attachments and is easy to use. I highly recommend this little guy if you're looking for a simple, affordable vacuum.
