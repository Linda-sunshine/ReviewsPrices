review/summary: Brita Filtersreview/text: They're exactly what you'd expect from Brita filters. They last a long time. You can tell it's time to change them when they stop filtering or do it incredibly slow. I think the real brand lasts better than the cheaper over the counter ones and end up canceling out the higher price.
