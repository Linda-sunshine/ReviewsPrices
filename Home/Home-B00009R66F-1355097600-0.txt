review/summary: Cleans better than Stanleyreview/text: I used to leave my carpets to be cleaned once a year by a service (tried several). But now I save the money and use this regularly when needed. It's easy to use, and with 2 dogs, accidents are quickly and cleanly removed. While it doesn't bring the carpet back to NEW (neither did the big services) I feel like my carpets are cleaner more often!
