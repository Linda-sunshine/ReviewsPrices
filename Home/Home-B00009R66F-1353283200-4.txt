review/summary: Very pleased. Probably as good as a professional machine.review/text: This machine is an amazing value. I just purchased this to clean some carpets and upholstery. Last time I paid a pro to do my couch. This time, for the same price, I can do it myself, and then do it again and again for as long as this machine lasts. Now, I've only used it once, so I can't speak to its longevity, but it seems well made, and to be honest, even if it only works twice, I still got my money's worth (but I'm hoping that won't be the case).The instructions seem complicated, but using it is actually quite easy. Just make sure everything is seated properly. I cleaned our kids' playroom berber carpet, which was filthy and stained. I used a pre-treater and a little extra detergent in the Hoover. I have to say, I am amazed at how good a job this Hoover did. The carpet doesn't quite look like new - but it's a 95% improvement, and based on how stained it was and my prior experience with hiring someone, I highly doubt a professional machine would have done any better. I honestly could not believe how some of these stains which had been there for over a years disappeared before my very eyes. I'm kicking myself for not buying one of these sooner.Using the hand tool to clean the couch was a little tedious, it's quite small and you have to go slow, but that's a minor quibble. Also, the sprayer on the hand tool was a little wonky, and tended to spray out to the right side a little bit, making a bit of a mess. But, a minor issue, and one I'm certainly willing to live with, given how well this machine worked.When I ordered this, my wife was skeptical and suggested we just hire a pro again. Having seen the results, she is a believer.
