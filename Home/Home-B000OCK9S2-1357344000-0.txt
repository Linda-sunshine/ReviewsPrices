review/summary: Dimmer Dilemmareview/text: I asked for this product for Christmas and got it. I wanted it for the sounds plus to see the time as needed during the night. The dimmer switch does not dim the bright blue window light. It goes from bright to brighter. I want the room dark. I have to cover the clock window which defeats the purpose of the clock. It is useless for me and I keep having to replace clocks. It is fine for those who want a night light in a room. It was purchased on EBay and the seller has not responded to the buyers return request since they already got good feedback... we are guessing. Only a few of the sounds are soothing and natural sounding. I do like the sounds. Both tropical and song birds buttons sound about the same. Now, I have to find a new clock, again. Frustrating...:(
