review/summary: Water leaking even when brewer is offreview/text: I got the brewer with fast 1-day shipping to have coffee during the weekend mornings and when I put water in the reservoir and even before starting using it, it started leaking basically all the water via the bottom to my kitchen counter top. Could not be more disappointed.
