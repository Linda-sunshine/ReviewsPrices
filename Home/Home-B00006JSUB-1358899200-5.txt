review/summary: great panreview/text: i bought this pan to avoid the initial seasoning process. i'm not really sure it made much of a difference. i do clean it with water immediately after use, and then heat it to dry and apply oil. i'm sure i'll get to the point where i've built up the seasoning layer and achieve a 'non-stick' surface, but i'm not there yet. i do really like how meat tastes cooked in this pan as differentiated from teflon pans. i can go for a higher temperature with this one and brown meat better.
