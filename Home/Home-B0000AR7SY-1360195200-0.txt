review/summary: Perfect coffee grinder for us.review/text: Most importantly, this coffee grinder grinds any coffee beans we've tried (including flavored) to our liking. It works quickly and quietly. You can easily choose the grind level you desire with a twist of the top compartment. We don't find cleaning this grinder troublesome at all. It comes apart and goes together again simply and intuitively. It takes just a few strokes of the supplied brush to do the actual cleaning. For the money, this is the best coffee grinder we've found in 30 years of searching! We'll be recommending the Capresso 565 Infinity grinder to our coffee drinking friends!
