review/summary: What a disappointment!!review/text: I bought this vacuum to replace one just like it that I had owned for two years. I returned the first replacement because it was impossible to use on rugs; the brush was too long and hung in the rug. The second replacement was the same so I returned it also. It looks like the quality control in these vacuums has disappeared. I would not recommend this vacuum to my worst enemy.
