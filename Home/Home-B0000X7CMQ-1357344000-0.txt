review/summary: Great thermal carafereview/text: Great tasting coffee, six and one half measuring cups of water, easy to program. I wanted a thermal carafe that didn't sit on a burner and burn the coffee. My old Black and Decker stopped working after 15 years. This one holds 8 more ounces of water and the coffee seems to stay hotter longer. Some of the parts seem delicate so I hope it lasts. I've only had it less that one month. The number 4 filter needs to be carefully inserted but no problem adding 7 tablespoons of coffee.
