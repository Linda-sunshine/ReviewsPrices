review/summary: A good slice of lifereview/text: I must say I am a big fan of most things from this manufacture. This chef knife is a very efficient tool in the kitchen, easy to use and easy to sharpen. I do have much more expensive Wusthof knives but return to my Victorinox for general cooks duties. I also have a 10-1/4 inch bread knife ( love it ) a trio of paring knives ( very good apart from the straight parer ) and several other Victorinox. Great knives.
