review/summary: Buy it now!review/text: I'm so excited to find this slicer again. I'd owned it for about 10 years prior to 2001. We moved to a house with actual kitchen cabinets (long story) and I happily installed it inside a cabinet door. Six months later we moved for a job change and I unintentionally left my favorite slicer, perfectly installed for the next tenant to enjoy. I purchased and been given many slicer since then, some cheap - some expensive, and never found another that worked as well and that I loved as much.This beautiful little slicer is coming home with me today! Buy it, buy it now!
