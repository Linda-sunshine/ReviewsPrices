review/summary: Bought this as a present!review/text: I bought this as a present for my parents for Christmas. They love their wine and I thought this would be a great & easy product for them to use. They loved it & have used it numerous times since they got it for Christmas! So far, no problems with the product! For the price and quality, I would recommend it to anyone looking for an electric wine opener!
