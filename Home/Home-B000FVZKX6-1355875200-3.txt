review/summary: Better than expectedreview/text: After reading the reviews I expected to have to work on this sheet set to obtain what I was after, soft sheets that do freeze you on contact in the winter. The only thing I did different and because of other reviews, was adding a little extra fabric softener to the wash when I got them out package but I can not even say it was necessary. Very happy customer!
