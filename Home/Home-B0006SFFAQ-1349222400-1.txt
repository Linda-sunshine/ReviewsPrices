review/summary: DIED ON ME!review/text: I bought this coffee maker 1-2 years ago spending $80 plus on it and it stopped working this week. It stopped pumping and heating the water though the light will still turn on as if nothing is wrong. I tried using the self clean mechanism which also didn't work. My problem seems to reflect many others who also gave it 1 star. I expected more from this unit for the price. It is waste to have many of these units break after a couple of years - typical problem of American products made cheaply. This is makes two out of two cuisinart purchases break in short amount of time. The smartstick/food processor broke within a few uses, spent $10-20 to replace it only for it to break again. I will not be buying cuisinart products again.
