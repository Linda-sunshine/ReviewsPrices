review/summary: 8 Months-Still Goingreview/text: I bought this on Novermber 30, 2011, but I wanted to wait a little while before I wrote this review. Can openers have been the bane of my existence over the last several years. So, so many of them work great at first, only to fall apart or stop cutting after six months. It's been over eight months now and this opener still works like new.I'm the cook in the house, and I cook a lot. This can opener works very smoothly, with very little effort, is very comfortable in the hands, and has so far stood the test of time. I will update immediately if it does break or lose functionality. If you're reading this and there's no update, it's still working great with heavy usage.
