review/summary: Good deal even for picky people :)review/text: Excellent product! Bought as a birthday gift for someone who is pretty picky about his cookware. He will only use cast iron. He loves it and uses it almost daily! Win! If you are looking for a fairly small, easy to use cast iron griddle to make pancakes and grilled cheese sandwiches, this is it!
