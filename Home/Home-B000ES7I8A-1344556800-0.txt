review/summary: excellentreview/text: We just got our third Hamilton Beach electric kettle.I bought the first over 2 years ago because I kept leaving kettles on the stove until they burned dry or, in the final case, melted. We used it regularly until my son, who had come home from school for the holidays, decided it would be perfect for his room at school, and appropriated it. He says he uses it every day for making coffee or tea in his room, and he loves it.We ordered another in January and continue to use it regularly. Then, last week we were at our summer house and someone, who will remain unidentified, left another kettle to melt on the stove, and so - HB electric kettle #3.These electric kettles are wonderful, and I don't think I'll ever go back to the old-fashioned ones. We have no complaints with them - they do what we wanted and expected - boil water with no hint of plastic. They shut off automatically, stay cool to the touch, and they are reliable and safe. Definitely a 5-star purchase, three times over!
