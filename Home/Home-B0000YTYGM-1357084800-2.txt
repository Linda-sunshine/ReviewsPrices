review/summary: Would not recommendreview/text: First let me say that Cuisinart customer service has been terrific. Purchase in November 2011 and had a problem with spring in August 2012 and they sent a replacement part out quickly. I was hoping that this pot would be the answer to all my coffee needs...love the fact that I never have to worry about leaving the coffee pot on. However, I find that the pot does not keep coffee hot long enough. I know they reccommend warming the pot with water, but really??? what a waste to run all that water to get it hot, etc. Then just a few weeks ago I was wiping the coffee maker down and the white writing came off!!! How crazy is that? So now I have no ideas what the buttons mean. They have nicely offered to replace, but I really don't like the pot...bummer is I missed the 1 year deadline by weeks to just return it. Would not purchase again.
