review/summary: What Did You Expect? It's A Cast Iron Dutch Ovenreview/text: I've always wanted one and now I do. I couldn't wait to tear it open and put it on the stove top. Not long after that we were having hot fried fish and it wasn't even Friday. But tomorrow is Friday so we're going to do it all again. I am well pleased however now I'm thinking I've got to have a larger one for gumbo and chili.
