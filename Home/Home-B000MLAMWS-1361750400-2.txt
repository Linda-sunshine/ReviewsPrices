review/summary: Kitchenaid Pro 600 Mixerreview/text: Bought this to handle heavy sticky dough recipes like chocolate biscotti. Handles it with ease and makes the process much easierthan with a lesser machine. A little heavy to move around, but you get used to it, the price you pay for superior machinery. Theprice could not be beat. It cost the same as a reconditioned unit, but was brand new and came with the pour shield, whisk, doughhook and mixing attachment. I like the metal gearing and heavy duty motor and the way it mixes. A night and day difference between it and the unit it replaces. Great purchase.
