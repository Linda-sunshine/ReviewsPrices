review/summary: Easy to use!review/text: After researching Juicers, we chose this one from Hamilton Beach. It was the right combination of value for us. We've used it a few times so far and it works as described. It is powerful and can tackle just about anything you drop in it. It's a bit messy but clean up is fairly easy - just do it right after you're done and most of the pulp will wash off with water. The basket takes a bit longer to clean but still easy for the most part. It comes with a handy brush to clean the parts. We've made all sorts of Juice combinations and all of them have been very good. Very few few recipes come with it so use your imagination. Nice product at a fair price. - MM
