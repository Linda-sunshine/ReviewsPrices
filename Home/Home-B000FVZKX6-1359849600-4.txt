review/summary: Sheets as soft and smooth as silk!review/text: These sheets are like silk! I bought them for my daughter and her husband for Christmas, but I got to sleep on them one night and they are fabulous! It is so hard to find flannel sheets that don't pill and aren't scratchy, but you can almost count on a excellent flannel sheet from Portugal every time. I don't know what they do in the process, but you can't go wrong. I will remember this brand in particular, and will be back to buy more. These particular sheets are not deep pockets, however, but that has been part of their problem -- they don't have a super-sized pillow-top mattress and it is often hard to find sheets that fit because they are usually too big. Just a great purchase all around.
