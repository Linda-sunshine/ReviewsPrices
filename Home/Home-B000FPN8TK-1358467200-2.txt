review/summary: Fantastic!review/text: I got a small teapot for Christmas and took it to work. I was so happy with it I started to drink more than one cup of tea a day for the first time in my life. I was making several pots of tea so I looked and found the larger size. My husband is a tea drinker and complained that he couldn't have his favorite loose leaf tea at work so I picked up two of them. Now I only have to make two pots of tea a day.Well, this morning he took it in to work to try it out. He called me around 10am to tell me that the teapot ROCKED.I agree. Its easy to clean, keeps the tea warmer than I expected it to and so easy to use!
