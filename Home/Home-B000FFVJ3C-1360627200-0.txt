review/summary: Love it!review/text: This dehydrator works great, and is easy to clean. It seems a bit noisy, but I've never owned another to compare it to. Booklet that it comes with is pretty good. It lists common fruits and veggies and their drying time and uses. Made some beef jerky and it was delicious. My absolute favorite is dehydrated bananas. Love the chewy texture and crazy sweetness. So much less wasted produce now, as you can dehydrate over-ripe fruit.
