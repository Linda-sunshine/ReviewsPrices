review/summary: Used numerous times for canningreview/text: I've so far canned 15 quarts of green beans, 5 quarts of pasta sauce, and hot bathed a couple of quarts of pickles. Good big pot and the pressure release valves are very intuitive. Remember the instructions! DO NOT open the lid until the pressure on the inside has equalized and the pot has cooled. I learned the hard way thinking that &#34;It's not hissing any more&#34;. Got a bad steam burn on my arm because of my stupidity.
