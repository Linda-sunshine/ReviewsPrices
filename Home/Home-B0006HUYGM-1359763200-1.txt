review/summary: Holy Smokes!review/text: This is a very powerful little vaccum! Small enough for the kids to use, hefty enough to get ALL the jobs done. Does a great job on the stairs, picks up dog hair even when I don't think there is any, and the cord reaches much further than I expected.The filter doesn't come clean easily, and lots of dust ends up trapped in it, but it will work even with a still messy filter and I bought a second filter with it, so I wash one out and have the second one to rotate out. Super easy to go from bristles to hose to get in corners, and generally the best handheld vaccum I have ever used.I bought the micro attachment kit and it's sort of useful for the car, but you can do almost anything without it. And again - even easy for the kids to use! If you want to be cord free, this is obviously not for you, but this is so much more powerful than those are that it is worth being tethered.
