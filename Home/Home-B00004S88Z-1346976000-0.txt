review/summary: I love this pressure canner!review/text: I have used my pressure canner several times now and I absolutely love it. I was apprehensive the first time, fearing an explosion or something, but it worked exactly as it should. I had a little trouble getting the lid off the first couple of times (even though I applied olive oil as directed)but using a screw driver under the lid to provide a quick pop was all it took. The last time or two, I didn't have to do anything, the lid twisted right off. I think it's just something that works itself out as the canner gets more use. I used to look for canning recipes that only required a water bath, staying away from the low-acid foods. But now I'm searching out low-acid foods just so that I can use my canner. It was a great purchase and, if you follow all the directions exactly, you should have many years of use and enjoyment out of this "investment"
