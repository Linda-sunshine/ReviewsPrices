review/summary: THE PADDLE ERODES FROM THE HEATreview/text: Sunbeam 5891 2-Pound Programmable Breadmaker, WhiteI HAVE USED BREADMACHINES FOR YEARS.NONE HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT.AND NO ONE ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF CRUD ON THE PADDLE WHEN THEDOUGH CYCLE IS DONE AFTER OF COURSE A NUMBER OF USES. I REPLACED THE PADDLEON THE SUNBEAM AND CRUD STILL COVERED THE BOTTOM OF THE PADDLE. SOSOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE .I NEVER COOK THE DOUGH IN THE BASKET IT TURNS OUT HARD AND NOT TASTYI LIKE IT COOKED IN THE OVEN.I WANT TO FIND A MACHINE THAT WILL LAST , AND ASSURE ME I WON'T BE EATINGTHE CONTENTS OF THE BASKET OR THE PADDLE .
