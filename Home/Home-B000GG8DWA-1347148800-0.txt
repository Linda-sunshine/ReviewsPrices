review/summary: Consumer Reportsreview/text: Was considering this heater until I checked heater reviews on the consumer reports websiteThis one is a fire hazard.As long as you are aware of that I suppose you can use it safely enoughThe sensor on this heater is SUPPOSE to shut it off before it overheats but in their tests it did not.
