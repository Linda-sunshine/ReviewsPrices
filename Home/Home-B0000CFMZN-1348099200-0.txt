review/summary: Beware of variations in finish.review/text: This is great as a measuring cup. My issue with it is the handle. The two edges on the handle are fairly sharp when I grab it. Still usable and I imagine it's just a fluke in manufacturing since my larger pyrex measuring cup is nice and rounded out, but if you are going to be using this a lot (which I don't), then you might want to consider getting it locally if you can just to be able to feel the handle and buy the one most comfortable to you.
