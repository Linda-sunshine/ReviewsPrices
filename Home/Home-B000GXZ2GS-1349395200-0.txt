review/summary: More work and it seems like not as much flavor as French Pressedreview/text: I love french pressed coffee. Easy to do, easy to clean. I just did not like the gritty sips towards the end of the cup.I bought the Aeropress based off reviews, before reading what is required: use lots of grinds--maybe 2.5x more than you would. You make concentrated coffee which you dilute. There are a lot more pieces to fiddle with and also clean. What did I get myself into?Ended up using my own methodology: I make 14 oz servings. I put 3 of the regular Tbl scoops of whole bean into the grinder and then drop it in the Aeropress with filter. I pour 185*C hot water from my hot water dispenser in and stir. As the water level drops, I add more water. Keep on adding more water until it looks like around 14oz will be made in my mug--then I press. I think this makes a much better cup of coffee and uses much less coffee grinds than Aeropress recommends.Do I think it is a good device capable of making great coffee? YES. Do I regret buying it? YES. It tastes very similar to drip brewed coffee and not as robust as french pressed. I like robust.
