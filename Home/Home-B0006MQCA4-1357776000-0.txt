review/summary: favorite pitcherreview/text: Used many pitchers before. I think that the key to &#34;liking&#34; this pitcher lies with the type of faucet you have in your kitchen!We have a faucet that extends via an expandable pipe, so we placed this in the kitchen in a place where the faucet reaches. It's easy to fill up and we don't have to carry it to fill it up. It's been used for over a year with no problem. We replace the filter every 1-2 months.
