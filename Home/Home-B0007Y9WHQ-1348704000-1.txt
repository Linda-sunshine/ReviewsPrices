review/summary: I love love love this slicer!review/text: Did I say I love it? Suction cups keep it firmly in place, 3 different blades and super quick and easy to clean. I am eating beets now because the spiral ribbons are so pretty raw or sauteed and having recently gone wheat free the squash and zucchini "spaghetti" is a delicious substitute. As for any negative reviews here, I don't get it. Something at this price is not going to operate like a $200 machine. I think it's a fantastic value for the price and would highly recommend it to anyone.
