review/summary: Ok, but your getting what you paid for.review/text: I bought this to grind flaxseed and it did a good job. The problem is it's pretty much dead after just a few uses. If I screw around with it I can get it to work for a couple seconds but it's basically shot. People depend on reviews when deciding whether to buy something or not so I would just say that I personally would not buy this again.
