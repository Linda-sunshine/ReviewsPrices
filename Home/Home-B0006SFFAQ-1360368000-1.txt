review/summary: Great coffeemakerreview/text: Makes fantastic coffee easily. Well designed with the minor exception of the opening allowed to pour water into the reservoir and for reading the interior measuring scale. It's not for the shaky handed. But if you pour using the coffee carafe itself, it pours in a precise enough stream not to spill much and the carafe markings correspond precisely with those on the interior scale.
