review/summary: Would love it if it worked all the time but....review/text: I believe the unit came defective. It worked perfect for a short while but then started making a bad revving noise and the mist would not rise thru the chamber. I tried cleaning it extra carefully with vinegar thinking it was due to mineral deposit. It the worked off and on but finally conked out for good just past the 1 year warranty date. I should have called immediately since it was clearly a defective unit. Hello Kitty Model
