review/summary: One piece of plastic, 143 bad reviewsreview/text: Hello Cuisinart. I love my stick blender, I use it almost every morning for eggs. But this is my second one where the cheap plastic teeth on the motor have stripped in relatively short time. One cheap plastic piece on the motor which is metal on the attaching parts. Is this planned obsolescence? For $1, $5 you couldn't make this part out of metal? When all the other parts and accessories are so nice and well-made it's disappointing that you use this one cheapo piece that renders the product useless in a few months. Surely they have received enough complaints. I, too, was sent a new one after complaining. Few months of use, and the chopper stripped trying to chop water chestnuts...and then it was ruined for the blender.
