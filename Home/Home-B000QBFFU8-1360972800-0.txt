review/summary: WOW! Way better than the Juicemanreview/text: I've owned a Juiceman for 4 years, and the motor finally gave out. It started smoking and making funny noises, so I decided to try out the Breville. It feels like a MUCH more premium juicer. It's much quieter than the Juiceman, and much easier to use. I also love the rubber spout tip it comes with so you can juice directly into a glass without having it spatter everywhere...or the included pitcher with a lid is great if you are juicing for more than one person. Also, it looks fantastic on my countertop, contrary to the cheap white looking Juiceman.
