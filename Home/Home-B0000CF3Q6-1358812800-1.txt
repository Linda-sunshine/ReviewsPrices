review/summary: Excellent productreview/text: By far the BEST espresso maker that I have found, electric or manual. Simple to maintain and clean, this combines ease of use with the best and most consistent espresso that I've had.This particular model can fill up to just under 2/3rds of a cup of water good enough for two strong cafe con leches. It comes with a small cup to hold the fine espresso grinds and I use some existing coffee filters with a small circular template to cut out a small circle to prevent the espresso falling into the water. This is a personal preference and allows for much ease of cleaning later on as all you have to do is take the cup out invert it and give a quick puff of air into the thin end of the spout and 99% of the grinds pop right out into the wastebasket.The main filter and rubber gasket sealing the tank and the top are the other two consumables but are very cheap to buy off of amazon.Highly recommended.
