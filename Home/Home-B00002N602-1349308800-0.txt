review/summary: Great Healthier Pressure Cookerreview/text: I bought this pressure cooker to replace the crock pot I was cooking my pinto beans in, of which took 8-12 hours even after soaking them. The Presto now replaces that electrical appliance and takes a fraction of the time to cook with the beans coming out great. It's worth it to save on electric. I was looking all over town for one. Thanks for carrying this product.D.M. SimondsScribeCaveDotCom
