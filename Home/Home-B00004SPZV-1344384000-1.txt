review/summary: Great Oil Misterreview/text: When I noticed an oil mister in another store's weekly ad, I came to Amazon.com to compare prices and check the ratings. After reading the ratings, and noticing that Amazon had the best price, I purchased it from Amazon. I have never regretted this purchase.I followed the instructions that came with this mister to clean it and fill it with oil. It is so easy to use. You have to pump it several times before you mist oil with it. I don't have a lot of hand strength, but this Misto Gourmet Olive Oil Sprayer is very easy to pump up and to use.I use this Misto Gourmet Olive Oil Sprayer to mist a light coating of oil directly onto my food, or onto my pan or griddle, grill, or waffle plates. Using olive oil on my pans or grill plates does not leave a film on them like it has in the past when I've used cooking sprays.The only regret I have about purchasing the Misto Gourmet Olive Oil Sprayer is that I didn't purchase it sooner.
