review/summary: Great coffee. Easy to use. Easy to clean.review/text: Smooth and delicious. I haven't used a drip machine since I bought this. As I got used to using it I found the perfect process, grind and quantities for me. (two Tbsp coffee, fresh ground between drip and espresso fineness, water to the &#34;2&#34; marking, then top off the mug with more hot water)The one modification I made to the standard directions is that I load the Aeropress upside down now. (pull plunger out to &#34;2&#34;, set on counter upside down, grind and add coffee, add 175F water, stir for 15-20 secs, put filter in dampened cap, put cap on, invert assembled press onto mug, let grounds settle for 15-20 secs and press).By loading it upside down ALL the water stays with the coffee during the entire brew time rather than leaking through as I try to fit the plunger into the press (while balancing the press on top of the mug!).To make life simpler I adjusted the &#34;water on demand&#34; heater I have on my sink to the right brewing temperature so there's no heating water in the morning.Clean up is a snap. Remove the cap, push the plunger all the way down to eject the spent grounds and filter into the trash (or compost bucket) and then rinse off the press in the sink and air dry on the counter.
