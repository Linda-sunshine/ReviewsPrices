review/summary: Great Value, Great Performancereview/text: I was recently browsing around on Amazon and ran across the Lodge 6 quart Blue dutch oven at the low price of $42. I know how much the expensive Le Cruset cookware costs, (I own one Le Cruset oval dutch oven that I bought 30+ years ago for $40 on a close out sale) but was always hesitant about the Lodge enameled cookware because it was manufactured in China. But I needed a 6 qt. enameled dutch over for the times we cook any acidic type foods, so it would not ruin the seasoning on my standard cast iron dutch ovens. But at the $42 dollar price point with Free shipping, and after reading many reviews, I was willing to take a chance, and bought two of them on Amazon.com, one for us and one for my newly married daughter. After receiving the dutch oven the blue color is fantastic. I have so far only used it once, to cook Chicken Gumbo soup, and it turned out great. Very easy clean up, and all of the even cooking qualities that you would expect from cast iron cookware. I like the bigger handles on this pot. I like that they came with the stainless steel knob on the lid, so they can be safe in a hot 400 degree plus oven. Only time will tell as to the durability of the Chinese enameling, but so far so good. I own may non-enameled USA made Lodge cast iron pans and they are great, I am hoping for the same with their Chinese produced products. Not all Chinese products are bad, it all depends on their Quality Control, and if Lodge is keeping an eye on the manufacturing process. At the $42 price point, I could have bought 7 of these Lodge enameled dutch ovens for what you would have paid for one equilivent size Le Cruset dutch oven (about $300). I will report back after I have used the dutch oven for a while.
