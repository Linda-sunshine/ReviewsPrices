review/summary: Good coffee, if a bit fussyreview/text: I have been comparing the AeroPress with my old faithful 1-liter French Press and the standby Mellita 1-cup filter. I have to say that the AeroPress makes much better coffee than either, although it uses twice the coffee as the Mellita and requires a fussy ritual that gear heads will like. After much making of coffee, I find that the fuss is worth it. The coffee is full flavored without a hint of unpleasant bitterness. It is clear, unlike the sludgy brew I get in the French Press.
