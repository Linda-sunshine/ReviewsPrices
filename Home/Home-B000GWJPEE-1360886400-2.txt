review/summary: Quiet, easy to use, and very effective!review/text: We purchased this product, because of the VERY dry winters months in Wisconsin! We have a humidity reader and it was in the lower 30's percentage range, 50% being the (OK) range. So we wanted to bring that up to par. We seen the (Monkey) humidifier, and choose that one due to our sons liking.Pros1) Easy to set up2) Wide range dial from low/high3) Quiet4) Very effective5) Easy to cleanCons1) Recommends to be 2ft of the ground2) Could use a longer cord, especially with having to be elevatedUltimately, I would recommend this product to anybody that wants to increase there humidity!! It's an excellent product, and the pros definitely outweigh the cons in my opinion!*If you want to know anything else, please, feel free to ask:-)
