review/summary: Love it!review/text: I love this coffee maker! I have NEVER had a coffee pot in my house before because I had to make coffee at work in the past, and those coffee pots are a pain to use and clean. It was just easier to go to Starbucks. This Keurig is SO easy and simple to use, plus you can remove the metal water drip pad to fit a tall travel mug in the cup area, so you're not limited to little coffee cups. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because you can't set a timer to make it start brewing your coffee automatically. You can set a timer to turn the machine on and start heating the water, but you still have to get up and hit the start button to actually make the coffee. I was hoping to just set a timer and wake up to the smell of coffee, but oh well. Overall I love it and would highly recommend it! I'm really excited to finally have a coffee maker at home!
