review/summary: Easy to use, not so easy to cleanreview/text: Taking one star off on the cleaning part. I used this to make apple chips, since I don't have a mandolin. The chips are paper thin and dehydrates very well. Since it is white plastic, orangey vegetables can stain the plastic, no biggie though.
