review/summary: How have I managed without this??review/text: I use this just about every time I am in the kitchen, and still can't believe how long I went without it. Once upon a time, I had a cheap food processor which basically turned food to soup with an odd chunk left in, was hard to clean and was very loud. After it broke (less than a year after purchase) I saw no reason to replace it. As a Food Network addict, I saw chefs using food processors with much better results than I ever did, but somehow thought I must not have known how to use it properly. A few weeks ago, I saw my football idol Hines Ward overcome his own fear of the food processor on a celebrity chef show - and he made it look like so much fun, I decided I needed to give it another try.After reading several reviews, I bit the bullet and ordered this item - paying more than I had originally planned, questioning myself on whether it could possibly be worth the money. Within a week, I had used it for so many items with such wild success, I can barely remember how I ever got by without it. It has been used for everything from dicing an onion (no tears!!) to pureeing homemade dog food to slicing a pile of potatoes into perfectly uniform slices. The amount of time it saves me is unbelievable, it cleans up in a snap, and is very easy to operate.I am not someone who easily parts with $150, but have not regretted doing so to buy this beauty for a second. Love!!!
