review/summary: Warm Coffee for Hours!review/text: This coffeemaker follows a list of products we had bought that had notable less than ideal characteristics. The good thing about our previous purchases was they didn't last very long and led us to buy this coffeemaker. It takes up a smaller piece of real estate on our kitchen counter, brews very well, but the real advantage to this unit is that it does not have a heating element under the pot that turns good coffee into tar over time. The insulated pot keeps its contents steaming hot for a very long time. After an hour the coffee is still steaming and tastes like fresh brewed. One downside of this product is not being able to see at a glance how much is left in the pot, but this is more than offset by the advantages this unit offers.
