review/summary: Good for Espresso or Lattesreview/text: Here's my mini-review of the Aeropress, having just used it for the third time.The coffee is good, seems less bitter than with other methods. Maybe I've just gotten used to bitterness, I'm not sure that's a big improvement -- seems less "coffee like" and leaves me wondering if it's strong enough.Main thing is, it uses more coffee beans, like about twice as much. Since my wife insists on expensive beans from Starbucks that matters.The alternative here is those individual drip filters, the kind with the fine metal mesh (no paper filters needed). Put in the grounds, put another piece over them, pour in hot water, put a lid on top, wait a couple of minutes for it to drip through. Works well and fewer parts to deal with.Bottom line: If you're a coffee connoisseur you *might* like the Aeropress better. And it seems perfect if you want an espresso or latte. But for a regular cuppa joe for a regular Joe, save your money.
