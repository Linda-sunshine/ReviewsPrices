review/summary: Padraiginreview/text: Wow, was I surprised at the suction this small vacuum delivered. I don't like where the switches are, however. I guess I'll get used to them. I was looking to replace an inexpensive Vornado electric broom and this is a close as I'll get, I know. I have two cats that require a daily clean up in my bathroom where the litler box is and in my bedroom where they exit the bathroom. I keep it plugged in at the ready.So far, so good.
