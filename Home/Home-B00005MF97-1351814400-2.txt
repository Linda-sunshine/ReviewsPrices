review/summary: You will not regret the purchasereview/text: I was skeptical about purchasing this product beacause most of the electric choppers don't function that great.To my surpirise,this really does a good job of chopping the veggies in a jiffy.My only complaint is that it does not dice or chop in an uniform shape.So, i would it a 4 star for this reason.Still, this is a great handy machine for those who cook a lot.I would always have this in my kitchen!
