review/summary: Reviewreview/text: It makes a good cup of coffee. The timer is a &#34;must have&#34; in our home and the variable temperature warming plate assures that the coffee won't be burnt between the time when my spouse drinks it at 5:00, and when I drink it at 8:00. I like the black matte, textured finish. It hides dirt and looks cool. p.s. since I bought it I have seen it as a prop on lots of TV shows.Does this mean I am hip? ;-)
