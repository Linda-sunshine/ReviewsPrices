review/summary: The Lil' Thermos That Could!review/text: This thermos is very NICE! It looks and feels great in the hand. Easy to open and close. Easy to handle. And it keeps stuff COLD!!! I am a "bedside water drinker" (LOL!) I just have to have me some water throughout the night when I wake up. I noticed that pouring a cold bottle of water in this thermos (which by the way is the MAX it will hold: @ 17oz not 18) it remains cold all night! So that's at least 8 hours. I can only imagine what it will do to Hot liquids.So I highly recommend and would purchase again.~ Big Marcus
