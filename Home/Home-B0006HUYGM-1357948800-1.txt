review/summary: Does the job!review/text: Bought this as a gift for a family member, especially to do stairs. Started looking at a Dustbuster, but having owned them before, I am well aware of the battery situation and so wanted to avoid that. Decided to look at corded models. According to the family member for whom it was bought, it does the stairs beautifully and the cord is more than long enough to do anything. They also have 2 dogs, and it does very well on picking up their hair. Delivery was very fast as well. Completely satisfied!
