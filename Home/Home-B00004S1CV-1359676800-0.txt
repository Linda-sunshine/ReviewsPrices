review/summary: Uhm .... it's okay. Make sure you understand the product's purpose.review/text: If you're making tea in this, you'll have to take the tea out, dump it, and replace with a different lid. It's a multi-step tool. Not a &#34;set it and forget it&#34; tumbler. Steps: 1. Put tea in &#34;tea screen lid&#34; 2. Pour hot water in. 3. Cover tea screen lid with plastic cap. 4. Remove plastic cap. 5. Remov tea screen lid 6. replace with sip-cup lid and enjoy Why wouldn't I just use a tea ball in a tumbler? lol Dumb purchase. Wouldn't buy again. It doesn't make anything easier. Plus, it's a pretty tiny cup.
