review/summary: All American 921 - High quality pressure cooker/cannerreview/text: After using the old blue water bath canner, I opted for the pressure canner and found it much faster and easier to use. I am also finding it very useful for many other cooking chores, reducing required cooking times and keeping the food looking great and tasting great. I rate the purchase of the All American pressure cooker/canner as one of my better kitchen utensil investments. I looking forward to using this for many years.
