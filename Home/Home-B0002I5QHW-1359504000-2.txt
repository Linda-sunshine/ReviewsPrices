review/summary: Good Qualityreview/text: This grinder is pretty good! I suspect that it might grind meat a little better than it makes pasta, however. Given the fact that I had never made pasta dough, I wondered if it might be recipe-following related, but the dough was springy, as indicated in that recipe.The main thing I noted, was the pasta attachment for linguine is very easily clogged. The rotini attachment, however, worked a whole lot better.
