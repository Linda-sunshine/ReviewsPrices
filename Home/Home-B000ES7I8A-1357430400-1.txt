review/summary: Electric Kettlereview/text: Kettle arrived quickly and in good shape. It does EXACTLY what I wanted - heat water quickly, then turn off automatically when the water boils. The kettle is well made, can be easily removed from the base and is good looking. I particularly like the way extra electrical cord can be wound and hidden in the base.
