review/summary: Junk That Will Not Lastreview/text: We got this brewer for a Christmas gift and it wound up in the dumpster in less than 2 years.After a few issues with not properly filling the cups, the ground fault circuit interrupter started to cut power off to the Keurig at intervals. To be sure it was the Keurig at fault, not the GFCI, we moved the Keurig to another GFCI but it then began to trip the fault indication again.A tripped GFCI can indicate a condition that can cause electrical shock or fire, so we called Keurig. The service rep advised us to descale the device. That had already been done. He then offered a new Keurig for $69.After reading the other problem reports in Amazon, we decided to go back to our old coffee pot.This item appears to be another piece of imported trash that is a total waste of money.
