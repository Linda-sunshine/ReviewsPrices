review/summary: Worked less than two yearsreview/text: Worked pretty well for less than two years and that is a LOT of money to spend for a mixer than does NOT last and I only used this MAYBE once a week...probably more like twice a month. I never abused it or put more ingredients than it could handle (per the user guide). Even so, the unit would get HOT after only a couple minutes of kneading! Loved my first KA 4 1/2 QT stand mixer, but this one is a joke. Does not mix as well and does not get to bottom or sides of bowl very well at all. Also very awkward when you must stir to get to the bottom and sides with spatula or spoon while bowl is still attached. Cannot believe I'm left to shop for yet another mixer at my biggest cookie baking time of the year. will NOT buy another kitchenaid mixer. These days they are JUNK. Most definitely not worth $400!
