review/summary: A high quality panreview/text: I purchased this stir-fry pan as a Christmas gift for my son, who is stocking his own kitchen. First of all, it is gorgeous -- a really beautiful piece of equipment. Second, as Cuisinart products are reputed, this works wonderfully. The heat distributes quickly and well, and the pan helped my son create a lovely stir-fry meal for all of us. I am planning to replace my old stir-fry pan with this one, too -- and will probably be purchasing this second pan shortly.
