review/summary: Messy and Riskyreview/text: I got this coffeemaker as a hand-me-down so I paid nothing for it, and it's pretty much worth what I paid! It does make coffee straight into the cup, which of course is convenient. However, as so many others have said, it splashes grounds all over the inside of the coffeemaker during every use (no matter how much or how little grounds I put in) which means it requires frequent cleaning involving putting the entire coffeemaker in the sink to rinse out. It also sometimes results in grounds getting into my cup of coffee. The convenience factor is gone when it takes as much time to clean the maker as it does for the cup of coffee to actually brew.Worst of all, today I was making a cup at work as usual. I filled the cup itself with water, poured it into the coffeemaker, put in two scoops of coffee, and turned the machine on, then went back to work. The coffeemaker sits on my side desk and when I turned around to pick up the cup, I discovered that coffee had spilled all over my desk. The cup itself was about 2/3 full and the last 1/3 was all over the place. All I can figure is that I didn't sit the filter and filter basket back in the perfect position and it must have somehow stopped up the little spout that pours into the cup. Anyway, it was an absolute mess and it's simply not worth the risk of that happening again.I'd highly suggest investing in a better coffeemaker than this one! Or if you decide to get this one anyway, come take mine. I sure won't be using it again...
