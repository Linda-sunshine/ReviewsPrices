review/summary: good for the pricereview/text: I got this for my one bedroom apartment and it works really well. The cord is very long so you aren't always unplugging it to get the other end of the room. The canister is pretty small, so it probably wouldn't be great if you're doing a whole house. The hose for the attachments is pretty short, and can make it a bit difficult to get the back of the couch if you have a big one. But overall I would reccomend it for an apartment vaccuum.
