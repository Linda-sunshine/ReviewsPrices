review/summary: Great juicer, great pricereview/text: I've had this juicer for over a month now and I absolutely love it. My kids are drinking fresh fruit juice every day! Yes it takes a few extra minutes to clean but is so worth it (I don't recommend dishwasher). I also bought a juicing book of recipes for some ideas but most of the time I just juice enough fruits and veggies to fill a glass every morning. We are members of a CSA and sometimes I get so many veggies that I can't cook them up before spoiling....this solved that problem. Definitely worth the money.
