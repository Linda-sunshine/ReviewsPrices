review/summary: Love it!review/text: I bought this along with a knife sharpener. It was recommended on America's Test Kitchen as being the one they use. It is wonderful. I enjoy cooking much more because chopping is so much easier. The only thing is that the packaging is very hard to open (standard plastic zipped edges) and it so locked tight, that I nicked myself on the knife just getting it out of the packaging.
