review/summary: Great Kettlereview/text: We bought this kettle perhaps three years ago to replace our previous plastic-lined kettle. We were a little surprised about the actual fillable volume, thus the 4 stars. As long as you do not fill much past the max of 40 ounces, it works like a charm, bringing water to a boil very quickly and quietly.Make sure you let the kettle come off the boil before pouring out or else the kettle will leak out the bottom. If you overfill the kettle, it will leak out the bottom as well. I cannot imagine that this is good for the insides of the kettle.I would definitely recommend this kettle.
