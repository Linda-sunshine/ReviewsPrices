review/summary: Great energy efficient small area heaterreview/text: I purchased this for the foyer of my home which is tile so it tends to feel colder than the rest of the home when the temperature drops. This is perfect for tile floor since the radiant heat warms the tiles which also retain some of the heat in addition to the direct heat from the two bulbs. This heater does not have a blower like ceramic heaters, it is radiant heat which means it warms the air directly around the heater within about a 3-5 foot area. It will keep a small room warm but not hot but it only uses 400 watts on the low (one bulb) setting and 800 watts on the high (both bulbs) setting which is significantly less than the standard 1500 watt space heaters. Since this is radiant heat it does not dry out the air like most other heaters thus it is good for use if you have dry skin in the winter.If you have a small area, preferably tile floor since it does radiate heat, I would recommend this without hesitation. I have used this on hardwood floors and it does well but I would be hesitant to use on carpeted areas since it does heat the floor directly in front of the unit significantly which could be a potential fire hazard if left on for long periods of time.
