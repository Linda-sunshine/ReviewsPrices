review/summary: excellent, but note how your fridge worksreview/text: The hudnreds of other reviews say how well this works, and it does. It is great. Sturdy, large capacity, etc etc.One thing to bear in mind if you want to keep this in the fridge: in most fridges the door shelves don't leave a gap between them and the internal shelves when the fridge is shut. This is fine, but means that you may well not be able to have the pitcher hanging over the edge of the internal shelf so that you can access the tap straight on opening. So I have it on the shelf, but just have to pull out a couple of inches to use, and push it back to close the fridge. No big deal really, but worth bearing in mind
