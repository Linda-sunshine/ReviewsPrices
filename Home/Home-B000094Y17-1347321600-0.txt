review/summary: piece of garbage, don't buyreview/text: This is a piece of garbage, the top green portion was in so tight we could not get it out, numerous people tried, we put it in the freezer thinking the cold would shrink it, we tried to put olive oil down the sides, NOTHING WOULD BUDGE THAT GREEN PIECE OF PLASTIC! So we got some pliers and started to pull, CRACK, it broke into two pieces, into the trash, we were all so angry at that point! I read the reviews saying buyers were dumb and didn't put the thing together right, we never had a chance to take it apart to put it together right, the green piece was just way tight and would not budge. I hope others don't buy it, ths is the only way they will learn not to mass produce garbage. (And no, I didn't want to repack the broken pieces, trot to the post office, then fight and explain that it wasn't my fault it was broken to get a refund, my time is money.)
