review/summary: OKreview/text: The material is heavy and has a nice sheen to it. Washes well. I ordered the blue and it was just what i wanted. I have a problem with night sweats and my sweat breaks down to a very mild bleach. YES this really happens. So the pillow cases are bleached out. by no fault of there own. I have ordered another set of pillow cases and to use for display only. We are selling our house.
