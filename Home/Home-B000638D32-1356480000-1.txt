review/summary: Best valuereview/text: Every young cook should start with this knife. (It is also a great gift!) I started with Forschner/Victorinox as a butcher and learned that the rolled steel is forgiving and the edge is easy to maintain. Also, Cooks Illustrated rated it the best a few years ago. Can't say much more than this is a great kife.
