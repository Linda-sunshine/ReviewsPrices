review/summary: Pancakes? What are those?!review/text: This waffle maker is so awesome! Previously, we'd make pancakes on a griddle (I think that's what is is, anyway), but found it messy and hated tending to the pancakes, guessing when to flip.This thing--at a great price, no less--makes delicious waffles with none of the guess work! Basically, you pour your waffle mix into the center of the plate (directions say 1/4 cup, but that caused overflow, so we proceeded to do just 1/3 cup, which was perfect), close the lid, and wait for the light to turn green (~1 minute)... and voila, you have a perfect waffle that leaves no remnants behind on the waffle plate. We used the standard recipe on the waffle box (just a random brand from Safeway), but I added some ground psyllium husk to mine, which blended/cooked perfectly. I suspect you could also add chocolate chips, blue berries, raisins, anything.I deducted one star (or .5) because the top plate feels a little loose to me--not a deal breaker, but I wish it was a bit more sturdy. Although, for the price, you can't really beat it! I suspect we'll use this quite often--it's quick, easy to clean (just wipe down with a damp paper towel) and produces heaps of delicious, light, fluffy waffles!
