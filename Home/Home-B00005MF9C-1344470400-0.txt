review/summary: Love itreview/text: I bought two of them at the Black and Decker Store in Lancaster PA. I've been using the first one now since 2006, with the other one still on standby in case of failure.Some observations:The original mug lasted years, but then developed a leak between the rubber and metal. I didn't particulary like the taste the rubber liner imparted to the coffee anyway. Trashed it and now use any mug that is handy.You will occasaionally get coffee grounds in the bottom of your mug. No worry for me. It happens more frequently if you put a lot of coffee in the filter. Be careful scrubbing the filter, as you can damage it.You WILL get leaks unless you pour the water carefully into the tank. Do it carelessly and water will spill over into the filter and you will get coffee on your counter.I use only about 1/4 scoop of coffee (the scoops that come in the coffee containers) in mine, which I've learned through trial and error is how strong I like my coffee.The thing huffs, puffs, chuggs and chuffs; it has more personality than most of my kitchen appliances. It seems to let out this small cloud of steam, with accompanying wheeze, when it's finished brewing just to let you know it's done.I am the only regular coffee drinker in the house, so it is perfect for me. Brew time is short and taste is consistant. Clean-up is easy and there are no filters to buy.I love mine and wouldn't trade it for any other.
