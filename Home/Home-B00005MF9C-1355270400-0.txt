review/summary: Awesome little Coffee Makerreview/text: I didn't think I could get a coffee maker that works this well for this cheap. I've had this for about a week, brewed at least 10 cups with it. Each and everyone has been perfect. I haven't had any of the over flow problems, or too finely ground problems that other people have complained about. It brews in about 3-4 minutes (including the drips at the end) for the travel cup it comes with (~15 ounces.) It's easy to use, and it frees you from using the ridiculous expensive keurig machines/k cups.
