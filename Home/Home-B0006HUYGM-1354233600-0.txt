review/summary: Awesome Power for Small Vacuumreview/text: I purchased this because it was too difficult to maneuver my full size upright to do the carpeted stairs. This thing is great. I missed the cyber monday pricing on this of only $29, so I went ahead and purchased at regular price $37. Not disappointed at all. Very handy vacuum. I also have an upright Eureka that I purchased at Sam's club for less than $100, I would rate it five star also. Great products and highly recommended.
