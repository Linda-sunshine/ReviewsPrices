review/summary: Huge, heavy: just what cast iron should bereview/text: This is a very heavy skillet, so it's really nice having a handle on both sides to help carry and pour. The small spout is a little annoying for me as a left-hander, but the rest of it works great. There was no need to spend time seasoning this skillet, and it's perfect right out of the bag.
