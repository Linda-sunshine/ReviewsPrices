review/summary: Poor Quality and Designreview/text: I would give this chair less than one star if possible. The description and price make the chair attractive. After receiving this product last year as a gift, I have done my best to use it and try to ignore the discomfort and poor quality but I have to urge you as a potential buyer to look for something else. It is not comfortable for me to sit in this chair for long periods of time. I'm a computer programmer and need to spend at least six hours a day in my chair. When you initially sit in the chair, the mesh back will pull your shirt up. Should you ever sit in the chair wearing something like a t-shirt, it feels like a cheese grater running over your skin. The seat doesn't have enough padding. After almost a year of use, I feel like I'm sitting on a board now. Both foam arm rests have broken. Don't waste your money or comfort on this horrible chair.
