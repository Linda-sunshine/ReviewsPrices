review/summary: Food Processor does not come with the Blade Holderreview/text: I bought this during a Black Friday lightning deal that Costco advertised and Amazon picked up. I had since gone into Costco to compare the models. The packaging and accessories for Costco are more in that they include Cuisinart's blade holder. If you are considering getting a food processor and do not know how you will store everything, the holder is sold here on Amazon separately.My purchased-items are the Cuisinart 11-Cup Food Processor with a brushed stainless finish and the Cuisinart Blade holder that work for this size together. I am not disappointed. I chose the full-size one because of the ability to scale up. I am making delicious meals, and I find more flavors and textures since starting to use the food processor. The brushed stainless is pretty. This is my first food processor!
