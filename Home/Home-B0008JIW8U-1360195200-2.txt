review/summary: Unregrettable buy.review/text: It works exactly as described. For a full time and a half college, student that gets very little sleep, getting up in the morning isn't easy. I love the programmable feature, having the pot brewed when I wake up is invaluable. I also quite enjoy that you have no program it every night. I am a forgetful person that would not enjoy waking up to coffee all over my counters.
