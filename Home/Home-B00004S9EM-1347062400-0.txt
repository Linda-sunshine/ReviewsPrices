review/summary: GREAT processorreview/text: I have had one of these for years and use it for practically everything including breadmaking. I bought this one for a close friend who is a disabled Vietnam veteran. He absolutely LOVES it. Not only does he do the normal food processing stuff (cole slaw, grating, etc.), he's turned into a breadmaking "animal" and makes 4 - 5 loaves a week. His came with more accessories than mine did and, because of the way he talks about his, I may add a few things to mine. The only MINOR gripe I have is that it's not that easy to clean dough out of and I try to time things so that I can rinse it and put the "dirty" parts in the dishwasher - where they clean up just fine. If you're looking for a STRONG, versatile processor, this is your baby.
