review/summary: not really impressed (specifically for dust)review/text: i didn't even get this for the air purity or allergens, or whatever. i just wanted some help in minimizing the dust in my apt. i dust about once-a-week and so i know how much dust generally accumulates during a week's time. my expectations for this air purifier were a range from hoping that it would virtually eliminate the need for dusting to at least help me cut down on the frequency.i honestly can't say i see any impact. and i even run it on turbo like almost 24-7.in all fairness, i don't think it's because this particular one is not good, but rather, i'm thinking now that there really isn't an air purifier that is going to be worthwhile. i chose this one after about two months of researching.it does seem to act as a decent fan though, circulating the air in my 4th floor apt.
