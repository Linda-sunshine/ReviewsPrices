review/summary: Good Popcorn popperreview/text: Works well and efficiently. Just plug in and it'll pop on its own. The reason its a 4 star and not a 5 is because the top butter melting cup does not work very well. Luckily its microwavable and that'll melt any pieces of butter. Also, if you are only trying to pop a smaller bowl, a lot of kernels will come flying out without being popped. I'd say under 1/4 cup of kernels inside will lead to quite a few shooting out unpopped. Anything more pops greats, fluffy, popcorn.
