review/summary: good topperreview/text: Ok, !st let me say the bed topper was a great value.I was looking at a similar topper at department store and it was expensive around $300 on sale.The 2nd thing you'll notice is the smell.It has a faint sweet chemical smell that may bother some people, so let it air out for 1 to 2 days.I'm sensitive to most types of those chemical fragrances ,so I let my sit for a day. The topper is very comfortable and definitely improved our bed.It hugs all the curves and shape of your body while you sleep and supports your back.
