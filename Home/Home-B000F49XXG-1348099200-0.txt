review/summary: My new best friendreview/text: I had a giftcard to Macy's so I decided to treat myself to an espresso cappuccino maker. I had done no research and based my decision completely on pricing. Well I lucked out because this machine has been a dream. I'm saving myself the daily $3-4.00 I spend on my fix and I've had great results. It has really worked well for the price.
