review/summary: Great product!review/text: This is my first cast iron skillet. I did some research on the web before it came on care, and coated it with vegetable oil and baked it in the over at 500F for a few hours, then let it cool down to room temp. I know this is a per-seasoned pan, but I figured the factory coating would be a bit "mass-produced" at best, so added a coat of my own before using it. I've used it for bacon and eggs, pancakes, and a chili like dish, as well as for frying some fries in vegetable oil, which really seemed to improve the coating. I plan on frying up some chicken in oil next. The pan is great, very good quality and very heavy.
