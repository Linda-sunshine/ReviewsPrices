review/summary: Excellent pitcher for iced tea!review/text: This is an excellent little pitcher. I looks quite small, but holds more liquid than you would think (due to its square-ish shape). The product description say it is a 2-liter container, but I have observed that it comfortably holds a bit more than this. The glass it quite heavy, which is a plus from my point of view as it is sturdy and holds in the coldness of iced tea better. It is machine washable. I love the air-tight lid. It is a simple design than works quite well and doesn't require threading or grooves that can be difficult to clean. I liked mine so much that I got another as a gift for my parents. They also love theirs. They especially like its square profile, which fits nicely into their cramped fridge.
