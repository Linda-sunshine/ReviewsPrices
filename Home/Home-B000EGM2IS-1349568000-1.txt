review/summary: Gets the job done!review/text: This boils water super fast and I like how it has a dispenser! It makes pouring hot water into my teapot a lot easier. The water limit is a bit small though, and sometimes I find I have to do two loads to get the amount of water I need. It's good enough for maybe 2-3 regular-sized cups of tea (not teacups) and 1 cup of ramen with a little left over.
