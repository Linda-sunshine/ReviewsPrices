review/summary: Perfect product, if it workedreview/text: I love the design of this product. Far superior than other humidifiers. It worked great for the first 3 weeks and I was very happy with it. I followed the care and operation instructions precisely b/c I read other reviewers had problems with this product. Last night, I started having the same problem as others - mist forms in body, but does not rise up and out. Just swirls and eventually leaves a wet mess. I'm waiting to hear back from Crane, but since it's still within the return window on Amazon, I'm trying a replacement. Would love to give this 5 stars, but am reserving higher marks till I try the replacement. Hoping #2 lasts and performs, b/c it really had been highly effective in delivering good mist. So easy to use and clean compared to others. Takes up less space too. No awkward big basin to fill. Easy to fill in bathroom sink.
