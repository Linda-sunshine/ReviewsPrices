review/summary: Wenzel insta-bed Queen sizereview/text: We really love this bed. It inflated very easily and was very comfortable. We did need to add more air after a little while, but after that it stayed inflated to a very comfortable firmness. It also deflated easily and was very easy to get back into the provided bag. We had a great night's sleep and were able to fit 3 on the bed when needed.
