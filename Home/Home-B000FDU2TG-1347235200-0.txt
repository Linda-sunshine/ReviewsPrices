review/summary: Failurereview/text: Purchased this product in March 2011 and proceeded to use it once or twice per week over the next year making smoothies. As many other reviewers have noted, the blade assembly / jar failed after about 15 months - bottom started leaking, loud noises, failure to blend, etc. Of course, the replacement jar/blade assembly costs about $50, because any time you can fleece your customers for an extra $50 because of a serious design flaw in your product, you gotta do it! That is a brazen price point for a piece of plastic whose only conceivable use is to replace something that went wrong with the original product.Shame on me for purchasing a Kitchenaid product. Not a mistake I plan on repeating.
