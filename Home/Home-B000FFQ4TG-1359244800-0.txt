review/summary: So Far Great.....review/text: Excellent coffee maker so far. Had this coffee maker for couple of months and its the hottest and quickest brewer I have ever owned. The dual heating tanks is a great idea. Reason did not give 5 stars is that that you have to put less coffee grinds to avoid an overload. Took a few times and few different roasts to get it right. It brews light and would need to go with a darker roast for a stronger flavor. 2 scoops is all what is needed. Overall after a few tweaks its a great coffee maker and the 3 yr warranty helps!
