review/summary: Got the dreaded Prime message after two months.review/text: Don't purchase this product. Google "Keurig Prime message". See for yourself how many common this problem is. It's a sort of RRD for Xbox 360 or a blue screen of death for PC except the Keurig does not recover from it. You'll see discussions about this even in Amazon. Mine displayed this msg and does not work anymore a mere two months after I purchased it.
