review/summary: LOVE THIS!!!!review/text: I absolutely love this Cast Iron Grill/Griddle. I mostly use this for making pancakes, oh they come out so much better than my non stick pan I love it. The Grill side is great for larger dinner cooking chicken or steak. I have used this on my gas stove top, Have not tried it on our new electric stove top (old school coils)
