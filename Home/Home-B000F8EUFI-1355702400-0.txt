review/summary: Very happyreview/text: I got this using a gift certificate so it is even that much better. My roommate had an old dirt devil that she hated but I had read good reviews about this one and they were spot on. It is very light weight but still does a great job. We have a large German Shepard that leaves hair everywhere and this cleaner has no problem cleaning up. And it is very easy to empty and maintain. Very happy with this product.
