review/summary: good onereview/text: The markings finally faded from my old one. Be sure you don't put this in the dishwasher. It may be safe, but it makes the marks disappear faster (I believe it actually tells you that in the description). I didn't know that, but then, my old one is 20+ years old. I understand Pyrex has changed their formula and these newer ones aren't as heat resistant. I'll have to get back to you on that. this is a good, standard piece of kitchen equipment
