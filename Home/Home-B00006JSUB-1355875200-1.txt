review/summary: The pan is awsome - butreview/text: As a first time cast iron owner, I need directions for maintnenance. When I cooked a marinated steak in the pan, the marinade stuck to the pan. No idea how to get it off without hurting the pan or the finish. It is heavy and cooks well, just need to know how to clean it.
