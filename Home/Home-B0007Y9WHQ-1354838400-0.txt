review/summary: Works For Nowreview/text: I've used it once and it already started to break. I used it for potatoes and the plate I used cracked around the metal. I wonder how many times I'll be able to use it before it breaks completely. That's how cheaply made this is. Part of it was already broken but it was just a part of the plastic that holds the plates you aren't using in place so I shrugged and dealt with it. It made a mess but I guess that's to be expected. It will work but I really don't know for how long.
