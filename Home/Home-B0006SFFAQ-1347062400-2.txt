review/summary: Fire Hazardreview/text: Stay away from this product, and read reviews first including the one from Consumer reports recommending a recall. It worked very well for a few years until this morning. Today it started to smoke, made bubbling noises and the warmer plate literally got red hot. I quickly moved it outside thinking it might catch fire. Then I read all the reviews and called people I knew had purchsed this on my recommendation.
