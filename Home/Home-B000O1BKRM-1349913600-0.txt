review/summary: Useful for water, other liquids, even solids (like fruit salad). Large, slow melting cubes.review/text: I hate ice cubes that melt quickly, they water down my drink and mean I have to make more ice, which I just don't have room for.These trays fill easily and stack (silicone doesn't stick easily so stack as many as you want). The cubes are large so they melt very slowly, they freeze relatively quickly because the silicone breathes to a degree, and it's easy to get the cubes out (turn the tray upside down and bend in half and the middle row will come out, push on the bottom of the cube (through the silicone) and any other one will pop out easily -- takes about 20 seconds to get them all out once you get used to it.Unlike other trays you really don't want huge amounts of cubes - three will keep a 20 oz drink cold for around two hours. e.g. I can drink 40 oz of fluid before I add new cubes.And if you drink the same type of drink regularly (say, lemonade) you can use these to make flavored cubes easily -- their size also accommodates things like frozen grapes to add a bit of flavor and chill to a drink.I've even used these to freeze leftover fruit salad to make easy "smoothie" cubes. Nothing sticks to them so cleanup is a breeze, and for those wondering how to get smells out, just soak them in a dish or large baggie with a mix of 10% white vinegar and 90% water. Soak overnight and whatever smell was in there is gone (the vinegar smell will dissipate on its own).
