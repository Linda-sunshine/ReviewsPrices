review/summary: Great juicer but messy like some sayreview/text: I've used it twice so far and do notice that it can be messy. I recommend keeping a towel handy, especially near the spigot where the juice pours in to the cup. With smaller fruit/vegetables, I notice that some pulp blew back out the insertion tube at me. It was minimal and not a big deal.
