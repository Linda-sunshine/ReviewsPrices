review/summary: Perfect Pot!review/text: The perfect all around cooking pot. I've roasted a chicken, pot roast, and made Seafood Gumbo and chili in this with no spill over! Six quarts is neither too big nor too small. Great price and works just as well as the Le Crueset line. I have both and this by far is more bang for your buck, plus, it's made in America.
