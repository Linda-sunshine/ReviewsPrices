review/summary: My second set!review/text: Some people like silky, satiny sheets. I like a crisp, cool sheet- maybe it reminds me of being at good hotel. The only small issue I have had is putting on the fitted sheet can be tricky. I'm hoping the second set I just ordered is fitted slightly differently, but if not, that's okay too. It doesn't pop off the corners or anything like that, just a little good navigating is necessary.I LOVE the thickness of the cotton; it's not flimsy or see-through. When these are in the wash, I can't wait to get them back on my bed because the matching sheets that I ordered with my comforter cover & shams are okay, but not my favorite cotton white ones. If the biggest compliment a manufacturer can get is a repeat customer, then here I am to testify. I LOVE my sheets (and pillowcases)!
