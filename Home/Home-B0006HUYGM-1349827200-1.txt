review/summary: Very Strongreview/text: This is the strongest hand-held vaccum I have ever used. The cord is nice and long, the suction never gives up. My only complaint would be that it is a bit heavy. I don't have an issue with it, but my mother was complaining while she was testing it out. She is 5'1" and very small... so I don't blame her... It is surprisingly sturdy though (heavy/solid).
