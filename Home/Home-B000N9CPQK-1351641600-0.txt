review/summary: Powerful, Quiet, Works as Described - what else....review/text: This is the third Air Purifier I am buying from Honeywell. The other two are-Honeywell 50250-S 99.97% Pure HEPA Round Air Purifier- 's. I have two kids - a 4 Year old & a 6 months old and the elder one had severe breathing problems and the doctor suggested to keep the home free from dust.I searched a lot of websites, read a lot of reviews and bought the bigger ones for my Living Room & Family Room ( although they are portable I found it difficult to carry around with my kid). They were pretty useful and the visible amount of dust is comparitively less as it was before.I wanted one of these pruifiers for my bedrooms and obviously I started searching for Honeywell items and found this one - which did not break my expectations. Now I have two of these - one in the master bedroom and one in my elder kids bedroom. Needless to say, they work flawlessly.Now about the Ionizer - my wife had been complaining about headache since I started using this. I stopped using the Ionizer and now everything is fine. Me bedrooms have pure air, less dust ( whcih I cannot control completely as these rooms have carpet installed on them).About people complaining the noise by this purifier - you cannot and will not find an Air Purifier which is completely quiet. Period!!! Me, my wife, two kids - all of us sleeps sound with this pruifier on its lowest setting ( which is still powerful) and never had any issues with the sound....
