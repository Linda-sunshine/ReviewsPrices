review/summary: Expect a lifespan of about 9-12 monthsreview/text: This is a great product if you can afford to replace it at least every year. We only have one coffee drinker in the house and she babies this device. It only gets filtered water, gets cleaned and descaled on a regular basis, and turned off when not in use. Despite all this, all three devices (this exact model) have failed within 12 months of purchase to the point of being completely inoperable.
