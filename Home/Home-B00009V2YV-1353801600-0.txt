review/summary: Midland WR300 radioreview/text: Have used this as my bedside radio for a couple of years now. Takes a little bit of patience to learn to program in the county codes but worth it to do it. This will keep you from getting alerts for areas not affecting you. I bought this to warn me of severe weather while sleeping. When strong thunderstorms pop up close to home, the weather service is pretty good about getting out an alert. The only complaint I have is that the regular time/alarm clock display is so small. It is tucked into the upper right corner of the face. I need my reading glasses to see if it is set to am/pm. I work at a steel mill and we use these radios to monitor for severe thunderstorms/tornados. I would recommend this radio.
