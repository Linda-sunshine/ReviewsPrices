review/summary: LOVE THIS PRODUCT!review/text: I am completely satisified with this awesome product! I wanted something for my workplace that was BPA-free and metal or glass as I am leery of heating food/water in plastic containers. This product fit the bill. It heats the water quickly; the heating element is contained inside the metal pitcher, so you will never burn your hands on heating coils, and the water stays hot after you've boiled it. I highly recommend this product!
