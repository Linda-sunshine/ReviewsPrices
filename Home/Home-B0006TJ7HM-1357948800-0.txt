review/summary: Flimsy and disappointingreview/text: I was pretty excited to get these, the reviews were strong and it was very affordable... but I should have known I'd just get what I paid for. They're sharp, but they feel so flimsy in your hand...I was cutting a red onion and could not get a straight line, it sort of wiggled around and instead of slicing right through, if that makes sense. I regret this purchase. Seems like people who give these a good review have probably never used a good knife before.
