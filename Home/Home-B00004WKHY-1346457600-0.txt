review/summary: NO CUISINART FOOD PROCESSORreview/text: I bought a new 11-cup Cuisinart Food Processor in March. It started SMOKING when used in August. I returned it at my expense to a service center in NJ & demanded a new motor. In return, I rec'd my motor/base which smokes more than ever. The Cuisinart "customer service" is abysmal. They still will not guarantee a new motor/base to replace my defective 5-month old processor. Ridiculous. I will never buy another Cuisinart product. I urge you to avoid Cuisinart. Unless, of course, you don't mind disposing of a product that costs over $140 when it fails just months after purchase.Cuisinart DLC-2011CHB Prep 11 Plus 11-Cup Food Processor, Brushed Stainless
