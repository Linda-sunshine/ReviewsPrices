review/summary: Perfecto !!review/text: I received this originally to cook my homemade tortillas, but I have been enjoying it for many other things. I seasoned it on the stove top several times, then in the oven once to coat the entire pan. It works wonderfully ! I am very pleased with this purchase ! If you season it correct it wont be disappointing ! I have cooked over easy eggs on this and it did not stick to the pan.
