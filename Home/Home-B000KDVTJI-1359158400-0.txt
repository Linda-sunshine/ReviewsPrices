review/summary: Elegant and Usefulreview/text: I bought this water kettle for my mother for Christmas. The design is sleek and modern, I LOVE that it is not lined with plastic (which I worry leaks byproducts into the water). The outside does get hot (common sense I think...) so keep it out of reach from young children!
