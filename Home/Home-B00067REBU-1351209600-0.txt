review/summary: Perfect bread makerreview/text: Easy to make fresh bread with this machine, and my bread-snob European wife loves the bread. I don't measure very accurately and still get great results every time, so that dispels what others say about being precise in measurements. I spend just five minutes to add ingredients (regular flours and yeast, nothing special or costly). My sister has a $300 machine and gets same results I do.
