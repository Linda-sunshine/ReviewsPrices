review/summary: amazing juicer!review/text: i just received this today and i have already used it twice! it is a breeze to clean with the built in pulp collector and the motor is a beast. it pulverizes veggies into submission. i love that the collection cup has a separator to keep the foam out of my juice. this is a wonderful product and definitely worth the money!
