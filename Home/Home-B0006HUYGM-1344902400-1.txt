review/summary: while it has several flaws, i still give it a 5review/text: it really sucks~ it has a lot of problems, it takes quite a bit of strength to use (quite a workout), the cord isnt very long, the cord doesnt really warp around too well, it's larger than you probably think it is and yes as stated in other reviews it's quite loud, however it sucks so well i absolutely love it anyways and give it a 5/5. it has extraordinary power for such a small and cheap vac. a small warning for emptying out the compartment is that dust will get behind the filter (depending on how u beat the dust out of the filter) and it WILL shoot out a stream of dust out it's back when turned on next so take it outside and shoot the dust out outside after every compartment cleaning (may as well suck the dust off your hands too while your at it), and yes that was another complaint but i STILL love it regardless!
