review/summary: Very good chair.review/text: After having to return a brand new chair purchased from a 'superstore' chain online for a defective piston ( a completely different chair/brand) I must say I am pleasantly impressed by this chair. It is quite comfortable and seems solidly built AND only took a very few minutes to put together as most of the work has already been done for you. Since I am just over 6'3", I was a bit leery as to how well this chair would fit me, but I need not have worried, the fit is great once I made the initial settings.So, as others have said, if you're looking for a decent chair but cannot afford one of the 'popular' chairs, you can't go wrong with this one. A good chair at a good price...I'm happy !
