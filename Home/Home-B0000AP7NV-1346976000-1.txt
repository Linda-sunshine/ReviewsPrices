review/summary: Great value for clean waterreview/text: I have only had this pitcher for a day, but am really happy to finally have filtered water. The pitcher itself is great for the price. It assembles easy, is easy on the eyes, is slim and is completely functional. I haven't had any problem with pouring as some reviews have mentioned, not even when pouring faster than necessary, and I believe it has to do with a plastic arc that was engineered on the pouring side of the filtering bucket. It carries plenty of water for two people, especially as it filters the next pitcher in under 5 minutes.There is a very obvious difference in taste. The water this produces is, actually, near tasteless (a testament to all the stuff in my tap water!), pristine, and refreshing. The biggest difference I noticed was making espresso with an entry level home espresso maker. It was a noticeable compliment to the e.s.e. pods I was using at the time and can only imagine what a better brand of pods will taste like. The Americano it produced was really tasty!Some minor notes to avoid some of problems mentioned in other reviews: Follow the instructions before using this! Soak the filter for 15 minutes in cold water then rinse with cold water. Discard the first three pitchers of water to avoid carbon dust in your water! Use this water for plants.This will suit me perfectly as I use it to keep 20oz water bottles full in the fridge and to make coffee. I drink water from an Intak water bottle and was using a regular pitcher (which I will also think about keeping full with the filtered water) for refilling, this is a great way to always have water ready. The only downfall I can really see is that it seems pretty fragile, but for the price, I wouldn't expect better. I can't imagine getting something better for this price!
