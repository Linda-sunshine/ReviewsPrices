review/summary: LOVE THIS 15-inch SKILLET, BUT...review/text: I love cooking with this skillet, it gives everything that a cast iron product should and you can fit almost any size protein in it. We recently seared and follow-up baked 5 Cornish hens (yes, it is that big!). It is even heating, wipes clean easily, BUT it is so heavy that it takes more than 2-hands to pour anything out. So, if you are very strong or have a loving hubby to help you pour the juices or gravy into a separate bowl, this pan is for you. I am thinking of buying the next size down for everyday cooking; it is otherwise over-the-top excellent.
