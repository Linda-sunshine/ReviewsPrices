review/summary: Lodge lovereview/text: I have discovered, through purchasing this pan to replace a different crepe pan, that I am crepe-handicapped. I tried, I really did to make beautiful crepes the likes of which I had in France all to no avail. Nothing to do with the pan and everything to do with me apparently. I do love this pan though. It is wonderful for pancakes and probably anything else you may want to cook. This is the lightest Lodge pan I own and it is so nice to work with. No hot spots, no cool spots just perfectly cooked pancakes that were made after my bitter dissapointment with the crepe batter. If you are not crepe-challenged (as I am) I highly recommend this pan. You cannot go wrong with lodge.
