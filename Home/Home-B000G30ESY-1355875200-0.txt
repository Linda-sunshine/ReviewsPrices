review/summary: It was TERRIBLE!!review/text: This item was such a disappointment!! My husband and I thought "finally, perfect rice!" No, not at all. After following directions to the T, the rice was mushy and plain yucky. I could have done that on my stove top in half the time. Thanks a lot - returning it today!!
