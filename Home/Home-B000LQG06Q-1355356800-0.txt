review/summary: Wonderful!review/text: I purchased a new mattress in April, and by May 1st I deceided that I had purchased a mattress that was too hard. I decided to return the mattress, but shortly found out that the fees associated with returning were not worth the hassle. I turned to the internet and they suggested a mattress topper of memory foam no more than 3" no less than 1 1/2". The best purchase for my bedroom ever. I love this topper. I do have a suggestion though. The topper will turn white sheets yellow, so double cover your mattress and it will be great.
