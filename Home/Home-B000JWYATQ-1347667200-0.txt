review/summary: Extremely disappointedreview/text: For this price, I expected a pretty high end set of sheets...one that was fairly soft, and fit well. With these, I got neither. Not only do these feel "cheap" and thin, they're not soft at all, even after three washings. Additionally, although I ordered Queen size sheets and do not have an overly thick mattress, it almost took an act of Congress to get the final corner onto the mattress. I can tell just by this first experience that they aren't sized properly, and that after a few uses, the elastic is going to be complete stretched out. Do yourself a favor and don't buy these. Go to Target and get their 600-count Egyptian sheets...which is what I wish I had done to begin with.
