review/summary: Stopped working after 4 months, but Crane is replacing itreview/text: This worked wonderfully for about 4 months, with heavy usage (2x/day for about 2 hours + 12 hours overnight). It operated silently and was cute to look at. Daily cleaning was a little messy since the water drips when you lift up the tank, but nothing a quick wipe up couldn't take care of. After about 4 months, the humidifer started buzzing and a few days later it stopped producing mist entirely. I called Crane and they are going to send a replacement unit since it is still under warranty, so I am pleased with their customer service. I expect that the next one will probably die after a few months as well, but as long as Crane is willing to keep sending me replacement units, I am willing to put up with that hassle given the relatively low cost of the product.
