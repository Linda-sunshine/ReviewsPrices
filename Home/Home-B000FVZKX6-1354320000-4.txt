review/summary: So Very Warm and Softreview/text: These flannel sheets are so warm and soft! The fitted bottom sheet is the perfect size for my queen deep pocket mattress. So far the color has stayed even with only a couple of washings. I use a mild soap and medium temperature dryer on these wonderful sheets. I'm not sure why I waited so long before purchasing flannel sheets. The winter cold is never felt during the night now.
