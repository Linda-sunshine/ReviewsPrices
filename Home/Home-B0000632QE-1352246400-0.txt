review/summary: Love it!review/text: Given all the warnings in reviews about how sharp this thing is, I was actually afraid to take it out of the box!Once I got over that, it was great fun. Beautifully sliced radishes and cucumbers, matchstick carrots... so far raw beets have been the only thing that didn't really cooperate with the slicer (parboiled they were okay). I look forward to many happy times with this slicer. It would be nice if the holder somehow attached to the rest of it for storage, but that's a minor detail.
