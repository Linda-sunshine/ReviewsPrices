review/summary: Perfect for my needsreview/text: I needed a lightweight vacuum to clean my hardwood floors upstairs, on the stairs, and downstairs. The suction power is great, and the price is perfect. I do wish that the cord was retractable because it is obnoxious to have to wind and unwind it every time I use. And it's kind of lame for carpets and rugs since it doesn't have a spinning roller brush, so we'll hang onto our regular vacuum for the one room in our house that has carpet.
