review/summary: Knife are greatreview/text: This is my first set of knives that i have bought so I went with a trust brand. The knife works great and presentation looks good with my kitchen colors. The one thing that would make the set perfect is the re-sharpening. I was told that you don't need to resharpening with the Ginsu knives. When more time and uses of the knives I will let you know.
