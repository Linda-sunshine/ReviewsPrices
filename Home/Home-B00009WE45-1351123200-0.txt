review/summary: Pretty accurate, inexpensive thermometerreview/text: I have had a few of these thermometers and I find them to be pretty accurate. If you leave them outside then you must put them in a ziploc freezer bag to make sure they don't get wet (as that will eventually rust the battery connectors). You can drop them a couple of times but they aren't rugged so be careful with them. Replacing the battery has worked about 1/2 the time but I just buy them in pairs so I'm not left without one.
