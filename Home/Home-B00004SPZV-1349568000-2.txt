review/summary: Meh.....review/text: I've had it a couple months, worked fine at first, but quickly started having issues with it not sealing properly. So you'll be pumping it for pressure and the top will fly off other times, you'll pump forever and it will barely work. Oil all over the place. Looking for my replacement now. $10 good price, but you get what you pay for in this case! Bummer!
