review/summary: Very disappointedreview/text: I got this humidifier after our Vick's died. I thought this frog was cute and I liked it didn't need a filter. After 2 nights of using it when my daughter was sick, we didn't use it for a week because my daughter was admitted to the area children's hospital for pneumonia.After a 4 night stay at the hospital I came home today, turned it on in preparation for bedtime, and the mist is more like a gentle mist rolling out, even on full-blast it trickles out. So now I'm stuck tonight with a still- sick little girl and a barely working humidifier! Kind of a worst-case scenario.It died with 2 night's use. Therefore the one star rating.
