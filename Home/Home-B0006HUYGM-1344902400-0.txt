review/summary: Good little machinereview/text: I had my doubt's this would clean good I ordered a different brand and it was terrible. This really has a lot of suction I have two long haired cats and a dog that sheds. Is a little awkward for the car mats but it really works good. I am glad I bought this one but will order an extra filter so when I wash this one I will have a spare and it washes good also.
