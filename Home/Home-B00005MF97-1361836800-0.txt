review/summary: Absolutely the Best!!!review/text: I ordered one of these last Summer and use it for everything! From nuts, to carrots, to fruit...you name it, this little chopper is the best for any job! I'm an avid baker and home cook, constantly in the Kitchen. I'm ordering another because I use it so much and don't know how long it will last. I don't want to take a chance of not having one. It's a must have if you don't like hauling out and cleaning a big one, which I rarely use anymore.
