review/summary: Makes a Differencereview/text: We use a french press, and have been grinding our beans in a blade type grinder. I was skeptical that I could taste the difference in the uniformly coarse grind the burr grinder produces, but I was wrong. We now have perfect coffee at the push of the button. A plus is that our old blade grinder has been re-purposed as a spice grinder.
