review/summary: Will still be grinding your beans long after you've checked outreview/text: I have one in white (that looks identical in all respects to this offering) that I bought in 1985 at Kobos Coffee in Portland, OR. I am still using it regularly in 2013 to grind my beans. After 28+ years of use and three moves, it's still running smoothly and powerfully (and quietly by the way, except for the initial clatter of the grinding beans). Believe me, this puppy will grind any coffee beans to espresso-grade powder (if that's your preference) in a jiffy. Coarser grinds more your style? you'll have it in a few seconds. The plastic top is dishwasher safe (top shelf). Built to last.
