review/summary: Buy Itreview/text: I bought this based on its high rating from others and I was not disappointed. It is easy to handle and control and it effortlessly purees veggies in a pot of cooking soup. It seems well made and it is good-loooking to boot. i haven't owned it long enough to rate its durability.
