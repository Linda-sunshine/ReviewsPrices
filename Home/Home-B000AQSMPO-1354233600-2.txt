review/summary: RIP my two B60'sreview/text: Our first one got it's little electronic brain fried when the power went out right in the middle of brewing one day. I don't blame the coffee maker for this, I only bring it up to say if you spend the dough for a Keurig put it on a surge protecter.The replacement we got (thanks to the retail store's generous return/exchange policy) has finally died after almost 18 months. I won't bother with a detailed review about the expense and quality of K cups, other than to say if you decide to buy a Keurig get the "my K-cup" so you can use your own coffee. But I wouldn't do it. A $170 coffee maker that doesn't even last 2 years is unacceptable.
