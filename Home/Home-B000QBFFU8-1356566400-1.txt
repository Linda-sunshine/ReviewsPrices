review/summary: dangerous!review/text: I have had this juicer for a year and a half. In that time, I've used it 2-3x's per month. This past weekend I used it after not having used it it for 2 -3 months and the micro-mesh filter disintegrated inside the machine while it was running and blew out the plastic side causing a plastic and vegetable part explosion on the wall and other kitchen appliances. I had it set to hard vegetables and had chopped the vegetables up to make them smaller. I have tried to contact the company but they haven't been available. I would love to post detailed pictures of this mess, but as of now, Amazon does not allow this. Please be careful when using this product. I had small children in the room with me at the time and I am still shaken up about it.
