review/summary: Very pleasedreview/text: I bought this filter about three months ago to help my husband who was suffering from terrible allergies coupled with a very bad sinus infection. And we have a dog who sheds quite a bit. The poor man wasn't sleeping at all. It has improved his breathing significantly! We have up to now only run it at night in our bedroom on the medium or low setting. Our bedroom is fairly large but it is doing a good job even in the larger space. I'm considering buying a second unit for downstairs as we've noticed an uptick in his allergies since the heat has been blowing dust and dog dander around (we vacuum and dust regularly but he's still sniffling). My only complaint about it is the noise. It is quite loud at the high setting and even the medium setting. The low setting we've adjusted to as white noise while we sleep but it took a bit to get used to.
