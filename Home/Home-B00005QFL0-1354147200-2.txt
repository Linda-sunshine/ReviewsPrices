review/summary: Fresh bread!review/text: Easy to clean, easy to use. The directions contain some basic recipes that turn out pretty good - unless someone accidentally measures the wrong kind of ounces (reason number 500 the boyfriend isn't allowed in my kitchen!)I love the fact that this bread machine has the delay timer on it, there is nothing quite like waking up to a fresh loaf of bread in the morning!
