review/summary: Slow Workreview/text: I sought out a carpet cleaner for our area rugs as our floors are tile. I bought this machine because of the upholstery hose/accessories and was pleased to find out that I can purchase a hard floor adapter/head separately. So, as far as functionality goes, this is definitely a winner. I'm a little disappointed in how slowly the process moves along. The machine works well as long as you move at a snail's pace. Because you move so slowly you go through your tank pretty quickly. I had to refill the cleaning solution tank more than half a dozen times for an 8x10 rug. This may be because my rugs were SO dirty. Two dogs, Army boots, and two years without a rug cleaner will do that. The hand held scrubber is awesome for the edges of my rugs where the machine sits half on/half off and doesn't get to fully work the scrubbers. I'm hoping that three months from now when I revisit the rugs with the cleaner I'll be able to zip through it a little quicker. I'm very pleased with this purchase and despite the perceived issues, would purchase it again.
