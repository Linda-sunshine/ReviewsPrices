review/summary: Okreview/text: I like this purchase and it definitely chops up all my produce just fine. The only gripe I have is the buttons on it, there is just a sticker that is covering the buttons, and after two uses the sticker started peeling off. Also, the safety mechanism is a little flimsy, so I'm wondering how long it will last until it snaps off. But overall it does it's job and it was a good price.
