review/summary: Defective?review/text: I ordered this iron, because I saw a review on Good Housekeeping and the reviews on Amazon are stellar. Although the steam output, digital display and iron temperature were good - the spray function which is super important for ironing cotton clothes - was defective in the product that was delivered to me. Instead of spraying water it simply dripped down along the iron, I was heartbroken. I have placed an order for another one hoping my item was defective. I will keep you posted!
