review/summary: Mighty "Mighty Mite"review/text: In 2002, at a garage sale I bought a used little red Eureka Mighty Mite for use in our car, we had no idea how old it was at the time, however soon it became the familys main vacuume, best we have ever had. In 2012 it sadly expired from age and overuse. We just had to have another Mighty Mite(new), the one we received from our order is every bit as good as the one we were replacing, we hope it gives us as many years of service.
