review/summary: Works but just okreview/text: First, the motor is just a bit weak and bogs down a little to easily. Second, The slots are a little sloppy when using thinner blades and require a good steady hand to keep the angle.There is some time needed to get the proper technique and movement down so don't just shove your $200 knife through expecting it to come out razor sharp. I used an old knife that I didn't care if destroyed to practice a bit before I felt comfortable enough putting my good blades in it. It does a decent job especially on big long blades but I actually prefer my manual sharpener to sharpen my small knives by hand and it costs half the price. I did use it to sharpen some serrated steak knives but the results are not as favorable as I would have liked.
