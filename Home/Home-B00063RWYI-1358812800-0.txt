review/summary: Best Dutch oven for the moneyreview/text: Purchased this approx 1 yr. ago and love it. Yes, cast iron is heavy and this is no exception. It did come pre-treated and I have maintained the treatment with no problems. Just follow the instructions to the letter and you'll have a rust free and non-stick dutch oven for the rest of your life and your kids life!
