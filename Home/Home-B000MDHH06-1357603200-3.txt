review/summary: I like it BUT!review/text: Arrived 10 days late after being pronounced lost. Juicer was badly defective, during the second use my husband almost got electrocuted. It sounded like fireworks going on underneath the motor and we could also see full blown sparks through the plastic walls of the unit. Otherwise it's very easy to use and and clean and it's a very powerfull juicer. Just about to unwrap the new one that arrived during the holidays. Still kind of afraid of it though.
