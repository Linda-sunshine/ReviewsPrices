review/summary: Best long lasting co fee maker I have owned!!!review/text: I was looking on Amazon to see if this coffee maker is even available these days. I have had mine for 5 years now and in my household that is a dinosaur's age for a coffee maker. Prior to this one we had Cuisanart, Krups and Mr. Coffee one a year each year prior to this one's purchase. If you maintain it with the vinegar and water clean out on a monthly basis it works well to shorten the brew time. It is a tall unit so if you plan to put under kitchen cabinets make sure to measure. I set my coffee up to brew the night before. The water temperature warms a bit thru the night so it does brew hotter and keeps in the thermal carafe for a bout 4 hours.It is smaller brew pot overall, it says 10 cups if you drink mugs of coffee it is more like 6 mugs. However the longevity of this coffee maker outweighs the smaller size. The others always flooded out the brew controls because, in my opinion, the brew controls or electric on/off switches were beneath the brew pot and could get wet if a pot of brewing coffee improperly brewed. So when I went looking for a replacement I looke to see where the controls were in relation to the actual brewing and this units controls are completely to the side of the brewer filter and pot. I do believe that is why it has lasted 6 years. If my current one every quits I will try to buy this model again. Very pleased with it's quality and engineering!
