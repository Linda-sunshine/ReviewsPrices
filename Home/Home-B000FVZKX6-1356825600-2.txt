review/summary: nice sheet setreview/text: I've never bought anything from Pinzon. The fabric is soft and the fitted sheet has wonderfully deep pockets. So far it seems to be a good buy. My only complaint is the color. The color is a true deep camel color. Not the off white Chamois I expected. This sheet set makes it difficult to get out of bed in the morning.
