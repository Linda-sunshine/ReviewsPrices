review/summary: Superb coffee filter basketreview/text: This is an option for the Mr Coffee programmable coffee maker that eliminates the need for paper filters and filter dispensers. The only drawback to its use is coffee grounds disposal. With an ordinary filter basket, one can empty the grounds by removing the filter. The grounds are more difficult to remove from the permanent filter, requiring tapping the basket to remove as much as possible into the waste can and then several rinses in the sink to completely clear the basket of grounds. All in all I'm glad I purchased this item. Just be sure that it fits into the filter basket provided with the coffee maker, to avoid overflow.
