review/summary: Indispensable FoodSaver accessory in our kitchenreview/text: This Jar sealer is an excellent product. We have been using it for years in our kitchen at home and we have another in our motor home galley. It simply works as promised every time without fail.FoodSaver bags are good for many items. However, vacuum sealed canning jars are the ideal, low cost answer for many products that you want to partially use then re-vacuum to be fresh and ready for the next use. Grated cheese like cheddar, Romano, assiago, etc. will stay fresh in vacuumed jars in the refrigerator for long periods of time. If you try to store these grated cheeses in a vacuum bag they will smash back to their original solid state. Glass jars and lids are low cost and are available in a variety of sizes. The lids may be re-used if they are carefully removed. This can be done by wedging the back of a sturdy knife between the lid and the top thread of the jar. Then, prying up very slowly until you hear the hiss of the air rushing in. After taking the amount of product desired, you may wash the lid with warm water and re-seal.We use vacuum sealed glass jars to extend the shelf life of a variety of food products. Examples include: rice, barley, bulgar wheat,beans,lentils,Dry minced onion,Panko bread crumbs,orzo,various small pastas, sugar and a variety of nuts.These jars may be used to speed up marinating meats. Slightly perforate the meat then, insert into the jar, apply vacuum to the lid, shake a few times to distribute the marinade then place on its side in the refrigerator for a few minutes.I am certain that you will find more uses as you explore possibilities of this wonderful gadget
