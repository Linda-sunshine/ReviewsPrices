review/summary: Caprsso 565 Arrived Defectivereview/text: Purchase Capresso at your own risk!!!The grind setting only went as far as "Fine". The "Extra Fine" setting could not be set. I called the manufacturer and the representative said I "broke" the machine and the warranty does not apply.Capresso did not accept the fact that it was defective upon arrival.I returned it to Amazon for full refund.I have now purchased from Amazon a Breville grinder. I had previously owned a Breville purchased from Amazon.
