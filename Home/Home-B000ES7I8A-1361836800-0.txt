review/summary: Horrible.review/text: We've had this kettle for about 1.5 months. We discovered today that when there is water in the kettle, water leaks out the bottom of the kettle, in the area just below the on/off switch. Needless to say, we are returning the product because we don't want to be electrocuted.We've also had problems since day 1 with pouring water without having water leak all over the place - I think the spout is poorly designed and when you pour, water dribbles down the side of the kettle.It's really too bad because this is a nice looking kettle and it is stainless steel.
