review/summary: Perfect for PET owners!review/text: I busted this sucker (pun intended) out as soon as it was delivered (right on time) and boy howdy does it ever get the job done! I live with two long haired dogs who are still molting like the dickens. Since they're my spoiled babies they get onto our fabric covered couches constantly. I've bought my weight in lint rollers and daydreamed about throwing my upright vacuum into oncoming traffic. I bought the eureka because of the rave reviews from other couch fur afflicted people. I could not be more happy with that decision! I paid $30 and some change for my sanity, hello, bargain! I just got it today and my couch looks like a human's piece of furniture again! I did have to empty the dust bowl a few times throughout the cleaning but as I've said I have two long haired dogs losing their summer coat and one of them is quite a large dog. Plus the eureka was still full powered suctioning, I just thought it best to empty it out when I saw the amount of dog fur already sucked up. Not to mention dust and dirt!! I had no idea my couch was that color, HAHA! Best money I've spent in a long time. If this vacuum lasts only a year it would have paid for itself 4 times over and you can bet I'll be buying another of the same model the same day! Also I think it's neat the way the crevice tool can be inserted into the bottom of the vacuum for storage. And it stays firmly on the hose until you pull it apart when your done which is something that my upright vacuum can't even accomplish.
