review/summary: Best tiny vacuum ever!review/text: I don't claim to be a vacuum authority but I do get frustrated by the cheapness and lackluster performance of others I've used. This vacuum is the spitting image of lesser machines I've found in my local big box stores for comparable cost, but the reviews and specs left me unsatisfied. I had read some reviews on this baby and after much deliberation, I purchased it. If this sounds like you, just buy this one. It sucks, and it sucks and you change the filter (inexpensive) and it sucks some more. It is loud, yes, and I don't care. It is simple. No frills. It does precisely what a vacuum should: clean THOROUGHLY. I highly recommend it.
