review/summary: No problems - works greatreview/text: I was hesitant in buying this model because of those who posted they had problems with the fit of the lid. We've had no problems. We do make sure a finger holds the lid on "just in case" while pouring. We pour over the sink for an extra measure. I love how much it holds and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. No problems at all.
