review/summary: the best sleep...review/text: I ordered this for my rack while I was deployed. It made all the difference. It added two inches of cushion to hard mattress making it almost as good as my pillowtop serta at home. I ended up ordering four of these in total for other soldiers. It's a great way to have good sleep when replacing the mattress is impractical or financially not possible. Do yourself the favor and try one. My company commander said that he got the best sleep that he's had in fourteen years after trying this mattress topper!If you would like to know something specific about this item just ask and I'll try to respond within a day or so.
