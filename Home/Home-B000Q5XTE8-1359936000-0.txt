review/summary: What a comfortable chair!review/text: I am tall with long legs and have never found a home office chair that fit me that didn't cost over $1k until now. This one works great. I didn't use the original casters that cam with the chair because of the wood floor in my office. Instead I use the previously purchased Rolland Office Chair Caster Wheel for Wood Floor - Stem Diameter: 11mm, Stem Length: 22mm - 5 Unit/Pack from Amazon. The combination is perfect. I can still scoot around the office in the chair without marking the floor and now for long periods and all without breaking the bank.
