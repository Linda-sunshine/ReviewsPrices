review/summary: Second one bought as a giftreview/text: I have one of these and recently purchased this one for a friend-as a part of a &#34;Tea-lovers Basket&#34; gift that I made for her. The kettle that I have, I have had for over a year, and it is nearly-indestructible; I drink tea all day long, and it is used for ramen, oatmeal, cooking, sauces, etc-it has been in constant use for over a year, and still works wonderfully. I recommend this to everyone who drinks tea, but also as a great kitchen appliance that looks lovely sitting out on the countertop.
