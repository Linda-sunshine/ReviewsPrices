review/summary: Great help in feedings and putting the baby to sleep.review/text: I love this chair. I bought it even though some people said in their reviews that cushions were not super comfortable. It's a great chair - it's great iduring feedings- you rock back and forth and the baby falls asleep. The second piece is great for the feet- makes you fall asleep too :))
