review/summary: Marvelous!review/text: I love my presto pressure cooker! It works like a charm. I was unable to find anything similar for a good price in Spain and I was very pleased to see that there was international shipping available for this product. I was able to can some high quality meat at a very good price, not a bad day's work with the ongoing economy crisis and the rise in food prices! It also solves the problem of buying in bulk size and not having enough space in the fridge. Highly recommended!
