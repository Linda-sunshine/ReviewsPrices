review/summary: A great product at Avery good pricereview/text: When I started using this product, I was not impressed.Despite having owned espresso machines for 35 years, I could not get decent crema.I tried many of the tips other owners had suggested in their reviews,all to no avail.It was not the amount of coffee used or the tamp that was the problem, it was the grind.The last few pounds of coffee I have used are &#34;traditional&#34; roast espresso beans ground at 4.5.Now I can do no wrong, perfect crema every time.This machine is a very good value especially if you can buy it for under $100
