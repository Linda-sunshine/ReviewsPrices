review/summary: Perfect!!!review/text: This is just what I was looking for.- Boils quickly - I didn't time it, but it feels like it boils 4-6 cups of water within a few minutes.- Automatic shut-off - The water comes to roaring boil, then it shuts off.- &#34;Cordless&#34; - The cord detaches from the unit. It is plugged in while boiling the water, then I can detach it from the unit to carry it around cordless while I pour it on the table for my guests.- Switch - It lights up when it's on! So no more of &#34;Why isn't the water boiling? Oh, I forgot to turn it on.&#34;- Large pouring lip - It doesn't drip. More importantly, I don't have to take the lid off to put more water in from the faucet.- See-thru level - It's very easy to see how much water is in the unit.- Handle - It's easy to grab the whole thing by the handle and it's very stable.And it's cheap :) Like I said, it's PERFECT!
