review/summary: Gorgeous, but Not Very Accuratereview/text: I adore the look of this scale in my bathroom! It is beautiful. I don't mind leaving out for anyone to see. However...it is not extremely accurate. I have been very careful about standing in the exact same location on the scale each time I step on. Most days it will give me the same reading again and again. Other times I have tried weighing myself 3 times in a row, five minutes apart after letting it reset and it varied by several pounds each time. I have no idea why this is! After reading other reivews I have also been very careful about not moving the scale at all, and yet it still varies by several pounds.Normally I would not think the varying pounds would be a huge deal, however, I am currently pregnant and am attempting to monitor my weekly weight gain. With this scale, it's pretty much impossible! What a bummer.
