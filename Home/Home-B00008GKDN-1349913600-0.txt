review/summary: best price ive seen for this type of skilletreview/text: Great price for a functional pan! Makes my prime membership so worthwhile!I grew up making Danish thin pancakes (most everyone calls them crepes) with my mother in a large, flat cast iron pan like this. Since ive been married, I have been scouring the local antiques stores for something similar. I never found anything for a fair price...I looked on ebay and got the same thing...old pans for 35 bucks and up plus shipping. I understand there is value in older cast iron...but I just wanted something that worked! I remembered that my most treasured cast iron griddle for my stove center burner came from amazon and was ridiculously inexpensive so I checked for this type of pan. I'm so glad I did! Its perfect...the handle is an acceptable length, the overall size is perfect and the edges aren't too high. I am gong to make thin pancakes at my house in my own pan tomorrow...I cant wait to see how this pan spreads the batter.Ive noticed I am phasing out my tephlon pans for cast iron more and more. This makes 4 cast iron stove top implements now...everyone should convert back to cast iron...it cooks so well and evenly, its so easy to clean and gives a superior texture to many foods.
