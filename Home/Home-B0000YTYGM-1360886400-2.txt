review/summary: This coffeemaker has most of what I needed...not all, but great for what it is!review/text: Like so many folks who have taken time to review coffeemakers, I've looked high and low for the perfect home coffeemaker...this one is the closest so far for what I quest! Makes great coffee, stays hot for hours (without burning the liquid gold). Very easy to operate, attractive, well designed and worth every penny (which was not too much) considering 1/3 of the field was more expensive. I wish it had a detachable water tank and the biggest con for almost all thermals out there...very small opening on the top...making it very difficult to thoroughly clean the inside buildup of coffee residue. Our last maker (Krupps) had the same issue...as does most carafes out there. I would have preferred that the electronics were located on top of the brewer, rather than the base for various reasons...safety from accidental spills/overflows (yet to happen), harder to see and less accessible than top mounted switches. the LED display is also very small to read (especially early in the AM...or late at night when trying to setup the &#34;auto&#34; feature for AM brew. The loud &#34;beeping&#34; when coffee has finished it's brew cycle is useless and annoying...wish there was a switch to defeat this feature (needing to know the precise moment the coffee is ready is silly to me...you know it when it stops brewing..the water is gone!).
