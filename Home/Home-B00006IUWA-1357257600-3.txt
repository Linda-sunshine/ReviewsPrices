review/summary: Great, cheap air popper!review/text: This thing works great! It's just your standard, run-of-the-mill air popper but it gets the job done with very minimal clean-up. The heating element finally died in our old air popper so I bought this one becuase of the low price (we eat a lot of popcorn). It has met all of my expectations. The tray for melting butter is sort of more hassle/mess than it's worth, but other than that I have no complaints.
