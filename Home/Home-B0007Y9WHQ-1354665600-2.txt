review/summary: Run!review/text: I was so excited to get this until I actually tried it. I used it on one sweet potato and after turning about half way through the potato, I heard a crack from the handle. I sent it back. The design is good, they just need to improve the quality of the materials. I ordered a Japanese one in hopes that the construction will be much better.
