review/summary: My Replacement for Plastic Coffee Makersreview/text: Bought this a year ago to replace my junky dirty plastic coffee maker(s).I use 4-cup unbleached coffee filters I purchased from the local store or on Amazon.com, fold them in half and cut about 3/8" around the perimeter. Hence, cutting off 3/8" around the outer perimeter of the half-moon shaped filter after folding in half. Then, while still folded in half, I snip a 1/4" centre notch. Unfold and slip the filter into the metal bin. A one minute task, but tirelessly performed as the flat circular paper filters I purchased from Amazon.com do not filter the grounds as well.Other then this, the unit is easily cleaned with a simple rinsing, unlike the plastic coffee makers with hidden grime. The unit also makes coffee well. I usually unplug the unit after brewing, heating half cups of milk in the microwave in order to reheat the cold added coffee.I have no doubts this unit will easily last a decade or more, and still look new!
