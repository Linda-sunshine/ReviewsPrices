review/summary: armrests lay a few inches widerreview/text: Overall the chair is just barely satisfactory. It's not terrible, but it's not really all that good either. The biggest issue that I have with this chair is the width of the arm rests. I am male 5'8" 150lbs, and while sitting in this chair, with the most narrow setting for the armrests, my arms are spread out like chicken wings because the armrests lay a few inches wider than a normal resting position.
