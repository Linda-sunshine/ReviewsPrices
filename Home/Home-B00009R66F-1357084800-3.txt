review/summary: Not a Steam Vacuum - Hoover said it's a trademark onlyreview/text: We did not see the steam, only a dribble of cleaner. Hoover CSR said Steam is a trademark only. It puts down the cleaning solution via gravity and then vacuums it. It is a manual process controlling the cleaning solution put down. It does work. On a scale of 1-10 my wife said its a 4. It takes the easy spots out, not so much for most, or ground in dirt.
