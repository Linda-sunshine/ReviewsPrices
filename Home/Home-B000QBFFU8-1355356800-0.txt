review/summary: Recommend this one!review/text: A friend who had done juicing and had learned what characteristics make a good machine, suggested this one and I am SO glad! This machine is powerful, easy to use, easy to clean, and I am so thankful to have benefited from her experience! The variable speed is important due to the hardness/softness of the fruits/veggies. Being easy to clean makes me more likely to use it regularly. I would highly recommend this machine for those reasons.
