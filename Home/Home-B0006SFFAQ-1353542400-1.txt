review/summary: Great Coffee Maker, But...review/text: We purchased this coffee maker four years ago and it worked perfect every day. Starting a month ago, the coffee maker would begin shutting itself off halfway through the brewing process and we would have to wait 10-15 minutes to turn it back on. Two days ago, it finally died completely. Overall, we were satisfied with the coffee maker, just wish we could have gotten a couple more years out of it.
