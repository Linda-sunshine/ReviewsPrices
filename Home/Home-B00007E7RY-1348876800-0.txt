review/summary: great deal from amazonreview/text: Was looking for a true HEPA filter since we are doing construction at home and there is a fair amount of dust in the house. Seems to be a lot of HEPA-like filters out there, this is a true HEPA filter.I was at home depot and happened to see this same unit in black color it was $195, I was able to get it here for $129. Major difference in price.The unit is borderline 'industrial' appearing, large and circular in size (19" diameter). It is not low profile by any means.Does make a good amount of white noise when on high mode, the lower modes aremuch better to sleep to.It does a fine job in cleaning the air. The HEPA filter is given 5 years of life till needs replacing. There is a pre-filter that needs to be replaced 3-4 months if the unit is always on. Great by at the price.
