review/summary: Love!review/text: This is my first Keurig, and I'm so glad I received it! It's easy to use, quick to brew, and the perfect size for my coffee nook in my kitchen. I haven't set up a timer yet, it's so quick to brew that I really don't need to! Again, it's a new product, and I've only been using it for a couple of weeks, but let's hope it always works as wonderfully :)
