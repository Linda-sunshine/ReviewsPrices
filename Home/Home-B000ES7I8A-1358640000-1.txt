review/summary: Good if you like scalding hot water...pouring on youreview/text: I chose this item because of all the positive reviews, but I am very disappointed. Sure the design is awesome. It is 99.99% metal, which is great. It heats up well. But it also has the WORST spout I have ever seen. It is next to impossible to get a clean pour without wonderfully boiled water pouring ALL over the place...like on my FOOT!!This leads me to ask about all the glowing reviews. There are three explanations that I can come up with for the good reviews: 1. There is some magical way to get the boiling water not to pour all over the place, but since I did not go to Hogwarts, I do not know what it is; 2. The good reviews are from people who do not actually use it for anything that involves boiling water; 3. The people who wrote the reviews were paid to write them.I still give it 2 stars because the design is pretty awesome, if not functional.
