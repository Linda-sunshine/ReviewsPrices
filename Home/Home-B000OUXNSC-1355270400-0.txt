review/summary: Great product for the pricereview/text: I needed a mattress cover ASAP and decided to get this one after reading a few of the reviews. I'm so glad I did. This cover is awesome. Excellent quality. And like a previous buyer pointed out, the part that goes over the sides of the mattress is NOT made of that papery material. It's more of a cotton blend. I put it on my son's full mattress (it's the thin kind from IKEA) and it fits perfectly. With PLENTY of room and stretch to go over a deeper mattress. Would definitely recommend this to anyone.
