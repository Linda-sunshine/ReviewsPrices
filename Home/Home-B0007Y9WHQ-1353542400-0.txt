review/summary: Wonderful culinary oppotunities, craptastic durabilityreview/text: I purchased this gadget, about a month ago, with the primary intent of replacing the pasta (and other conventional grain-based noodles) in my diet with healthier, leaner vegetable-noodle options. I received it in a timely manner, and immediately began making zucchini spirals to have with marinara and non-dairy/nut-based alfredo sauces. It made long curls, lovely texture, and the zucchini spirals are a wonderful replacement for pasta. I actually much prefer them to regular grain noodles, and do not know how I managed to exist in ignorant bliss for so long without trying them. After about my tenth use of this tool, I decided to try spiralizing a carrot. Since hard root vegetables are shown on the packaging, I assumed it was perfectly fine. Nope. Two cracks formed along the top of the main blade (the one with larger holes), almost immediately, and it basically just shredded the carrot, rather than producing long curls. I was able to seal these cracks off with durable packaging tape and continue using it, but for soft vegetables - zucchinis and cucumbers only. While I LOVE the potential of this product, I'm seriously disappointed with its lack of sturdiness. At some point, I will probably invest in a much nicer, more durable version.
