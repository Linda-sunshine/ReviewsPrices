review/summary: Right-Wing Neo-Con Racialist Propagandareview/text: Reading this book, I learned many things:1) That blue-eyed people are spiritually superior to dark-eyed people. (Racism)2) That sharing feelings and dreams is bad, and keeping your feelings bottled up inside is good.3) That the idea of community and interdependence is bad, but rugged individualism is good.4) That Old-Folks' Homes and daycare centers are bad, because they really are "death-panels" in disguise.5) Providing three square meals a day is bad, but starvation is good because it helps people develop "feelings".6) Bicycles are bad, but sledding downhill is good.Now what does all that sound like? Why, it sounds like typical right-wing fascist propaganda.Congradulations, Ms. Lowry, for being able to disguise your propaganda as "serious literature", and for being able to foist it onto kids with very little serious objection from parents.Needless to say, this book is not for kids, and never should have been placed in the kid category. Instead of making kids think, this book tells them what to think. If the author wanted to write true literature, she would have had the main character die at the end of the book. Only then would I even remotely recommend it to kids.
