review/summary: Unit works well but the plastic shatters if dropped on a hard surfacereview/text: This filtered water dispenser was shipped promptly. The filter unit works well but the plastic is somewhat brittle and will shatter if dropped on a hard surface like tile. Brita and PUR filters appear to be interchangeable.
