review/summary: great kettlereview/text: i bought this electric kettle because I got tired of trying to use the stove top one when my children wanted hot cocoa or ramen noodle cups. There have been a lot of reviewers stating this kettle leaves a bad plastic smell and taste in the water. It smelled of plastic when I first opened it and I rinsed it out with a little dawn dish liquid and water. There has not been a plastic smell since. I have had this for 4 days now and have used it since I got it after washing out and have not had any problems with smell or taste of plastic. This heats the water in less than 2-3 minutes which comes in handy when having impatient kids.
