review/summary: This is the best coffee brewer I have ever purchasedreview/text: I got this as a Christmas present to myself. Even with the smaller, 2-4 cup coffeemakers, I either didn't drink enough, or wanted more. It was a waste of coffee. I thought this would be a foolish purchase, but I was so wrong. The coffee brewer takes no time to heat it up and stays hot for two hours. It is much neater than the regular drip brewer, and you can have whatever kind of coffee you want. People told me it would be more expensive for me, but I don't think so, nor do I care. Easy to clean, everything about it is great.
