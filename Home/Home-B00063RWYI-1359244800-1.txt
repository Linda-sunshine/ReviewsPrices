review/summary: great for... EVERYTHINGreview/text: I use my dutch oven to sautee veggies and sear meats... cover with water and finish the cooking in the oven for the rest of the afternoon to make a great stew. There is no switching from a stovetop pot to an oven pan. This is the best!I use it the most often to make homemade bread. Bake a boule for 30 mins covered, and then finish the bread uncovered for the last 15-20 mins. Comes out perfect and crisp every time. And I don't have to spend a fortune at the neighborhood bakery!Chili, stews, breads, ribs, I have even made a batch of cinnamon rolls in this thing. It's the best!
