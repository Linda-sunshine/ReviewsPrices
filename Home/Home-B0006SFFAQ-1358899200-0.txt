review/summary: Mostly lovereview/text: What a beautiful coffee maker. Our friends had one when we went to visit and I liked the way the pot poured. I also loved the coffee! So I ordered one the minute we got home. The one thing I'm not fond of is there is no hinge on the top of the pot. You have to snap the whole thing off and on and that is too much handling. However, I'll put up with that little inconvenience to enjoy the good looks and the good coffee.
