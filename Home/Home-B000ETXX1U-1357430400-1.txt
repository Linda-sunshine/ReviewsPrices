review/summary: Comfortable and easy to inflate/deflatereview/text: Bed is well made, inflates and deflates relatively quickly and provides a good night of sleep for guests. As with all inflatable beds, the pump is loud. It does have two chambers, which makes it easier to get the right feel. The built-in pump lets guests adjust the bed without much fuss.
