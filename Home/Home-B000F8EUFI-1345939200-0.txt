review/summary: good for a small vacuumreview/text: I was a little skeptical about buying this because I have always had hoover or bissel vacuums, but I'm very pleased with this. For a small lightweight vacuum this works great. You do need to empty the cannister a few times, depending on if you're doing the whole house or just an area. However, I always empty the cannister after each use so its not a problem for me. It's lightweight, easy to store, easy to handle. I have a cat and it picks up cat hair just fine. I would recommend for someone in an apartment or a dorm.
