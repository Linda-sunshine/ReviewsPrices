review/summary: Great Juicer!review/text: I love this juicer. I would have preferred a juicer that included pulp but this was half the price. I was totally surprised when I opened the box and saw how big and heavy duty this product is. This juicer gets so much juice out of the fruit and vegetables. One fuji apple made a glass of juice. I would recommend this juicer to anyone looking for a good, strong juicer for daily juicing. Oh and as for people commenting on cleaning. All juicers have to be cleaned. Most of the parts can just be rinsed. It also comes with a brush to clean the juicing part.
