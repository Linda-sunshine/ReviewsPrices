review/summary: Oster Express Breadmakerreview/text: Oster is another name for Sunbeam. I only use the Whole Wheat Bread making menu but it doesn't work. As well as adding an unneeded pre-heat time it doesn't allow a long enough time for the second rise to complete. I proved all of this by using the dough making menu which allows 15 minutes more second rise time and no preheat. The shape of the paddle does allow for good dough mixing but this is helped by using a spatula to move the dough marooned outside of the reach of the paddle.
