review/summary: 4 years of moderate to heavy use and still working well.review/text: I purchased this back in 2008 for culinary school. I now teach foods and nutrition classes and use this on a weekly basis sometimes daily basis and aside from the face melting a tiny bit when one of my kids dropped it in a frying pan of boiling oil, it still works great. Accurate and easy to use. Replaced batteries one time in four years.Great for getting formula temp on baby food, checking inside of poultry, sugar temp, chocolate temp, etc. Easy to clean and easy to use.
