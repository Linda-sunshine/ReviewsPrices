review/summary: You have to tighten it or it will leak!review/text: Original review from Nov. 29, 2012 1 Star rating:My brother has this same Kitchenaid blender and he highly recommended it to me. I read the reviews and a lot of them said it leaked but I decided to take a chance. After the third use it started leaking where the blade assembly is. I noticed the whole blade was very loose. I tightened the two plastic hex nuts near the blade with two wrenches. It worked great for a few more times and then the blade loosened up again. I don't want to have to tighten this thing up every couple of days. I don't mind the leak but I don't like the loose blade wobbling around. It seems to do better if I'm not blending anything frozen. I would never in a million years blend ice. I would be afraid the whole blade would come off. In my opinion this should be recalled. Save yourself the pain and don't buy this product.Feb. 14, 2013 After having it leak on me all the time I decided to really tighten it good. I cranked on it and haven't had any problems since. So I changed my rating to 3 stars. It's a good blender just too much hassle.
