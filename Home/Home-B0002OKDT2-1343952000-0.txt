review/summary: LOVE.review/text: WHOA! I was skeptical about buying a new juicer. There are SOOOOO many different kinds and brands and BLEH. I researched for MONTHS. There were a few things that lead me to this little beauty...1. Customer service from the negative reviews seemed that Omega actually helps their buyers. Not one review I read for breville said they even replaced one part upon breaking during or before the first use.2. Lots of fitness leaders have recommended this exact model and put their life on it.3. It does not damage the nutrients with oxidation or heat.4. You can make pasta, frozen yogurt, nut butters with it.5. I mostly wanted one for leafy greens. DONE. :)This works SO awesome. I cut up a whole variety of fruits and vegis. Put them in randomly. The pulp is dry. The juice flavor is AWESOME. It comes out with so much more flavor than any of my previous juicers. (Be careful with Ginger root.) I would suggest using HALF of what youre used to with the ginger.Very easy clean up.**Who ever said you can not juice wheat grass in this machine... Is the kind of person causing us have stickers on ovens and curling irons that says "Caution: Do NOT touch. This is HOT." Using the little brain God gave us, we CAN juice all leafy greens in this Omega. Quite beautifully. :)
