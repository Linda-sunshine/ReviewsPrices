review/summary: Non Stick my foot!review/text: First this product was just thrown in the box. When it arrived, the handle was sticking out the side of the box!Second, They had glued several labels to the Cooking surface. We had a terible time prying them loose.Third, EVERYTHING sticks to the surface.I grew up with cast iron. I have other cast iron pans. They all work perfect.I can not figure out what they did to the surface that causes this.I have even tried to scrub the surace and then re-season the iron.No luck.How did they mess up a cast iron pan??
