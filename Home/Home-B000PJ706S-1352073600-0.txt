review/summary: Bad Engineering.review/text: At the time I really liked the style of this Kettle,but within a week I saw a leak through the seal which looks to be silicone,why on earth they would use a compound like this in a heated enviroment is beyond me.I took the kettle back and got a replacement now after putting up with the smell from the silicone the centre heating element is rusting,which is supposed to be Stainless! and the lid hinge broke, absolutely pathetic. critical areas are poorly designed overall the concept is great, but falls down by being cheaply made. gotta make those bucks.
