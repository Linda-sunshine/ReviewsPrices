review/summary: 12 Inch Skillet - AWESOMEreview/text: I really like this skillet and it was a breeze to clean and re-season following the instructions found all over youtube.com. I used a coating of Crisco shortening and baked the pans for 2 hours at 350 degrees...worked like a charm!I was skeptical it was really going to be non-stick but it is! I bought the 7-qt Dutch Oven too - its' lid is interchangeable with the 12" skillet.Get them both! Very solid, high quality construction. Probably be buying more cast iron soon.
