review/summary: painless sleepingreview/text: since I never slept on a cloud I can't say this was like that. However it was what you would imagine a cloud would feel like, soft!I have arthritis in my hips and back, this topper allows me to wake up without the surface pain that occurs on regular mattresses and the joint pain is much less. This allows me to get much better sleep than before.I hate getting out of bed in the morning.
