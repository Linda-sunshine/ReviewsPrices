review/summary: Great Humidifier and Terrific Supportreview/text: This humidifier works great. It's very quiet on the low setting and empty's both tanks in about 24 hrs when set on low. It was easy to set up, as well as easy to fill. I made the mistake of dropping a tank while filling and it cracked. The warranty center replaced the tank quickly at a reasonable cost. They were easy to get hold of, their number is actually published in the manual. They were also very courteous and helpful on the phone. I would definitely recommend this model!
