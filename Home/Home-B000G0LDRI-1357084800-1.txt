review/summary: i think i need a 2nd humidifier on the 1st floor.review/text: when we 1st got this, it seemed to help a lot.we ran it at 3/4 fan power for the 1st week, and at the 100% humidity output level.our indoor, 1st floor humidity percentage went up into the 40s and stayed that way for a couple weeks at least.(we measure the humidity levels with a weather station, we keep the measuring device in the same room [the parlor] as we have this humidifier running. the room is not large, maybe 15x15, though it does have 2 large doorways coming from the foyer & going into the dining room, which are also rather small rooms. our 1st floor is not large, our house is about 75 years old & the 1st floor is all hardwood floors & about half the walls are plaster, half have had drywall added. the house is drafty.however, i am writing this about 6 weeks after receiving and beginning to use this humidifier & our humidity level has dropped steadily over the past week or two to 20%, where is is right now. i have began running the humidifier at higher levels constantly again. the outside weather (humidity, dew point, temperature & sun vs clouds) does not seem to matter at all into the equation, which we suspected initially due to the age of the home & draftiness. we even had several rain & snow storms for many days total & our indoor humidity has continued to decline, which makes zero sense.the machine is working. the tanks are filled daily & the water is going where it is supposed to be.however, this machine, given its size, price & overall ratings, did not make my sinuses or skin feel better for long, and for that reason, i give it the 'it's okay' rating. it COULD be the age of my home, but i'm not convinced of that.
