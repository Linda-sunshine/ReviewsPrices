review/summary: Good can opener.review/text: A good can opener at a good price. I have not been satisfied with other openers costing much more.The opener looks to be well made and should hold up over time.Buy it in an ugly color like I did and save a few bucks.This is my first experience with a Zyliss product and I will certainly keep the brand in mind the next time I shop for kitchen gadgets.
