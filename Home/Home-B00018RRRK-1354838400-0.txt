review/summary: Loudreview/text: This mill does a good job grinding your coffee beans, and it's semi-airtight, so your beans will stay fresher before they're ground. You set the grind amount from 4 to 12 cups, select the grind size, and press the start button. The mill will automatically stop when the selected amount of beans have been ground. This thing is pretty loud, though. I have to make sure all the doors are closed between the kitchen and the bedrooms, or it'll wake up the wife and kids.
