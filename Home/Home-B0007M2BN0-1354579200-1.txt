review/summary: I love it! Perfect and shell almost falls off by itself with a couple cracks.review/text: The eggs are perfectly cooked, I cook 4 at a time to get 12 to make deviled eggs. The shell practically falls off. Got it as a birthday gift and buying it for my daughter and daughter-in-law as stocking stuffers.
