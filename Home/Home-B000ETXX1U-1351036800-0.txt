review/summary: Not happy with this company at all.....review/text: I purchased this "air Bed" in May '12, set up was a breeze. The bed was comfortable, after the first night I did have to add some air which is normal, the bed only required air one time after that, about two months later. Then things started to go wrong with the bed, inside the "mattress" there are inner & outer air chambers, there are also chambers inside the inner chamber separating the top from the bottom of the bed. About 3/4 of the way down the bed (what I call the foot) one of the chambers separated inside the bed causing a huge bulge (it was/is 10-12" high) in the mattress that I couldn't sleep on it any longer. First I tryed contacting the manufacture by phone, after explaining what was wrong with the bed, I gave them my information & was told I would need to make a claim & how to do this, after three weeks I still had not received the email they said would be sent, so I emailed them & received a reply the next day, in the email they said I need to take a photo of the mattress & fill out the claim form that was attached to the email, I was unable to open the pdx file (it was damaged or not correctly attached to the email), I contacted the company again about the pdx file problem & received a reply that the person who was handling my problem was no longer employed by them & there was nothing they could do, I just assumed I need to start the replacement process over, after 3 phone call's & 5-6 email's they just said the person does not work there anymore & they can not help me! The bed wasn't cheap, it was never abused & it never leaked air, but I will never buy anything made by this company again & I will be sure to pass along my experence with this product.
