review/summary: Disappointed in toaster functionreview/text: We use this primarily for toasting, and the toaster tray does not extend deep enough into the unit. Top of the bread does not get toasted. Looking thru the window it appears the tray physically could drop down another inch or so, but the mechanism won't allow. Also, there is no cancel function. If you need to stop the toasting process you have to force the toaster handle up.
