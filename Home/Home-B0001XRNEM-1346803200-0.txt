review/summary: Solid tamperreview/text: This tamper feels very solid in the hands and has a good heft to it. It is comfortable to tamp down my espresso and creates a nice flat tamp. Unfortunately I need a slightly larger tamper so this is the best size I could find to fit my needs. But if you need a 50 or 60 mm tamper, this is a perfect buy.
