review/summary: Perfect!review/text: My apartment does not have the greatest light setting. We have a projector that we watch tv on and play video games with so the lights are very dim wattage. Because of this set up my fianc&eacute; decided to do, it's hard to put my makeup on properly without making it look a little cakey. This mirror lights up beautifully! I am able to tweeze without missing a hair thanks to the magnification and my makeup has never looked more flawless in any light setting in a room. When you have the right tools, all you need is the right light to get the perfect look and this helped me achieve that! Would recommend to anyone looking for a good inexpensive mirror!-jill
