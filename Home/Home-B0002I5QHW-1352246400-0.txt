review/summary: A-grinding we will go...review/text: Is there anyone out there who doesn't dream about grinding their own meat? You vegetarians can put down your hands, because you are probably looking at some veggie wash anyway. The rest of you need to take a serious look at this baby.It's not big. In fact, the only downside is that it's on the small side. And it doesn't plug in. You use elbow grease to get it to work. You old school-types will remember pencil sharpeners used to work like this. Use the suction cup to secure it to the counter, fill it up with the meat of your choice and before long the meat starts flowing in your choice of two sizes.Apparently you can make pasta too. That's next on the list!
