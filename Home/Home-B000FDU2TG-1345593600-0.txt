review/summary: Great Blender, Great Customer Servicereview/text: We purchased this blender from amazon in June of 2009. It's seen almost daily use since then (we make smoothies every morning). In the past I noticed a very small amount of leakage, more of a ring of scum than drips in the bottom part of the jar where the assembly is. Lately, there has been more leaking, and this morning it went haywire. The plastic part of the assembly under the jar got mangled, and the blade is now loose and the whole thing is leaking like crazy. I was pretty disappointed because I've loved this blender. It's a little workhorse, and gets the job done with very little hassle. It's also very easy to clean. We called Kitchenaid customer service, and even though our blender is well outside the warranty, they are sending us a new jar as a customer courtesy (I didn't even ask for this, they offered before finding out what I wanted them to do about it). They were very polite, and I was impressed with the handling of the situation. I am glad we don't have to get a new blender, and can keep on using this one!
