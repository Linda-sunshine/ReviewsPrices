review/summary: Nice Inexpensive Coffee Grinderreview/text: This is a great product for grinding a small amount of coffee beans quickly, easily, and inexpensively. All you have to do is add beans, cover, and press the button until the coffee is fine enough for your taste. The longer you press, the finer the coffee gets. I generally brew only 1 or 2 cups of coffee at a time and this works perfectly. I have used it to grind up to 6 cups at a time, but to grind enough a full 12-cup coffee-maker I find it better to do it in 2 passes. It does a nice grind for regular drip coffee. I still use it for my espresso maker even though I can't get it as fine as I would like it. I recommend only using it for coffee beans because it is not the easiest to clean; I find a little coffee grinds get stuck in the machine no matter how diligent I try to clean it. The canister where you place the beans is not removable so you must wash it by hand. I have used this machine for several years so it is very durable.
