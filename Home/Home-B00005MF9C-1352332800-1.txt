review/summary: Be very careful not to overfill with groundsreview/text: Perfect for the office environment, but be very cautious about using too many grounds. Thankfully the coffee pot has a built in overflow prevention system, but washing the grounds out of the unit is not an easy task. Brushed steel mug that comes with it is nice, overall its worth the $17.
