review/summary: put in our trailer, i love itreview/text: I put this in our trailer because the pad was hard as a rock. I never slept when we took it out. With this, i sleep like a baby. Wish it was a little thicker, and found a thicker one at costco for less money, but i still love it! My husband on the other hand claims he can't tell the difference. I think that's crazy :-)
