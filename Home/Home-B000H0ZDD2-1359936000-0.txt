review/summary: Hard working little guyreview/text: I got this dehumidifier because my bathroom does not have an exhaust fan, and the constant damp was leading to mold growth. This little guy fits on a small shelf, and it really works hard. The catch basin fills up with water so you can see how much it helps. It is not very loud either. I'm very happy with my purchase.
