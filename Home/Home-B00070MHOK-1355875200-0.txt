review/summary: Highly Recommendreview/text: Great product. Upon arrival I was surprised at how small the water tank was but it can easily steam 4/5 items in one load. Three speedy refills allowed me to steam every creased shirt in my wardrobe. It has swiftly become the most useful electrical I own....and I love my toaster!Compact, effective, arrived in lightening speed! Only spits when held incorrectly and even then it doesn't damage the garment (I was steaming delicates such as silk, as well as cotton).
