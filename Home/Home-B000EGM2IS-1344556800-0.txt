review/summary: Still love the Hot Shotreview/text: We've used Hot Shots for almost 30 years, and I still prefer them to the microwave. For some odd reason, my tea doesn't taste the same with microwave heated water. Our old model started leaking after our cats hit the "heat" button when it was empty. On to the comparisons:* The new model is bigger, with a larger, more oval footprint.* I much prefer the heat button in the back instead of the front. Much less likely for humans or felines to accidentally hit it.* Also liked the option of getting it in black, although making the "dispense" button in gray solves the grungy button problem.* This model seems to heat the water a bit hotter than previous models, and the water holds the heat for a longer period of time. Might be better insulated.* As noted, tall cups/mugs won't fit underneath. We dispense into a beaker and pour it into our cups, so that works for us.* So far we have had no problems with leakage; the water flow is a bit slow when dispensing, but shuts off completely as soon as we release the button. This is the typical failure mode with our Hot Shots, however, that the gasket fails and water leaks, sometimes after we've mistakenly heated it dry, sometimes for no particular reason. I'm not surprised some units have this problem right away.We're very pleased with the new model, although we kind of wish we'd bought the white. We were hoping the black would stay nicer looking longer, and it very likely will. But the gray "dispense" button (even on the white model) cleans up a major area for grunge, plus the unit's larger size makes the black a bit more imposing than we'd thought. A minor niggle for something we use multiple times a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.
