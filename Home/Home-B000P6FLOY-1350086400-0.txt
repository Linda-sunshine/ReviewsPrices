review/summary: Never overcook your meat againreview/text: I have one of these and bought more to give as gifts. Every since I have been using this thermometer, my meats are cooked perfectly. I set the proper internal temperature. Place it in the middle of the meat. The cord actually is long enough and runs out of the oven and it have the unit to read on the kitchen counter. When the meat is done to temperature a little alarm goes off (it is quiet - so you needs to be vigilant)...it has helped my cooking tremendously. No more guessing.
