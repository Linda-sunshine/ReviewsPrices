review/summary: Lovereview/text: My husband and I have been eating mostly raw and wanted to be able to make zucchini noodles. This machine works great! I didn't even have to read the instructions, I just added a zucchini, turned the handle and out came perfect noodles. We are able to make so many more raw dishes now and in a fraction of the time of cutting noodles by hand (believe me we tried and it takes a very long time). So worth the money we spent and clean up is a snap!
