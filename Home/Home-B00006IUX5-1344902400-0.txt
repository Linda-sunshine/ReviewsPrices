review/summary: Get the Krupsreview/text: I recently bought one of these for a vacation home and own the similarly-priced Krups grinder at my permanent home. I would strongly recommend the Krups over this Proctor Silex grinder. Krups has significantly more capacity, is just as compact, and can grind more finely and uniformly.
