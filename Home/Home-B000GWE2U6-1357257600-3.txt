review/summary: Bad designreview/text: This is a good humidifier. It works well and the quality of the plastic is excellent. It's easy to clean and disinfect. The primary issue is that the vapor comes out the top of the owl's head and spills down directly on whatever the humidifier is set on top of. This soaked the night stand that I had the owl on. What I ended up doing was drilling out the eyes of the owl and covering the original vents with electrical tape. Now it's a perfect product. I'd never seen a humidifier that sent vapor straight up. Very poorly thought out.
