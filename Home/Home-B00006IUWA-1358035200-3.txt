review/summary: Presto Hot Air Popperreview/text: I have always been a fan of the hot air poppers. They make a healthier, tasty popcorn, and you can put on more butter because you don't have to use oil to pop it. I make up my own garlic butter with a splash of healthy olive oil, then top with a light sprinkle of parmesan cheese. Very tasty. Thyis model is great. It doesn't take up a lot of room so is easy to store and use. It pops fast and efficiently. Used our other one for years and finally had to replace it. Love Presto poppers. Excellent brand.
