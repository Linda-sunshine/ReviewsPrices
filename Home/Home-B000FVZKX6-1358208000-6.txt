review/summary: Just Lovely.review/text: Warm, soft, low pill, everything you want in cozy flannel sheets for a cold winter's night. We own many sets of bed sheets but we always end up washing and drying these right away so we can use them again for the night! Happy owners of these for the past 2 winters!
