review/summary: The Juice is Loose!review/text: As a vegan I eat a lot of vegetables. Sometimes the bulk is too much. I'd been watching several documentaries about juicing so I gave them a look. This was a best seller and with good reason! This thing eats the veggies and puts out some serious juice! The health benefits are through the roof and for the price, this thing can't be beat. I've been using it for 2 weeks everyday and LOVE it.
