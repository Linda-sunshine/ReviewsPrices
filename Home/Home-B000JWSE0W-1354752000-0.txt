review/summary: Everyone should have such sheets!review/text: This is my third purchase of the Renaissance 600-Thread Count Cotton Sateen sheets. The most luxurious sheets I have ever encountered was when vacationing in a 5 star hotel in Germany. I looked all over for those sheets only to be told that they sold for over $300.00 a set. Comparable sheet sets for a King sized bed have ran between $100-$150.00.I have never found the quality of these sheets matched elsewhere, even in costly 800 thread and 1200 thread count sheets. I am a return customer x 4. I think everyone should have sheets like these and feel like you are sleeping in a 5 start hotel every night. Great product, great service, great shipping and great company!SusanStafford, VA
