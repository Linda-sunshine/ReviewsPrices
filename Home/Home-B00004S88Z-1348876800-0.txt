review/summary: can't live without youreview/text: we love our new toy! have already canned pickled beets, cocktail onions, caponata androma tomatoes. my only regret is that we didn't purchase the all america sooner but we willno doubt enjoy many years of pressure canning. extremely easy to use and a well built cooker/canner. we are thoroughly pleased with our purchase.
