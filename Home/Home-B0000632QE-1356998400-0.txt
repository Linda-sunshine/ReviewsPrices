review/summary: Perfectreview/text: This is wonderful for what I needed it for and I have not had any problems with it. I agree with some of the other comments that it is not the best for using up all of your item because the holder doesn't push the veggie or whatever far enough down and the blades are WAY too sharp to use your hands, but otherwise I would buy this item again in a heart beat.
