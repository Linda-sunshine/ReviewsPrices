review/summary: Nice Vacuumreview/text: I have to say that this is nice little vacuum. I had it for about two years, and used it quite heavily. Works great on stairs and is especially great for vacuuming the car. Has a nice long cord so you dont have to unplug constantly. My one complaint is that the flexible tube broke and i had to tape it up. Definitely worth the 40 bucks
