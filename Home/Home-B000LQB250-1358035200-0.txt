review/summary: great topper for the price! my bed has never been comfier!review/text: I am in LOVE with this mattress topper! I have a full size bed, and ordered the full size mattress topper and it hangs over the edges a bit, but that doesn't really bother me. I get hot very easily when I sleep, and I stay cool with this topper! It also fluffs right back up after I get out of bed stays dense.It's very comfortable and has improved my sleeping! When I first took it out of it's packaging I let it sit flat for about 24 hours (like the directions said), and it had a very minty smell. The smell wasn't bad, but very strong. It's been a few weeks and the smell is still there, but it seems to be slowly dissipating (or maybe I'm just getting more used to it?)Overall, this is a wonderful topper for the price! You won't regret it!
