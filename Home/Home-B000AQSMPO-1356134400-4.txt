review/summary: Makes great coffee, machine doesn't lastreview/text: I admit, this machine makes great coffee. When we have guests, they can all have what they want, strong, mild, decaf, cocoa, whatever (makes horrible tea, BTW). Lots of cup selections in the supermarkets now. The cups are expensive, but we knew that.The problem is with the quality of the machine's engineering and construction. Our first one lasted about a year and a half, which isn't long for something that costs $150.00. The pump started straining and then the electronic display gave out. We liked it so much we bought a replacement, just in case they have improved the quality or if we originally got a bad one, but I won't be buying a third one if this one doesn't last longer.In the newer "Special Edition" hey did address a problem with ease of use of the water reservoir. The container now protrudes forward making it easier to remove the container. Still an awkward process, though; I just fill mine with a pitcher.
