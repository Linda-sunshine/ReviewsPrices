review/summary: Better than Keurigreview/text: This is the best coffee maker that I have used/owned. If you are looking for a real coffee maker (not keurig), than this is one of your best options. Definitely the best option at this price point.All stainless steel construction, except for the base and the handle, but these parts are not connected to the brewing system or carafe.The coffee does not burn when left on for hours at a time, like with a glass carafe on a burner.Easy to clean.It's a bit more work to load it than other coffee makers, but its worth it.
