review/summary: Great Bedreview/text: This bed worked really well for a guest with replaced knees. He needed a higher bed than a flat mattress. He could get on and off with ease. The only concern now is that if two people tried to sleep on the bed, it appears they would both fall toward the center of the mattress. It is not flat. The sides are higher than the middle. I am not sure how comfortable two guests would be on this mattress. This is why I gave it only 4 stars - because of the sag.
