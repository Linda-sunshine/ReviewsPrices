review/summary: Disappointment.review/text: I was excited when I got this item but it quickly turned to disappointment with the lack of quality of the product. The case is cheaply made. The "Sounds" are hard to distinguish without reading what they are. At least three of the sounds seem "exactly" a like (rain, waterfall, and white noise), the heart beat doesn't even sound close to a Doppler let alone a "heartbeat". The Songbird sounds do not blend in, instead it sounds like an old 45 record skipping in the same spot--no seamless sounds and it's quite irritating. The Tropical Birds is pretty good. I had just hoped for "smooth, soothing, sounds" but instead it was like listening to a skipping record.The quality of the speakers are VERY shabby. If you turn it up loud enough to block out other sounds, you hear a lot of "distortion" noises like when speakers are going bad. The other problem I have is that of the light on the clock. It's a pretty blue which I like, but there are two settings: Bright and even brighter, so if you can't sleep in a brightly lit room, don't bother getting this! Even on the dimmest of the two settings, the room is lit up like a Christmas tree. Even worse when it is on dimmer setting it's hard to read the time with the back light and it's kind of a blur.I do like the duel alarms, the radio tunes in well and it had battery back up.I DID know what to expect from a "Sound therapy" style sound machine as I have had 2 other Sound machines in the past and the sounds had smooth-seamless transitions. But, not this one, it was really just amateurly done."I would not recommend this product.
