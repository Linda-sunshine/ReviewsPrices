review/summary: Stop struggling getting a cork outreview/text: I've tried a dozen different cork removers but this one is flat out easy. Sit it on the bottle and push the switch. Hold the bottle tightly and in no time the cork is out. Reverse the switch and the cork comes off. Used it for a year and it just keeps ticking.
