review/summary: Great Potreview/text: :-). Wonderful! Quiet, fast, good looking, perfect condition, timely arrival. Purrfect.This replaced the kettle shipment from "Electronics Warehouse" (also on amazon), which was a piece of crap. Loose cord, repackaged box was taped & banged up. My bad review got lost in dozens of 5 star reviews they give themselves w/every complaint. Fake "customers" write endlessly about the good shipping boxes & great cords! Ha, what consumer writes a review that mentions the box condition unless its damaged?Couldnt review 2x so I just did it here. :-D
