review/summary: Weird "original" positionreview/text: While I'm not a chair expert, I think that I did find a few things a little odd about this chair.After putting the whole chair together, following the instructions, the "resting" position, meaning the position where nothing has been adjusted yet, is weird. The back of the chair slants like about 30 degrees to the FRONT?!?!? Is this weird or what? I would think that the resting position of the back should be like just straight.Please let me know, other users, if I just installed it wrong or are all your chairs similar too?Other than that, I've noticed that while it is not the most attractive chair, it is made quite solidly. The seat is heavy, the stand is heavy and the back is also kinda heavy. Don't expect it to wear on me very quickly.I like the 3 heights, and the arm rests positions, though they are a little floppy, but works for me.And like I mentioned earlier, I have to sit in the chair, lean back with my body weight so that the back is in the place that I want it, and then lock it in at that position.Other than the weird quirk, (which by the way, I have no idea if it's a quirk or not) it's a pretty solid chair. I wish you could move the seat forwards and backwards, but you can't, you only can tilt it.Hope my review helps you folks in deciding on this chair.K
