review/summary: Perfect little coffee potreview/text: I'm not a coffee connoisseur, so all I needed was a little coffee pot to brew a couple of cups of Starbucks coffee at a time for myself and my husband and our occasional coffee-drinking guests. This pot is perfect for our needs. It is very reasonably priced, has a delay/timer so your coffee can be ready for you when you wake up in the morning, and it's small enough to either sit on your counter and not take up a lot of space or stick in a cabinet.
