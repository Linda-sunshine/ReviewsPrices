review/summary: Like coffee grounds in your coffee?review/text: I've used a lot of different french presses over the years. This Thermos model has a fatal flaw: A channel on the inside that's wider than the screen. So if you fill it up to maximize your coffee volume, then the grounds fill the channel and bypass the screen when you plunge. Voila! Crunchy coffee. To avoid this issue you have to under fill, and stir carefully so as not to get coffee grounds in the channel. And be careful how you put the grounds into this puppy as well. If it's wet they'll stick to the channel. There are just so many ways to mess up your coffee with this thing.Bottom line is this thing is a real pain to use. I'd suggest you get something else. RECOMMENDATION: The Boden stainless insulated french press is the GOLD standard in my mind. It's spendy but man, it is just about perfect.
