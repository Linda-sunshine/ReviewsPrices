review/summary: MMMMM Pizza tonight!review/text: This pizza oven is a joy. It cooks the pizza perfectly everytime. You, of course, have to keep an eye on how the bottom and top are cooking, just like any oven. We have used this oven to warm up leftovers, cook our own handmade pizzas and alot of Mexican fares cook well on this, as well. The picture of this product also shows other foods being cooked. It's great because you don't have to heat up the oven and you keep electricity costs down. If the pan becomes to scratched up or to burnt to use, replaceable pans are available. I swear by this little Pizzazz Pizza Oven. One of the best kitchen appliances I have! :)
