review/summary: Every kitchen needs onereview/text: I love having one of these. This is actually my second one because I broke my first one. It's so small that it will fit in kitchens that don't have space for bigger food processors or you just don't want to pull out the big one. I use it to chop onions, mushrooms, carrots, garlic. And i use it when I'm mixing things together for a dish. For example, I'll add together broth, oil, garlic and other spices and then pour it into my dish like a soup or a chicken marcella or something. It's the best processor of this size. The others are too cheap to work right. This is NOT a paid review! I'm trying to remember to say that in my reviews since I've believed some reviews that in my opinion weren't true.
