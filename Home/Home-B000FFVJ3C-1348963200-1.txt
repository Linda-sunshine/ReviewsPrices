review/summary: My first dehydrator ! Ilove it!!review/text: I wanted to dehydrate some peaches in season locally and didn't really know what to look for in a dehydrater so I poked around the internet and realized that I needed to find one that dryer relatively fast and was quiet. I came across thus one. Read the reviews of other people, got it for a good price and ordered it. So far we have done peaches and apples and both have turned out great. Looking forward to trying beef jerky as this one came with instructions and spices for jerky.I highly recommend this dryer for anyone but I know it works especially well for a beginner and home user like me.
