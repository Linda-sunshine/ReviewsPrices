review/summary: More than what I wantedreview/text: Wanted something for which to cook my little pizzas in the convenience of my room, got a cooker that cooks grilled sandwiches, chicken, chimichangas, *and* pizza. All as well as the oven, but without the hulking size and you don't wait for preheating, what's to complain about?
