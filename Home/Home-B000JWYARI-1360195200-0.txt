review/summary: Great Qualityreview/text: I've been using these sheets for about a month now, and they still feel like great quality even after a few washes. The sheets are nice and thick, and it gives them a bit of a 'crispness' which I really like. If you're looking for sheets that are really soft against your skin, these probably aren't the ones for you, but they feel like a good quality sheet. I expect them to last a long time.
