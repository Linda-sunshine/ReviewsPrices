review/summary: Amazing!review/text: When my cheapo drip coffee maker broke I was determined to find a deal on a Keurig. I had a percolating basket laying around and used it for a few days. It was possibly the best coffee I ever made from home. I found the reviews on the Farberware Yosemite and after using it for a while this is now my permanent solution.I drink coffee for the caffine 1st, flavor 2nd and I won't go out of my way to purchase "premium coffee". If I'm at Aldi, and need coffee I get Aldi coffee (which is pretty nasty stuff)! This percolator makes the cheap, gross coffee taste good!
