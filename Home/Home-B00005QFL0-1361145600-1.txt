review/summary: Does the jobreview/text: Works just like it is supposed to. I only use the BASIC bread setting for all breads. Helps to aid the initial mixing cycle with a rubber spatula if the dough is dry-ish (but be sure to do it in the same direction of the mixing paddle !) . Light crust setting is fine. Medium & dark settings pretty toasty but good for certain recipes. Like that all during the cooking process you can lift the lid and do anything you want with the bread dough, just don't lift right when the yeast dispenser on the lid is going to open.Bread-finished timer beeps aren't very loud so pay attention. Best to lift bread out right when done and get it out of the non-stick pan....very hot so don't touch with bare fingers ! Never use abrasive scrubber on non-stick pan, but it wipes clean easily anyway.
