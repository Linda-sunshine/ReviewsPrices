review/summary: GREAT WEATHER RADIOreview/text: This is a great weather radio, but it doesn't receive am broadcast well. Also, nearby fm station can be heard on several places on the band. My main reason for buying it was to receive SAME weather bulletins and it does that well. It does do am and fm good enough to make it a good clock radio.
