review/summary: Worked great for 2 years....Now I need to BABY SIT the pressure cooker...review/text: I really wanted to love this pressure cooker....I bought this unit from Amazon in Jan 2010 so we could make meals faster. It was wonderful for the first 2 years. We cooked rice, made soups, and stewed meant. The results were pretty good. However, it is a different story now. Somehow now I have to tap on the release valve to get it seal for multiple times when cooking a dish. At times it could not hold pressure and I would need to reset the menu. So I would have to "baby-sit" my pressure cooker. Trust me I do know how to place the release valve in the right position after all I did it right for the first 2 years.I think I need to call Cuisinart and hopefully the process would not be too painful...
