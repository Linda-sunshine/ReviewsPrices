review/summary: Best pan next to cast ironreview/text: It is non stick, large, and you can cook anything in it. However, do not expect to brown a roast or other meat in it. Cast iron is better for frying. That being said, it is the first pan I reach for for everyday cooking. It cleans with a little soap, water, and a sponge. NEVER put anything metal near it or in it.
