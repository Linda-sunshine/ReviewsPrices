review/summary: Nice pitcher.review/text: These are advertised as being very high quality glass. The glass work does look good to me and this pitcher is completely sealable. The top has a center part that can be turned clockwise to expand a rubber seal inside the top.I use a distiller to make my own distilled drinking water and I keep this pitcher on the counter with distilled drinking water in it. You shouldn't drink ice cold water out of a refrigerator, so I keep mine on the counter in this sealable pitcher.
