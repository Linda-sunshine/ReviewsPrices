review/summary: I am not blown away by it!review/text: Really disappointed in this as an upgrade from the limited edition below it. It is real close to the largest amount of coffee that will be dispensed from the other one and it makes no sense to have a choice of 5 different sizes of coffee to be honest. Also the hottest the coffee can get is 192 and that really isn't a big plus in the end. After spending money for this, I have went back to using the one I had before (limited edition). There is not real significant diff. Also, the filter doesn't make a diff to me or I do not notice any difference. I wish that I did not purchase the B70. Sam's sells it for same price online, as I seen after the fact.
