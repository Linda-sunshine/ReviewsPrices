review/summary: No Surprisesreview/text: The best part of this experience was there were no surprises. The popper works well with a few shortcomings that I expected. Typically ejects a few popped and unpopped kernels during the popping process even thought I angle it at certain times to reduce the quantity. Don't mind having to unplug it since I have to to put it away.The very best part of it is there is essentially no cleanup. That I really like and why I use it more than my stovetop popper which makes better popcorn.
