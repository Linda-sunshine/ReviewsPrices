review/summary: Get a Swiss Army Knife instead!review/text: This can opener is 100% junk. My Swiss Army Knife can opener does a better and faster job. It is very difficult to align a can correctly in order to get this contraption to open a can. You find the right location by trial and error as there are no intelligible guides to help with alignment. I've opened about a dozen cans with this thing and each one was a struggle that ended with a barrage of bad language. Now the cutting blade is jammed against the toothed gear wheel and the opener is broken. The only positive thing I can say about it is that it looks good, but beware, the beauty is only skin deep. Next stop, Walmart for something that can open cans without a struggle.
