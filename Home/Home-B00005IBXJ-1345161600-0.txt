review/summary: So much awesome!review/text: Ill start with the obvious consIt's a super slippery pan rotating on a needle head so if you even touch it to check the done-ness of your pizza the whole thing crashes and burns and your pizza's on the floor now.You cant use it as a warming tray as we all so want toYou cant slowly cook things as there is no heat settingAnd you HAVE to put equal weight on each side of the pan or else it will be all wibbely wobbly and cook uneven(if you have a pizza 1/2 inch off center it will cook uneven)ProsEr.mah.gawd.It's so awesome o.oIt some how makes things taste better..The crispyness of the pizza is god-likeit's always perfect no mater what you're cookingThe hydrophobic nonstick surface is so frigging easy to clean just rinse it off.To make lunch just smack a piece of bread on there, throw some cheese on it and a piece of lunch meat if you so desire. turn the bugger on and get you some noms.Makes life easy and doesnt heat up the house its fantastic
