review/summary: Fast and easy cup of coffeereview/text: When I read "3-cup" I interpret that to be 3 8oz cups. That's plenty. Apparently in Italy 1 cup = 1 american shot glass. I have a 'regular' size coffee mug (here it is exactly: [...] and this Bialetti produces enough coffee to fill this mug exactly half way. The coffee does come out strong, which is how I like it, but it's strong enough that you could 'americano' it and add water to get a "true" full cup. Or it makes it strong enough you could use it to make ice coffee and not worry about dilution.Pros:Makes excellent coffee quick. Throw it on a burner and 2-3 minutes later you're drinking boiling hot coffeeCan be used off grid (camping, zombie apocalypse compatible)VERY easy to clean - no paper filters, total of 3 partsCons:3 cups actually equals .5 cupsI'm going to order the 6-cup or larger model. Suggest you do the same.Update: This will produce 2 good cups of coffee by pouring half the coffee from Bialetti and then adding about 3/4 boiling water. Doesn't taste watered down at all
