review/summary: New found love for cookingreview/text: After some long research on cookware & the best type that works with my cooktop I found several rave reviews on the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro stainless steel set. Everyone who tested them said they worked just as good as the high-end multiclad pro but for a fraction of the cost. I didn't really expect there to be a huge difference at first but within a week found that there is a HUGE difference compared to my old pots & pans. I cooked rice the very first night & it came out so perfect. I have never cooked rice that came out so perfect before, not too dry & not to wet. It didn't even burn onto the bottom of the pan, I was completely shocked at that. The lids fit perfectly so there is no escaping steam which is good if your whole purpose is to "steam" your food. The handles are cool to the touch. with my old cookware i would have to cook everything on medium high in order for my pan/pot to get up to temperature & then keep it there to regulate it. Now I turn it to medium or sometimes medium-low & my food cooks just as fast. I fell in love with them instantly & have been cooking every night since then (except for grocery night). They are easy to clean as well of which I was afraid that there would be loads of scrubbing but there is not. Hopefully I will have this set for a very long time & I expect that I will. I will recommend this set to everyone I know that are looking for a new set of cookware.
