review/summary: hot and quickreview/text: My 12 cup West Bend perc which I like a lot does not brew a good 2 cup batch.I typically brew 3 pots during the day and my 5 cup drip pot just died. It was the 5th one in 16 months. Got to love the made in China stuff.This pot is fast and the coffee is very hot even with creamer. Making a 2 cup pot with 2 measuring spoons of coffee is just about right for my taste. Not to bold but not to weak. Two cups also fill my mug where it took 3 cups with the drip pots. The spout is designed so you can pore a cup without poring the coffee all over. However it is very high on the pot so you really have to tip the pot to get the last cup out. The West Bend spout design is far superior.The basket takes the standard size flat filters so I can share the filters between both pots.I took off 1 star because there it has no light to remind you the pot is plugged in and it does not have auto off. The picture on the box seemed to imply a light. This is not a problem with a 2 cup batch but my first pot of the day is a 4 cup brew thereby increasing the likelihood of forgetting to unplug it.I took off a second star for 2 reasons (1) the length of cord is to short, less than 27 inches tip to tip thereby restricting where the pot can be placed. Without much countertop space this can be a major inconvenience. To get around this I use my West Bend cord. I find a to short cord to be more of a hazard then one that is to long. (2) The fill marks are difficult to see, especially the 2 cup mark. There is no see through water level indicator. There is also a mark about one quarter inch above the 4 cup mark. Filling to this level will leave enough coffee in the pot to help keep grounds out of your cupThe big question is will it last for any length of time as yet another made in China coffee pot.
