review/summary: One Year Laterreview/text: I loved this kettle and did not have a problem with the chemical smell (as other reviews have commented). Perhaps I bought mine after they fixed that issue?It served me great for about six months so I bought a second oen for my father.SIx months later my kettle began to fall apart. A year later his did as well.Some of the issues:1. Metal heating element ball rusted2. Plastic cap over blue light fell off3. Chrome plastic cap over lid fell offUnits still work but no longer look pretty.At $60 I expected this to last longer than a year.I use it 3+ times a day.
