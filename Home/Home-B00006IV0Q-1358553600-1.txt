review/summary: Great Little Percolatorreview/text: My wife decided that she wanted a percolator because, she claimed, they made better coffee. I was dubious. I was going to order her the 12-cup version of this percolator because of the good reviews, but she wanted the smaller version. I like to make her happy so I ordered this 6-cup version. The first couple pots were weak. She tried one of the filters that came with the percolator for the next pot and it was fantastic. Only problem was, then, we couldn't find filters in any of our local stores and nobody had coffee ground for percolators. So, I ordered filters from Amazon.com for a reasonable price and we are set. I have never been much of a coffee drinker, usually only drinking no more than a cup a day, but now I nearly always have two cups. We have a coffee grinder but haven't ground any beans for this percolator yet. I highly recommend this coffee maker. I may have to buy the 12-cup version.
