review/summary: juicer reviewreview/text: This is a great juicer for those who don't want to take the time all of the time to chop up fruits and veggies and is easy to clean. I juice every single day and the juicer has lasted me 2 years. Longer than any other juicer that I've owned. I am so pleased with this juicer, this is my second one that I bought. I have a different juicer with a smaller motor and food shoot to extract more juice from things such as cilantro, parsley and wheat grass that this juicer just wont abstract. However this juicer still works great for bunches of leafy greens such as spinach and kale and so forth. hope this helps.
