review/summary: Very dissapointedreview/text: I bought this on the rave reviews here at Amazon. I really like the look and feel of the Thermos, and it kept my coffee warm for hours. However it has a tendency to leak when drinking from it, at the connection where the screw-on lid meets the mug. The result is a mess and possible coffee on your shirt.
