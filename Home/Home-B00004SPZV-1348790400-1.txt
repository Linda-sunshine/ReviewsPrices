review/summary: Love times 2!review/text: I love love this product. I have two of them! One for home and one for travel. You'd be amazed as to how little oil you really need to use. Gone are the days of pouring "1 to 2 teaspoons" to saute onions for a recipe. I just spray a little to get it slippery and off I go about 120 calories lighter! OH, and how about spraying your bread or crackers? I like Wasa Crispbread, Multi Grain, 9.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12). I spray the crackers and there's my snack. Want a little olive oil taste? I spray my completed morning omelete for some flavor.I went through four other olive oil sprayers that didn't last more than a few months each. Maybe the reason the other company gives you an 'extra' sprayer is because you'll need it in another two months!I have had my original Misto for over a year with no problems. The key is to follow the instructions for use and cleaning. Don't buy the cheaper plastic versions because you will have to buy two for every one of these!
