review/summary: Handy little kitchen gadgetreview/text: This is such a helpful kitchen gadget. I use the whisk to whip heavy cream which saves me the effort of pulling out my Kitchen Aid stand mixer just for this job. I use the regular hand blender to puree chunks in my spaghetti sauce while it's still cooking in the pot. I will have to see how the slicer attachment works with pie dough, though.
