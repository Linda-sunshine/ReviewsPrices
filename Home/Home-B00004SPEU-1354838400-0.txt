review/summary: Grinds Like a Champreview/text: This is a great little grinder. I like my coffee ground to fine powder, and this does the trick. 10 seconds in this thing, and I'm good to go in either my espresso machine or my drip coffee maker. I use the same grind for both. The fine grind allows me to use less coffee in the drip machine and still get really strong coffee.
