review/summary: HORRIBLE!review/text: Save your money. Not the same vacuum as in 2010. CHEAP imitation. Brush is horrible for low carpets. No bag full indicator. Only good thing is suction. Consumer reports rated this as a good buy. I call it a good bye... Mine is sitting in the trash as I type this. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS VACUUM TO ANYONE.
