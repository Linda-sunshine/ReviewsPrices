review/summary: So Pleased!review/text: I recently started making my own soy milk and wanted a container to store it in that would fit on the door of the fridge. This is perfect. I struggled with the lid a bit until I got the hang of it. I will buy more of these for juice, etc. Love the compact handle that doesn't get in the way.
