review/summary: Great for flax!review/text: I bought this grinder specifically for grinding flax seeds. It works wonders! I didn't want to buy a grinder that was too big because I only needed to grind up a tablespoon or 2 of flax, and I work a lot of seasonal/temporary jobs so I'm moving around constantly and didn't need to add to my collection of stuff. This really is a perfect size for small grinding. If you are making coffee for just 1 person in the morning, I imagine this would work well for that too. It has a retractable cord so that's just an added bonus. This probably isn't big enough for grinding more than 1 or 2 servings of coffee so keep that in mind. But it makes a nice addition to your kitchen if you need a grinder for flax, or small servings, or some other substance that you don't want mixing with your coffee grounds.
