review/summary: So far, great, and for the money, awesome.review/text: I grind for french press only, and at the coarse settings this gives me a uniform grind with very little if any dust. It's surprisingly quiet, which is very nice. And it looks nice. There is a small issue with static, and if there's any chaff in the roast (I stove-top roast my own, so there's some), this will pop up over the front of the machine when the hopper is opened - but only if the hopper is more than about half full. But this is easily blown off, and not much of a problem. For them money - barely more than the cost of a tedious hand grinder - this can't be beat!
