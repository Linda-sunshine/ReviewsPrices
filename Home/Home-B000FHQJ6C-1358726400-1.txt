review/summary: Yes, it makes juice but....review/text: ConsOne of the latches came apart when I was unpacking it but i was too lazy to return or exchange it (too much trouble). I also really hate the fact that its makes more foam than juice, making the juice a bit gross to drink if you don't remove the foam. Also the pulp isn't as dry as I'd like it to be, but it's not soaky wet (mostly).ProsYes, it makes juice. You might have to wait a little for the foam to set and then clear it off the top of the juice but the juicer does what it's supposed to do. It makes juice.
