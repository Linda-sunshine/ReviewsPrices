review/summary: Love it!review/text: I was an occasional coffee drinker, mostly mochas, looking for something rich I guess. Then I discovered the exceptional coffee served in European cafes on a recent trip and looked for a way to recreate it. I believe the fundamental difference is drip vs. espresso so I was looking for a good but inexpensive espresso machine. Read up a bit, read a few reviews of various machines, and eventually settled on this one.I'm not an experienced espresso maker, I hardly know what I'm doing, but I find this pretty easy to use and I'm able to make a coffee that is like what I got in Europe, so I'm happy.No complaints so far, but a word of note to others like me, it took me 4 or 5 tries to become comfortable with making espresso. It's not difficult to use but being new to me, I wasn't sure in the beginning of even the basic steps.Do be sure to read up on the other plentiful reviews of this product. One general thing to note is that this machine is small.And for guidance on using it, there are several Youtube videos of this product.Pros:&#62; perfect size for me and my kitchen space&#62; makes a good cup of espressoCons:&#62; small size makes it difficult to get the arm on tight&#62; small size can be a problem if all you have are big cups
