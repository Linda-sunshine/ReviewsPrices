review/summary: Just Great!review/text: I ordered one of these as a topper for my twin bed, and gosh what a difference it makes. Its like I have a new mattress! Very good buy and smelled wonderful, green tea that goes away but while waiting for the memory foam to enlarge itself, it was a great fragrance. thanks so much!
