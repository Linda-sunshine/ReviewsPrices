review/summary: Perfect Maker Makes It Perfect!review/text: I recently purchased this coffee pot, b/c I needed something to help wake me up in the morning. I am not a heavy coffee drinker, so this fit the bill. It takes up virtually no counter space, and is easy to use. It makes the perfect amount of coffee for me, b/c I really only need one or two cups. It also is easy to clean, and I like the retractable cord. It is also a great purchase for the job it does. A great Mr. Coffee product for the price offered. Perhaps I will gets its partner Ms. Tea and having a matching set.
