review/summary: Gorgeous, quality piece of cookwarereview/text: First, it arrived in less than 24 hours - amazing! I am an Amazon Prime member with free 2 day shipping but this was really unexpectedly fast. It's a beautiful piece - the blue is a more a cornflower blue than aqua or turquoise but it's lovely. I can't' wait to use it. It is very much worth the money.
