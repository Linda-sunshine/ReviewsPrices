review/summary: Reaaly Sucks Up The Dirtreview/text: Well at first glance it is not the best made unit. Plastic hose, plastic everything! However, this is a very light weight unit that cleans bare floors very well. The power even thru the long hose is good. The cost and performance are very acceptable. There are not very many canister type vacuum's on the market and my wife wanted to be able to reach under the tables and beds without unhooking the hose and adding attachments. This does the job. If you have wood floors and pets this is the vacuum for you. It Works
