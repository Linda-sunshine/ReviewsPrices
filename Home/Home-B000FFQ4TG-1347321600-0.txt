review/summary: A full pot of hot coffee in less than 3 minutes!review/text: This Bunn coffee brewer is very high quality with a reservoir tank that is always hot, so no long waits for fresh, hot coffee anytime! I have had my first Bunn for several years with no problems, and just purchased my second one for our vacation home. It has a switch for the heated reservoir, that we turn off when we will be gone, to save electricity. An excellent well-made product that will give you years of trouble free service.
