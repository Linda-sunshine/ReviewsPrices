review/summary: Wonderful!review/text: This topper fit my double bed perfectly. The smell was very pleasant, and faded in a few days. Best of all, it has helped my joints so much! I no longer wake up stiff in the morning. And I don't have to shift around during the night to take pressure off sore points. Saved so much money by not having to replace the mattress. I'm thrilled with the comfort.
