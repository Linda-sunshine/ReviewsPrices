review/summary: Performs Way Above Pricereview/text: I bought this as an emergency settle. Me and my family made a spontaneous decision to move and needed new appliances. Well, moving day had come and I realized I hadn't bought a new vacuum. I'm very OCD when it comes to cleanliness and I have a tendency to need to vacuum a new place entirely before putting new furniture in. Well, I didn't have the money that week to purchase the $300 vacuum I'd been looking at. So, on another whim, purchased this instead and had it delivered to the new place. Let me tell you, this vacuum is incredible. Great suction, great power, does the job incredibly. And it's small and lightweight that I can carry it all over the house. I use it (not the attachments) to clean the stairs. As for the attachments, when I need them, they were perfectly and keep a strong hold to the vacuum. My only concern is the actual hose itself when used with attachments, it doesn't stretch out as well as I'd like it too but it may just need to be broken in more. I use it almost 4 times a week but it has only been a month. However, you will not be disappointed with this product, ESPECIALLY for the price being asked.
