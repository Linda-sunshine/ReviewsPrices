review/summary: Big Vac in a little pac!review/text: LOVE this thing. EXACTLY what I wanted. As much power as a full size vacuum but smaller. Bigger than some hand-vacs, prob the biggest I've seen (has some weight to it too) but not too heavy or too big. And I LOVE the swivel guard on the front so you can vacuum the vertical FRONT part of the stairs! The roller won't get the absolute crack of the stairs but that's what the crevice tool is for. The ability to vacuum the front of the step and the good reviews was why I chose this vacuum and I am not disappointed! Rotating brush is great too, gets the pet hair out of the carpet just like a big vac. Good long cord; I'm glad its powered and not chargeable, rechargeables are so weak and never last till the job is done. IF YOU HAVE CARPETED STAIRS GET ONE OF THESE!
