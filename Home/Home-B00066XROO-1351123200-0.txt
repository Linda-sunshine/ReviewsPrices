review/summary: Griddle is amazing. I'm so glad I bought them...review/text: When I first got married, we received a griddle for a wedding present. We ended up never using it, and it eventually was given away.I was in-charge of cooking pancakes and sausage for a group of about 150-200 at a church 4th of July pancake breakfast. I knew I needed some griddles, and they needed to be large.PROS:1. It heats up evenly, so the pancakes cook perfectly. They also look perfect.2. You can tilt the unit so when making sausage, the grease drains into a drain pan.3. The size is perfect. Having a large cooking surface is fantastic.4. My wife who things griddles are a waste of money, loved cooking on this and is happy with the purchase. (Should be first on the list.)We have since used this for cooking chicken, quesadillas, bacon, grilled cheese, etc.Oh, and it cleans easily.
