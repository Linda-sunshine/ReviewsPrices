review/summary: good radio and alarmreview/text: i plugged the radio in and the time automatically set for me. there is a little button for brigtness control so i can make it dimmer at night. the two alarm settings are good for those that wake up at different times during the week. the radio quality is good, you might have to position it differently to get a better sound. the only down side is that i can't tell which station i'm listening to and will have to guess since the only display is the AM/FM bar for tuning.
