review/summary: Love this thingreview/text: I bought this several years ago--not on Amazon, but at Bed Bath and Beyond or Linens n Things (when they were still in business) and have used it ever since. It does help if you leave it in the water while filling the tub; otherwise, the suction doesn't work as well. Sometimes it comes off anyway, but it really does ensure a fuller bath. I use it almost every time I take a bath.
