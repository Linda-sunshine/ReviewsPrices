review/summary: Early Impressions - Effective Against Cigarette Smokereview/text: Scenario: using unit in a 1,000 sq ft apt with 2 bedrooms, 1.5 baths; living in 2-unit apartment building on top floor; neighbors on bottom floor (2 adults) are heavy smokers; unit was purchased mainly to combat smokeHigh points- both smell and effects (eye and throat irritation) of smoke are undetectable- although the recommendation is for use in one large room, the unit seems to be filtering smoke from entire apartment- filters come with this unit- unit is easy to set-up- the cost is reasonable for this level of performanceLow points- you must adjust to the white noise - You can't love rain only when it's dry!- you must adjust to the fact that the unit will probably not match your furniture/decorI like this product because it fixed the problem of cigarette smoke from my downstairs neighbors in my apartment. It has exceeded my expectations. The high points far outweigh the low points for this scenario. I will update my review in six months.
