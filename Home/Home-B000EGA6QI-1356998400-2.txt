review/summary: Love it!!review/text: I purchased this item in November 2012. I use mine mainly for making iced drinks and love it!! It blends the ice to a very fine and smooth consistency quickly. I use it daily. After having it for about 1 month, there was a popping sound and a light flashed from the &#34;on&#34; button while I was using it. Of course, it immediately stopped working. I contacted Amazon, and they immediately sent me a replacement. I've only been using the new one for a few days, but still love how it works. Hopefully this one will last longer.
