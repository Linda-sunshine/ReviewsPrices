review/summary: Tried it; didn't like it...review/text: I have used the Phillips Pod system for years now. The up side is that it's convenient, clean, and efficient. Plus, it leaves a wonderful crema in your cup. The down side is that the coffee pods you buy range from okay to stale and that they're expensive. So I tried these guys, filling them with coffee that I'd ground. They tasted fine and worked well -- but ... but the mess was as bad as any other system of making coffee -- perhaps worse. And, after a while, I managed to plug up the Phillips Pod Hole of Death and had to "rest" the machine for a week before it would open to be cleaned out. I threw out these pods. Bottom line: if you use these, you might as well use another system to make coffee. Fair enough.
