review/summary: Great Juicer for the pricereview/text: I am just getting into juicing but wanted to pick up a juicer that was fast and easy to use in order to help get me started on living a healthier life style. Whether just getting started, or an experienced juicer, this product works great. A single cup of juice, or massive quantities of juice, this machine can handle it. It will juice as fast as you can throw produce down the chute.I think the Breville fits my needs perfectly. I can't imagine needing any more power than what this beast offers. It juices anything you put into it almost instantly, literally juicing is what I spend the least amount of time on. There is very little prep required for fruits/veggies, most stuff will fit right into the shoot, extra large apples may need to be cut in half, but most fit right in. If you are planning on doing apples however, I would suggest picking up a corer just to make things easier.I am hardly an expert when it comes to juicing, but the amount and quality of the juice coming out seems to be good.As for the cleanup, nearly everything simply rinses clean if you wash it right after juicing. The only downside was the time it takes to clean the mesh screen. I took a star away simply because cleaning the mesh screen is the single most time consuming part of juicing for me. That being said, I am not sure how they can do it any better, and it does clean up fairly quickly with the provided brush.I do have a friend who uses the $299 version of this juicer and while he loves it, he wishes he had picked up this version since there just really isn't any need for the more powerful engine.
