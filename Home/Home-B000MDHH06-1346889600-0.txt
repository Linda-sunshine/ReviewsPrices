review/summary: Perfect for making healthy drinks for my mother (and ME!)review/text: My parents recently purchased this Breville juice fountain from Amazon, primarily in hopes of making healthy drinks for my mother suffering through chemo due to pancreatic cancer. Since I moved in with them to become their caregiver, I was the first to tackle making juices for my mom with this brand new unit. I hesitated due to knowledge at how hard it is to clean many juicers out on the market, but was pleasantly surprised with this unit. It was so easy to clean and made drinks FAST! The drinks have been so tasty and with the help of a juicer book purchased at the same time, it was easy to determine what types of fruits and vegetables were beneficial, particularly in regards to my mother's needs. If my mother had a compost pile, the leftover fruit and veggie particles would immediately go into the compost. Unfortunately this is not the case so I cannot be truly green with it but my dogs tend to enjoy a few tidbits of the dejuiced (is that a word???) particles remaining from the process. Nevertheless, I feel this juicer far and above exceeds my expectations for a juicer of this size and power. It has become a daily part of our healthy routine at home. It is worth every penny to me when I see my mother enjoy the concoctions I come up with (oftentimes with the help of the Juicer Bible book!) and knowing that these beverages are healthy for her rather than the chemical laden pre-made juices in the supermarket.
