review/summary: The Dream Machinereview/text: This percolator has made all my coffee dreams come true. The coffee perks at a high temperature and the standby temp after perking is hotter than most brew temps of drips. The coffee taste is wonderful. I had the same experience with the Presto that I had when I went from dial up on the computer to DSL--so thats the internet. So that is what real good coffee is!!! A good tip for groundless coffee is just use a round drip paper filter. Fold it in half and just cut a small triangle that will fit snugly over the perc stem. You can cut several at a time. The triangle is easier to cut than a half circle. I get a stray ground every once in a while, but that is it. Such a simple coffee making process, but oh so good coffee!!
