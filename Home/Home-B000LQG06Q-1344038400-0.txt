review/summary: Works Good BUT Offgas First!review/text: I bought this product based on the many good reviews on Amazon. Some reviewers had mentioned the product has a minty smell. Indeed it does have a pleasant minty smell. However, I doubt the smell is from adding mint to it. It is most likely from the chemicals used to make the product.So I opened it and let all the volatile organic compounds out for a couple of weeks in front of an open window before using it. I did not want to breathing in the stuff all night.I have had it on my mattress for a few weeks now. It has made my mattress a whole lot more comfortable!
