review/summary: As temperamental as a maiden aunt with the vaporsreview/text: Makes good coffee, when you can get it to cooperate. The carafe must be placed rather precisely under the valve that lets the coffee flow from the filter; get this wrong and the machine barfs coffee + grounds all over itself and your counter. The device requires a level of accurate aim of which I am incapable in the mornings before I've had my coffee.Also, the little swing arm which drizzles the water from the reservoir into the filter does not reliably swing into place when you close the lid. And finally, it's very easy to hit the wrong button when trying to set the Auto brew feature, and to bump the time set buttons when you're just trying to turn the thing on. Nice form factor, good coffee but an altogether poor design. I would never buy this again.
