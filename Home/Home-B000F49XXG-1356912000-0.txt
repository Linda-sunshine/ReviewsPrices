review/summary: Okay for the moneyreview/text: I drink espresso several time a day - every day. As new this espresso is fabulous, a nice froth on top like a commercial machine would produce. This is my 2nd machine which leaks after about 1-1/2 to 2 years. The leak starts (i believe) inside the pump area where the water tubes connect. I was thinking of replacing the guts with parts available for sell through ([...]) to my first machine but decided for the cost... to replace it with the new machine. Now having paid over $200.00 for two of these espresso machines, I'm saving to put that kind of money in a different brand.
