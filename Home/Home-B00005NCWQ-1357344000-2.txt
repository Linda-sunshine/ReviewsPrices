review/summary: Damn Good Cup of Joereview/text: My family had one like this 12 years ago and nothing was better than a cuppa from it on cold winter mornings while away at the cabin. Now I have one again and get to enjoy the aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafting throughout my home. As for the taste, it's all quality: the coffee that comes out of this thing is probably what Bob Dylan had in mind when he wrote One More Cup of Coffee.Since I received my new peculator, I've become the envy of my family despite them all having graduated to sophisticated capsule and filter brewing machines with timers and regulators and all sorts of redundant features added for the sole purpose of slapping "New and Improved" on the side of a box. It's also environmentally friendlier because it doesn't need any disposable capsules or paper filters to do it's job. It's mostly steel construction means it will last forever or until my descendants choose to recycle it after I've passed it on to them. It can also be used to boil water for tea drinkers when out camping with friends.I would give this product 5 stars but had to old one star back because it came with a plastic knob: what the hell? I suppose this is what happens when economists and bean counters have too much influence over product design and manufacturing! I would have ordered replacement glass ones had it been more obvious that it comes with a plastic know.Clear glass percolator top, fits Farberware, etc.
