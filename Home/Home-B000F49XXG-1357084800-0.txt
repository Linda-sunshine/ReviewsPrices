review/summary: Too small space for a cupreview/text: Pro:Fast heat up - less than a minute.Small size - doesn't take up much room, looks very cute and nic3.Con:The space where you put the cup is misleading in the picture. It is actually very, very small (about 2 inches high), meaning it requires an equally small cup. This is not a problem for those who simply drink a cup of espresso and call it a day. But I like to drink Americano (espresso + hot water) meaning I need a bigger cup. I'd like to simply use a big cup in the first place, instead of having to get a small cup, place it on the machine and brew espresso, pour the espresso from small cup to a bigger cup, and pour water. It's just annoying to have an extra step and more annoying to have one extra cup to wash every morning.
