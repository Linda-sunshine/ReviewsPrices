review/summary: Don't BUY!!!review/text: Before I bought these sheets I had 300 thread count sheets. I was super excited about 600 thread count and that it said Sateen. When you think about Sateen you think soft, silky, and smooth. Well, I got none of those. These sheets feel like cardboard. My 300 thread count sheet are softer then these trash bags. IT STATES SATEEN, it's actually a horrible cotton.Don't WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!
