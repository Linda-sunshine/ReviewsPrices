review/summary: Tops are greatreview/text: I ordered these tops to use to make yogurt. I like them very much and am happy with the product. The packaging was all squashed when I received these and I was unhappy with that as I wanted to use the box to store the metal canning tops while I am using the plastic ones. If you want your inner box to be intact when you get these, please order from another seller. They were just sent stuffed in a plastic envelope which offers no protection for the box or the plastic tops.
