review/summary: LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE ITreview/text: I have been waiting for the right price and the right color for this dutch oven.I am very pleased with the product and probably use it 5 out of 7 days a week.The only thing you need to know is that the cover gets just as hot as the pot.My husband didn't realize this and placed the cover down on the counter andit sustained a burn mark on the laminate. So...be careful about that.
