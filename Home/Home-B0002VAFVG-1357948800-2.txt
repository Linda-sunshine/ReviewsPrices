review/summary: RIP OFFreview/text: Yes, I've owned and used this juicer for about 4 years....HOWEVER, within a few months after purchasing it, the blades dulled, the filter wasn't filtering very well, and huge chunks of veggies were not being juiced. Then the part where the top housing sits, began to corrode, then the "stainless steel" PAINT all bubbled and peeled off. Now, when we juice (and yes we juice every day) the contacts with the top are all loose and we have to wear raincoats because juice gets spit out EVERYWHERE....all over us, all over the walls. And WHY is Breville still using plastic as their juice catch? They could so easily make a real stainless steel jug (not painted to look like stainless steel) and get rid of the plastic. The company is horrible to deal with....they make it very clear they just don't care once thye've got your money. And if you buy replacement parts....I could buy a brand new juicer with what you have to spend on that.. I will not buy another Breville juicer....Be smart and find another juicer...this one is a RIP OFF!!!!
