review/summary: Not 32 Ounces, more like 24. Novelty wears off after about a day.review/text: I really looked forward to this. I make tea several times per day. I figured, this would make it simple instead of throwing away or rebrewing my tea leaves. It does strain, and works as described, but has 2 terrible flaws.First, it's closer to 24 ounces. can fill up one 16oz mug, and a another halfway. I poured water from my measuring cups to verify that it was less ounces than stated. So, if you are getting this to fill up two large 16oz mugs, or four small 8oz mugs, don't waste your money.My second complaint is that it's difficult to clean, and there are no way to seperate the parts for thorough cleaning; not to mention the fact that this came with no instructions either! I don't see this being sturdy enough to last a year, if that.
