review/summary: Love it!review/text: I have both the small and large 3M shower caddy hanging now for about a month and they are both holding strong. I have my oversized shampoo/conditioner in the large caddy and no detection of it coming loose. I was actually originally looking for a corner shower caddy because the one I had rusted and I was looking to replace it. When I read the reviews on this product I decided to try it and love it! It is easy to install but make sure you follow the instructions for best results! The caddy's are also removable for easy cleaning, and you can even put them in your dishwasher. The larger shower caddy is great for those oversized products while the small shower caddy is great for items that might be more prone to tip (like shaving cream) because this caddy is actually deeper than the large basket. I would recommend at least 1 of each! Love 3M products!
