review/summary: Doesn't work wellreview/text: I like the idea of the reusable basket. It's good for the environment and I don't want to bother replacing the paper filters. However, this basket is just not fine enough; the small grounds come through. It ruins the last cup of coffee in the pot. I'm going to stick with the cloth filter instead. I bought the basket because sometimes the cloth folds in on itself, but it works most of the time!
