review/summary: Love it for all my loose teareview/text: Very nice, no hassle teapot that's great for a quick cup if you don't want to make a whole pot. Just don't put it down on an uneven surface with water in it, since it might depress and release tea all over (learned that the hard way with 8 oz of tea pooling under my table).The only thing I wish was that it was a little easier to clean and the base was a tad bigger. I still don't know how to fully take this thing apart (or if you're supposed to), and aside from just rinsing it out and dropping a few cups of water through it, I'm not sure how you're supposed to clean the screen. Also, I have a few teacups that I thought were standard size, but the mouth is too big for this teapot!
