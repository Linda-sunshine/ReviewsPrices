review/summary: Terrible qualityreview/text: This mixer is not worthy of the kitchen aid name and to call it "professional" is a joke and whatever marketing jerk came up with that needs to be strung up.This mixer, despite its name and marketing specs, cannot handle anything more serious than a single batch of cookies. Mixing a 3-cups of flour pizza dough or a single loaf of bread stresses the machine rather badly. We tried a 5-cup of flour pretzel recipe and the machine began smoking, overheating and smelling awful.This is a consumer-grade piece of junk. Do not buy.
