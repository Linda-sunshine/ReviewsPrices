review/summary: Fun product, poor qualityreview/text: My wife and I bought this product in hopes that it would add some fun to our son's room and help keep his skin from getting so dry in the winter. The day I bought it, I dropped the container from 3 ft and it shattered. So I bought a new part. After a few months of use, the cable shorted out at the junction where it goes into the base. So I emailed crane and they told me how to obtain a replacement. The replacement got here today, and it doesn't work properly. It doesn't even have HALF of the output of the old one.UPDATE: I emailed crane, and they sent me out another replacement without me having to send back the defective one. The third unit arrived much quicker than the first two. So far, it works. When it breaks, I will buy another brand for these reasons:1. The dial doesn't vary the amount of water vapor coming out nearly as well as our safety 1st 360 degree humidifier.2. The junction where the cord goes into the base isn't strengthened, so it is prone to shorting out.3. The water vapor isn't projected out and away, it billows out of the top. So any surface that the humidifier sits on will get water damage over time.4. This is my third claim on the warranty in 3 months. In my opinion, it is irresponsible to engineer a product that does not work well consistently, and I will not support that kind of company with my business.On the positive side, I have nothing but good things to say about their customer service department. They are polite, responsive, and kind. Too bad their product doesn't reflect that kind of quality.
