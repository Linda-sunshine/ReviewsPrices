review/summary: Received defective unit... But Amazon is great on the return and making it right.review/text: The unit I received started to issue blue smoke and an electrical burning smell shortly after I first turned it on and started using it - that's after grinding beans for only 20 seconds! It still runs, but I am assuming that my unit has faulty motor wiring and am returning it for replacement rather than risk a fire with continued use. (Most likely a weak motor power lead or bad internal connection.)In cleaning it up to send it back, if you live in an area where static electricity is common in the winter, be warned, fine coffee grounds *love* to stick to the plastic housing and catch cup like crazy. (I really wish the manufacturer designed this with something that negated static buildup or at least lowered it. As is, it is a real pain to cleanup because of this!) The beans it did grind came out great - just need to wait on a replacement unit before providing a more in-depth review.
