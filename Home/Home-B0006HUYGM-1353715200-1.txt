review/summary: Powerful vacuum, great pricereview/text: Not a lot to say, really. The price was great - on par with their competitors - and the quality is greater. I live in a relatively small and dusty wood-floored apartment that accumulates dust and dirt very quickly. This unit does what its asked to do. I would recommend this unit to anyone looking for a compact vacuum.
