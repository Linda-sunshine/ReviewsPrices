review/summary: Better than buying bottled water!review/text: It fits in my refrigerator just great. It probably takes up less space than all of the bottled water than I had in there. I refill it at least every night so I have fresh water in the morning. I haven't had any problems with it at all. I have saved a lot of money not having to buy bottled water.
