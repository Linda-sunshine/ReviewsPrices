review/summary: The Keurig is awesomereview/text: I love the Keurig! I used to use an older coffee pot and ended up throwing coffee down the drain. Keurig is perfect. I brew whatever I want 1 cup at a time and no waste. And it's much cheaper than Starbuck's or Carribou. This is one of the best purchases I've made recently. And it was very well packaged. It arrived in excellent condition.
