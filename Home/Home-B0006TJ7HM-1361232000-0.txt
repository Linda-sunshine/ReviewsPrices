review/summary: Great Concept, Rusts in first dayreview/text: Left a knife not completely wiped down and apparently the STAINLESS STEEL decides to RUST, and it has now done so in multiple areas. Had these only 5 days. Not going to send back because these are a throw away, could have saved the shipping cost at Bed Bath and Beyond and got a little cheaper too. They cut nice, look like they could be solid handles, but poor steel to rusts instantly.
