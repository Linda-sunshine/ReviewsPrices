review/summary: Awesome coffee makerreview/text: My girlfriend bugged me to get one of these and I was not convinced. The K-cups are more expensive than ground coffee and it seems like a lot of waste to be throwing those away every day. As she pointed out the benefit is in the time and amount of coffee you make. I can make a quick cup when I leave in the morning and not worry about wasting 3/4 of a pot if I'm the only one who wants some. Also, you can buy K-Cup sized strainers so that you are able to use ground coffee or tea and reuse the container.In terms of speed and ease of use, this is one of the best appliances I've used. The only thing is that i wish the filter life could be monitored by the machine (it is manual for this model). I highly recommend a Keurig and this model especially has been awesome.
