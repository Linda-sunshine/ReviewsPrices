review/summary: Difficult at first, but now they workreview/text: At first I was very frustrated with these because as people mentioned, the ice is hard to get out, but i have found that now since i've had them for a little while, they have become worn in and the ice comes our very easily. Now it is everything that I hoped. Nice large ice cubes that are easily removed.
