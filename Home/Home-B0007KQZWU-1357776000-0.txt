review/summary: Love these pots!review/text: This is a great set of pots and pans. I was a little nervous after reading some reviews about things sticking and them being hard to clean. I have had no problem whatsoever getting them clean, I think they clean up better than any other pots or pans I've used even the non stick! I think that cleaning them right after use or soaking them is all you need to do. Also I followed what other reviews said and the instructions that came with them of not cooking on high heat. This is a great set!
