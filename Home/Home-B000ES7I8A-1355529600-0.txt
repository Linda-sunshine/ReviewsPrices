review/summary: electric kettlereview/text: Wow..something JUST as it was advertised, what a lovely find. It is a great pot, warm not hot to the touch, very fast and quite convenient. My husband had badly burned his hand with an old fashioned teapot so I went online and this one had something I was anxious to have, &#34;no plastic smell or taste.&#34; Very true and it's a great product.
