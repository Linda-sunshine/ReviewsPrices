review/summary: Kicking myself in the butt for not buying this sooner!review/text: I've wanted a juicer for over a year now but I've been hesistant only because I had been concerned about power and cleaning of the product. I didn't think that a juicer that cost under $150 would exist that was powerful and very easily to clean! I can stuff 3 carrots back to back and whole apples without cutting in this thing! It comes apart in three pieces that I can clean and rinse in under 10 minutes. My juicer has found a permanent place on my kitchen countertop!
