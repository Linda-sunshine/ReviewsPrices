review/summary: Great product!review/text: We bought this item because our shower does not have any shelves in it, and I was tired of all the clutter along the edges of the tub. We love it! It is super easy to put up and holds a lot of stuff, so I can have all my girly items and there is still room for my fiance's items as well. The little hook is perfect to hang sponges or was clothes on. We bought two just so we have one for our other bathroom as well! Highly recommended!
