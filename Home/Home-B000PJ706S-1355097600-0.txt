review/summary: THE WORST - DO NOT BUYreview/text: THIS IS THE WORST TASTING WATER EVER. For a $70 water kettle, I should expect much, much more. It should be against the law to sell such a disgusting, toxic gadget. Even my husband, who is not in the least concerned with toxicity and who seems to have few tastebuds, will not drink the water heated in this unit.
