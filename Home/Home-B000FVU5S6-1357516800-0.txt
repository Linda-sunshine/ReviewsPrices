review/summary: Color not as expectedreview/text: Pros: the sheets fit my pillow top bed perfectly. I was worried that the pockets might not be deep enough (18 in), but its just fine. I was disappointed in the color. The picture makes the sheets look more beige, but they are more orange. After washing, they are all wrinkled. I kept these sheets, but won't order any more.
