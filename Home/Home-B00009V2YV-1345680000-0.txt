review/summary: Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FLreview/text: Midland has been making excellent quality CB and weather radios for many years. I really like this radio. It has clear sound quality of the NOAA weather bands. It has alerted me to severe weather several times. I give it 5 stars. By Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL
