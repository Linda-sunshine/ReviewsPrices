review/summary: Bought four!!review/text: Loved the first one I bought so much, I bought three more! I bought one for my mother and she claims it makes her over sleep because it's so comfortable. Bought one for my husband's bed (he snores and jerks sometimes) and he loves it. Bought one for our main bed and it's soooo comfortable. We replaced old foam mattress toppers. One thing I noticed is the Sleep Studio is much cooler than the old mattress. There is a smell for a couple of weeks but it smells like mint. Kind of pleasant to me but could be too strong for others. Just lay the mattress out for a few days to dissipate the smell. Husband does wake up with numb fingers or hands now. The mattress seems to give a more restful sleep. One thing I noticed is I'm able to get out of the bed easier. The other mattress got a hold of you and wouldn't let go.I highly recommend this mattress. Be very careful when you first unroll the mattress. Give it time to expand or you will rip it.
