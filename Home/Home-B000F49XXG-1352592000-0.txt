review/summary: Are you kidding me?review/text: This espresso maker is awesome! I have had mine for 6 months, and I love it. In fact, I just purchased two more of them for christmas gifts. I used to have a Buon 330 espresso maker that I bought from Starbucks 10 years ago. I literally had to microwave the milk before frothing it with the Buon 330. I never knew how the coffee was going to turn out. It was very inconsistent. This unit makes great coffee every time. Granted, it is not super sturdy and is not completely metal, and it does have parts that could possibly break, but you are only paying $80.00!!!!!!! What matters is "Are you getting a great cup of coffee for $80?" The answer is YES!!!!Pros: consistent brew, excellent frothier, multiple inserts.Cons: Alright, I will admit it, the tamper is totally useless. Yeah, useless until I can't find my regular tamper in the morning then it totally goes in the "PRO" column!If this thing broke tomorrow, I would immediately buy another one without even thinking about it.
