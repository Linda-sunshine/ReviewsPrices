review/summary: piece of crapreview/text: I bought this coffee maker after rave reviews but I guess I should have read the 1 and 2 stars reviews. The permanent filter is a nice touch, if it worked. Mine came with a huge gap in the filter and duhhhh all the coffee grounds ended up in the coffee. Waste of money. I'm not even going to call the customer service or B&D since the reviewers say its a waste of time and they won't help. I will be returning it...although it'll probably cost me the same amount of money to return it. No use having a crappy coffee filter in my home taking up space. Amazon should be ashamed of themselves...selling shitty products
