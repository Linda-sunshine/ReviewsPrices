review/summary: New Best Friend!review/text: This vacuum is awesome! Anyone with stairs should buy one. I have a standard bilevel home, so about 12 carpeted stairs and a landing half way down. It was a total pain to bring my large vacuum up and down the stairs. I finally got fed up and bought this one. Can't beat the price either. I've gone through several that say they have great power, and don't. This vacuum lifts the hair of both my cat and dog without a problem.
