review/summary: Hot Shot broke in a little over 3 months with very limited use.review/text: We've used 2 Hot Shots over the last 20 years. Ordered this unit through Amazon.com on August 2, 2012. Received this last one on August 6th. Used it sparingly. On November 18th the cheap plastic 'on button' obviously broke. You can no longer turn it on. A cheaply made copy of the originals. The steam issue is another issue. You must leave the top open after heating water and then physically dry off the top of the container as it is made of cheap plastic. It also needs to be taller for larger containers and hold more water. It takes much longer for water to heat than the previous units. They are not being made like they used to.
