review/summary: Excellent bread makerreview/text: Have made 6 loaves since Christmas and was surprised at how delicious the bread is. My only complaint is that the recipe book is very confusing and the recipes are very strange in the required measurements. &#34;Close enough&#34; has not given me any problems though. The machine is noisy at times, but I have heard they are all that way. Other than that, I highly recommend this machine for bread making. Have not tried any oddball kinds of bread yet. Have made whit, wheat, honey wheat, & molasses wheat. Because of the lousy book that came with it, I rate this at 4.5 stars.
