review/summary: Great-- but be careful!review/text: I've used these in restaurants to cut onions, tomatoes and zucchinis. One very nice feature is the little notches at the end of the cutting board. This fits perfectly over standard hotel "half-pans" to have a place for the cut veg to go to.But use EXTREME care when using this. Don't use it without the guard. It cuts very fast and will easily take off a finger tip if you are not paying attention.I prefer this over more expensive metal mandolins because it's much lighter and easier to clean.
