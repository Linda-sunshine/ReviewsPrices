review/summary: Nice chair for the pricereview/text: My Uncle bought this chair and ottoman for me as a gift when my son was born. He was born on 9/23/12, and I received it on the 24th. My husband set it up, it didn't take him very long to do. In the, almost, two weeks I've had this chair, I can tell you I have spent many days and nights rocking my little one in it. It's a nice chair, but having spent several hours each night rocking a fussy baby, it's not easy on your bottom. The rest of my family enjoy it as well. Including my husband. The color is beautiful. Just be aware with the light fabric, it does get dirty easily. My MIL crocheted covers for the arms, ottoman, and headrest. Overall, for the cost, it's a great chair. Maybe with a little extra cushion, it would make those long nights easy on your bottom.
