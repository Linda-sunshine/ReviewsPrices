review/summary: There are better choicesreview/text: After one week of using these pans, my wife insisted they be returned. I said we should use them a little longer because I really liked their looks. The problem is, cleaning. I have to use cleanser to scrub them after each use. Unfortunately, some stains remain even after scrubbing. I finally gave in and bought my wife one non-stick pan at at a local store. This pan is a pleasure to clean so I use it too. The lesson here is &#34;listen to your wife when she doesn't like something&#34;!
