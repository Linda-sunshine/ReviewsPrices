review/summary: Pretty cool. Suits my needs. Looks sweet in the kitchen:)review/text: I hesitate on the 5 stars only because I haven't used it very much yet - but the few times I have? NO complaints! I don't need to pay for the swanky ones:). It cooks well, it cleans well (you can hardcore "caramelize" and bake things, leaving crusty rings and it cleans effortlessly) and I'm a bit rough and tumble... I move things around alot in my small kitchen. I haven't had any chipping issues?I'll leave the big bucks for "impressive" brand appliances... No need here for a cooking vessel! This thing looks sweet and I my short ribs come out awesome;).
