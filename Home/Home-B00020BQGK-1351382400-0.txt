review/summary: Go Amazon!!, best vac and best price!!!review/text: I have had lots of these stick vacuums over the years and this one by far is the best ever. I am 74 years old and I got this because the regular vacuum is to heavy for a few crumbs in the kitchen so I can just grab this one and use it for 5 minutes and all the crumbs etc are gone and I am not worn out from trying to wrestle the big vacuum. I just love it. Every senior should have one of these because it is so light weight an also it has the rotating brush for the rugs and turn that off and it is perfect for hard floors. ITS GREAT!!!!!
