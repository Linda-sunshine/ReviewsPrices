review/summary: love it.review/text: (This is Chris' wife posting this review) I still don't know a lot about pressure canning and I was scared to death the first time I used this. Everything went alright and didn't experience any of the problems other people were complaining about! I feel like this is a perfect starting price to get your foot in the door. I was looking at some of the 200 dollar ones but figured that I would play with this a few times before I spend that kind of money. I will update this review if anything changes though!
