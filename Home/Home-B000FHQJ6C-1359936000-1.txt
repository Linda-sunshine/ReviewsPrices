review/summary: Good little juicer, great for startersreview/text: I did a lot of research before purchasing this juicer and I'm very happy with it. It is a little loud and a pain to clean but that's part of juicing and you get used to it. BUT - it is not a Breville. The breville is the best but if you can't afford to drop $300 on a juicer then definitely get this one.
