review/summary: Great thermosreview/text: Keeps food warm for long hours. I heat up the food super hot and 5 hours later its still warm. I wished I had gotten this earlier. I used to bring my sons food in plastic containers when we went out to eat and would soak it in hot water to heat up or ask the restaurant to microwave. This is so much better! Will be getting a pink one for my daughter.
