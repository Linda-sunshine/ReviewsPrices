review/summary: GREAT FOR STORAGEreview/text: I use Ball/Kerr jars a lot for culturing/fermenting raw vegetables. Normally, I use the old standard 2-part metal lids for culturing/fermenting, but I have done, in a pinch, with these plastic lids, with good results (i.e., I haven't ever lost a batch I have made using a plastic lid.After my ferments are done, I do like to switch from the metal "dome" lids to these plastic lids when I move things to storage in the refrigerator.I also use Ball jars to grow sprouts, and I switch from the plastic "grid lid" I use for sprouting, to one of these lids for storage, as much to keep the sprouts from drying out in the refrigerator as to slow their growing further.As a consummate Ball jar user, I keep my dry goods in these glass jars, and the plastic lids provide a very good seal for items sitting on the shelf, whether they be beans, seeds, nuts, spices, dried herbs, or dehydrated vegetables or crackers.These lids are also best, I think, for gifts. If I've made some dehdyrated kale chips, for instance, as a gift, I'll put them in a suitable jar and then lid them with these plastic caps. It makes a double gift - the recipient can enjoy the contents, and then use the jar as a storage jar.Yes, I am a big fan of these plastic lids.
