review/summary: Just the thingreview/text: This little one-cup coffee-maker is a perfect thing. It comes with a very high-quality travel-cup, but is worth the price even without the cup.Add grounds and water, close the lid, place your cup, and turn it on. It quickly brews one cup and shuts itself off.Shuts itself off! That's why I bought it! It's very energy-efficient, and there is no way you can forget your coffee and burn it dry. If you forget your coffee, the worst thing you get is cold coffee.
