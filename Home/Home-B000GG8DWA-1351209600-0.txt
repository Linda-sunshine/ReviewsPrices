review/summary: Retireereview/text: I like the over all function and the simplicity of the infared heater. The one really big improvement that could be made on it is,get rid of the odor. The paint creates a odor that takes forever to go away, so use something different so as not to have the odor. I know it is a cheap product, but the problem can be fixed.
