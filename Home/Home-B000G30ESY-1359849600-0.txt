review/summary: Great little rice cooker!review/text: Terrific little rice cooker. I was tired of the mediocre rice I made in a pot on the stove. After being served delicious rice made from a rice cooker, I decided to purchase one. Online research showed that the Zojirushi products were well-recommended. I'm very pleased with the quality of the rice I now make in my rice cooker. I'm experimenting with lentils in the cooker, and pleased with the results. One caution though -- moisture collects in the rice cooker and it does not dry out in a day. After removing and washing all the removable parts (cooking pot and inner lid) and letting them dry for over 24 hours, if I reassemble everything and close it up to store, the next time I get it out I find water in the cooking pot. I now store the rice cooker open with the inner lid left out. It takes up more room in my cupboard this way, but now there is no chance of bacteria growing in a moist environment.
