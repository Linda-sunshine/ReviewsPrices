review/summary: Easy to use....delicious coffeereview/text: I just bought the AeroPress yesterday at my local shop. This morning was my first experience using it. I read through the instructions and watched the video on their web site prior to going for it. I like a strong cup of coffee and I don't need a lot of it. I heated the water to 175 degrees which seems to be just before it starts to boil. I put two level scoops of espresso ground coffee into the chamber and filled it with water to about 2 1/2. Put the plunger in and slowly pressed it down until it bottomed out. I then topped it off with some frothed up warm 2% milk (no sugar for me). It was delicious. I don't care that there's no crema on top and I don't expect that from anything less than a thousand dollar espresso machine. It's the taste that matters and this is the best tasting coffee I've had since I was in Italy. My Bialetti Mocha Express can't match the smooth taste produced by the AeroPress. There was absolutely zero bitterness to the coffee. I like the idea one reviewer has of reusing the filters. At least I would entertain using one filter per day as opposed to one filter per use. I would recommend heating your mug, maybe just microwave some water in it to heat it up before you press your coffee into it. I'm sure I'm going to be absolutely disgusted the next time I brew a batch of Dunkin Donuts in the auto drip machine. To get the exact results I wanted from this unit the very first time I used it just floors me.
