review/summary: Much better than Braun that we had earlierreview/text: The biggest issue we have with similar products tried previously was that they didn't last more than a few months. The Cuisinart is an exception, and a welcome one at that. It has lasted a long time and it still works great. You pay for quality and in this case, it was money well spent.
