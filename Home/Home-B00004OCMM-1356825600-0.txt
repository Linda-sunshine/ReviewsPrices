review/summary: Love it!review/text: I purchased a new can opener on a whim a few years ago at a local grocery store, and it worked well for the most part; however, I put it in the dishwasher a few too many times and it was shot. I searched online for a can opener that would last me longer, having learned my lesson and knowing to only hand wash moving forward, and I stumbled upon this one. I have to say, I'm impressed. I've only just begun to use it, but it's the nicest one i've ever used. The ease of use is impressive, and it's very comfortable in my small hands too! All in all, i'm a fan. I will have to see how well it stands the test of time, but for now, i'm happy.
