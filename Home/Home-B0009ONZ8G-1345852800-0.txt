review/summary: Crapreview/text: This thing is a complete piece of crap. Normally I don't read one-star reviews, but in this case it's appropriate. I bought this based on other reviews, and I recently saw that they redesigned this unit. The new version is a waste of money, even at this low price point. Bare-floor pickup is supposed to be excellent, but it excels only in shooting debris at your feet. The hose is too short to be of any real value, and the electrical cord should be cut off and replaced with anything else that will carry electricity. The tools don't stay in their assigned holders, and at least they could have designed it so the extensions sit small side up - that would allow you to put the brush and other tools on the extensions, where they might actually stay.
