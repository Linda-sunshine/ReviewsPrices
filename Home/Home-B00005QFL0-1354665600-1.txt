review/summary: Very pleasedreview/text: I am so very satisfied with my first bread maker. I have, for years, made my own from scratch. Loved the kneading etc. and the aroma. So many years have taken the toll on my hands and I can no longer indulge myself with doing that. I am now making my second loaf, and I know it's soon to review but I can't find a thing wrong with the machine, the operation or the recipes. If that changes then fine, I'll amend this one, but so far, I'm truly enjoying it.UPDATE! 12/18/12I've been baking bread now almost daily. No problems, no malfunctions, no complaints. I make one loaf that turned out terrible but that was my fault. I tried my own twist to an old bread recipe, didn't weigh the flour (which, by the way, is easy and very much better than just dipping the flour). LOL, I now have an interesting paper weight. HA! All the other recipes are turning out great. Still satisfied.
