review/summary: Twice I Have Been Disappointedreview/text: I purchased this humidifier last winter for my newborn son. This frog humidifier was so cute, which is why I bought it in the first place. After 3 or 4 months the fan started making a very loud grinding sound. I contacted Crane and they told me they would replace it. I had to send in the tank cap, the end of the cord, and a receipt with the date of purchase. It took a few weeks, but they did send me a new humidifier. The second humidifier started making the same sound again after about 3 months. It wouldn't always make the sound though. Sometimes I would refill it and it would work fine for two days. Other times I would turn it on only to be disappointed by the loud grinding sound. Last week the humidifier stopped working all together. I was so frustrated I just threw it in the trash.
