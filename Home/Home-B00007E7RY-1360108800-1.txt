review/summary: Can Tell a Difference!review/text: I actually recieved my order within 2 days which was great! I am a pet owner and live in an older apartment building, so there is a lot of dust and pet fur flying around. With the Honeywell, there is a tremendous difference in the quality of the air. When I am out, I turn up the purifier to high. When I return, my apartment is freshly scented and I no longer smell the old apartment/litter box/dusty odor that I have in past. I am so content with it that I ordered a second one for more coverage.
