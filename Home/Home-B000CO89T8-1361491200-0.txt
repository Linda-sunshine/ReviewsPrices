review/summary: It's the cupreview/text: This warmer gets pretty darn hot. The problem is that most cups have a concave bottom which means the only cup contact with the warmer is the rim of the cup base. This will keep a full cup warm but the more you drink the warmer the beverage gets. It's a matter of contact area x amount to warm. If you want a full hot cup I suggest you try to find a flat bottom cup or mug. A warm full cup is not the fault of the warmer. Trust me, it gets hot enough you won't want to touch it. I'm ordering a second one now and I'm not so fussy that I'll look for a flat bottom mug to go with it.
