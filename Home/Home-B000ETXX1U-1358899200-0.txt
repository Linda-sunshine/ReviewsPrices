review/summary: Sturdy inflatable bed!review/text: Got this on a lightning deal, and thought it was a bargain - not so much, it wasn't that much cheaper than what I saw it for at local retailers. Oh well, can't win them all. Anyways - it's a good bed, takes longer to inflate than it says it will, but not a deal breaker. The only reason this isn't a five star review is because to keep it as firm as I like it, I have to add air daily. Otherwise, it's comfortable, and easy to store. Great add on for guests, or for a nursery if you have an infant that likes to have 2am block parties.
