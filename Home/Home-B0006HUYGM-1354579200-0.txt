review/summary: Love this little thingreview/text: I bought it for my stairs, but it's come in super handy for the cars and for furniture, as well quick messes and tight spaces. It's easier to drag out than the big vacuum, and it's light and has great suction. The tools are perfect and the flipping circulating brush cover that I never thought I'd use gets used often. The cannister is easy to pop off to empty, and the 'replaceable' filter in there is sturdy and I just brush it off everytime I empty the cannister. I don't forsee having to replace the filter for a very long time. It looks and feels very durable.
