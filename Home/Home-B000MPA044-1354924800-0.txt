review/summary: Would not buy!review/text: I have tried two different Cuisinart pressure cookers. The timer did not work on either pressure cooker so I had no way of knowing if it was done or not. The second one actually switched to Keep Warm 4 minutes after being turned on to High Pressure. The flashing LED light was supposed to stop flashing and count down once it reached pressure and did not. I am now going to try a stovetop pressure cooker. Although Cuisinart is a very good brand, they do need to do some work on this product. What they do not tell you upfront is that this electric pressure cooker only reaches 10 psi vs a stovetop that reaches 15 psi.
