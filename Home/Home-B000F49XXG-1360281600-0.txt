review/summary: Fairly inexpensive Espresso Maker that Does a Good Job.review/text: For the money this is a good machine. It is a bit stiff to actually get the coffee holder attached, and it takes two scoops of espresso coffee to make one ounce of espresso. We tried with one scoop per latte and you could barely taste the coffee with the milk. You need a stainless frothing jug and it needs to be fairly short to get under the spout and do the job right when frothing milk. Make sure you get one that has a large enough handle so you don't burn your fingers, the pot gets hot.
