review/summary: Replaced mine for freereview/text: I had mine about 14 months, worked fine. Then it started acting up so I called customer service and the replaced it for free, no hassle except I have to mail back one of the pieces "to prove ownership " . I registered it when I bought it, not sure if that's why it was so easy.
