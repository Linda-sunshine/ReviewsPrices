review/summary: Not as good as expectedreview/text: I did careful research before purchasing this coffee maker, which was highly rated, but I am disappointed because it doesn't keep the coffee hot as long as I would expect for a thermal carafe. Also, the &#34;pause&#34; feature that is supposed to allow you to pour while it's still brewing, doesn't always work. The coffee comes out well, though.
