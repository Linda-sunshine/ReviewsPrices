review/summary: For the price why complain?review/text: Let's be honest, I'm not a chef. Hell, I hardly can cook. These make what little I attempt easier and work as well for my purposes as the $200 set my ex had. Sure they will rust if you're not careful with them, I just use them, wash them and dry them. Seems fine. If they ever wear out I'll just buy more.
