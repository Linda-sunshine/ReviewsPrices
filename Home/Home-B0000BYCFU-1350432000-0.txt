review/summary: Presto Pressure Cookerreview/text: The Presto 01781 23-quart pressure cooker is a solid product. I had no problems using it and found it easy to clean. I do think the instruction book could use some clarification as to when to use the pressure and not, I have seen clearer directions. However because I had previous experience with pressure cookers along with the internet, I was able to figure it out.
