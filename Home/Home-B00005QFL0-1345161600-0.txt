review/summary: This is Japanese bread \(^o^)/review/text: I have the first National bread machine from Japan. It works so good after I use over 25 years, it still working great. After I have my children, Japanese bread machine became too small to feed all of my family. So I made by Kitchen Aid Mixer, but I still want to have large size bread machine for long time. First, I order Zojirushi but no luck.Cuisinart, was not great. Oster, price is good but not great texture. Finally, I order Panasonic because I love National so the same company might work like what I want to. I made the first bread and I jumped!! YES, YES, this is it !! This is what I want to look for !! Bread is just like my hometown Japan. If you look for Japanese bread, this is the one just like home of Japan and Japanese bake shop !!!!
