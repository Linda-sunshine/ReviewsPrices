review/summary: Easy does itreview/text: I love this little kitchen helper. When you don't want to set up your big food processer this works great easy to use, easy to clean up,doesn't take up a lot of room and comes in so many colors. I liked mine so much I got one for my son. My daughter has one in silver mine is red and my son's is pink for his new daughter. It's great for cutting up thing small enough for the baby to eat. It's quick ,easy and a great price
