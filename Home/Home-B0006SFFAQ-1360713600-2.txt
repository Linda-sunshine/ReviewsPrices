review/summary: good coffee until unit caught fire in warm modereview/text: What else can I say, after 10 months of use, which was about one pot of coffee a day, the unit caught fire. Fortunately I was at home sitting nearby. I noticed that awful smell of plastic burning, then ran over and unplugged the unit that was smoking. If I was not in the room at the time I would have had a kitchen fire. The unit was not abused/misused. I cannot say if this represents just a rare defect, or an ongoing problem with quality control. My suggestion is that folks should always unplug the unit when not physically present in the room. The features on the unit are very nice. The quality of the coffee is good. Obviously I have to rate my unit a one star due to reliability.
