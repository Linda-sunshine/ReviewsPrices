review/summary: Awesome!review/text: This thing is sweeeet! Makes opening up bottles soooo ez! The wrapper cutter makes taking the wrapping off the top a sinch, and then the opener goes to work and you have the cork in your hand without thinking twice about it. If you don't intend on drinking all the wine in one sitting, make sure you have one of those wine savor rubber stoppers or something, becuase this thing WILL CHEW UP YOUR CORK. It drills all the way through so it will leak slowly in your rack. The wine cooler is pretty nice too, and adds a classy touch to your dinner parties.
