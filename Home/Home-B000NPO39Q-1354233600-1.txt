review/summary: Simplicity & elegance!review/text: My niece recently moved into her own place, and this Willow Tree Navity basic set was the perfect "housewarming" gift to help decorate her new place for the holidays! I've purchased several of the "family" figurines before for my mother, and knew what great quality workmanship - simple, yet so elegant! - goes into this brand. If she wishes, she can make additions to this basic nativity scene as the years pass, since there are other figures available. Willow Tree makes truly quality products!
