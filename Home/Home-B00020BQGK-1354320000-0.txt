review/summary: Hoover Flair S2220review/text: The price was right and delivery was prompt but&#8230;1 important part was missing. The 3&#8221; screw that anchors the top handle to the motor housing was missing. This is not an optional or easily substituted part. This was a used item and may have been returned for the reason I just mentioned. Fortunately I hoard old worn out vacuums. One of which is an old flair with a dead power nozzle. Problem solved. There is always the potential of a problem with used or returned items. However, I have purchased 5-6 flairs over the past decade. I feel it is the best utilitarian vacuum Hoover ever made.
