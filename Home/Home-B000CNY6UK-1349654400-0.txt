review/summary: Coffee a Go Goreview/text: You really cant be an authentic stovetop expresso maker. I have had a few of the 'cheaper' ones, and they have leaked, they wearnt solid, and importantly weren't stainless steel! This bad boy is great - sturdy, doesn't leak, strong and can take the demands of a man addicted to coffee.The 6 cup is a great size too - taking about 23grams of coffee (depending on your tamping preferences), the 6 cup makes 3 decent sized espressos, or if you are addicted to the devil juice it makes one good mug full.Recommend - it is a great price too. In stores you can expect to pay double or more (at least in New Zealand that is..)
