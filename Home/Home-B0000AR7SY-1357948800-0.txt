review/summary: Messy and Hard to Cleanreview/text: I was very disapponted in the grinder, especially after reading the many positive reviews.It was returned after three attempts to make it work satisfactorily.1. Grounds fall behind the receptacle and were difficult to remove. (Yes, the receptacle was in the proper place.)2. Timer has to be reset when attempting to grind 8 oz.. You have to wait until the timer counts down, even if all of the beans have been ground.3. Clogs easily and difficult and messy to unclog.
