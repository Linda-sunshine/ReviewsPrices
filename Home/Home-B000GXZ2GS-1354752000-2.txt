review/summary: A great gift for the coffee lover who has 'everything'.review/text: I have an earlier version of the AeroPress which I love and use for camping and even home use. I purchased this AeroPress for a friend who's husband is a coffee lover. He has expensive espresso makers and abhors Starbucks coffee. He's the type of guy who is hard to shop for because if he wants something he goes out and buys it. I was happy to come up with this idea for my friend because she was frustrated on what to get him for the holiday. It's nice to see that even though the AeroPress is widely praised they continue to improve it. Looks like the later versions are of a darker material so that over time it doesn't look 'stained'. If you're on the fence about the AeroPress I suggest you get it due to it's quality, convenience and novelty. If you're shopping for someone who camps and/or rides a motorcycle DEFINITELY get it as it's lightweight, small and produces coffee of such great taste and potency you'll be happy you did. A recommended item to purchase with it is a portable burr grinder.
