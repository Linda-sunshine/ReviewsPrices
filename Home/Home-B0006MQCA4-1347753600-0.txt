review/summary: Works great and holds a lot of water!review/text: Maybe the only thing that could be improved is that the handle doesn't feel super sturdy, like it might break off if I push on it too hard but I don't think that's very probable. Great product overall, very satisfied for someone like me who drinks a good amount of water daily
