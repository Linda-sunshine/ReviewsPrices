review/summary: I thought I would like itreview/text: The capacity of the tank is good and the humidifier looks good. However the mist doesnt shoot up above the spout. It beats the purpose of having a humidifier. My eyes are still soar and dry in the mornings. Added to that, It leaks and it spills water all over the place. The carpet becomes completely wet for 3x3ft around. If I had to walk over a soaked place every morning, its frustrating.
