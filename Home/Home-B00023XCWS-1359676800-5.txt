review/summary: Gr8 4 $ 4 50 weeks of use!review/text: We loved this kettle & never had taste problems as some newer reviews say. VERY fast, good size; much more convenient than microwave boiling! ( Or running thru coffee maker!) BUT wanted 2 post that tonight after heating 1 pot, then refilling for second, it died! I've done this almost daily for 50 weeks, besides other uses. (Brew a daily batch of tea). But for ~$1 a month....will probably replace w same. Just FYI.
