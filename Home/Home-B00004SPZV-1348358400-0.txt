review/summary: Great concept, poor execution!review/text: This is one of those irresistible ideas. Who wouldn't want to use their favorite oils in controlled amounts? I purchased this sprayer with great anticipation, and expecting performance. What a disappointment it turned out to be. The sprayer is a dribbler. I initially thought it was just a defective unit, and returned to Amazon, receiving the replacement in only a few days. The replacement worked for the first day, and on the second day it failed. If the manufacturer can fix the issue, I will definitely try again. Amazon informed me that if they make the item available again it will be because the issue has been fixed. I will keep an eye on the site, just in case. I would like for this product to deliver consistently the performance that I had during the first day.
