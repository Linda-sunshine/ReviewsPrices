review/summary: Great for my juicing needsreview/text: I've had this product for over a year. I don't juice a lot, but it's still running strong and doing what I ask of it. I did a bunch of research before buying this though, and I still believe this is the best juicer at this price point, and can beat or match other juicers at higher price points as well.
