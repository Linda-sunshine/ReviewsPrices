review/summary: Fool Proof and Fantastic!review/text: This is my first pressure canner and I'll admit I was a bit scared to use it. When the box arrived, And I pulled out the canner, was amazed at how substantial the walls were. This is a serious piece of metal! Looks like it will last into the next century.Last week, I made a batch of Ham and Bean soup and followed the canner instructions to the letter. Everything worked just as described and I had no problems. A few hours later, I had 7 quarts of canned soup ready to store (plus some extra for dinner).I especially like the fact that the All American uses a metal on metal seal instead of a gasket and has multiple safety features so I don't have to worry about an explosion. The weighted gauge is easy to use, as are the clamps that hold the lid on tight. Everything on this machine is made to last. I'm looking forward to many years of canning for my family.
