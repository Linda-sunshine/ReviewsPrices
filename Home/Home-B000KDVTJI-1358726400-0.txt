review/summary: Broken in less than 6 monthsreview/text: Loved the kettle and used it nearly every day, however suddenly water gushed out from the bottom and all over my counter top. Now I must go through the trouble to figure out how to have it replaced. In fact, I liked this kettle so much in the beginning, I purchased one for our office...which who knows if it will last much longer, too.
