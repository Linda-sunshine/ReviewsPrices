review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: It worked well for a few cans but is now popping out on just tuna cans, in spite of the great (pain-in-the-neck) "lock." I can't get a single can opened without slopping the insides all over the counter because the thing loses its grip over and over. Way, way overpriced. I could have bought a cheap electric which would last a whopping 3-5 months for $4 more than what I paid for this. It was supposed to be a back-up but sadly . . .
