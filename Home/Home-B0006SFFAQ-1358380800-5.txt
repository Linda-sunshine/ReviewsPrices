review/summary: Works Perfectlyreview/text: I bought this coffeemaker to replace a Cuisinart Grind and Brew I had owned for years. I opted not to get the grind and brew again due to the loud noise the grinder made and the grounds getting clogged in the trap.The carafe temperature feature is awesome if you like a hot cup of coffee - I keep mine on high. Also the 2-4 hour auto-off feature is nice if you prefer a coffeemaker that doesn't shut off after 2 hours. I found this unit easy to program and the brew complete cycle beep lets you know when your coffee is ready. If you can't wait for the cycle to complete, the brew pause feature lets you grab a cup before the whole pot is done. I use the gold tone filter and the charcoal water filters and have great coffee every time.The water reservoir is a little tricky to get used to, but I haven't had any issues with major spillage. Just keep a rag handy to clean up the minimal drippage. The only issue I have with the reservoir, is that you cannot see how much water you are putting in, so you have to measure using the carafe. Put the grounds in last to avoid spilling any water in them.This unit is taller than most (14-1/4"). I like the cord keeper that keeps the cord out of sight in the back of the unit. There is a 3-year warranty on this coffeemaker.
