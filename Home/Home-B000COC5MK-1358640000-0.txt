review/summary: Better than my battery powered one!review/text: I had an Oster wine opener that used AA batteries. I like it. Unfortunately, my favorite wine generally has ridiculously dense corks, so unless the AAs were fresh, it could be a struggle. This one handles them with ease. I like that it has a nice little storage space for the foil remover too.
