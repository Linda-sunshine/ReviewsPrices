review/summary: Heat retaining and as advertisedreview/text: This is exactly as advertised. It's heavy (but not too heavy since it's just a 9&#34; pan), retains heat perfectly and is pre-seasoned. I also got the hot pad handle which I think is mandatory (otherwise you might just reach out to move the hot pan and get burned).
