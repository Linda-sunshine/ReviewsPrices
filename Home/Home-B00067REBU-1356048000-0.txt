review/summary: First breadmaker I have ownedreview/text: This is the first one I have ever used and as far as I can tell it is a good buy. I have made several loaves and cinnamon rolls and all have turned out great. I have had better luck with recipes from allrecipes.com and some other cookbooks than i have with the cookbook that came with it but I am sure that those are just basic recipes. Easy to use and straight forward instructions.
