review/summary: The best sheets ever!review/text: Bought my first pair 3 years ago. Bought another pair this year ... just because (first pair are still just like new!). I've given them as a gift, too. Wonderful, soft, wear extremely well, love'em! If you enjoy snuggling into a warm and comfy bed on a cold night, you won't regret buying these sheets.
