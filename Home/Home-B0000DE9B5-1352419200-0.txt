review/summary: Perfect storage for vegetable juice.review/text: We recently began juicing both fruit and vegetables and needed something for storage/refrigeration that we could sterilize, that had an airtight seal and that we could "shake" before using. The Bormioli Roco Frigoverre Jug with Hermetic Lid, 39-ounce is the perfect size and delivers on its promises. It's exactly what we were looking for and is dishwasher safe as well. Highly recommend this product.
