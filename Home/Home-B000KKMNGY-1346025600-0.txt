review/summary: bad quality, but useable IF....review/text: --if you support the bottom with cans, or something to keep the back up.it's weak metal: bends by its own weight, sinks when items are places upon it...but it adds extra space to a shelf, and only if you can makeshift a leveler to rest the back so that it doesn't bend even more.
