review/summary: Solid but lackingreview/text: This is a decent immersion blender for the price, but its biggest drawback is that it has only one speed which limits its utility. I was disappointed in that, but it was my error in not checking before I purchased it. The chopper is more trouble than it's worth and I didn't actually keep it.
