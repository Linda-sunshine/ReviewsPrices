review/summary: Love Keurigreview/text: This machine was given to me as a Christmas present and has been well used and much appreciated. It was simple to set-up and program, super easy to clean, refill and no real maintenance has been required almost 8 months later. No cans of coffee or filters taking up space in my cabinets, no coffee stains to clean up off the counter or coffee pot to scrub down. It fits multiple size mugs and has a very conveniant programmable on/off feature. It is so easy to pop a cup in before I get in the shower and it's ready when I go to walk out the door. I am always finding free samples of different K-cups online and even always seem to find flavors on sale or clearance from Macy's to the Christmas Tree Store so I have not found that to be a huge expense. I highly recommend this product for low-volume coffee drinkers.
