review/summary: Must have kitchen gadgetreview/text: I have just retired my first salad shooter after 12 years of faithful service. I will be ordering another one with out hesitation. From slicing potatoes to shredding cheese, this thing does it all quickly. And simply put everything in the dishwasher, minus the motor and cleanup is a breeze.
