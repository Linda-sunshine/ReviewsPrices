review/summary: Incredible value and fantastic espresso!review/text: Bottom line - buy it and if your a beginner to espresso, order some espresso pods to make it easy for yourself. You can always buy a specialty grinder and learn the art of being a barista at a later time. I have owned three other espresso machines in my life, the cheap steam no-bar type and a couple of 15 bar pressure types. This is by far the best one I have owned. At this price, it pays for itself in a month and the espresso and lattes are as good as you can get at a coffee shop. I did call Delonghi's customer service about a broken piece and they sent a new one out right away. What are you waiting for....at this price and how it functions....it is a no brainer!
