review/summary: Conair SU7 Sound Therapy and Relaxation Clock Radioreview/text: every one of the sound tracks on this machine have annoying backround noise or short repeating tracks. this made it impossible for my husband and i to fall asleep. even the white noise has some sort of repeating background static or something - not a smooth steady &#34;white noise&#34; sound. sound might be ok for those who just want to wake with it, but not good to go sleep with. i returned this product after trying it for a week and received immediate reimbursement from Amazon. great doing business with Amazon - never any problem with returns!
