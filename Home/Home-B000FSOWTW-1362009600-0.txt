review/summary: Makes might night cap super easyreview/text: This makes it super easy to open any bottle of wine. It took a little getting used to, as the instructions don't really tell you that you do have to apply a minimal amount of pressure downwards on the bottle when opening. but once you figure that out, it takes NO EFFORT at all to open any bottle.The charging dock is a very nice touch. For this price, i would have expected just a cable, or heck a USB cable to recharge the thing. But having a nice steady cradle for the opening to call it's home is ideal, and was frankly unexpected and a welcome surprised. Even better, a foil wrapper cutter is included in the stand.For the price, you can not get a better solution to easily, open and handle your favorite chilled wines...highly recommended
