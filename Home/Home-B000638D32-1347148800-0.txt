review/summary: Good but a bit light for my tastereview/text: For around twenty dollars, you really can't get any better. The blade is sharp and strong enough, the handle has a decent grip. The knife is very generic looking, but that's what you get for the price. But the handle hasn't fallen apart or loosened any screws, like you get from those cheapo knifes. I use this every day for cooking, and after about three months it's going strong. However, if the day comes to when I upgrade, I would prefer something with a heavier feel like Henckels or Wusthof, and I like a wooden grip. But this is excellent for the money
