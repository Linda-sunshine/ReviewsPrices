review/summary: Most comfortable inflatable bedreview/text: I've owned several inflatable beds, and the Wenzel surpassed even the Aerobed for me. It is large, comfortable, strong and so easy to inflate/deflate. The pricing was terrific and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I used the bed when I moved into an unfurnished apartment and was waiting for my furniture to arrive. Now, it's a spare bed for unexpected guests.
