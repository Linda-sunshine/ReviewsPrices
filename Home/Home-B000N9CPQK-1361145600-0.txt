review/summary: Fantastic.review/text: I have been dealing with allergies and had just about lost my mine, not being able to sleep... because of nasal congestion. The first night I used this with the ionizer on .... I slept the whole night, my nasal congestion was minimal... so happy I have slept for a full night and matter of fact took a long nap, so great to be able to breathe , ionized clean air... as soon as my tax refund comes in, I will be buying a couple more.... The unit is just the right size for the bedroom and I want one in my computer room also. It was the best buy for me.... LOVE IT
