review/summary: Presto 23 quart canner cookerreview/text: Awesome deal, a true value for those that want to pressure can meats etc. A great value, hold 7 quart jars. The all american pressure canners are so expensive, this Presto is cheap enough you can buy two and still save over a well over hundred bucks if you were to buy their expensive product that holds 14 quarts or so.I highly suggest buying this pressure canner!!!!
