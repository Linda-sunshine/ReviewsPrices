review/summary: Great as a griddle too.review/text: We are more or less vegans, and don't cook pizza, but I cook dosai, and a good one is at least a foot across, so this gives me room to get the spatula under the edges.The downside of cast iron is how long it takes to heat up, but the heat stability is the upside of that coin. Lodge does a great job of choosing the correct thickness to fit between the horns of that dilemma.
