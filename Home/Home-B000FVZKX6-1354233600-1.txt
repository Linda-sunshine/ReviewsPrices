review/summary: Best sheets everreview/text: I'm not a bedding expert so I'll preface this with that...However I researched sheets a lot after throwing an old set out and found that the flannel cotton was the feel I was going for based on internet description.Searching Amazon came up with these sheets. I ordered two sets on faith initially and could not be more happy with the product. Everytime I get into bed I am amazed at how soft and thick yet not sweaty they are. I LOVE these.Its weird to think too because I'm a guy that was never much into or cared about housewares, bedding etc. Now that I have seen the light I will never go back to normal sheets.I ordered two more sets just because and have told all my friends and family- these are that good.
