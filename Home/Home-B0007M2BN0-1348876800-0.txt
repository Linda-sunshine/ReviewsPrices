review/summary: Easy make Hard Boiled Eggsreview/text: I always had troubling making hard boil eggs but the Mircrowave Egg Boiler takes all the guess work out of it for me. During the first couple uses I had to experiment with my cooking time. It seems like it take 10 minutes in my microwave for hard boiled eggs (directions call for 8-10) but I also make sure I use warm water to get the unit boiling a little quicker. Now my eggs are perfect everytime.
