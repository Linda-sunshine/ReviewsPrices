review/summary: Convenient, attractivereview/text: I'm pretty lazy and hate refilling brita or pur pitchers constantly, especially when a family is drinking the water (goes quick!). This 18 cup dispenser is easy to use, and holds alot of water. Enough for our family and our dog. Great product. Water tastes great.
