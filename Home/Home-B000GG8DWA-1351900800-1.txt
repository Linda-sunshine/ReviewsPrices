review/summary: I love this heater.review/text: I bought this space heater in January 2011 to heat my large, 120-year-old house. The 2010-2011 season was my first winter in my home, and between October-January my heating bills were astronomical. I'm the type of person who feels as though she is freezing if the temperature is below 70 degrees, so I was keeping the thermostats at 70 and layering my clothing. Even keeping the temperature below my desired range, our gas bill was $400 one month! I figured it may be smarter to get some space heaters and heat only the rooms we were occupying and keep the thermostat around 55-60 in the unused parts of the house. So I made my way to Amazon and browsed the inexpensive space heating options. I was looking to order two for under $50 each. The reviews on this one and another (the Sunpentown SPT SH-1507 Mini-Tower Ceramic Heater) looked good so I bought them. The Sunpentown was good while it lasted, but it wasn't as warm and after a few months of use (I'm guessing) the heating mechanism bit it and it no longer worked.This Optimus heater is amazing. Close the doors in a small-medium room and it will warm it up significantly on its lowest setting (which is 400 watts). This is great for my cozy entertainment room, bedrooms, and I even bring it into the bathroom with me so that the room is comfortable when I get out of the bath or shower. The higher setting (800w) isn't used often by me, but I occasionally use it when I have company and am entertaining in my larger, more open rooms.I have children and pets, so it's great that it turns off if it's knocked over.Overall, a great buy. At under $30, you cannot go wrong with this. I'm actually going to be buying a couple more of these soon: one for two more bedrooms, and one to keep permanently in the bathroom.
