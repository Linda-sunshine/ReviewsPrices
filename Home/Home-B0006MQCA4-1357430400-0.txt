review/summary: Great pitcher design, horrible filter design.review/text: I have been using this pitcher for less than one month (including a week when I was out of town for the holidays), but the filter has already stopped working. I've read on some other threads that this seems to be a common problem. The filters are expected to last 40 gallons or around 2 months, and with just my roommate and I drinking the water I know we haven't hit 40 gallons and we certainly haven't hit 2 months.I'm very disappointed because I love the slim design of the dispenser for my fridge, and it holds a lot of water, but the filter lasting under a month is a huge rip-off. I will try purchasing replacement filters elsewhere in the hopes of getting a different batch.
