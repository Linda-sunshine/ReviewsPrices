review/summary: This Is A Real Vacuum Not Just A Toyreview/text: I was not prepared for the power of this vacuum. I bought it to vacuum my cars and it is very good. I was expecting a hand unit but got a real vacuum cleaner in miniature size - honestly just what I was looking for. I can not attest for the durability but after a few uses it working fine. There is also a hose and crevasse tool included so an extra tool kit is most likely not required.This is a good one - give it a try.
