review/summary: Liquid does not come out, brush broke on first day.review/text: I purchased this product and assembled according to the instructions.The liquid does not come out of the bottom like it should.The heater does work to dry the floor, all I was left with was a heated carpet.The brush broke on the first day of use.It's currently been in the vacuum repair shop for a WEEKS because returning the item would be a hassle with such a large item but instead, having to wait weeks to have them repair the item.I should have just returned it...
