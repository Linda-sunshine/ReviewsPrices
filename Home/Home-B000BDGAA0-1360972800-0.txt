review/summary: Firm = HARDreview/text: I prefer firm pillows so I thought this would be a good choice. This goes beyond firm to just plain hard. I took off the cover and that improved it slightly, but still to hard for me. Have actually found it to be a better lumbar support when sitting on a couch that is a bit too deep for me.
