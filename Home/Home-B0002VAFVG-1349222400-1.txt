review/summary: Amazingreview/text: Owned a Jack Lalane juicer before this one. Juicer was o.k. 3,600 RPM.This Breville blows that one away. Construction is awesome. Take apart and put together is very fast. Cleanup is fast. Eats fruits and vegetables in a fraction of the time my other juicer did.Everything about this Breville is way better than the other juicer I had.I am very happy with this product. Well worth the money.
