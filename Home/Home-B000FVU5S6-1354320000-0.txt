review/summary: Itchy scratchy show!review/text: Oh my god these sheets are awful. I expected them to be rough to begin with... I soaked them for 24 hours in the wash... they softened up a bit i guess... but not much. I repeated this process 4 times. They are better, but still not the soft lavishness I expected from some of these reviews... The purple was definitely much softer than the tan. I'd recommend, sadly, walmart or targets 400 thread count sheets over these...
