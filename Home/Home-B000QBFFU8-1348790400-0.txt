review/summary: Stopped working after 3 months :-(review/text: I bought this in June 2012. Today, 3 months later, while juicing some melon, the motor stopped spinning. I turned the power off and on again but, the screen lit up without any speed number and the motor won't spin.I suspect that the melon which has a tougher out "layer" (not the peel/skin) killed the motor at the soft fruit speed. I wish the manual had said, only very soft fruits instead of saying to juice melons at speed 1. So be careful, if you juice melons and it has a tougher outer edge, set the speed to at least 3. Never ever use speed 1.
