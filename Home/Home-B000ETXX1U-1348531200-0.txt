review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I bought this product based on the good reviews it had but was really disappointed as the product failed to perform from the time I got it out of the box and set it up. It was leaking air continuously. At one point, it deflated on its own by about 30%. In addition, the smell of the plastic was overwhelming. I was really disappointed and thank goodness Amazon was willing to refund me 100%!
