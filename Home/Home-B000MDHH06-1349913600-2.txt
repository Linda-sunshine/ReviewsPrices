review/summary: Best appliance I ever purchasedreview/text: I wanted to start juicing, but didn't want to buy a really expensive unit until I knew this was something I would want to continue. This Breville couldn't have been a better choice! I've had it almost 2 months now and use it almost every morning. Clean up is easy with just 3 pieces and the plunger. It is a bit loud, but nothing you can't get used to because it's quite fast. I go through quite a bit of produce but have subscribed to a local farm delivery service every other week as well as using the big bags of spinach and carrots from Costco. I've lost 8 pounds, not really trying to diet, but probably with all the extra fruits and veggies have just cleaned out the pipes! I feel great, have more energy, and skin and hair even feel more healthy too. It's worth getting into the routine every morning, so go for it! You'll be happy you bought this machine.
