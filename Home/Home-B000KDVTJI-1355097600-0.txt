review/summary: Worked well for 16 months, then broke.review/text: I drink a lot of tea, multiple cups per day, typically using a kettle on the stove to heat the water. In the summer of 2011, during a huge kitchen renovation, I needed an alternate method to heat my water. I purchased this, and it worked beautifully until October of 2012 (16 months), when the lever that is pushed down to start the water heating stopped coming up on its own. In other words, once the water was started heating, it was anyone's guess when it would turn off. Sometimes it boiled for a few minutes. Sometimes it shut off when all the water boiled away. As you can imagine, this is really, really dangerous.I use it now only under strict supervision, but it's a bummer to have to remember all the time, as I'm easily distracted. I'm the type of person who only purchases kettles with whistles or I might leave the kettle boiling on the stove for who knows how long. So, this kettle has essentially become the same thing--darn near useless.I came online tonight to buy a different water kettle, but I thought I'd review here so that others can benefit. It wasn't cheap for what it does--heats water--and it broke quickly. I would not repurchase.
