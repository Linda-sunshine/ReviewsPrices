review/summary: Perfect for a singlereview/text: This is the perfect coffee maker for a single person. It brews 15 ounces in less than 2 minutes and comes with a nifty thermos-type cup with a sip lid. I put the plastic filter aside and use No. 1 Melita filters which fit like a glove, so there are no messy wet grounds to deal with. It makes a cup of coffee just about as quickly as the $100 single cup makers and I am saving money by buying ground coffee in a bag rather than those expensive single cup packages.
