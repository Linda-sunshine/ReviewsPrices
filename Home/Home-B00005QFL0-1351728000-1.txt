review/summary: Maybe I got a lemon ...review/text: I read many reviews of bread machines, and decided on the Panasonic because so many people bought one, I think more units of this than any other. Well, I read the instruction book, selected a recipe, and started the process. The first stage is a Rest, where the ingredients are gently warmed. That went fine. The next step is Kneading, and that went fine, the dough looked good. After that, the machine bakes it, but mine did not get hot, so no baking. I tried again, but the machine just quit the first time, no heating. Well, that was both a surprise and a disappointment, but I took the dough out and baked it separately. I thought the recipe was very good, I used a 7 Grain flour mix, but the machine had to be returned. I don't feel too enthusiastic about ordering another one, I really didn't expect anything like this to happen.
