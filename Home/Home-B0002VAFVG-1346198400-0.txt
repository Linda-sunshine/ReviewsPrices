review/summary: The mother of all juicersreview/text: If you are looking for the mother of all juicers, then look no further. Solid full-metal construction, and a powerful motor will turn even the toughest veggies into delicious juice. Heck last night I juiced parsley, beets and a potato and the juicer had no trouble at all. Sure the price may be a little steep but this is the last juicer you will ever buy, EVER! 67
