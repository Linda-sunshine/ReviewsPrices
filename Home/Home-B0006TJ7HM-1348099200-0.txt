review/summary: RUSTY, Ginsu knives ??? really - I think they are knock offs.review/text: I purchsed these knives when I moved into my new place, so excited about them and after one wash they are rusty! Not kidding they have rust spots. Just to clarify I have washed by hand and dried, I have washed in the dishwasher and let airdry, still rusty.I honestly think they are knockoffs. I feel ripped off and lesson learned I will NEVER buy from this seller again.
