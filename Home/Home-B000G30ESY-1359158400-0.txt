review/summary: Where have you been all of my life?review/text: Since living in Hawaii in the 1990's, I've always considered a rice cooker to be a required appliance in my kitchen. My old Aroma served me well until I started cooking exclusively with brown/whole grained rice. I grew tired of having to throw out the bottom &#34;crackly&#34; layer of rice whenever I cooked whole grain, and found this gem! I love the timer, which allows me to have my brown rice perfectly cooked by the time I arrive home from work, and I love the size, which is perfect for a 1-4 person household. I haven't yet tried the &#34;porridge&#34; feature to cook my steel-cut oats, but I am optimistic, having read other reviews. Well worth the money!
