review/summary: Great upgradereview/text: I'd heard about burr grinders for quite some time. I've had a number of cheap blade grinders that produced extremely inconsistent grounds, and with the addition of a used espresso machine in my kitchen, it would be almost impossible to get the right grind every time.This little machine is wonderful, and so much quieter than blade grinders of yesteryear. Just find a setting that works for you, and leave it there. The timer means you can grind completely hands-off as you're preparing the rest of your morning's coffee drill!
