review/summary: Great little dehumidifierreview/text: I had a closet in my bathroom in one apartment (classic New Orleans construction) so a dehumidifier was essential to keep my clothes from growing moldy. This little machine works like a charm! Sucks a shocking amount of moisture out of the air. So far, so good, had it for several months and still going strong.
