review/summary: Not So Muchreview/text: I received this pan as a gift and was impressed by the Cuisinart name. They have engineered this pan down to the thinnest possible use of metal. While the flat bottom is a tri-layer of stainless with aluminum core, the sides are thin, single ply with little heat conductivity. The instructions caution against the use of a flame above medium except for boiling water; but the pan will not sear and caramelize food quickly at these temperatures. So it isn't a wok experience. As for boiling water, it is not efficient for boiling water unless in small quantities. The lid is heavier than the pan; I can hang the pan on a hook; but in my kitchen, am at a loss for a good place to store the 14" lid conveniently. Don't buy because you can't go wrong at this price; you can. (10 years professional experience in culinary)
