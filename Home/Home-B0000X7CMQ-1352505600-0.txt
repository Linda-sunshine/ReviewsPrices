review/summary: Perfect Coffee Makerreview/text: I bought this coffee maker to replace one I had used daily at least once for almost SIX YEARS! Incredible longevity and reliable coffee maker. I also like the stainless steel pot - it won't break like the glass carafes do. After the brew cycle is finished, the maker shuts down and the steel pot keeps coffee hot. You'll love it too.
