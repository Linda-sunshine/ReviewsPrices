review/summary: Nice affordable little coffee makerreview/text: I ordered this coffee maker because me and my wife wanted to switch from instant coffee to ground, but didn't need big 8-10-12-cups models for us two, and didn't want to pay $50-100 for just something fancy to brew couple of cups of coffee in the morning. This device is very compact, it takes just a little more space on the counter than electric tea kettle (I appreciate it living in a very small apartment), power cord is pretty short though, but it was enough for me. I bought some pack of 200 universal paper filters for 4-6 cups coffee makers for under $2 in Target, and they fit perfectly, so for under $4 I can have paper filters for a whole year! This coffee maker is very easy to operate, you can see water level from both sides, putting in filter and coffee takes a seconds, and cleaning after is also very easy - you just have to rinse filter basket and carafe, no stains of coffee around or inside. This model has delay brewing setting, but I don't know why I would use it - brewing whole 4-cups pot takes just about 5-6 minutes, it's not a time I would be uncomfortable to wait without coffee. Pause-n-serve works fine, no spills. Coffee tastes good, warmer plate is very hot and keeps coffee in a good temperature for an hour. Only one thing to pay attention - in this coffee maker "1 cup" is only 5 fl. oz (150 ml). Usually "1 coffee cup" means 6 oz., but this manufacturer decided to make it smaller, so maximum amount of coffee you can get out at once is a little under 20 oz. It's enough for 2 people to have coffee if they don't need oversized cups, but if you need coffee for 3 or more people, this model may be too small. Overall, it seems like this coffee maker worths twenty dollars I paid for it. Not something fancy where you can choose coffee strenght or set up shut-off timer, but it makes coffee for 2 people fast and easy.
