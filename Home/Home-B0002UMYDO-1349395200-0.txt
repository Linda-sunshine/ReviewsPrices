review/summary: A better can openerreview/text: The can opener arrived very quickly, packaged well, new. Works well, even has a bottle opener and knife sharpener on the back. I got this one to replace a more expensive Cuisinart [SCO-60]can opener that had a plastic drive piece on the blade assembly that broke and I could not find replacement parts of any kind for that. It always was tricky/jittery to use. This one appears to be much better quality, I don't see any plastic parts on it.
