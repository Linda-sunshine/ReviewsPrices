review/summary: Honeywell HCM-6009 Humidifierreview/text: When we found that we needed to keep our Arizona home above 50% humid, I did some research on line to find the best product. The Honeywell HCM-6009 seemed to be the best fit within our price range so we ordered a unit from Amazon.The day it arrived I unpacked it, filled it and plugged it in. It has been constantly in service since that time. Within a few hours at the beginning it got our house above the 50% humidity mark and I had to back it down a little until the right humidity stabilized. It is a very quiet unit and has a good water supply when both tanks are filled. It generally lasts over 24 hours before a refill is needed.I am very satisfied with the quality and efficiency of this humidifier.Roger Hart
