review/summary: Defectivereview/text: This product worked great for a week or so, then the sensor completely failed. Tried some of the suggestions written by other reviewers with the same problem, but nothing I tried got the sensor to work again. The open and close buttons still worked, but this is a touchless trash can. I really did like it for the week it worked, and probably would give it 4 or 5 stars like many other reviewers if it was still working. However, this is not an inexpensive trash can, and for it to fail so quickly for the main feature I purchased it for, I give it the lowest rating. I sent it back and appreciate Amazon's great return policy. I debated whether or not to order another one as I already had purchased four new D batteries, but didn't feel confident enough that I wouldn't end up with another defective product.
