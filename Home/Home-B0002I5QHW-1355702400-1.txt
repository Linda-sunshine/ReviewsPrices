review/summary: Works well for filling sausage casingsreview/text: Bought the Norpro Meat Grinder primarily for making sausage. I was encouraged by previous reviews plus the additional options for use. It works great for filling sausage casings. Only have had it for 3 days so I don't know about other uses. My only difficulty was lacking personal strength to turn knob to lock grinder in place on counter. Luckily my son came and he did it. It will be a good strength trainer for me as I definitely will make sausage more often.
