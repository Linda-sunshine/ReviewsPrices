review/summary: Breville Compact Juicer - Love It!review/text: I have had my Breville Compact Juicer for three weeks now and totally love it. I juice 10 lbs of carrots at a time; it has plenty of power and has no problem keeping up. The screen could be a little difficult to clean if you don't clean it as soon as you're finished. I couldn't be happier with my purchase and would highly recommend.
