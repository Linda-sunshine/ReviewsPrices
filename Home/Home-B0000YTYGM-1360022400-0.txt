review/summary: It works fine for me... and its darned good coffeereview/text: I was no fan of my old (10 years) coffee maker, but it worked and I also knew that they pretty well all leave something to be desired. Who knew that building a better coffee maker was so tough?I rated it at 5 stars because it has what we wanted and after nearly 2 months its working great for us.I was concerned about the lid issues, but like some others I figured, "how hard could it be?" Maybe we just got lucky, but I can see how you could put the lid on wrong and not notice. I can't say for sure that would cause a spill, but who has the time to test it and then have to clean up if it did. There seems to be 2 ways to remedy the lid situation. Either look closely at the raised lettering on the lid and line it up properly before screwing it on, OR just reverse thread it (put the lid on and turn counter clockwise) until it seems to fall in square and then screw the cap tight. I prefer the latter, but either way the lid has NOT been a issue with ours.Beyond that, it really does keep hot HOT for a long time. We have also found it just brews quite hot and was very glad that I didn't follow the directions (I know, I can't even believe that I read them either, but I did) and pre heat the carafe prior to brewing. It was plenty hot enough!Finally, although I read about the height concerns, and measured twice; I did not realize that the opened reservoir lid was so tall. The machine stands 23.25" with the lid open. We had to juggle a few things on the counter to find a space that was unencumbered by an upper cabinet. Overall we're quite happy so far.
