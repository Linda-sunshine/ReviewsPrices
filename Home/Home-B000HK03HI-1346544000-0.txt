review/summary: Fabulous - LOVE ITreview/text: This is the best (translate, easiest) can opener I've ever used. Grips and starts so smoothly, opens with almost no effort, then you just push the lever to release the can. And that's saying a lot because I have tried one after another can opener for several years. My husband uses one I used to use, then I started having problems with it. He thought it was me. I started buying new can openers every time I found a different brand and none of them worked. It wasn't an arthritis problem. Although I'm not the strongest person in the world, I do exercise. It was weird. They just wouldn't grip the can or if they did, they slipped while cutting. Finally I bought a really inexpensive electric can opener that worked very well. Then I bought a new product in a different kind of can (unbeknownst to me), and I couldn't open it! So I bought this and, no problems at all. Very happy! Wish I could give it more than 5 stars.
