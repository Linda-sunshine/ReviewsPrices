review/summary: Does not last long with daily home usereview/text: Length:: 0:20 MinsDidn't last long for a device as simple as a coffee maker. I have repaired it twice - once to clean out a clogged valve and once to try to fix the switch which is the problem shown in this video. I have had a Cuisinart food processor for over 20 years and it still works great. I got the Cuisinart coffee maker after my last one died thinking Cuisinart knows how to design a product that gets used daily. Turns our I was wrong.
