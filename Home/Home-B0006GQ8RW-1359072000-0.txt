review/summary: Brita Waterreview/text: Not that I wasn't happy-I just decided I have been having Alhambra Springs deliver to me and it really is not that much money. It is just more convenient. I realized I am lazy :) did not want to deal with spending the money on the filters, changing them, ordering them. I realize this is not a big deal, but this was an afterthought... Thank you though-everything came well packaged. Maybe at a later date...
