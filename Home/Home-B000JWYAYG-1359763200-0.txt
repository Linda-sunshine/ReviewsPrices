review/summary: Love these sheetsreview/text: What's to love about a set of sheets? The way they feel against your skin of course, and these sheets are REALLY nice! The perfect weight, not too thin, not too heavy. Since they are cotton, I expected them to wrinkle and that's ok, I can't feel the wrinkles. I have a regular mattress and a 3&#34; memory foam topper on top of that. Then I have a quilted mattress pad on top of that. This fitted sheet fits perfectly over all of it with no problem. It's actually a perfect fit! I am very satisfied. And there is just something wonderful about the plain white sheets. They look so clean and cool. I highly recommend these sheets, in any color.
