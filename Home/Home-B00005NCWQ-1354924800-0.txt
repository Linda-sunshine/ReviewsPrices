review/summary: Very Good Coffee Potreview/text: This was an excellent purchase at a good price. It's a simple device, so there's not much to say other than it works well, looks great, and seems robust enough to last a long time. I initially feared that the modest purchase price would result in a flimsy product that would esily dint or discolour, but that hasn't been the case.Regards, Mark
