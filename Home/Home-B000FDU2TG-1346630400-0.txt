review/summary: Best blender for the moneyreview/text: I bought this blender to replace a Cuisinart that I had for years. My Cuisinart was purchase about 3 years ago and maybe used twice, until a few weeks ago when I started making breakfast smoothies everyday. It took me over 5 mins of blending to get everything blended and the ice chopped and then all of a sudden it didn't work. The computer board had fried. I knew I would not buy another Cuisinart after this, since this was maybe the 15th time it had been used. I did some research online, not having a large budget I wanted to get the best product for my money. From what I found it was the KitchenAid KSB560MC. I have used it about 5 times now and am so very happy with this product. I put in my fruit, nuts, oatmeal, yogurt, and ice and in about 90 seconds I have a completely liquefied smoothie! I'm actually glad my old one bit the dust because now I have one that actually works the way you would expect a blender to work. I HIGHLY recommend this product!
