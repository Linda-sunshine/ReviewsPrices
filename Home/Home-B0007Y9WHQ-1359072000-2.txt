review/summary: Very usefulreview/text: I just purchased this item and couldn't be happier with it. It's very easy to use, easy to clean as the crank piece slides off, uses no electric energy and I love that the other two blades are stored in the base. I have no complaints and can't wait to give this as gifts to my family members.
