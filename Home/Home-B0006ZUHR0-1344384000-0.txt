review/summary: Circuit board will die after a few yearsreview/text: Mr. Colombo here. Iron is great while it works. I've owned two over the past several years. However at some point the circuit board will die and you'll have to get a new one. Another reviewer said that their iron emitted a long beep then started to smell like it was burning. Mine did the same exact thing. I'm off to try another brand to see if it lasts longer than a couple of years.
