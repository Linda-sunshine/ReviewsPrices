review/summary: Great juicerreview/text: I've been using my Breville juicer for about a week now and really like it. It's not the most expensive, but a middle of the road version. Well built and not a problemwith any kind of leaking of the juice of the pulp. I just wish it had a better guide as to which speed to use for which fruits and veggies. It has a small basic guide and it lists cabbage, but so many juices these days call for kale and spinach but I'm not sure whis speed to use to get the most juice out of it...you just need to experiment a bit starting out on the side of caution. Everything cleans up well if you don't let it dry on the parts.
