review/summary: My favorite thing!review/text: I've owned this for at least 8 years and it still works amazing. Recently, I made all my infant's baby food in it. Pureed everything I put in it. Then when a little older, I just put whatever I made for dinner in here and diced it all up. By far my favorite small appliance in the kitchen.
