review/summary: Too Lightweight - Grippy Handle, Thoughreview/text: Personally, a knife is all about feel for me. With a plastic handle and thin spine, it was obvious this one would be light - too light, in fact, for me. The blade flexes a little, but I assume that would not be a problem for anyone. The one thing that impressed was the texture of the handle, which is superior to a smooth plastic/composite or polished wood surface for keeping a grip if the going gets greasy.While sharpening the blade with a honing steel, I noticed several rough spots on the edge after a short time of use, though a smooth edge did return after a few strokes on the steel.
