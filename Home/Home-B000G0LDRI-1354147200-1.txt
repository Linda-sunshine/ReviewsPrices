review/summary: Great humidifier. Fragile Tank.review/text: Received this item a couple weeks ago. Live in a very dry climate (Denver, Colorado). This humidifier adds a fair amount of moisture to my entire 1.5 bedroom apartment. Outside it is be 20% humidity and inside my apartment it is 50% humidity. This increase is common in my apartment, the unit performs well. It only makes bothersome noise when the tanks are empty. I discovered that due to lack of water weight they vibrate against the plastic of the unit while the fan is running. This is easily remedied by adding more water (or as I did, placing small felt pads or bubble wrap between tanks and unit).The only issue I've had is refilling the tanks can be a bit cumbersome in the bathtub and the tanks themselves are fragile. I dropped one while nearly full and the plastic piece broke off on the bathtub floor. Apparently this is common with these tanks. Must be very careful not to drop. Plastic is breakable. I was upset about this, thinking I'd have to try to repair it or spend money on a new tank or even a new humidifier. However, I called the company involved with the warranty (800 554 4558) and they sent out a new tank immediately. Very satisfied with the customer service.
