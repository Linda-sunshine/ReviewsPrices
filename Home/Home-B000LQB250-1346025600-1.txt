review/summary: Not As Expectedreview/text: I have purchased memory foam toppers before, with great experience. I needed new one and thought this product would be just as good, if not better, based on the stellar reviews. Wrong.It doesn't feel like memory foam, provides very little support, and feels uncomfortably warm. The ventilation hole design is such a gimmick.Do yourself a favor and get a quality topper with higher density instead.
