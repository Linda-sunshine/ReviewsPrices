review/summary: Eureka Mitey Mite Cannister Vac.review/text: This item replaces another Mitey Mite which we had had for many years and was still working, but starting to have some problems. The new unit works very well and we look forward to having it as long as the previous unit. I rated it with four stars primarily because it seems louder than the other one, and also because I would prefer separate dust and upholstery brushes. There also seems to be nothing in the manual to explain which is the bare floor setting and which the carpet setting on the large attachment. Other than that, we are very pleased with the performance.
