review/summary: Messy juicingreview/text: Not a frequent user, mostly for hard fruits/ vegetables. Plastic parts are wearing very quickly, well I guess that's what you're paying for. The main issue is flying particles off the fruit receptacle during juicing- IMO due to an engineering flaw. Constantly trying to cover with palm while inserting new portion but to no avail- the motor launches it up. Leaves the surrounding area covered with debris, oftentimes even on the ceiling. Buy a lot's of cleaning solutions with this juicer.
