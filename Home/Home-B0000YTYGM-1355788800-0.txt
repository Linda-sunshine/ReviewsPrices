review/summary: Lid takes practice but I can do it w one eye openreview/text: This coffee pot rocks. You can see the water level very well on the outside, it takes different filters than normal pots but its worth it, keeps coffee warm, easy to clean & buttons are straight forward. We love the brand too, been using them for years.
