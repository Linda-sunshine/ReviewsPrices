review/summary: Junk, barely worked for 6 monthreview/text: Nice made from outside, extremely cheap plastic connector between the actual unit and attachments which crashed after 6 month. Now I have another dead cuisinart "product" in my collection so don't waist your money on it and if you do, prepare to pay for shipping for of item to cuisinart and back. This is how their "warranty" works.
