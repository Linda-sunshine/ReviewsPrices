review/summary: Larger than the animal humidifier but still greatreview/text: I also own the green frog and to me, this plastic seems a bit thinner and perhaps slightly flimsy in comparison. It's also bigger than the frog in that it's wider (although more shallow so it can sit on a thinner ledge). The frog has a round base whereas this one is oval shaped. The flower control knob has a button in the center that turns on a lavender colored light inside the base which lights up the pink area where the water is held. A simple touch of the button turns the light on and off. I plan on using it as a night light once my little one is older.I've used the frog for 2 years without any breaks or complications and am hoping this one will last just as long.Easy to clean, no fancy filters or complicated parts. I use alkaline water (9.5pH) made with my Kangen machine to ensure that only the best water is being pumped into my child's room. I clean it with (2.5pH) acid water but vinegar can also be used according to the manufacturer.Great humidifier!
