review/summary: Good Pressure Canner AND Cookerreview/text: I got this canner after having wanted one for a few years. I mostly use it to can homemade chicken broth/stock. It is VERY easy to use. I am familiar with pressure canning from watching my mom do it as a child, with all the jiggling and loud noises. I was looking for something that did not involve any of that! The guage is easy to read, and it's a fairly simple process to use it. This pot is ENORMOUS. It's hard to rangle it over the sink to clean it, and it needs a lot of space to store. So keep that in mind. I have used it equally as a pressure cooker, and have had great results with cooking various kinds of meats. Since it's so big, you can fit 3 big chickens in at once!
