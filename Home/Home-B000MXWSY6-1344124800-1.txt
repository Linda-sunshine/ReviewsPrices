review/summary: Great alarm clockreview/text: Bought this for hubby - I have the older model but it works the same. Working the same was the key to the purchase... So I would know how to fix it when he messed it up or forgot to set it. Love the turn off feature....turns off the alarm ring but not the alarm itself..meaning you do not have to set/turn on each night.
