review/summary: Design was changed, so now they only last a month regardless of usereview/text: I've bought replacement filters for years. They were able to work for quite some time, which is good because I don't use a lot of filtered water.The new ones, as many other people have found, now stop flowing after a month. This seems to happen regardless of how much you actually use them, in my experience.I bet the company would say "we're just ensuring that you have properly filtered water." really?I imagine someone with a spreadsheet figured this would be good for sales, to have the filters stop flowing after a monnth. I'm going to find another solution from a different company. Goodbye Pur.
