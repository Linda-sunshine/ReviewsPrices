review/summary: Loved everything but the handlereview/text: Victorinox knows how to make steel products. They are famous for their swiss army knives and this knife is also very well made. It is sharp when it arrived and it does its job very well.My one area of concern is that the handle isn't made to the quality I expected. It's made out of a plastic like material and for me, it was too light. The balance is the most important thing to me. A fully tanged blade would be better balanced and if they could somehow make the handle heavier, it would be great.
