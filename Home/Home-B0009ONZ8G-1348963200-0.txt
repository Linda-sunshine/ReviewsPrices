review/summary: What a "sucker"!review/text: This product really cleans up. I have used the carpet nozzle on my very good cannister for several years. It did a good job but several things needed to be replaced and that would have been costly. While lying on the carpet, I noticed bits and pieces that shouldn't have been there after vacuuming. I researched vacuums and this Tempo was highly rated by several sources (including Consumer Reports). I was a bit dubious that such an inexpensive machine could be as good as it's PR but thought it was worth a try. The suction is so strong, it actually leaves vacuum marks in my Berber carpet. I use an extraction shampooer regularly. The solution it picks up is less mucky than it was when I used my previous vacuum. The Tempo is pretty noisy but it more than makes up for that with it's cleaning power.
