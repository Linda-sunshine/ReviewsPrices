review/summary: Works well with my De'Longhi EC155review/text: Looked for a solid tamper, to use with the De'Longhi EC155. After reading some other reviews, which were not to decisive, with regards to its compliance with the specific machine, I decided to order and give it a try. Figured that for this price, and the fact that I can always decide to return if it does not work well enough, the risk was not that big.I am happy yo report that it works just fine. Not fancy or expensive, but does the job. That's the important thing. Right?
