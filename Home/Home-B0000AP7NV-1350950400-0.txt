review/summary: horrible lid designreview/text: I read some reviews about the poor lid design, but I was in a hurry to get a replacement pitcher. So I went ahead and bought it anyway. OMG it is horrible. Don't try to use pitcher if there is still water in the top container, because the water will pop the lid off, and you will get a big puddle every time.
