review/summary: Totally worth itreview/text: This sealer is a great product, it works, inexpensive, and pays for itself in no time by preserving foods for longer. Some of the items in our kitchen go bad specially when it rains because of the moisture. This sealer creates a nice vacuum seal and makes them last a lot longer.
