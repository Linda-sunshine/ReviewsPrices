review/summary: Worth the extra $50 over the JE98XLreview/text: I'm a nubie to juicing so take that into account while reading this! I used the JE98XL at a friend's place and it was great and inspired me to get a juicer. I ordered the next model up to get the stainless exterior, mainly. I'm happy I did. The SS exterior is indeed "stylish" as described by the mfgr, haha. More importantly, the swing arm "clamp" that holds the juicing compartment in place is much easier to use with one hand than the other model. Its more substantial and the machine doesn't tip over when you use one hand to release the clamp. This is important, as you end up cleaning this thing every time you juice to insure that pulp doesn't dry on the cutting blade/strainer and other parts. This model is also abit heavier (due to more robust parts), which is a benefit when removing the pulp container: the unit just stays in place while you do it. The lesser model is lighter so it moves abit. Most of these are modest improvements, but if you end up using the juicer alot, it saves aggravation when performing the fairly labor intensive task of juicing.
