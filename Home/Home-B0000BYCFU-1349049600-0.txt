review/summary: Presto 23 Quart cannerreview/text: This is the first time using a pressure canner, but so far this one has worked fine. I had trouble once with a loud whistle noise when reaching 10 lbs. pressure, but discovered the pressure button wasn't all the way up. I had to pull it up and the whistle was gone. Nice size for quart jars and pint size too.
