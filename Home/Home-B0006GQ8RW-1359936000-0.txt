review/summary: Great price for these filtersreview/text: We use a Brita pitcher for both home and office, and needed some replacement filters. In-store prices are substantially higher, so finding them on Amazon was a great deal. We have had some minor trouble in getting these to fit properly into the pitchers...having to force them in place for a proper seal. If not forced into place, weater bypasses the filter, taking good bits of charcoal with it. However, once we discovered that and wedged the filter with additional force, it worked perfectly.
