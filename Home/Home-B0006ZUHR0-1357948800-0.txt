review/summary: Piece of junkreview/text: I bought this iron to replace a Rowenta whose dial never seemed to work right, so based on all of the good reviews I chose Black and Decker. First things I didn't like: the clumsy water fill cover and tiny filler cup. It was also very difficult to see what the water level in the iron was because of the dark color of the tank.While using the iron the auto turn-off feature would beep even though I was in the process of ironing something (the iron was horizontal and not vertical). This wouldn't happen each time I used it but often enough to be irritating (once out of every three times I used it).After about a year of minimal use the digital display window no longer lit up so it was difficult to see what setting I had chosen.After a year and a half the iron flat out quit with an error saying that I had to replace it. So I did...with a Rowenta.
