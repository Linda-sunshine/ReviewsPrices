review/summary: Great waffle makerreview/text: I bought this after reading all the reviews. It is a great waffle maker and if you spray it with baking spray before you make your first waffle each time you are making waffles then you don't have to worry about waffles sticking to the waffle plate. The plates aren't removable for cleaning but the waffles never stick to the plate so all you need to do is wipe it down good and you will be ok. I haven't had it that long but I will update again after I had it for some years to let you know how it is holding up.
