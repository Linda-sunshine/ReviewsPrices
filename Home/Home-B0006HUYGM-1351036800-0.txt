review/summary: Worthlessreview/text: This vacuum was worthless after two months of use. It still turns on and provides a small amount of suction, but not enough to accomplish anything. It overheats and turns off after about 5 minutes. Of course, it lasted just long enough that we couldn't return it to Amazon. Very disappointing.
