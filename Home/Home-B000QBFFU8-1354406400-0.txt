review/summary: Makes great homemade apple juice!review/text: I use this once a year in the fall to make homemade apple juice. It works great! I put a plastic bag in the canister part that holds the left over apple for easier clean up. I core, and slice my apples before I toss them in to juice so it fits better. For clearer juice after I juice I pour the juice through cheese cloth. Very fast and powerful!
