review/summary: Not simply a juicerreview/text: NO PROBLEMS WITH THE MACHINE- JUST MY OWN MISCONCEPTION ON WHAT THIS ITEM ACTUALLY DOESWhen I purchased this item, I wanted a simple juicer. Something I could put an orange or lemon into and get the juice out. This item is more of an emulsifier. When I put the fruits in, it made a more frothy beverage, not just the juice. Had I wanted an emulsifier, this would have been a good one. The setup was simple as was cleaning. I didn't find the noise it made to be a big deal. I put a plastic shopping bag into the back to catch all the pulp to help with clean-up. Returning it was easy. I printed the label, put it into its box, took it to UPS, and sent it to Amazon. I had a refund in a few days.
