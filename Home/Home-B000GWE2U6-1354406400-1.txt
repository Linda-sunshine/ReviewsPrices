review/summary: Good humidifier for a studio apartment or other small roomreview/text: This humidifier is cute, and surprisingly powerful for its size. Leaving it on for a day makes my small studio apartment feel like a steam room, which is especially great for the winter. It also doesn't seem to develop a lot of mold or other stains like other humidifiers I've owned.However, there are two problems which prevent me from giving it a five star review. The first is that when you lift up the reservoir to refill it (which, incidentally, leaves the owl temporarily decapitated) it tends to drip water all over the place, so you need to have a towel handy to carry it, which isn't exactly convenient.The second is that it tends to blow steam straight up, which means that the vapor doesn't disperse as effectively as it should. If you turn it on too high, it will also leave water all over whatever surface the owl is on, so you have to make sure to lower the strength and put it on a moderately waterproof surface. Other than that, it's an affordable and effective humidifier.
