review/summary: Looks like its been used and smells awfulreview/text: I just needed a small electric tea kettle and this seemed to be about the right one for a short term use.I'm leaving the country in a few months and it was only $11 so I said why not.When I got it, the lid part of the tea kettle was stained with some black stains as if it were used before.Another awful thing about this product is I haven't been able to use it because when I pour it on a powder soup or some tea, it makes my food smell AWFUL. Like a sewage kind of smell and I completely lose my appetite. I thought it was just the first time I use it, so I tried to use it again but no. I've washed it thoroughly and everything and I just can't seem to get rid of that awful smell. So it became useless without me using it once properly.I have two stars cuz it's cheap but it's not worth it. Just buy something that's $10-20 more. DON'T BUY THIS TEA KETTLE.
