review/summary: Nice cubes, hard to pop outreview/text: These trays are very good, and they make nice perfectly square cubes. However, I find that because of the way the trays are constructed, it is a little difficult to pop out the cubes. With a hard tray, you can just twist and most cubes pop out, but with these you have to work at it and laboriously push out almost each cube individually.Aside from that - my only other comment about rubber trays is: you should remember to wash them occasionally with a combination of water and white vinegar to disinfect and prevent a strange smell from occurring. There is a note about this on the packaging.
