review/summary: Looks nice, hard to use.review/text: Once you can get the can to start, it opens fine, but man, what a job it is to get the can properly lined up. We replaced an antique opener (that worked sooooo easily) that had finally gotten too dull, but not sure this is a keeper, though there were high ratings for this one.I don't really see giving this any more than 2 stars. wish I had the option to try it before I bought it...Could be I'm a spaz, but my wife, an MD and very handy can't even get a can started, not a machine for those who are patience challenged...
