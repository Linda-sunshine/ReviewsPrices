review/summary: Two happy campers.review/text: Purchased the Wenzel Insta-Bed Queen Raised Sure Grip Bottom with Built-in Pump and was amazed by the comfort. We purchased the bed for camping and were somewhat apprehensive of how it would perform and how comfortable the bed would be. All I can say is WOW!! The bed was terrific!! On two week long camping trips we had amazing comfort. We liked the convenience of the built in pump which both inflates and deflates the bed and being 18" off the ground. The bed did not slide around and the dual inner and outer air chambers work wonderfully. You did not feel like you were going to roll off the bed. My initial reservation was the 110v AC pump as we normally camp at sites without electricity. A simple inverter did the trick, no problems. We slept better on this bed than we do at home with our conventional mattress. We were considering buying a new box spring/mattress for our guest bedroom but not any more the Insta-bed is way more than adequate. We would recommend this bed to anyone. It was a great purchase
