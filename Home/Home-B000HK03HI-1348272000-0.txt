review/summary: Best can opener I've owned yetreview/text: My son is left handed and has broken every can opener we've had. Every time he would try and hold the can opener in place while spinning the wheel, he'd get it cocked into a bad angle and end up braking the spring that holds the teeth wheel to the can opener itself, making it totally useless from there on out. This can opener is extremely easy to use and you don't have to put hardly any force into turning it although it may take a little effort to get it to punch through enough to go into the lock position. I really like that you can lock the handle in place so you aren't constantly having to hold it down and hope it doesn't slip off. It even works around uneven or slightly bent edges instead of jamming up.I find the magnetic lid lifter to be useless. It's in a weird position and doesn't work at the same time as you're unlocking the can opener. I have to open the can, unlock, let the lid fall into the product, turn the can opener at a weird angle and then hope that I can fish for it down in the can. Now the can opener is dirty with juices or whatnot and you have to clean it off too. It was my impression that you were supposed to be able to lift the can lid BEFORE it fell in the can and while it was still in the locked position (or just releasing it). Oh well.....I clean my can tops anyway before I open them, so no biggie.
