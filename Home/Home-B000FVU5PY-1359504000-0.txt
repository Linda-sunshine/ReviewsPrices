review/summary: Unexpected Qualityreview/text: I was looking for inexpensive pillowcases for extra pillows on our guest bed and purchased 5 sets of these in various colors. Wow was I surprised at the good quality of these cases for the price! The fabric is good quality and heavier than I expected but not stiff or "crunchy". Very soft. I bought the blue, lavendar, and mint colors and they were all beautiful. Highly recommend. :)
