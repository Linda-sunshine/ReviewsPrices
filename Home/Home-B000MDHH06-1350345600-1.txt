review/summary: Terrific juicerreview/text: This is my third - and favorite juicer. The compact size is perfect for my small countertops, but it does a big job for its size. I notice that this juicer produces drier pulp than my previous brands, so I believe I'm getting more juice for the cost of the produce. It is definitely easy to clean and the whole construction of the juicer is better designed than others I've used. I particularly like the plug! It's so "ergonomic" and comfortable to use. After juicing, the nozzle does not continue to drip on the counter. The juiced product contains very little foam and what foam there is, is easy to separate from the juice. I love this little juicer! It's powerful and a great value for the price. My only difficulty with it is that I'm left-handed and the juicer is more right-hand oriented for its operation.
