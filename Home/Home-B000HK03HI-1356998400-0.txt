review/summary: Works as Advertised, But Doesn't Seem Sturdyreview/text: This can opener has some interesting features that make it a bit easier to use than a standard can opener, including a locking mechanism and a spring-loaded release mechanism. Overall however, it seems unlikely to last through the five year warranty period. Who knows? Wish I'd bought a more standard, sturdy opener.
