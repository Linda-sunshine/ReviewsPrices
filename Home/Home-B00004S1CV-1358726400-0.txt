review/summary: Goodreview/text: Good thermos but I didn't give it 5 stars because the mesh strainer has too large of openings so the tea get through and makes the tea you drink have chunks in it. If you don't mind that then go for it. If you do mind, the thermos is still worth it, but get another strainer.
