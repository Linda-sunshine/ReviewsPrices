review/summary: Don't waste your moneyreview/text: I bought two sets, one king and one queen. I washed one set and when they came out of the dryer the top and bottom sheets were a different color of ivory. The color was splotchy and they were horribly wrinkled and stiff. I packed them up and sent them back to Amazon today. I've bought heavy cotton sheets on Amazon before but they were made in Pakistan and were really wrinkle resistant even though they were 100% cotton. Wish I could find those again!
