review/summary: Disappointing qualityreview/text: Like many of the other reviewers here I was tricked by the pyrex name, expecting a durable, well-made product that would last for years. The measuring cup I received was poorly constructed, with about half of the glass being bumpy/wavy rather than smooth and straight (see the Customer photos - I uploaded a picture of the wavy glass). I would return it, but it's a fairly heavy piece of fragile glass, so it would be a pain to pack up and ship back. Giving it 3 stars because it does in fact hold liquids, but I definitely wouldn't recommend this to others.
