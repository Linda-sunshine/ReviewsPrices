review/summary: Almost as good as my old one...review/text: I really like how the power button is on the back of the Hot Shot (as opposed to the old model I used to have) but I am disapointed with the dispense button. You have to hold it down quite far to release the water but it feels like it is going to break off. I had read other reviews about this issue but thought I would buy one anyway because it is such a handy appliance. The water resevoir is quite large (larger than the old model?) and holds enough water for a large mug or travel mug.
