review/summary: Love it!review/text: This is a great coffeemaker. I haven't had any problems pouring water into the unit-I had read that some people found it difficult. I haven't tried to program it so I couldn't give a higher rating as I don't know how well that function works. I am happy that I bought it and would buy the same one again.
