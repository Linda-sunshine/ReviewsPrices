review/summary: Great Productreview/text: I like this sprayer very much. It is easy to use. I have followed others suggestions to relieve the pressure after using by turning the threaded cap. I am hoping this will make it last longer. I had two similar sprayers of different brands and they did not last long. I like that I can use pure olive oil without additives. However, since it is pure you will not get the same non-stick excellence that you do with PAM which has extra additives to prevent sticking.
