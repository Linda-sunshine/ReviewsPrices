review/summary: As advertised!review/text: This waffle maker is as stated in the ad! It is wonderfully simple to use, makes great waffles and best of all, is very easy to store in an upright position. I was concerned about the ease of cleaning but found that it is very easy to clean as well. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a waffle maker.
