review/summary: Great Blender Great Servicereview/text: I've had some problems with the blender (well documented in other reviews...leaky carafe, dulling blade). Overall, it has worked well though. 3 years later I finally called kitchen aid to ask for a new carafe. They sent it off no charge no problem. They said they made some design changes. 100% A+++ to kitchenaid on service. This is the customer service that will get them my return patronage.
