review/summary: Use the right Mugreview/text: This warmer does a good job of keeping your beverage hot. But your mug does make a difference. All mugs you buy have the raised ring on the bottom so the entire bottom does not touch the warming plate. You need to look around for a ceramic mug like the ones that are made by hand with a completely flat bottom. You can find them on line. Also the bigger mugs don't work well either. I use an 16 oz. Mug. It's bulb shaped. Wide at the bottom then narrows at the top. I have several that I bought at local craft fairs. It keeps my coffee at a drinkable temp. for hours. Covering the top helps too but I don't need to do that.
