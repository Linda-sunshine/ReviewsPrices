review/summary: This is the most amazing coffee maker!review/text: I have to tell you, I love making coffee by the cup. And I have had 3 keurigs that I have returned over the years because the water stops coming up the tube to the coffee, despite the fact that I am regular about running vinegar through the system to keep it running smoothly. This coffee maker is no fuss, no frills, and works like a champ every time! I've had mine now for 6 months and I use it every day. I bought 5 more for gifts last Christmas because people would see it at my house and say &#34;how does that work?&#34; Nobody has been disappointed. It's the best kept little secret and takes up barely any room on your countertop. You can put any of your favorite mugs under there. There's no restriction except height (the tall travel coffee mugs will not fit).
