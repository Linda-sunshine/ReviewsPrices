review/summary: Just doesnt cut it for mereview/text: The taste of the water is not very good takes up a good portion of room in your fridge even more if its smaller, the cost of the replacement filters is the worst part, I don't feel they are worth anywhere near 20$ and you have to replace them constantly, which can add up. Overall its just not a good dispenser if your looking to drink good tasting water and saving money.
