review/summary: Might as well toss out your Toaster Ovenreview/text: Not only does it make a perfect pizza every single time with almost 0 effort, but it's also a great toaster oven replacement that you can use for almost anything. I make anything from grilled cheese sandwiches to quesadillas to fish sticks on this thing. There's not a thing I would change about it, except for maybe increasing the timer to 30 minutes instead of 20, other than that, perfection! I love that you can control if you wanna cook from just the bottom or top, or both! Something really fun and nostalgic about getting to see your food being cooked in the open air also, not to mention the great smell that fills the whole house. Presto hit a grand slam with this product, it's become an absolute staple in the kitchen for me, just one of those items like a blender, that you just can't do without. I actually tossed my toaster oven after a few months, when I realized that everything I used the toaster oven for, I can now do with the Pizzaz, only more! I've had my Pizzaz for well over 3 years now and it's still working flawlessly. You can tell that it's built really well, it's got that nice heft/weight to it. So ya, safe to say, I'm a fan. Presto, don't change a thing(except maybe add 10 more minutes to the timer)!
