review/summary: Only buy if you can't afford something betterreview/text: This is my first Amazon review, and I'm writing it from a father's perspective. I convinced my wife to try this chair before buying a more expensive glider chair for the nursey. Needless to say, I'm in the process of returning it after using it for about three weeks. It's basically a cheap wood chair that you assemble by putting on the back and arms, then attach a piece of foam filled canvas to it for the cushions. Pretty easy to put together... at least I thought so. We decided to get a chair at Babies R Us - one that is upholstered and much more cushy, although it was $500 for the chair and the ottoman and the Stork Craft was $130. "You get what you pay for" is a saying that is not always true from my life experiences, but I would certainly say it's true when it comes to nursery gliders. It's hard to put a price tag on comfort and when your wife is literallu going to be spending hours a day in her nursery glider, pony up and get a quality chair. I'd recommend going to a store and sitting in some chairs to get a feel for what you like (duh). For the money, this chair is OK, and like the Hyundai Accent or Ford Fiesta, those cars definitly serve a purpose. If you're on a tight budget, this chair is not to bad. But if you have the money to spend, I'd suggest getting something a little more plush. Don't expect this to be a nice, luxurious chair, because it it not.
