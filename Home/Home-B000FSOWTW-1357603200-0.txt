review/summary: great giftreview/text: I got one as a gift and I loved it. I then bought 3 more as gifts for others. It may not be the sort of thing people splurge on for themselves, but they should. You get so spoiled you can't believe you used to wrench on corks with a corkscrew. It even makes the rabbit style seem difficult. Great price, and mine has been very active and lasted over a year without any problems. I use it frequently on synthetic corks too, without any difference. It's also portable if you need to take it along, though mine sits in the kitchen.
