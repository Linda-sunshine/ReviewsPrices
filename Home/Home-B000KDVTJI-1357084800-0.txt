review/summary: OK kettlereview/text: Works well and looks good though a little small compared to my old Krupp one. This is no faster or quieter than the old one either which is a shame as that was the main reason for changing it out. The scale filter clips directly onto the metal at the spout and looks like it will not last more than a few removals/remounts but for the price its fine.
