review/summary: Great coffemaker with very few flawsreview/text: I bought this a year ago and have used it almost every day for nine straight months. I have no major complaints about this product. I got it for a quick "brew 'n go", and that's exactly what is. If I could offer any suggestions (not complaints), it would be the following:1) I like to use the "No. 1 Cone Coffee Filter" by Melitta because it's just an easier cleanup. The permanent wire filter is great, but can be a pain to clean out if you're in a rush. Although they do create a smaller amount of waste at a tiny additional price, the coffee filters make it easy to drop in the garbage and go!2) I don't know if this is an issue with all of these coffeemakers or if it just applies to my personal model. I have found (only in the last couple of months) that sometimes the brewer automatically stops prematurely. All the water is not used and only a half cup is made. It is an easy fix - I just hit the button again and it compeletes the entire cup. I think this happens mostly when I have poured HOT water into the coffeemaker instead of cold water. Anyway, it seems like using COLD water is the solution to this problem.I have truly enjoyed this coffeemaker, ESPECIALLY at the price. After using it so often for so long, I wouldn't be upset if it just stopped working, as I could afford another one right away.UPDATE - 1/25/2013I just started a new position where I will be commuting between 2 places every other day. Because this coffee maker has worked so well in the past, I just ordered an ADDITIONAL one so that I may have one at each work place!!Highly recommended!!
