review/summary: It's ok.review/text: I searched high and low for a classic style waffle maker that wasn't Belgium style. This seemed to fit the bill and I respected Cuisinart. But, it's barely acceptable. The kids want waffles every weekend and I expect it won't last long (hopefully the kids move onto something else). This is NOT NON-STICK. You must use spray, which prevents the waffles from browning. The handles are very small and I have burned myself on the hot exterior several times. It is difficult to clean since the irons are not removable. It's work about $15, we paid $35. Not worth all the trouble and wouldn't buy it again.
