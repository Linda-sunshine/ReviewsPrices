review/summary: Must have kitchen gadget.review/text: Being these types of thermometers are so much better and easier to use Vs the traditional tube type it&#8217;s tuff to say anything negative. Except for the ease of setting the temperature and/or timer each time it&#8217;s used. This particular model has been a breeze; being my wife threw out the packaging & instructions, when I went to use it all I had to do was just set the temperature and hit start. It was that easy. Do note there is an on/off switch on the back that I&#8217;d recommend one use it when it&#8217;s not in use to conserve the battery. I&#8217;d recommend it to anyone. Also, the cable is very flexible; more so than the steel braided one this one replaced, and so far is as durable.
