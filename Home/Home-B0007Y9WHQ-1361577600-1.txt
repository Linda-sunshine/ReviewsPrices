review/summary: Exactly as reviewedreview/text: This works very well without fear of cutting my fingers, which is why the mandolin style slicer went in the trash. Zucchini curls are perfect with chicken and other veggies and sauce instead of pasta. Fine with onions for nice ring effect when carmelizing. Easy to incorporate core of zucchini etc. into meal, just slice into smaller pieces.
