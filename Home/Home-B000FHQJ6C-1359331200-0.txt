review/summary: Seems okayreview/text: Tried it out a couple of times with oranges, big carrots, satsumas, blueberries & very large Fuji apples. I cut the apples up but it struggled a little but worked itself out. Some pieces of the apples & blueberries didn't breakdown but all in all I am satisfied so far. I don't care to waste all of the skin on the blueberries & apples or the insides of the fruit. Maybe I'm not one to be juicing.
