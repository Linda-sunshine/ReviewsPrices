review/summary: Great Juicer!review/text: I was looking for a juicer for my girlfriend, and having been around juicers growing up, I knew how much of a pain it can be to clean all the pulp out after only a couple of vegetable/fruit pieces. This juicer is fantastic. you can easily get 16 oz without having to clean out anything, and we have gotten up to 22 oz. without having to do anything. It's simple and the feeding tube is very wide, so a smaller apple could actually go in there without any prep work.Definitely a great juicer for the price. Doesn't have some of the &#34;fancier&#34; options, like speeds, and other things, but you really don't need them. As long as you're not a professional, I think this is your best bang for your buck.
