review/summary: Happy Nightsreview/text: I purchased these sheets (in cream) largely based on the good reviews here. The cream color is fairly neutral so it goes fine with any of our comforter sets. The main important pieces to me are:(1) the size: these fit our thick mattress perfectly, and still can tuck under the corners when we put on a tempurpedic topper (~2")(2) the feel: these sheets are oh so soft, even after many washes. They are my favorite to slide into after a long day, especially when they are warm from the dryer.These sheets are thick and cozy. I enjoy them very much!
