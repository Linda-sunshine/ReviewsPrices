review/summary: Perfectreview/text: Everything about this thing is awesome. It is perfect for guests and has had zero issues at all over the year that I have owned it. Perfect in every way. I have even slept on it for a month solid, love this thing. It also keeps you very elevated off the floor and whatever material they used up top keeps the air that gets cold in it from rising to your body. Sheets however can be a pain so I just lay a flat sheet on top.
