review/summary: Simple and efficient!review/text: This is a great clock. I do not want a lot of&#34; bells and whistles&#34;, just a simple machine! This clock was super easy to use and comes with the time zones already programed. Just pick your zone and voila! I love the dual feature for weekends and naps. The radio works great, better than any other clock I have ever had. I am sensitive to too much light when I sleep and the ability to lower the setting is awesome. I have never had such a simple clock. When you set the alarm it advances in minutes up to 10 and then switches to 10 minute increments so it is quicker than other clocks. I am tempted to get another one because I like it so much. The only thing I do not like about this clock is the cord. It is thick and inflexible. When I turn the clock the way I want it to sit, the cord pulls it away. So no 5 stars as a result. Other than that it is great! (So far, anyway.)
