review/summary: barely worth $15review/text: I thought this would be a simple way to make one cup of coffee but I'm back to my old 5yr old maker. This is extremely messy and with no shut off, you can get coffee all over. I like strong coffee and when you put alot of coffee in the filter, it clogs up. Cleaning the reusable filter is very messy as I guess all these are. I would send this back but I'll save it for emergency use. Really, the only good thing about this product is the thermal mug.
