review/summary: Auto-set time is wrongreview/text: There are things I enjoy about this clock radio - the dimmable display is great, and I like the small footprint.Unfortunately, the auto-set time is wrong. It's fast by 7 minutes. It's possible to adjust this manually and that's included in the instructions. I'm hoping I don't have to remember to adjust it every time the power goes out.
