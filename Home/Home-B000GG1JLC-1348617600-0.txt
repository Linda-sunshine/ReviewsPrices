review/summary: Tie Rackreview/text: No problems thus far. Filled the tie rack to the brim and it held itself together while still twirling. It does the work of what other ties racks 10 times it price do. Easy pick!Evriholder offered great customer service as well. I didn't realize that this product was coming all the way from China and thus going to take at least two weeks to get to me and they gave me a full refund and let me keep the product.
