review/summary: I can sleep again!!review/text: For a few weeks, I had been unable to stay asleep. I have had my mattress for 5 years and just could not get comfortable lately. Rather than buy a new mattress, I opted for a mattress topper. This memory foam topper has BLOWN ME AWAY!! I've had it for only a week and can tell that I am getting more restful sleep. In the morning, I wake up feeling wonderful; no aches, no lag in my step! Will buy again and recommend to friends!!** As other reviewers have noted, there is a noticeable "minty" smell from the foam topper when you first open it. But once I put a mattress pad cover over it, it was muted and barely an issue.**
