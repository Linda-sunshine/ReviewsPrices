review/summary: Very Goodreview/text: I was skeptical about this product, but it turned out really well. After filtering, the water tastes really well. I have saved a lot of money (not having to buy bottled water). I understand there have been a few complaints about the quality of the filter, but so far so good. After about three months, the filter is still going strong.
