review/summary: Love Love Lovereview/text: My beloved Sanyo Rice Cooker finally died on me after 10 years or so and I was overwhelmed by choices. We did not need a huge Rice Cooker for just the two of us and this size is perfect. It took me awhile to get used to &#34;something new and different&#34;, but eventually I have come to love this cooker.One big thing to remember is use their little 1 cup container and your rice will be perfect every time, the enclosed container is not an actual cup, which is why it works.I have cooked every single kind of rice and cereal in this sucker and it comes out perfectly every time. I highly recommend it.
