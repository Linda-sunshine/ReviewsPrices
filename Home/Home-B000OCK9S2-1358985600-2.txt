review/summary: Want to sleep with a flashlight shining in your face? Then this is the clock for you!review/text: This is the first time in my 48 years I've actually had to read the directions on how to set an alarm clock. Even then I was confused. But that wasn't the most annoying aspect of this product. As other's have written, you have to stare straight at it to read it. Annoying, yes, but it's made worse by the fact that even on the dimmer setting it is way too bright. So if you want to see what time it is when you sleep you must be forced to sleep with the bright blue display boring into your eyes.The shut-off button is one of 8 buttons in a row on the front. All the same size. I usually get up in the dark about a half hour before my husband and don't want to have to turn the light on in order to shut this thing off. Off course, due to the bright display (which is about the same blast of light as the Bat Signal)I could actually put my hand in front of the face of the clock and the brightness bounced off my hand and let me find the tiny shut-off button.I'll be boxing this one up and sending it back, unless I want to ever go cave exploring. In that case I'll just strap it to a helmet and be able to see for miles.
