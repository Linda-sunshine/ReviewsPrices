review/summary: first time using presto coffeemakerreview/text: I am a believer in electric percolators and have always figured Farberware was the best model. I read a review from someone who used Farberware but switched to Presto. I decided to give it a try b/c the Farberwares always seemed to have a built-in obsolescence. I'm perfectly delighted w/ this electric percolator and recommend it to everyone. No problems, delicious coffee.
