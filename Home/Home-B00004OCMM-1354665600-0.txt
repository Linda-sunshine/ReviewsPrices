review/summary: This one worksreview/text: My wife tossed my trusty 20 opener because it looked so grungy, so we purchased any old new one at a kitchen department. It was a kitchen aid brand and it &#34;looked&#34; very nice,. From day one the new one just would't grab onto the can. The handle of the kitchenaid opener was made of some cheap metal and bent so so easy. After about 3 tries, went to the trusty amazon reviews and purchased the OXO. This one works great, as expected from all the positive reviews.
