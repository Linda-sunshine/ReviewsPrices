review/summary: Wet, hot, and steamyreview/text: I'm giving this steamer 3 stars but figured out a way to get it to work like a 5 star product. I needed a travel size steamer for our destination wedding. Because I wanted something compact I knew the tank size would be small and that I might need to refill throughout the steaming "session." The product is about the size of a medium hair dryer. I tried it out at home and was initially very disappointed with how much water sprayed out along with the steam, leaving water drips and spots all over my dress. This is ok for some fabrics but ruinous for others. The table where I had the steamer sitting was also covered in water (be sure to use a towel under it). As other reviews have mentioned, there is no on/off switch so once you plug it in, it starts heating up. Similarly there are no controls to turn it off to keep it from running dry. I figured I would be sending it back and started to look for other steamers. I also placed a call to a bridal shop to get recommendations for where to get my dress pressed. The very kind seamstress at the shop suggested I use a piece of cheesecloth over the steamer to stop the spitting water from getting on the dress. I put the cheesecloth (folded over like it comes in the package) over the steamer with a rubber band and this did the trick! The steamer worked like a charm. It was more effective than when I tried it without the cheesecloth and there were no water spots, the cheesecloth caught them all. I changed the cheesecloth a few times to keep it from being too soaked. I hate making adaptations to products to make them work, but for the price and what I need this for, this steamer with some cheesecloth is now a good enough product to keep.
