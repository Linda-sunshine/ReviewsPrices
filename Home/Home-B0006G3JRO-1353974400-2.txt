review/summary: Blender Safetyreview/text: I have this very set and it is wonderful. But please listen to the advise I am about to post. 1 week ago I foolishly was trying to clean creamed cheese off the blades and must have accidentally hit the on button with my right thumb. I amputated the full top of my left index finger just above the second joint and it could not be reattached. In 50 years of baking I have never done anything as foolish as this So please, UNPLUG your blender before your fingers are anywhere near the blades. The power and sharpness can cut through bone, and in my case they did!
