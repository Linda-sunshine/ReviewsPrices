review/summary: I'll never drink drip coffee againreview/text: While it's not true espresso the Aeropress makes espresso strength (and quality IMO) coffee for a much better price. My friend has an espresso maker and I can make very comparable coffee to his and my maker cost about a third of what his did.If you're looking for great coffee at a good price this is what you want.
