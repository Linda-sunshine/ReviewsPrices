review/summary: The moka that you would buy in Italy - US people: it's not 3 US cups!review/text: That's exactly the moka that you can find in Italy. Bialetti is quite a famous brand.You can make three single coffees with this one, or more likely coffee for two.US people: 3-cups means that you can serve coffee to three people, this has nothing to do with your unit of measurement. You can make three small coffeecups with this one. I would say that *in total*, it makes more or less half a CUP (US measurement unit).
