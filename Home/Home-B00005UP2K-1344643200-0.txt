review/summary: Make preparations for another purchase.review/text: Please, do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY a KitchenAid Mixer. We purchased one for my wife and this unit was used 4 times before it quit working. We had contacted KitchenAid/Whirlpool about this failure and were told that nothing could be done as it had been outside of the 1 year warranty. It was 1yr. and 3 days to the date of purchase. So for the 3 days of "extra" warranty I was asking for, this company chose to ignore the customer. I will, NEVER purchase an item from KitchenAid/Whirlpool again. I wish everyone who owns on the best of luck but be prepared to spend more money soon.
