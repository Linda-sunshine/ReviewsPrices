review/summary: Quick; Tends to Dry Out Popcornreview/text: This popper can quickly make a large batch of popcorn. Kids love seeing the popcorn flying out of the popper and into the bowl! Cleanup is a snap; just dump any unpopped kernals into the trash. It uses no oil, resulting in more healthy popcorn. However, I think the hot air tends to dry out the popcorn a bit. It's nothing a little butter can't fix, though!
