review/summary: Good useful pressure cookerreview/text: We've used this a few times now and have the following to report: It can fit 5-6 pint jars on the bottom and needs a separation plate if you want to put a second layer of jars on top of the first layer. We used a dinner plate and stacked 4 more jars on top for a total of 10 at a batch, I'm sure you could find something else good on Amazon to put into it and get 5-6 more on the second layer for a total of 12 jars. Don't use plastic or wood.It's Aluminium and will form a black oxide layer on the inside after a few uses, this is good, don't try to scrub it off, it protects the metal.Do not put it on a direct flame because it will warp, we flipped a cast iron griddle over the flame to even out the heat and it worked fine for us. It would work fine on an electric element but all of them were being used for other preservation projects.It does take a good bit of time to pressurize and depressurize but it is the only safe method for preserving low acid foods and meats.It liked to go up to about 12-15psi with the included weight, but im sure there are other lighter weights for lower temperatures that you can order, but only one is included.The included guide book has timing guidelines for every manner of preserving along with different pressure settings.Remember to remove,clean, and lubricate the big rubber o-ring before first use and whenever you wash it.
