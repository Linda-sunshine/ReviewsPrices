review/summary: it's okayreview/text: this blander dose the job, but if you are doing something everyday on it, don't buy it, because it will be so hard to clean it. Also, there is small empty spaces that keeps the meat on it. so if you are doing a lot of stuff with this blander I don't recommended.It work okay, and it's worth $10 not $25.
