review/summary: LODGE UPDATE- They have fixed the Knob Issue!review/text: Happy news!As of June 2012, Lodge has been replacing the plastic Knobs on their Color Enamel Cookware lids with Stainless Steel Knobs! Lodge Customer Service says that some products that have been in warehouse for a while, may contain the new knob packed seprately inside the box.You may want to contact the seller prior to purchase to be sure they will co-operate with this but according to Amazon and Lodge Customer Services, IF you get one without the new knob, you are to contact the seller for a replacement and they are to provide it, either by replacing the entire purchase or by sending the NEW knob directly to the buyer.The new Lodge Stainless Steel knob is safe for up to 500 degrees and is wider and flatter than the plastic ones - easier to handle. Of course it will get hot(when the pot is hot)- so using pot holders are in order...I am a faithful Amazon shopper, but I found my 6 Qt Green Dutch Oven at my local Kroger Market Place for only $65.99 on sale so I did not get it here. It came with the Stainless Steel knob and matches my Green 3 Qt beautifully. THANK YOU LODGE & Thank You Amazon. I find Amazon Customer Reviews a wonderful source of information and I hope this helps other Amazon Shoppers too.Lodge Color Dutch Oven, Emerald Green, 6-Quart
