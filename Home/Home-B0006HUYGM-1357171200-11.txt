review/summary: Brushes somewhat weakreview/text: The vacuum works great as advertised but I have the following two complaints:1) It is large and heavy2) The brushes are not strong enough to keep rotating for many applications. The vaccuum will suck too hard and pull the material being vaccummed into the brushed so that the dont rotate much or at all.
