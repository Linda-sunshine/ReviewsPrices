review/summary: Definitely a staple in my kitchenreview/text: I love this product. I bought one for my mother and have also talked 3 or 4 family members and friends to purchase. Easy to clean and put together. I have had it for a few weeks and have used it so much. I have made curly fries with it (from a rutabaga!), zucchini and squash &#34;spaghetti&#34; and sweet potato &#34;pad thai&#34;. I have really enjoyed replacing calorie laden pasta with light and nutritious vegetables. I can't believe I never had one of these before.
