review/summary: Money saver.review/text: Used to drink tons of bottle water, but after getting this filter, there's no need. It fits well in my fridge, and the only downside is that I drink so much water, I often have to refill it. Still, definitely worth it. Haven't experienced any issues with it so far and would recommend it to anyone looking to replace bottled water, especially if you have a smaller fridge with not a lot of space.Edited to add this: I'm pretty sure I figured out why people are having problems with "black flecks" in their water. The filter does leak some of that, but if you soak it in water for about 15 minutes and rinse it, that should fix it. Also, don't overfill this pitcher. Too much water forces the filter upwards, and any black flecks in the filter container will leak down into the drinking water.
