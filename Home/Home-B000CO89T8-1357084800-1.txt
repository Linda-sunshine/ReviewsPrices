review/summary: Oversize Coasterreview/text: Like other 1-star reviews, this warmer barely kept the coffee warm. And like most other cheap electronic products, the cord was too short; just enough to reach the floor with about two inches to move around. Also, don't waste your time trying to actually warm coffee, as it took about an hour and a half to go from room temperature to warm.
