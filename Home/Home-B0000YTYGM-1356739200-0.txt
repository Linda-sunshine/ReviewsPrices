review/summary: best coffee maker everreview/text: I won mine as a door prize five years ago and am only here looking for a replacement because the carafe handle broke this morning and I would never dream of using any other coffee maker after having one of these. I can't believe the number of negative reviews here for this. I suppose there are reasons for them and perhaps I just got lucky with mine, but I have nothing bad to say about it. It makes a great tasting cup of coffee with about half the amount of grounds as others. It keeps the coffee hot for hours and even if it does go cold, its not burnt and still tastes great after a minute in the microwave. Mine has overflowed the filter a couple times, making quite a mess, but it has been my fault every time by not having the pot fully seated or the filter tray not completely closed.
