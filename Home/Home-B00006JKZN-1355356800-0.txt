review/summary: Great REGULAR waffle maker. Belgian waffles suck!review/text: I've been using mine for several years now and think it's great. My non-stick coating has not had any issues and my batter doesn't stick(Traditional Waffle recipe out of Betty Crocker cookbook). At most I will give a very light spray of oil before the first waffle. It's really hard to find NORMAL waffle makers these days cuz everything is belgian waffle shaped and I hate that crap. It's also really hard to find this thing anymore though. Used to be able to get it at Kohl's and probably other similar retailers. Now I have to order from Amazon to gift one to my mom. I have already gifted another one in the past to my best friend. Turns out a nice crisp waffle and heats predictably.
