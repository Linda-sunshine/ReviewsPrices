review/summary: stopped working after 4 usesreview/text: Was happy to get it and start blending for guacamole and hummus. The 4th time (about 6 months later) the thing started stopping intermittently and then completely quit. Sometimes it will kick on for a few seconds just to tease me. These people raving about their 3 year model must have bought the last good ones before they started putting this crap in the box. Not worth it.
