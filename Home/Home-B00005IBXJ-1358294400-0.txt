review/summary: Perfectreview/text: I bought this when I was in college. It is 14 years later and thi s thing just died. I've probably cooked 500 pizzas on it. I felt like I needed to give it a eulogy. Anyway, if you are a normal human with average or greater intelligence, you can't go wrong. Check that, a spider monkey would love this.
