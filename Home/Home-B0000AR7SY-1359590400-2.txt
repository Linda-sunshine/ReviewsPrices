review/summary: Very happy with the unit and it's performance thus farreview/text: After 1 week I am very happy with the performance of my Capresso 560.01 Infinity Burr Grinder.I have paired this grinder with a new Rancilio version 3 Silvia. After 4 attempts I found what setting I am happy with on the grinder. I set it to the point in between extra fine (#4) and fine (#5). Setting 2 choked Siliva and setting 7 gave me 2 ounces in 15 seconds.Ive also figured out a routine to get the coffee ground and cleaning the grinder during my attempts to make an expresso. I'm grinding a little less than 1/3 cup of beans to get my double shot portafilter filled. Once ground, and while warming up and flushing the Slivia, I clean the grinder. First step is to lift up and gently tap the grinder sides and back as it finishes the beans. Once finished I lift out and clean the top burr and brush the loose coffee around the bottom burr into the collection chute. Lift the unit up again and gently tap and I have recovered most and have left very little loose ground coffee in the grinder and it takes about 1 minute.The grinder settings could be a little more granular but I seem to have enough flexibility to get the setting I need.For the price paid, I feel I got a substantial buy that I would not hesitate to recommend. We shall see how it performs long term and how long it lasts.
