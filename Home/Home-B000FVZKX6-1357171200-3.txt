review/summary: So very soft!review/text: I laundered this set as soon as I got it and put it on my bed. The first night I slept on these sheets I was in heaven! You know how soft a real &#34;shammy&#34; feels..? The kind you use to shine your car? Well these feel that soft! So wonderful to sleep on and very warm and cozy. They fit my queen size bed beautifully with room to spare even after drying them in my dryer. These are a very thick flannel... what you would expect a real flannel sheet to feel like. They are wonderful!
