review/summary: Great cup of coffee, does not last long, but good servicereview/text: I have the B60 model that I purchased and registered in June of 2011. I took care of it following the maintenance instructions but it started to "short cup" us regularly about a month ago. Today I called Keurig and they looked it up and yes (as I expected) the warrenty had expired months ago. BUT! They offered to ship me a new one for a bit more than half off. I should have the new one in a week.
