review/summary: Lets pop some popcorn,,,,review/text: I have two popcorn cookers, this one and one for the microwave. But this is the one I use the most. Popcorn comes out much more fresher tasting than popping in the microwave. Plus, its quite fun to watch. I add a full measuring cup of popping corn to the popper before I turn it on. Why ? Cause if not , say you only add half of a measuring cup of corn, some kernals will start flyin out of the chute before the popping begins. Just bag some up for later if to much.
