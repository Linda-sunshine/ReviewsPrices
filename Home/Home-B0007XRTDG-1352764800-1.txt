review/summary: GREAT LARGE SKILLETreview/text: I bought this skillet to replace a 30 yo sunbeam I was given at my first wedding shower. It was harvest gold if that tells you anything. This skillet is great. Love that it is dishwasher safe. I usually dont put nonstick items in dishwasher but decided to take a chance and it came out perfect. It is very large and deep cooked 6 med sized checken fried steaks at once. You cant go wrong with this skillet.
