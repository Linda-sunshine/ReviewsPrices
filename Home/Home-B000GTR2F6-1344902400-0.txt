review/summary: PRIME PRIME PRIMEreview/text: I had my original Keurig B-40 for years, not a single problem. Although it eventually quit, I felt I got more than my moneys worth out of it.Decided that since we like the coffee we would go with Keurig again but "upgrade" to a more expensive model. I am now on my third "upgrade" model B-70. Each and every one brews for a couple weeks then starts randomly throwing the PRIME message after a single cup.I don't care what Keurig says or anyone else, there is no other solution than to unplug the pot and let it cool down for 5 or 10 minutes, then plug it back in.So, I give up with upgrading, I am going to give Keurig one more shot by downgrading to the original model I had. After that, I'm headed to Senseo or something.Buy the way, I had a Tassimo at the office for YEARS and it worked flawlessly also.
