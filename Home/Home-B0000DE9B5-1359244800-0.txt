review/summary: excellent glass pitcherreview/text: Bought this to avoid plastic jugs/pitchers but initial concern was that it might be too heavy because it's glass. But it is not heavy and is just the right size for juices, nut milks or other beverages. The cap works very well, just have to hold the outside part of the cap and then twist the inside. Nothing leaks when you shake the container provided the cap is on correctly.
