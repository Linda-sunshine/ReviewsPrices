review/summary: Great until...review/text: When I bought this juicer I loved it! It worked wonderfully- I could juice hard veggies and leafy greens if I wadded them up. It was also relatively easy to clean up- the only difficulty getting the spout clean. Now, all was fine and dandy until one day it suddenly wouldn't turn on anymore. There had never been an indication of a motor problem or issues, just one day, it would no longer turn on at all even after I checked different outlets. And of course this happened about a month after the warranty went up.While this juicer may be a good price and a product that works well for a period of time it certainly doesn't seem to last well!
