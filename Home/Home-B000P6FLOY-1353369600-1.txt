review/summary: Broke after 3 usesreview/text: I have used only 3 times and I believe it is broken- the temperature is registering as &#34;lo&#34;. I understand that the probes aren't made to last and that they sell reasonably-priced replacements, but after only 3 uses I think that's a little ridiculous. I called their customer service and left a message- I will update my review after I hear from them. It is now 2 days before thanksgiving and I think I may be out of luck!!
