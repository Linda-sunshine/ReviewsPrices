review/summary: Ad description VAGUE!review/text: As you can see in the description it says, &#34;...3-Cup (Uncooked) Rice Cooker ...&#34;. Since so many rice cookers say the amount of cooked rice this led me to believe that one could put 3 cups of uncooked rice into the pot with an appropriate amount of water and turn it on. When I received the product and opened up the lid to look inside it had only a 3-Cup &#34;COOKED rice&#34; pot inside. It IS a 3-Cup (COOKED) Rice Cooker and Warmer, Not a 3 cup Uncooked Rice Cooker. Why they used the word &#34;Uncooked&#34; is beyond me. One star because of this. I don't know how well it works since I did not use it. People told me this brand is good and if 3 cups of &#34;COOKED&#34; rice is all you need then it's probably a good choice for you.
