review/summary: Delivers great waterreview/text: I love this thing. It holds a lot of water without taking up a lot of space in the fridge. The water it delivers tastes clean and crisp. The filters are in expensive and last for about 2 months. The spout on mine has developed a single, delayed, occasional drip. That's the only drawback, and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars. It's a minor annoyance to an otherwise excellent product. I'm very happy with my purchase, would recommend one to a friend, and would definitely buy one again.
