review/summary: Good Tea, Some Stainingreview/text: This works great for making tea, but it's a bit difficult to clean. It is dishwasher safe if you pop the filter out, but water tends to collect in the spring-loaded bottom plate, as it's in its recessed position when the cup is placed upside down. There's also some staining of the plastic if you only wash by hand, though it tends to come right off when run through the dishwasher a time or two. None of that has affected its functionality, though.
