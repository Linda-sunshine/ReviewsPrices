review/summary: Good while it lastedreview/text: I bought this vaccume in October 2011 and was very impressed with it. I have mosty hardwoods, but used the vaccume once a month or so to clean the stairs and the small area rugs in the house. After roughly 11 uses, the vaccume has turned into a noisey paperweight, there is no more suction and the brushes have stopped rotating. After cleaning the unit and having nothing improve, I tossed it and will not be buying a replacement. Even at this price is should last more than 11 uses.
