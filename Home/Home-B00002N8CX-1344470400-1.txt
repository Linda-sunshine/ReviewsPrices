review/summary: A Great Vacuum!review/text: I'm not big on writing reviews, but I was really surprised at the bang for the buck I received from the Mighty Mite. Now I will tell you that I do have mostly hardwood floors and it's great for that. Not to shabby on the throw rugs either. I did read a few reviews where people were complaining about the blower feature. Not sure why that's an issue? Again I'm very happy with my purchase.
