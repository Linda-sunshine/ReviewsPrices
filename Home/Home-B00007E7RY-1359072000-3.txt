review/summary: Honeywell 50250-S 99.97% Pure HEPA Round Air Purifier.review/text: I first purchased one Honeywell 50250-S 99.97% Pure HEPA Round Air Purifier and one of its smaller siblings (used in another room) because I suffer from terrible sinus allergies and medication alone wasn&#8217;t cutting it. My home is mostly carpeted with the exception of the kitchen and bath, and as a lot of allergy suffers can attest, carpet is not good for allergies as it has a tendency to break-down and release particles into the air, as well as a trap for dust, pollen and other allergens. I unfortunately don&#8217;t have the upfront cash needed to re-floor my entire home with a better alternative, so I turned to HEPA filtration to help out.I work in a scientific/tech industry and have an understanding of the limitations of these types of home HEPA filters and what they can and simply cannot do. I was not expecting miracles or it to knock down every smell in my house. In other words; HEPA is meant to filter particles, it won&#8217;t work on odors from gasses! I was however pleasantly surprised at how well it does work at helping ease my allergy symptoms and some of the odors it does seem to help with.I placed the 50250-S in the main living area of my home, which includes the living room, kitchen, dining room and a hallway that leads to the bedrooms. This is actually about 2 times more area than the 50250-S is rated to handle, so again I wasn&#8217;t expecting it to be as powerful as it could be if used in a room matching its rated capacity. But within a couple of hours of running the 50250-S on its highest setting, I started to notice my sinuses were opening up and a drop in the usual household smells.Knowing that people have a tendency to &#8220;get used to odors&#8221; after they have been exposed to them for a short while, I figured the best &#8220;smell test&#8221; would be after leaving the 50250-S while I was at work and returning home. I could definitely tell a big difference in the air quality, again with the usual smells being much attenuated, but actually feeling better than ever when it came to my sinus issues. My home was now becoming a sanctuary from my allergies!Now to address some of the pros and cons of the Honeywell 50250-S 99.97% Pure HEPA Round Air Purifier.Pros:Easy to set up. Take the bottom of and remove the HEPA filter from the housing, Remove the plastic from the carbon pre-filter, wrap it around the HEPA filter and secure with the included Velcro strips and install the assembly back into the filter housing, position the filter in the area you want and plug it in and tuen it on! I didn&#8217;t even look at the manual. You should however read the manual and pay attention to the safety recommendations. You wouldn&#8217;t want to place this near water or in a wet area or where drapes could get wrapped around it, choking airflow from the motor, overheating it and possibly causing a fire.Works well, even in areas outside of its rated capacity. Though I don&#8217;t recommend this unless you dust and vacuum regularly anyway.Quiet enough to not be bothersome, if it is on its lowest setting.It alerts you when it&#8217;s time to check your filters. I&#8217;m going to make the assumption that this feature is based on the increase of vacuum due to your filter getting clogged up, but it may just be keeping track of run time. Either way, it reminds you to keep an eye on your filters.Cons:On its highest two settings, it&#8217;s rather loud, but it is a big fan, moving a lot of air. So not so much of a &#8220;con&#8221; per se than the reality of physics! So if you want to clean a lot of air, you have to move a lot of air, and moving a lot of air with a big fan is going to make a lot of noise. If you stripped your furnace fan out and sat it in the middle of an open room, you would see that it is very loud as well! This unit is a plastic box with no real sound deadening, so be aware of that reality! I&#8217;d just run it on high when you aren&#8217;t going to be bothered by it, and then switch to low when you need it to be a bit quieter.It&#8217;s large and round, and they suggest you should place it 3 feet from any walls, which I ignore because it would just be in the way. It isn&#8217;t slim by any means. But to clean that much air, it has to be big.The energy usage is going to be worse of course on the highest setting, so again, use low most of the time.The price is a little high and fluctuates, not the fault of the HEPA filter, but you should be aware. I now own two 50250-S models and have them in my main living area. I got my first one at around $120, the second one I bought cost $170&#8230; So I would wait and see if the price drops before I bought this item.Hard board styrofoam pagaking is terrible stuff, it's bad for the environment, it sheds little statically charged pieces everywhere that stick to everything and it's more trouble than it's worth. I'd use that brown paper fiber based packaging before styrofoam!All in all, the Honeywell 50250-S 99.97% Pure HEPA Round Air Purifiers that I own were a good investment for me and have really helped greatly in combating my sinus issues. I would recommend it to anyone who suffers the same. I can&#8217;t speak for those who want to use this for smoke and other smells other than to say &#8220;quit while you&#8217;re still alive&#8221; and it may not work if the smell is not due to particles, again, HEPA was never intended to filter gasses! Cooking related smells may not be fully knocked down right away, but it sure makes a dent and the house smells a lot fresher and quicker than in the past. So if you have reasonable expectations, you will not be disappointed by the Honeywell 50250-S 99.97% Pure HEPA Round Air Purifier.I give it 4 stars because it actually worked better than I was expecting but had to ding it one point for the packaging. But I liked it so much I bought a second one!
