review/summary: Don't buy itreview/text: This is probably one of the worst things I've ever purchased. The filter didn't fit and the machine almost vibrated off the counter when I turned it on. It never produced one drop of coffee and had to be returned. DON'T BUY IT!! It's not worth the headache of having to return it. I won't purchase another product from De'Longhi.
