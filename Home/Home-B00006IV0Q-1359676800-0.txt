review/summary: Great valuereview/text: After having gone through 2 Farberware coffeepots within 4 years, I was skeptical about the quality of a much lesser priced perc pot. It's not the quality of the Farberware but, then again, the Farberware didn't last! It makes a good cup of coffee and the coffee stays hot. I'd definitely buy it again.
