review/summary: Fantastic Thermosreview/text: This bottle is amazing and can literally keep your coffee/tea hot for 8-10hrs if you pre-heat the bottle with hot water before you put it in. In fact it keeps it a little too hot at times and I won't preheat it. The latch works great and it doesn't leak if you wait to screw on the top till you fill it and keep the top part open then close it when it's screwed on. Simple and easy to drink out of without spilling coffee on yourself!
