review/summary: Nice water, but big flaw is the filter - lasted 2weeksreview/text: Let me start by saying the water it produces is nice, also the size of the tank is excellent too otherwise it would have got 1*.I got this to use for our kids formula and also for us to drink since our tap water is horrible, this fixes the taste and so we were initially very pleased. However, after exactly 2 weeks,the filter is working excruciatingly slowly. I read other reviews elsewhere on amazon and discovered that this is common. Last night I filled the tank and 9hours later it's only half filtered. When we bought this, it would have taken maybe 10minutes which is fine. There's n way we've got through 40gallons of water in 2 weeks, s it can't be that the filter needs replacing, it's simply a poor design
