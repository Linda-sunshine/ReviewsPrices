review/summary: A LIFESAVER DURING A POWER OUTAGE!review/text: We lost power for six days after hurricane Sandy. Our furnace doesn't work without electricity, and the temperatures have been in the low 40s. We had been given a gel fireplace and a case of Real Flame Gel Fuel by some friends who were moving and didn't have the room for it. After spending four very cold dark uncomfortable nights, I remembered the fireplace. We moved it to an unused bedroom, and set it up. It made a huge difference to be able to sit by a fire, and the flames raised our spirits as well as taking the chill off the room. I've just ordered another case--for ambiance, and JUST IN CASE Mother Nature isn't done with us this year.
