review/summary: Everything I wanted!review/text: This machine was everything I wanted -- and more!I originally wanted and thought I'd ordered the 4-cup version. When it arrived (very quickly and in terrific condition), I was surprised and a bit disappointed to find that it was the 12-cup version. I have since decided it was divine providence that changed it into the 12-cup machine -- grin! It's been perfect! If I only want a couple cups of coffee, I only MAKE a couple cups of coffee. If I want more, I make more -- the best of both worlds.I love how easy it is to clean; the delay brew feature, so I can wake up to the smell of coffee if I want to; the easy set clock (my power goes out a lot, so that is important to me -- grin!) and just about everything about it. I put in all the fixin's, turn it on, take the dog outside for a yard visit and when I come back in, my coffee is waiting for me -- happy sigh!So far, about the only thing I'm not real fond of is the two-hour auto shut-off. I like to sip my coffee and dawdle a bit. With the auto shut-off, I feel like I have to rush so I can consume the entire pot before it turns off. It would be nice to have some control over whether it is used or not. I'm sure it's a terrific safety feature, but when you're home all day and want to leisurely drink coffee, it's not real conducive to it.
