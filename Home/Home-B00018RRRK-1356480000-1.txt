review/summary: 5 Years & going strongreview/text: Amazon reminded me I ordered this grinder over 5 years ago and I'm still using it on a daily basis. It took me a while to find the setting I liked for the grind (drip) but after that I have been happy with the quality. Yes, it does clump against the side of the bin, I just tap the bin against the counter before I dump the ground coffee into the filter. It's easy to keep clean, I love the holding bin and it has lasted. I can't get over people expecting top quality when they are only spending 1/10th of the price of top of the line. I purchased this after using a blade grinder for years and when it finally wears out, I'll happily replace it with the same grinder.
