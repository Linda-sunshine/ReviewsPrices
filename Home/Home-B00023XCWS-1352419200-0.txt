review/summary: Faster than Micro-Wave? YES!!!!review/text: Love this small electric kettle. I didn't believe it could boil water faster than a microwave but found that the claim was no lie. It has a heavy multi-coil 1000W heater in the bottom of it that heats the water very quickly. It also has safety features like the auto-shutoff once the water starts boiling and auto-shutoff if the kettle goes dry.The size and style of this electric kettle are perfect. It's a definite keeper and I'm very glad I took a chance and bought it. From the many reviews on Amazon, it's clear that lots of buyers like this electric kettle and I can see why. After my first purchase, I liked it so much that I immediately ordered a second kettle to keep at my office.
