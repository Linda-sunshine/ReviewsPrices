review/summary: Non-stick but not roundreview/text: I've only had this pan for a few weeks, but the non-stick qualities are excellent. My only quibble is that the pan isn't round. It is flattened in the &#34;east and west&#34; directions relative to the handle. It bothers me a bit every time I take it out to use it. Also, I had hoped to be able to use a pan cover that I already had to cover the pan when required (since it isn't available with its own lid). Since this pan is out -of-round the cover will not fit well.
