review/summary: Very handy!review/text: I bought this for my wife as a birthday present (don't judge me - she put it at the top of her wish list) and she has been very pleased with it! If we're being honest, I've used it too!It is rather small, but we knew this before buying it (come on, it has the word "mini" in the title!). For small jobs, it performs really well! We have used it for small amounts of guacamole, pesto and even to bring coffee in a pinch (not the easiest way to grind coffee by far!)The build quality is not bad, but definitely not the best! For the price it is decent.Note: GO SLOWLY. We totally purified our first few items in this by pressing and holding the button for what we thought was a relatively short amount of time...turns out this processor is totally efficient and you should start by pulsing and work up.Overall this processor doesn't see too much use due to its size, but when you need a small batch of something it's indispensable!
