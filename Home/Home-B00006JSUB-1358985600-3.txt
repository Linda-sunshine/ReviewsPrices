review/summary: Don't buy this from Amazonreview/text: I usually love to buy from Amazon because I get a good price, I can find items that are not in the store, and the shipping is fast but this is one item that needs to be bought at the store. I ordered this pan as well as the 8 inch, and couldn't wait to try them. The first two that I received- the 10 inch pan's handle was completely broken off and the 8 in had a rust spot on it. The way they package these for shipping is terrible- they are thrown a box with those small shipping air bags. Not the brightest idea for heavy cast iron pans! I did leave feedback on the packaging when I returned the pans but apparently no one cared because the second set of pans arrived packaged the same way. They were not broken but this time they both had flaws in the cast iron finish coming off in a couple of areas. So if I were you buy these in the store! I also found them cheaper at Rural King and see them occasionally at TJ Maxx for a good price. I also plan to season these myself because I do not think the factory seasoning is not that great. I hope this works.
