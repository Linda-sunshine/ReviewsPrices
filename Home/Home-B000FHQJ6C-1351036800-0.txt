review/summary: Shame on Hamilton Beachreview/text: I have had my juicer for less than 60 days and it has already been sent to the curb. After less than 2 months of super frothy juice (Not exactly what I was hoping for) it started smoking and some of the plastic melted. I contacted Amazon and was told to call Hamilton Beach. Once I got them on the phone, they let me know that I was past the warranty date by 7 days for a free replace and free return. Now I must pay a noter $15 for shipping if I want this product replaced. But the only way they will do this is if I send them a picture of my faulty product. They advised me to cut the cord in half and send the pic via e-mail. Horrible customer service. Stay clear of this one. I was hoping for good results, but unfortunately, was disappointed with this product.
