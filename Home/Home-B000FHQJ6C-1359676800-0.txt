review/summary: This juicer is not good for juicing leafy vegetablesreview/text: This is really good juicer. This juicer is ideal for making fruit juices instead of vegetable juices. I didn't realized this until I started trying to juice spinach leaves. However, I still have positive things to say about this juicer and I would recommend this juicer to anyone who is only thinking about making fruit juices
