review/summary: So Pleased!review/text: I was nervous after reading some of the reviews on here, but I am so pleased with this juicer! The motor is strong, and the mouth is large enough to fit whole pieces of fruit/veggies. Cleanup is a breeze, just rinse!I had also read that this was a messy juicer, but it is NOT messy at all. It comes with a cover for the carafe that makes the spout fit very snug.The pulp is fairly dry, but I have been able to get a bit more juice out of it if I re-juice the pulp. This is the ONLY time things get a bit messy, and it is such a small amount of juice that it really isn't worth it.Overall, I am SO pleased! :)
