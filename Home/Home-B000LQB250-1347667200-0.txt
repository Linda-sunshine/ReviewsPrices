review/summary: Comfy and worth the money!review/text: This mattress topper is super comfy! It's pretty soft though, so if you like a little firmer memory foam it's probably not the one for you. I have shoulder pain that kept me from sleeping on my side but this topper allows me to sleep without the pain. I have the same topper in my RV and that is what promoted me to buy this one. Definitely money well spent!
