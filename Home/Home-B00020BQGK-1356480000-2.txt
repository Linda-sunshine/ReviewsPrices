review/summary: I was really surprised how much I like this little vac!review/text: I received this as a gift after picking it out in a catalog....not from Amazon. I just had to share how much I like this. It's really good on linoleum floors and even on bathroom floors with all the nooks and cranies. It does a fantastic job picking up dog hair which I can't even see. The bag fills up quickly but is easy to empty, clean and pop right back in. It's very powerful for a small vac and does the job in a snap. I would recommend this to anyone!
