review/summary: Culligan FM-15RA Faucet Filterreview/text: Very easy to install. So far its working fine. Does not leak or come loose andit removes the same impurities as the more expensive filters.One thing I miss is the fact that there is no indicator that tells you when to change filter. But for the price I'll just replace it about every three months.
