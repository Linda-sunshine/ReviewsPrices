review/summary: Great productreview/text: We use this at least once a week. Very solid and great quality. Nice uniform heat. For cleaning just don't use soap. Use a brush and it should clean up fine. Once it a while you need to oil it or cook some bacon on it to retain the non stick effect.Definitely recommend. It fits over two burners on my gas stove top.
