review/summary: Piece of crapreview/text: The fm radio range is from 104.9-154.9???!! So the radio feature is totally unusable. I'm a former pilot and I've heard local aircraft radio calls on it. Cool except that it is supposed to help my newborn sleep. It catches these calls while it's set to white noise. If you view it from above, for example while standing, it's impossible to see what time it is. The sounds often get stuck. If the white noise didn't sort of work I would have returned it. I'm just sick of buying and throwing away white noise machines.
