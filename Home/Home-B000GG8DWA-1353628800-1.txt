review/summary: It warms up very fast but is not efficient as its wattage appearsreview/text: Yes I know it runs on 800 Watts but for the winter that I used exclusively this heater for my room (not house), my bill went up to $160. Now I use only the central heater for the entire house, I pay only $60 for the heat, $60 for the electricity, that's $40 less.So if you are going to use this heater, use it only for a specific need, like heating while you are smoking on your porch, or like heating while you are working in your garage.It heats up very quick and it does not make any noises. You can't hear it.
