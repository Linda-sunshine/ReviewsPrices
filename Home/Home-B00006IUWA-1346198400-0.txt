review/summary: Arrived broken - doesn't work at all!review/text: What a bummer! I was looking forward to using this and not having to worry about the dangers of microwave popcorn that have been on the news recently. We followed directions and tried to pop our corn, but to no avail, the popper did not pop! We called customer service and they said we received a broken machine. Such a drag! I hate having to pack everything up and go to the post office. I thought that was the point of shopping on line...to save time. Not so!
