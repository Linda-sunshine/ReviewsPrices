review/summary: Comfortablereview/text: I have been extremely pleased with this air mattress. It was was quick and efficient to inflate. The mattress itself is quite comfortable. It does lose a little bit of air within a week. However, the built in pump allows you to fill it back up very quickly.This is a great price for a quality and durable air mattress.
