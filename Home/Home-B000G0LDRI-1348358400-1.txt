review/summary: Works wellreview/text: I bought two for my 4700 ft2 house in AZ. They are quiet and able to keep the house at 35 - 40% humidity. Downside is that I must refill the water tanks daily for my low humidity situation. Honeywell is a brand leader for humidifiers, and I would recommend for purchase.
