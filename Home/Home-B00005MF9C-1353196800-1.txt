review/summary: pretty goodreview/text: this product is easy to use and clean. it heats up any beverage within minutes, making it a fairly versatile product. it will make a cup of coffee, but not a super strong one. if you have a strength preference, this product may disappoint. i have used it to make a quick cup of coffee, tea, hot cocoa, and to heat up apple cider. i'm not crazy about the cup that comes with it- it doesn't keep your drink warm. it is also not very spill proof. i usually make my drink in this cup and transfer it to my travel cup.
