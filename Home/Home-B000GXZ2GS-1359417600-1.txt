review/summary: I would definitely buy it again.review/text: Bought this product because of the overwhelming positive reviews. Ditto. Would definitely buy it again. It makes an excellent cup of coffee WITH SOME EXPERIMENTATION. I like strong coffee and found a finer grind mandatory.It also took some testing to find the proper ratio of water to coffee. But with a little patience you will find a brew that your taste buds will really enjoy. It does take several times through the process to make it reasonably time efficient. I like to clean it after each use to remove the oil residue. That can be quite simply accomplished with a cup of hot soapy water a a clean paper towel. It travels easily and I intend to always have one available. I gave it 4 stars only because getting to a five star cup of coffee was not automatic but took some time to experiment.
