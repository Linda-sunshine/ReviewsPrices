review/summary: With such serious relability posts, I decided to buy another brandreview/text: After reviewing many of the customer reviews, I noticed that the rating are mostly either 5 star or 1 star.The 1 star relates to reliability. The Keurig K-cup systems seem to have a serious reliability issue that Keurig does not appear to be addressing. I have always believed Keurig to be a top quality brand company but apparently this has changed. I have decided not to buy Keurig any longer. I feel if one product line has serious quality issues, then there is an overall serious company quality issue. SO buyers, beware, if you buy the Keurig and it fails, you have been advised.As related to the B60 series, (and other B seriies), the following seem true.The product makes great coffee, when it works.This product is extremely convenent, when it works.This product is attractive, but a waste of space when it quites working.
