review/summary: So far so goodreview/text: Had used a $10 Black and Decker switch-on/-off 4-cup coffeemaker for the past 3-4 years; worked well but wanted to upgrade to a programmable model so that I can prepare the grounds/water the night before and have brewed coffee ready when I get up. The functions on this coffeemaker are easy to understand, but the buttons feel a little cheap. Other things I've noticed after a week's worth of use:-the "cup" size is probably close to 6 oz (the 2 cups I brewed with my B&D; filled a mug-and-a-half, but 2 cups from the Mr. Coffee is ~1 mugful). Unless the 2+ people sharing the coffee don't drink more than that each, they will probably find themselves brewing a second batch for refills.-it brews quickly and quietly (silently!), no sputtering like my B&D.;-has a cord-keeper in the back of the unit so that you don't have excess cord stretched all over the counter.-as other reviewers mentioned the top part/rim of the carafe is angled inward considerably, and it is tough to pour all the coffee out (or pour water from the carafe into the reservoir) without turning the carafe completely upside-down.-wetting the paper filter will help it stick to the sides of its bucket, so that it won't fold in on itself
