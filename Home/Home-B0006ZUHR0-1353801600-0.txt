review/summary: Within 3-months you will get... NO STEAM, LOW HEAT, & LEAKS!!review/text: I purchased this iron 2-times on Amazon.com. The 1st time I purchased this iron was in March 2012. I thought it was awesome "at first". It produced a lot of steam and worked great. Within 3-months time, the amount of steam began to decrease no matter what setting was used. I thought that my husband had somehow done something to the iron which continued to deteriorate; leaking water all over my clothes in addition to not producing enough heat or steam. I decided to purchase another iron for me, and let my husband continue using the bad iron.So, in June 2012.. I purchased this iron again. This time, I was the only person using it; I hid it from my husband. That did not make a difference though ... BECAUSE just like the 1st time I purchased the iron, it worked awesome "at first"; high heat, lots of steam, and no leaking at all. It worked great for about 3-months, then downhill. It hasn't even been 6-months yet and the steam has disappeared, it doesn't get anywhere near as hot as it did when I 1st got it..., AND it's leaking loads of water all over my clothes :(The same is still happening with my husband's iron. The amount of leaking water has increased, drenching my clothes!!The reviews on Amazon are what convinced me to purchase this iron in the 1st place. I believe the reviews are extremely deceptive. Based on my experience, the good reviews had to have been written within the 1st couple months of the purchase. I'd be really interested in seeing the reviews updated to reflect how badly this iron deteriorates within a short amount of time.I should NOT have to purchase an iron every 3-months! I'm very disappointed and do NOT recommend this product to anyone.
