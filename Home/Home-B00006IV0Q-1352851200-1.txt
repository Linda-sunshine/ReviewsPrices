review/summary: Everything I'd hoped for...review/text: The Presto 12 cup is awesome. Have had no problems with grounds. I use the cheap regular drip coffee filters in the basket and it works beautifully. Using Folgers and tastes amazing. The best part is making a pot (removing the basket of grounds and stem within 5 min. after brewing completion) AND then have coffee ALL DAY. Friends and family stop by and there is always HOT, delicious coffee ready. Most people think it's just been fresh brewed. Also, lots of cool comments on the vintage/retro look. I will never go back to a drip coffee maker.
