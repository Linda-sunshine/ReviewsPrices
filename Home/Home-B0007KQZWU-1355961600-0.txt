review/summary: As good as All Cladreview/text: I'll add to the list of folks who have used both and found this to be as good as All Clad. Been using for four years, and LOVE IT. Evenly and quickly heats, easy to clean, and induction ready should we ever get an induction stove. Handles stay fairly cool. Attractive design. I'm very pleased!
