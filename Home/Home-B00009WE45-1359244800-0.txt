review/summary: My favorite thermometer for three yearsreview/text: I am a professional food safety consultant. I have been using the Taylor 9842 for three years. I use it for checking food in deli cases and in refrigerators. I have used it for checking the temperature of the deliveries of perishable foods. It is great for just checking the temperature in a refrigerator or freezer. I just lay it on a shelf, close the door and wait a few minutes for the temperature to stabilize and it is always spot on. I have to say that I like it. I used to use an Comack infrared with a probe. It cost my old company $150 and the battery always died and it was so expensive to calibrate that I would end up throwing it away after 6 months. A guy that I worked with pulled the 9842 out of his pocket and recommended it to me. I used his and at the end of the day, I gave it back and bought my own. I have my first Taylor 9842 from 3 years ago. It found its way into my pocket when I left that job and I still have it and it still works great. I never needed to calibrate it, except to demonstrate to other how to calibrate it. It needed batteries after a year and a half, so I bought a pack of them. I don't use it for hot things much and it acted weird when I tried to check it against boiling water, but it is always spot on in a ice water bath. I bought a second one just for confirming, and they are always close to each other by one or two degrees. I recommend this thermometer without reservations. It works great.
