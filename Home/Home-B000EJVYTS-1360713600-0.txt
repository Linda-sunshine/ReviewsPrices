review/summary: So nice!review/text: I bought this to replace a touchless trash can we had gotten as a gift a few years ago. It is so wonderful in the kitchen. This one isn't as great as our last one, which was a disappointment but it still works great. I wouldn't want to go back to an old style trash can in my kitchen.
