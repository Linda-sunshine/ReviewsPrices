review/summary: The Percs of this coffee makerreview/text: I purchased this percolator for myself because my husband and I love perked coffee but couldn't find the 12 cup size in any store. We love the rich full taste of perked coffee that is kept hot all morning long. The only drawback is the shortened cord. It makes it a bit tricky to pour.
