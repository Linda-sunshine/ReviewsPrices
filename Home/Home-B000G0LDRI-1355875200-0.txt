review/summary: best humidifier I've ever hadreview/text: being an engineer I recognize that is really quite quiet for the amount of variance if you want something to minify your house it has to move air. This is by far the most efficient humidifier I've ever had footing amazing amounts of water into the air with no condensation or problems. In addition it is very easy to refill with the two removable tanks I give this a rating of the best humidifier I've ever seen
