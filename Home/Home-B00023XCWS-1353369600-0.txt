review/summary: Great little teapotreview/text: This is still the best little teapot I've found. I use it to heat water for my cup of Quafeetae every morning.Quafeetae? Well, I was using 2 scoops of Maxwell House Instant Coffee and wanted to use less, but weak coffee is no fun, and green tea is great but wasn't quite enough to get my brain working in the morning, so...I combined them: One scoop of Maxwell House and one green tea bag.But calling it coffee-tea didn't sound very exciting, so I upgraded it to Quafeetae. Do you think Starbucks will pay me for the idea?Back to the Electric Kettle, it keeps on heating and heating and heating, what more could you ask for. I love it.
