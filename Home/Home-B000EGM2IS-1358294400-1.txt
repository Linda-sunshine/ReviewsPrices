review/summary: Not very pleased.review/text: We have had a Sunbeam Hot Shot in our home for over 25 years now. Always loved it! Recently we replaced our older model with this newer one. The quality of this newer model is poor compared to their older model. The water dispense tab is very cheaply made, and has already lost the spring in it. We are very disappointed.My mother also bought this and threw it out after having it one month. She also had an older model and loved it. She said her newer one would make a very high pitch whistle as the water was boiling.
