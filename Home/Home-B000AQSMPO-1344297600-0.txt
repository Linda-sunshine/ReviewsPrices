review/summary: happy with this Keurigreview/text: I originally had a small, one-cup Keurig which, after years of service, finally died. I decided to order a larger one. There are many to choose from, and it's a bit confusing. I wanted one for home-use, and decided on this model. It suits my needs perfectly, can brew several cups (one at a time) for company, or one-cup only. You have a choice of cup sizes- espresso size, medium, or large. Easy to use and to clean...and I am electronically challenged. Very happy with this product.
