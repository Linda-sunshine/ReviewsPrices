review/summary: Lodge 6 qt. Dutch Ovenreview/text: Amazing ! At almost a third the price of the expensive French version, this is hard to beat. Nice heavy and solid. I have already used this a number of times and plan on useing it much more. I also plan on getting a few more in differant sizes. It looks great, lid and pot fit very well and unlike the more expensive version, the edges of the lid and poy are also enameled instead of being bare cast iron ( which is subject to rusting). My only complaint is the ame as others who have posted reviews, the botom of the Lodge is rounded instead of flat which makes browning of large cuts of meat a bit hard. But for the price, who cares...LOLAfter reading many of the older reviews it seems that Lodge has dealt with many of the earlier flaws, plastic knob has been replaced with stainless steel, lid and pot fit great.This thing is a tank !
