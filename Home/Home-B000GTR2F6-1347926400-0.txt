review/summary: think about itreview/text: I bought my first Keurig in April of 2010 and I just received my 5th replacement. They run great for about 6-8 months then just quit. When I call in and give them the serial number they just say have you done all the steps which I do before I call in and they send another in about 7-10 days seems I always have a new one. But I do love my Keurig problems or not.
