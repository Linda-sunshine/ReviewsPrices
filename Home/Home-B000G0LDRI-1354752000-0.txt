review/summary: perfect for 2 bedroom condoreview/text: I was having sinus problems and I bought this humidifier. It humidifies everywhere in the condo. A fill up of water is needed once a day on cold dry days. I would also recommend the purchase of humidity monitors so that you maintain the humidity about 40% to 45% which will greatly improve your sinuses by keeping them moist and less inflamed by dryness. Maybe clean the filter once or twice a week. For people having sinus problems I would recommend this humidifier before getting Vicks stuff. Now, I am off decongestants completely and it is a matter of keeping your unit humidity above 40%.
