review/summary: Very good, butreview/text: This vacuum has terrific suction, it is so strong it sticks to solid surfaces, just open the valve to release suction. Main and big complaint is that the tubes and floor attachment are too flimsy. Otherwise it is a great little vacuum for this small travel trailer, might not like product with the flimsy attachments in a larger area to clean.
