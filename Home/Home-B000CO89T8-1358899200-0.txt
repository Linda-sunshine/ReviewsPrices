review/summary: Seems to workreview/text: I was a bit leary about ordering this as there were a number of complaints that it didn't work. I have a unfinished basement workshop and right now it's about 60 degrees in there. My coffee stays warm for about fifteen minutes normally and now sitting on the warmer for about an hour and a half my coffee is staying warm. It's not steaming hot but it's warm which is more than it is without it. Works for me.
