review/summary: convinient and works greatreview/text: I love this humidifer because you dont need any kind of filter. It's super quiet and my son loves the tiger character so doesn't mind having it in his room. Just make sure you have it at least a foot away from the wall and not sitting ontop of a nice dresser or night stand without being on a towel of some kind. If you have it on the highest setting the area directly around the humidifier gets a little damp and of course you dont want to damage any wood furniture over time.
