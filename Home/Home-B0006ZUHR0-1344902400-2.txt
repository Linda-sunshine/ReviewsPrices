review/summary: Best iron everreview/text: I have only had this iron for a few weeks, but it is wonderful. It makes ironing so easy. I am a huge ironer and have owned many irons and this one is the best so far. And you certainly can't beat the price. I love the digital temperature gauge and the way the chrome plate is so smooth on fabric. I highly recommend this product.
