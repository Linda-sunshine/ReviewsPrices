review/summary: Love shape and sizereview/text: I really love how it easily fits in fridge. Only problem we have had is that you have to make sure it is pushed all the way back on the shelf when you close the door. Not only does the lever on the spout pull forward but it also pushes back. Twice when the fridge door was closed it pushed the lever back and the entire container drained out into fridge and onto floor. So be careful of that
