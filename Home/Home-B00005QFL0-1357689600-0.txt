review/summary: Good, but comes with a surprisereview/text: This is the third bread maker I've owned. I rarely bake bread in the machine, using it primarilty to save my time by making only dough. Other bread makers I've had would complete the dough process in about 1 1/2 hours. The least amount of time for the dough cycly is 2:15 which is for a basic white bread. I make multi grain which takes 3:20. To bake a large loaf of multi grain the time is near 5 hours. I find this extreme. The reason for the excessive time is that the very first cycle is a &#34;rest&#34; cycle of about 1 hour to stabalize the temperature of all ingredients. Maybe this is a good thing though I've made bread successfully for years without this step. Still, the results from this machine are very consistent, more so than other machines I've used. Perhaps they know something I don't, I just get impatient with the time. If you are new to bread making, this is a good quality maker that has had some thought put into it.
