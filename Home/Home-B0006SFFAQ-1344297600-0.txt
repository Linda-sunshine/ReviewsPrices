review/summary: My fourth one! Great coffee, short lifereview/text: I just bought my fourth Cuisinart DCC-1200. Two previously for myself and one for my parents. I have had other pots including Mr. Coffee but nothing compares to Cuisinart. The first had a small leak problem almost immediately but I attributed that to the rough handling it received in the unpacking process. Eventually the leak grew and it was necessary to replace. The second Cuisinart lasted about 19 months and then just stopped working. My parents' is still working but they have only had for 18 months. The coffee maker seems to have an 18-20 month life span. I thought is was just me, until I read the other reviews and everyone seemed to have the same issue. So this time I bought it at Best Buy for about the same price and purchased their two year replacement plan for $14.95. So if this one follows the pattern, I will be able to replace it for free.
