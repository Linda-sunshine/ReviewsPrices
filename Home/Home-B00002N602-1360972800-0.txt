review/summary: Pressure Cookerreview/text: I own several different sized pressure cookers but this is the smallest of 5.I love the stainless steel and the size. This is for the smaller meals as it is just hubby and me, more often than not.Time cooking beans, rice and small portions is great, and I am experimenting with different foods I wasn't sure could bedone in a p/c. I am learning a lot that is surprising me. Awesome pot. The price was way doable also.
