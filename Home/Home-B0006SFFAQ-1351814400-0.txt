review/summary: Still good but it seems like quality took a step back.review/text: I originally purchased one of these models in 2006. It was a good little machine that brewed hot coffee and was easy to keep clean. I recently had to scrap my first model due to some electrical plug problems and purchased a new model. It seems like Cuisinart scrapped the stainless steel exterior for a plastic metallic looking exterior. Virtually everything else is the same but I prefer the older model.Pros:Filters water using a charcoal filter. They're cheap and easy to replace.Easy to program.Brews hot.Easy to clean the carafe and the brew basket.It looks good.Cons:Filling the reservoir can be tricky, it's smaller than most openings.Newer models have slightly lower build quality than the model I purchased in 2006. They must be changing materials to maintain or increase margins during a period of commodity inflation. You can see that in a lot of products these days, this is no exception.Conclusion:Good coffee maker, pretty good value, I like cone filters so this works for me.
