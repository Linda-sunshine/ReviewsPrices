review/summary: Easy to usereview/text: A friend of mine recommended this, and I'm glad she did. It's really easy to use; I can make a fancy latte in ten minutes (including cleanup) for a fraction of the cost of Starbucks! My roommate initially had a bit of trouble reattaching the bar that holds the espresso grounds, but it got easier after a few tries. Note that the top of the steam knob gets hot when using steam, so adjust it carefully.
