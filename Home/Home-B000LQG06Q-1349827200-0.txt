review/summary: Best bet!review/text: We purchased one for our queen bed, earlier this year and love it. It was about half the price as the ones in the stores. There is no plastic odor but a faint minty smell. This was the way to go since we did not want to purchase a new mattress. I recently purchased one for my sons bed. We bought his bed off of C-list, didn't want to pay alot for something he jumps on as much as he sleeps on it. You will not regret buying this, you will feel the difference when you sleep. We also got the waterproof mattress covers on Amazon, and they have really worked great protecting the foam pad.
