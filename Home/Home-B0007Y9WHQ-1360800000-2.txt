review/summary: Works great and easy to clean!review/text: I don't eat wheat and bought the Paderno device to make a replacement for pasta so I can enjoy marinara over a pasta substitute. So far I have only used zucchini and yellow squash to make my vegie pasta but there are a multitude of options. Once I use the Paderno to make the 'noodles' I steam them for 8 - 10 minutes and use it just like spaghetti. It tastes absolutely great and much healther than wheat pasta! Who would have ever thought zuchini could taste so good? It is so easy to clean the Paderno it makes it that much more enjoyable to use. It is a great device for a very reasonable cost.
