review/summary: If the goal is bitter coffee, this one's for you...review/text: This coffee pot looks great and is easy to use. It also makes coffee very quickly which I think may be part of the problem. The resulting coffee is weak and bitter. This product has received great reviews and I wanted it to work but alas, I am back on the hunt for a good coffee maker. I should have stuck with my old Krups.
