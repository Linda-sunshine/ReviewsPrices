review/summary: Fantastic Product!review/text: I got mine a few years ago so it still says Pizzazz Pizza Oven, whereas the new ones say Pizzazz Plus (I don't know why Amazon hasn't changed the title yet) and lists a bunch more that it can do besides pizza, but they are essentially the exact same machine. I can still do the new stuff on mine as well, just following the instructions for the newer machines. This thing can bake any kind of pizza you can think of. I've even made Stouffer's French bread pizzas, though it's better to make two on opposite sides instead of one in the middle. The square DiGiorno pizzas like the garlic crust ones have to have the corners trimmed off a little, but other than that, it can pretty much cook any frozen or fresh pizza. I even make my own white pizza using fresh, risen dough, Alfredo sauce with ricotta cheese mixed in, and mozzarella spread on top. It bakes up wonderfully and the ricotta sets up well. So much better than heating your house up with the oven when the A/C is trying to keep it cool in the middle of the summer. This is probably the best small appliance that I have ever purchased and it makes life so much simpler when it comes to cooking pizza quickly and almost effortlessly. A great product.
