review/summary: I am steamedreview/text: After reading the reviews, I was excited to get this Hoover SteamVac. After assembling it from a less than thorough product manual, I turned it on and it did not work. The scrubbers did not spin. While this may have been an occasional product defect, I am not so sure I will repurchase it. The parts of made of cheap plastic and I have the feeling this is not a long lasting product anyway. Let's see if Hoover and Amazon make it right.
