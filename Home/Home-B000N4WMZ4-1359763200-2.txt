review/summary: Enamel chipped before I used it!review/text: I love this color. I love the idea of this product. I read the reviews about the chipped enamel and I thought, Well, I'll give it a shot! I took a chance and bought this one and before I even used it, there is enamel chipping off of the handle. I can tolerate a good amount of odd cosmetic things and the fact that it is on a handle shouldn't be such a big deal. But! This has never been used. If the enamel is actually flaking off of this product before I've gotten to make anything in it, how long before it starts chipping in a place that is more likely to leave fragments in my food?! Plus, $50 is a lot less than The Mega Dutch Oven Brand, but it's nothing to sneeze at. Back it goes! And I have no idea what to do now. I don't want to try a cheap brand, but I really don't want to shell out a third of a mortgage payment on a kitchen pot that I'll probably use 3 times a month. :/
