review/summary: Pinzon Basics Micro Bead Pillowreview/text: I think this pillow is top quality and is packed full with the microbeads. Maybe a little too full. The pillow is too hard really because the beads can't move around. I do like to use it for sitting up in bed but not for sleeping. I have not noticed the beads escaping like I read in some of the other reviews. I think it's a great pillow, just not what I was expecting. I was expecting something more like the cheap version you buy at novelty stores or Walmart. Would I recommend? Yes, for someone who needs a very firm, thick pillow it is excellent.
