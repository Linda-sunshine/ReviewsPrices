review/summary: Like the Sharpenerreview/text: Bought it the other day. Was able to sharpen every knife in the kitchen in about an hour.Two complaints (if they are complaints):One thing to get used to is figuring out the proper blade angle. Since the blade slots are wide enough to accomodate most blade, you must consciously hold the blade against one side for a proper angle.The other issue is the lack of power when polishing an edge in the far right slot. The grinding wheel goes into a stall more easily in this slot.But, there is not much effort getting used to these minor issues.I would buy this again.
