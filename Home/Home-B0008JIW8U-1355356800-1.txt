review/summary: Great little machinereview/text: I bought this to replace a machine of the same make and model, which served me well for 7 years before finally wearing out. I love its size and simplicity -- it does the job well and doesn't take up much counter space. Also, it doesn't drip onto the burner when you remove the pot. I'll keep buying this model as long as they keep making it!
