review/summary: Not exactly as pictured, but works very wellreview/text: The scale that I received varied slightly in appearance, but it's still a very good value. I've had it for several months now, and it still works perfectly after frequent use. Since it's only accurate to tenths of a gram it may not be precise enough for all uses, but it's very simple, rugged and functional. There's not much more you can ask out of a scale. Don't let the bargain price fool you, this scale is a wonderful choice for most purposes.
