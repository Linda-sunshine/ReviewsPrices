review/summary: Not too sure how this product worksreview/text: I never had a chance to use the product as the product voltage was probably not compatible with mine as I live in Singapore. The product, when first plugged into the electricity socket, started shooting sparks. The product, when inserted into a different socket and different converter blew the electricity in my building causing all the lights to go out and fridge to turn into an oven.If you are in Singapore, may think about just buying this at cold storage.
