review/summary: Long Term Usage Report - Good Dealreview/text: When I bought this kettle I really wanted something a little more classy and upscale, but I could not find anything that I really liked and had at least basicly good reviews. They all seemed to cost significantly more and were no better. I needed one ASAP so I just went with the least expensive option (this one at the time) and figured I'd start my search for a really good one. While after almost 2.5 years I'm still using this one because it really worked well. I use it at least once a day, and of course sometimes several times a day, and it works and looks pretty much as if it was new. What I don't like is relatively minor. I would really prefer the light to be at the back rather than on the side, often the pot is orientated that I can't see the light, two lights might be the best. The water level window at the back fogs all the time and has poor visibility, is seems like it needs an air hole at the top, but because it is located right behind the handle it's hard to for me to drill one, but I will go it as best I can in the next month or so just to see if it improves the visibility. The switch does feel very flimsy, but it works and I'm gentle with it and the pot always stays in one place so I'm not having to constantly pack it away where it might get damaged. I'd love it if it had a little beep when it turned off, right now I listen for the slight click sound of the switch as it turns off. If it's quiet I can hear it quiet easily, but not if there is any real noise level. Bottom line: good kettle for the price, don't pay more unless you get something more without losing the benefit of reliable operation.
