review/summary: I'M IN LOVE!review/text: I've been using my new spiral slicer every evening to make zucchini spaghetti with spaghetti sauce. Very enjoyable. But tonight I tried oven baked sweet potato curly fries. A sweet potato sliced with the large pasta blade, 20 minutes in the oven at 350. Wow! Some curls quite crisp, some still a little soft. And very delicious. Have been following Dr. Fuhrman's Eat to Live protocol, and this little gadget makes it even more enjoyable! I think I'm enjoying my new way of eating more than I did the old!
