review/summary: Great little hotplate for my tea mugreview/text: I'm a slow drinker, I sip from my mug all day while I work, so I wanted something to keep my coffee and tea hot, without me having to pop my mug in the microwave (Which still really doesn't solve the cold coffee/tea problem, since I tend to heat it up then get dragged away from my desk for 20 minutes, only to return to cold mug. Again.)For $10, this is worth the bang for your buck. True, it doesn't get really hot, but I've gotten half a mug of cold tea to warm temperatures just by leaving it on this hotplate. What I think it's really better for is keeping hot drinks hot for longer periods of time, so I can get called away from my desk and still come back to a hot cup of coffee. So I'm deducting a star, because it doesn't really heat up drinks, but very useful for keeping drinks hot, or at least warm enough to feel good while drinking.
