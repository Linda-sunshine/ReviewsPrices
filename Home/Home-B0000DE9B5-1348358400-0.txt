review/summary: Very nice sealing jugreview/text: I have been very pleased with this jug.I purchased 2 units to cold brew coffee in (for iced coffees), and I find the jug to be excellent.Product consists of the glass base and the plastic + rubber top. The top consists of 4 separable parts that are somewhat complicated in their assembly (it takes 5 minutes to learn how to put the top parts together to make the top), but does indeed work perfectly, provided the top is completely screwed on. All parts are dishwasher safe. The top can be hard to screw and unscrew sometimes; to unseal, it sometimes takes muscle power and makes my fingers hurt.My only complaint about the glass base is that the handle is kind of small and close to the base. I don't have the tiniest hands, and it can be kind of a tight fit to put my hands around the handle. I use the handle to horizontally rotate the jug to mix the contents of the jug from time to time. However, I can do it, so it is not a real problem. I just wish the handle were bigger.The shape of the glass jug is terrific - it is like a slightly tall cube - very compact. I like this shape better than a taller cylinder. The jug holds 2000 g of water (completely filled) (I checked) - just as the description says.I can share my recipe for the iced coffee if anyone is interested. It is so good!!! I learned how to make it during the heat of this past summer, but it is the most enjoyable way for me to drink coffee from now on, even in cold weather.I took off 1 star for: the handle being minimally sufficient and the top being a bit complicated and difficult to seal and unseal sometimes. But this jug is by far the best solution to my need that I could find, and I'm very happy with it.
