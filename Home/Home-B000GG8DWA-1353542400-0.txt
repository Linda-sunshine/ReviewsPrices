review/summary: Toasty Morning Bathroomreview/text: I like sleeping in a chilly room, but I HATE having a cold bathroom in the morning. This heater, combined with an inexpensive plug-in timer, has been my perfect solution. I have the timer set to turn the heater on about an hour before I get up, and it shuts it off about the time I leave in the morning.The low setting is great for my small bathroom, so at only 400 watts, I'm saving lots of money on operating costs compared to the little 1500w ceramic heater I used to have.I know YMMV in terms of quality on these cheaper electronics, and I may be one of the lucky ones. I bought this heater Dec, 2010 and use it daily for about four months out of the year, as described above. I have had zero issues with it and it's more than paid for itself.If you want to heat your whole den or living room, I don't think this is the heater for you, but for a bathroom or small bedroom (like a nursery, maybe), this is a great, cost effective option.
