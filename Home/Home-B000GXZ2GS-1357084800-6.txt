review/summary: Better than a french pressreview/text: Forget the single-cup Keurigs and the like. To make a cup at a time, this is far superior since you can use much higher-quality coffee than the junk in the pods. The AeroPress is very easy to use and very fast.I do not use it to make my morning coffee since I like the brightness, or acidity, of the first couple of mugs that I get using my Bunn drip brewer. But for subsequent cups, the Aeropress is great. The coffee is much mellower and less acidic and ideal for an afternoon or evening cup. I just use the Bunn to heat the water.Cleanup is a snap. When you push the press all the way down, you'll find that the coffee grounds are mostly squeezed dry and will fall out like a cake into the trash. Ten seconds of rinsing off the plastic and you're done.This ain't high-tech, folks. It does one thing only, but does it really well.
