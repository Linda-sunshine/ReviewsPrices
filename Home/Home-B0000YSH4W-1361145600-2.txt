review/summary: THe Giverreview/text: Excellent work and I got this book for my granddaughter for Christmas as it was on her list. I haven't read it but Lois Lowery has been on many H/S reading list as a former bookstore owner. I would stock her books and would suggest to local schools to place her titles in their schools library . A must read for any child from 8 yrs to 15 yrs .
