review/summary: Great gadget for pasta makingreview/text: I just got into making home made pasta. I wanted to make macaroni, but I didn't want to spend a ton of money. I found this little pasta maker, and for the price, decided it was worth a try.The first time I tried to use it, I was in a hurry. I put it together the way the picture shows. I had a lot of issues. The metal blade seemed to be stripping away the plastic of the pasta making piece. So I used my other pasta maker and decided to wait until I had more time to use it.The second time I used it, the same thing happened. At this point, I was very frustrated. I found the companies phone number, and called them to ask for help. I was connected with a very nice woman who figured out that I was supposed to be using the metal piece for making pasta. DUH. I told her I wish the instructions were a little clearer.I took the little piece out, and was rolling out noodles like crazy. The only down side is that you have to crank, crank, crank, stop, pick up a knife, slice off each noodle, and then start again. Making a pound of pasta took a very long time. However, the noodles were really cool looking. This worked exactly the way it was supposed to work. Would I buy it again? For $26, yes. Is it fun to use? Yes.I have not ground meat in it, or tried to make sausages. Making pasta with it is good. Just make sure your pasta dough is not too moist or your noodles will stick together.I gave it four stars for the bad instructions and the having to manually cut each noodle off.
