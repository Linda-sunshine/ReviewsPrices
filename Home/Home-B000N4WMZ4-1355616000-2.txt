review/summary: It's Perfect!review/text: Arrived in perfect condition. I used it twice in the first week. So easy to clean, distributes and holds heat well, lid is a perfect fit, and it goes from stovetop to oven without worry. Obviously it's heavy when full, but that is why it works so well. Do read the washing and care instructions. Don't put the hot pot in water, let it cool first. Handle with care since porcelain is glass. I'd strongly recommend saving the rubber rim protectors for storage; perhaps the box too. The black around the rim is also coated, not just cast iron as it appears to be.
