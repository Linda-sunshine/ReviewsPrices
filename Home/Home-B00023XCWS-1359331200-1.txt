review/summary: Simple, inexpensive, and effective.review/text: After seeing thousands of positive reviews on this kettle, I chose it over the more-expensive and prettier stainless steel ones. I could not be happier. It's extremely easy to use and works exactly as I was hoping. If you want an attractive metal kettle, this isn't for you but if you don't mind putting it in your cabinet when you're done, this is a perfect kettle for coffee or tea.
