review/summary: no pressure points and no sinkingreview/text: I really enjoy this mattress topper. I sleep in absolutely every position possible and the padding keeps the pressure off of my hips. Like many of the reviewers, I have a physical pain issue in my lower back due to a genetically absent part of my L5. The pain was sometimes alright with my old egg-shell yellow atrocity foam mattress pad, but I began to think I could do better.I was drawn to this item by the sheer quantity and quality of the reviews, as well as the promise of a hypo-allergenic ick-resistant breathing foam support object. The item itself is the same size as a (twin) mattress, fits easily under my normal sheets, and it makes being in bed very comfortable. When I am on my side my shoulders and hips (which are bonier than they used to be) just sort of sink into the pad a bit--just enough that the pressure is removed and my spine stays straight.Right out of the box, yes, there is a significant mint smell. It fades in a few days and is quite nice. Air it out for the first 24 hours (48 if you can't stand the mint).If you are looking for a little more support, if you really enjoy being comfortable, if you have any kind of hourglass or pear shaped figure, if you are looking for something that is genuinely kind to your pressure points, give this thing a whirl.The very short version of this review is that I like this product so much I'm getting one for my Mum.
