review/summary: Presto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Popper, Whitereview/text: this pops corn. the plastic parts are horribly fragile and cheaply made, but I did not see any alternative. it came in good delivery time. But it is already somewhat broken and I have to put a saucer on top of it to keep it from blowing popcorn all over the room.
