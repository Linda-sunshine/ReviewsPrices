review/summary: My second one in 30 yearsreview/text: If you have or had an older Cuisinart and need to replace it as I did, this is a great model. It has all the same features as the original so you can pretty much just start using it without a big learning curve. Most of the blades from the older model work with this one so don't throw those out.
