review/summary: NOAA RADIOreview/text: This radio seems to work okay.I have not had any warnings yet to rate it.The down side of it is:the screen is not visible when you look straight at it:.If you get down closer to table level it becomes very visible like getting to far to the side of the old flat screen TV it disappears.I don't usually look at the screen much so I'm not going to return it.I don't know if they are all like that or not.My old one was a Midland cheaper model and it wasn't that way.It's just irritating when you have to do something to the radio.I also couldn't find a tornado warning on it.It has a tornado watch but I couldn't find the warning setting.That don't mean that It's not there.
