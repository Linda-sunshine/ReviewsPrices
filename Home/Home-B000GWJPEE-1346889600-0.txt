review/summary: this product is for show onlyreview/text: Bought this product to add humidity to our sons bedroom. It looks cool, is quiet, shoot out the foggy mist in the air, but it does not do the most important thing that it suppose to....add humidity. We had it running every night throughout the the whole night and it just doesn't work. It works as a cool looking accessory...that's it. If you are looking for humidifier, don't waste your money on this product and buy the real thing. You and your baby/child will be much happier.
