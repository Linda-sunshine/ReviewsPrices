review/summary: Who buys a chair online? I did.review/text: Others reviews were positive and this appeared to be higher quality than what I was finding at local stores. Arrived in 2-days with Amazon Prime.The box is large and I&#8217;m guessing around 50 pounds &#8211; so plan for this on the day of delivery.Assembly takes about 15 minutes &#8211; pretty straight forward. I placed the seat on the box to use as a table during assembly. Only semi difficult part was getting the center piston to extend &#8211; once that happened everything went tighter perfectly.I&#8217;ve had for 2 weeks and am very happy &#8211; a good purchase. Chair is comfortable and has enough adjustments for what I need.
