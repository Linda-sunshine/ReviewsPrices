review/summary: Makes Wonderful Coffeereview/text: I am a bit of a collector of non-mainstream methods for brewing coffee so I bought the AeroPress on a whim while doing some online gift shopping. It's a simple device so my expectations were minimal but I can honestly say it brews the best-tasting cup of coffee I've ever made at home. It's easy to learn to use and simple to clean up, and since you can re-use the filters many times there is minimal post-purchase cost (other than coffee, of course). I've used it many times and it makes average coffee taste good and great coffee taste amazing, noticeably outperforming my french press. I read somewhere that (counter-inuitively) heat is harmful to the flavor of coffee so I think the secret of this device is it brews with minimal exposure to overheated water. It has a very smooth finish similar to cold brewing methods I've tried but is much faster and, in my opinion, extracts better flavor. Of course, coffee taste is a personal preference so if you enjoy more bitter, high-acidity coffees then this might not be the method for you. If you enjoy flavorful, milder brews with a smooth finish then I highly recommend you give it a try!
