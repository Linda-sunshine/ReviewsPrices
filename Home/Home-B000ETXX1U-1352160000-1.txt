review/summary: We now have FOUR purchased at Amazon!!review/text: Great air mattress. Our son moved to Boston for his medical residency and didn't have much time so we got one Wenzel Queen air Mattress. He loved it and told us it had the feel and comfort of a regular mattress. He decided to get 2 more for the second bedroom. We went up to visit him and slept on one in the second bedroom and decided to get one for our home. It is high enough to get off easily and is extremely comfortable. We would highly recommend the Wenzel air mattress! Amazon's price was great and the delivery was expeditious...Great purchase!!!
