review/summary: They're Great!review/text: Now that I've used these sheets for a while now, I figured it was time to write a review. These sheets fit well on my queen mattress. I like the way the sheets are wrinkle free, and I pull them out from the dryer and throw them straight on my bed without having to pull out the iron. No piling, very smooth and I get a good night's rest. Plus, the sheets don't make me hot or sweat. I highly recommend these sheets!
