review/summary: Great pan at this pricereview/text: I have/had a nice hard anodized pot and pan set that was starting to wear out. After watching the review on America's Test Kitchen I got the 12.5&#34; and this one to replace them. I have had this for two months now and I haven't noticed any difference in the heat distribution or how something cooks in this pan versus those more expense pans. Obviously since it's brand new the non-stick surface works great and these are a breeze to clean.Keep in mind that extra 1/2&#34; - I had to get a universal lid (which was a unique challenge because of the raised handle; just any over-sized lid will not work).
