review/summary: Nothing betterreview/text: This is my favorite waffle maker. I originally had this one for about 10-12 years. When it finally conked out on me in 2011 I was devestated. i received 2 other Belgian waffle makers as gifts but they just could not replace the Morning Maker. I finally treated myself to another Morning Maker and I am so completely over the moon. It's so easy to use and makes the best waffles. You will not be disappointed. I promise you.
