review/summary: Easy and consistent, but makes very thin waffles (NOT BELGIAN)review/text: As most have said, the price, quality, and ease of use of this product are all excellent. Setting it to level 3 produces slightly browned and crispy waffles every time. HOWEVER, one flaw has me back on this site shopping for a new one: the waffles are very thin! The finished waffles are about 1/2" thick, where I was hoping for something more like a restaurant waffle that is closer to 1" thick. EDIT: Now that I've read further, I am realizing that the thick waffle I am looking for is a Belgian waffle. As a waffle rookie, I didn't know that! If you want the thicker ones, get a Belgian maker. If you like the thin, this is a great deal.
