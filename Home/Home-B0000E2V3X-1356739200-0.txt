review/summary: Great Pizza Panreview/text: Reviews on this pan are not exaggerated (the 5 star reviews that is)Every cook knows that you need the right tools for the job. The best pizza recipes from a favorite pizzeria or hand-me-down-heirloom-recipe is going to shine if you have the right tools.Pizza requires uniform high-heat and consistency during baking. This pan delivers.Pros:Pre-seasoned (you need to keep it in good shape over time)Great handles!!! Easy to grab and carry.Can be pre-heated to 500 degrees and won't warp.Pizza slides right off.Pizza cooks evenly - No soft, mushy, uncooked portions.You don't need to sprinkle corn meal or anything to keep the dough from sticking.Cons:You have to take care of it properly or it will rust. It is IRON, after all.Observation:Even though it is not a griddle, you can use in on top of the stove if you wish, just don't expect the entire cooking surface to reach the same temperature all around at the same time. The limitation here is the size and BTU output of the burners, not the pan.How to season this pan and all other cast iron cookware?Google this: Chemistry of Cast Iron Seasoning: A Science-Based How-To or go directly to the link (if Amazon allows the link)[...]How to clean it?Wipe it with a paper towel (after it cools down) - If you need to wash with water, use a soft plastic brush from the dollar store and wipe dry. Add a thin coat of flax seed oil and wipe almost dry.You can put the pan in the oven and turn it to 200 degrees to allow any moisture to evaporate if you don't think you wiped dry enough. Once temperature is reached, turn oven off and let it all cool off naturally. This last step prevents warping.Enjoy making the best pizza you ever made.
