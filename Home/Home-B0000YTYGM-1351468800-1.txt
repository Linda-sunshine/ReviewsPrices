review/summary: It leaked coffee all over the counter until the lid was replaced by Cuisinartreview/text: Update after receiving new lid from CuisinartWe haven't had any problems since using the new lid that Cuisinart sent us. It looks exactly the same as the old lid and our problems started after a month of using it eery day with the original lid. I will update the review if we have any more problems. Meanwhile, I will add another star as we now really like the coffeemaker.----first update----Update on my review, I am changing from one star to two stars, adding a star for great customer support from Cusinart! I called Cuisnart and they are sending me a new lid for free to try to fix the problem, they said I have a defective lid. It will take 7 to 10 days for me to get the new lid. If it works well I will upgrade this review again.----original review----Horrible Horrible Horrible! We bought the Cuisinart DTC-975BK from Amazon in July, the first two months it worked well, now just three months later (Cctober) it is a disaster. If we make more than four cups of coffee at a time, the coffee spills all over the counter and the floor. We wash the lid, we use Cuisinart filters that are the correct size, we use Starbucks coffee beans ground for a drip coffee maker, we make sure it is closed all the way, we make sure the word "pour" is pointed in the right direction, yet the coffee that is brewing in this coffeemaker still spills over and makes a huge mess.If you want to start your day cleaning up spilled coffee, mopping the floor, and removing everything from the counter to clean the counter, waste a lot of coffee beans, and then only have one cup of coffee if you are lucky, then this is for you, However if you want a nice cup of coffee in the morning, look elsewhere for a different brand of coffeemaker.The 99 dollars we spent on the Cuisinart DTC-975BK is wasted. It is not worth the stress and we don't want to start our day in a bad mood anymore.
