review/summary: Really cool ironreview/text: This iron is just great. It is really slick and does a great job ironing with little effort. It heats up very quickly (surprisingly quickly in my opinion) and is heavy enough to do much of the work without me having to press down too hard. I read that the flip cover for the water container for the steamer can break off pretty easily. I am a pretty careful person so I'm not sure if that point is valid. I've had it for about 3 months now and everything still works great. The iron surface is stainless steel so it doesn't have any stains on it even though I use the steam settings every time I iron.
