review/summary: Easy to use, inexpensive, but have to clean it oftenreview/text: I've owned this machine for 8 months now, and it's still going strong. I don't understand why some people have so much trouble with it, but you have to keep in mind the following:1. Clean the coffee filter often, and that means taking it apart by unscrewing the plastic part at the bottom. Fine coffee particles tend to clog this, thus reducing water flow.2. Remove the screw that holds the metal filter (where the coffee basket is attached) and clean it as well.If you did this once a week, your machine will function fine.
