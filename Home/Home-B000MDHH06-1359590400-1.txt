review/summary: I love this applicancereview/text: I found it easy to clean, easy to work, and its easy to juice. I do fold a scott towel into quarters and put it under the measuring cup when the juice comes out and that fixes the uneven surface of my counter top and keeps the juice from missing the cup... whatever... a simple fix. I take the stuff that isn't juice and throw it into my compost pile and that's great because its all in tiny pieces and composts faster. When it starts up and then goes off, it sounds like a rocket ship with a big whirrrrrr. I kind of like it!
