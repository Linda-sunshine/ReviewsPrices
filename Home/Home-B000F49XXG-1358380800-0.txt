review/summary: disappointingreview/text: I don't know... maybe it's operator error. I read the reviews, I thought I cold get this to operate but after many, many efforts I have abandon it. I've had espresso machines in the past and never had a problem. This is noisy, the &#34;green&#34; light that says it's hot enough to use stays on only a few seconds, then, what? I'm suppose to wait again when the cup is only one fifth full??? Just not a well thought out machine... at least for this gal...
