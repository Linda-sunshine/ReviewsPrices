review/summary: It works, mostly.review/text: I love corkscrews, so I had to buy this. Overall it works well. I bought my parents one of these as they have a hard time with manual corkscrews. I like the unit, but there are caveats.Composite and plastic corks can be problematic. To be fair I have only had one or two plastic corks this unit failed to pull. It has shredded a couple of composite corks and torn the side out of a few normal corks because it fails to align properly. Overall, it works reasonably well. I recommend this for elderly folks that have a hard time with manual corkscrews, or for anyone like me that cannot resist another silly gadget. I would buy this product again.
