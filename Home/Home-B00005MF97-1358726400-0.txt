review/summary: Great...until it broke!review/text: I used this affordable little chopper several times and loved it. The last time I started to use it I noticed that the plastic housing that holds the blade in place was not just cracked, but broken in half! The pin will no longer stay firmly in the bowl. The work bowl is not available for replacement. My recommendation is to skip this item and go for the more expensive Cuisinart or KitchenAid choppers. It costs less in the long run.
