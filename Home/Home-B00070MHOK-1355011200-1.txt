review/summary: Ok for removing light wrinkles quickly, but it is no replacement for a real Iron.review/text: I use this primarily for daily use of my dress shirts. Compared to having to pull out an ironing board it is faster, but not by much. I like it so I don't have to pull out the ironing board. There's definitely a technique you need to learn to use this so that your shirts look decent. However, if you have bad wrinkles or need to look really crisp it cannot replace a good old fashioned iron. It might be because this is not a really heavy duty steamer, but if you're looking for something to quickly remove wrinkles within a few minutes in the morning without the hassle of an ironing board. This will work fine.
