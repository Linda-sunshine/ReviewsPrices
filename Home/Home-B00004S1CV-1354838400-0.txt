review/summary: liked it so much I bought it for a friend!review/text: I bought this thermos at Teavana years ago and love it -- I can make a cup of tea in the morning and forget about it, and six hours later the tea is still hot. It seals up completely so you can just throw it in your bag. The interior is stainless steel so you don't have to worry about plastic leaching chemicals or cracking, and you can scrub the heck out of it with steel wool if you need to get coffee/tea residue out. It's held up for years and I am buying one for a friend as a gift. The insulation capabilities are truly amazing.
