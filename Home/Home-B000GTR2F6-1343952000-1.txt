review/summary: Watery coffeereview/text: I'm still breaking it in so I haven't tried a lot of cups. I'm noticing though for at least some, but hopefully not all of the k-cups, it's a weak brew if you go past 8 ounces. Now, I don't know about you, but I'm used to at least a 12 ounce starbucks tall. 50% less as the normal tolerable cup of coffee isn't great. If I have 2 well then the economics start to not be as compelling. I'll probably try some brands that I know have strong followings to see if it's true across the board. However, even 8 ounces is watery in this brand which I have not found to be true for others so hope is still alive.
