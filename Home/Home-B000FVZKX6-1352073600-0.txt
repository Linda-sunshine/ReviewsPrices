review/summary: Well madereview/text: Silky flannel sounds like an oxymoron but it's true in this case. I am thrilled about the quality of these sheets and also happy to have selected a product made in Europe! Time will tell about how these wear, but I was so thrilled with the feel of these sheets that I ordered the duvet cover. I will follow up with my review after repeated use but at this point, I have no hesitation about recommending this product!
