review/summary: Great for the office when the facility nazis won't let you make your own.review/text: I use this at the office and it works great. Cheaper than buying fresh made, better than the free co. perk of liquidy syrupy coffee from a dispenser (who knows how long its' been stored).The coffee press is simple to use, just get your water temp right and a fine grind. You can even run it through again if you can't get it strong enough the first time.Easy to clean and I have reused the filters a few times without issue.The thing is so light you can carry it in your backpack or 'larger' purseA great conversation piece and icebreaker friend maker in the co. kitchen.Can't think of anything bad to say about.If your coffee at work tastes like crap and you don't want to pay big buck$ for a decent cup of coffee. This is for you.You will need a hot hot water source.
