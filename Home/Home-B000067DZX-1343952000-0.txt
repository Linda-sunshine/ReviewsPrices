review/summary: Good filter but have had some failuresreview/text: I have used these filters with the DS-1800Z water dispenser for 2+ years. I live in a Third World country and all our drinking water, tea, coffee, etc. comes from these filters. They do a good job. I give them a 4-star rating because we get about a 10-20% failure rate when we 'first' install them. We follow the directions (soaking and rinsing them before installation) but they appear to be clogged and will not pass water. Nothing can be done except to throw them away and try another. I have written to Customer Support but haven't heard back from them yet. Yet, they are a good filter and I will continue to use them even though 1 in 5-6 is bad. In fact, I just bought 12 more from Amazon.
