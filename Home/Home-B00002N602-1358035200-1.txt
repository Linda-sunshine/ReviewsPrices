review/summary: Why I like my new pressure cookerreview/text: I broke the handle on one of my two existing 4-quart Presto pressure cookers and couldn't face Christmas cooking for house guests without a second; hence my purchase. It's great, looks lovely and shiny, works well but I shall be glad when I get a replacement handle for my other 4-quart-er because as they use less water than the larger size, they cook more quickly.
