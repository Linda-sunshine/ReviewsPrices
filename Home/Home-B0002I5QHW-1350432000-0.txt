review/summary: Great grinder!!!review/text: I decided to try and grind my own burger meat and reviewed lots of grinders and actually went to stores and opened the boxes and looked at the grinder they had. Got on Amazon and ordered this one and WOW!!! I am very impressed. Easy to put together and the suction works well. It's only come un-stuck on me one time out of 5 uses. Grinds very well, and the handle turns easily.I was fretting the cleanup but found that it only takes a couple of minutes due to the fact that the machine comes apart and its all so easy to access.If you've never tried to grind your own burgers I'd highly recommend it. The taste is so much better and after you experiment with different meats and the fat content(I use bacon) You will never buy hamburger again!!
