review/summary: Cant go wrong with a Lodgereview/text: I make a lot of stews soups and braised recipes. This heavy duty fantastic Lodge Dutch Oven is great for that and it will last a lifetime or two!!! I have made Lamb Shanks in it and Braised Short Ribs it does a beautiful job going from stove top to oven. It comes pre seasoned which is a plus.
