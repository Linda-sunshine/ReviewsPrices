review/summary: I love this coffeemaker!review/text: I purchased this coffeemaker about a month ago, and I absolutely love it! There is no warmer plate, so the coffee doesn't "cook" during the day. The stainless steel carafe really keeps the coffee hot for several hours. It is easy to use, and my gold filter fits perfectly into the filter basket. I have owned 4 cuisinart coffeemakers over the last 10 years. The first two lasted 3 years, but the last two gave out after only two years, so I was ready to try something new. It seems that there is less to go wrong with this machine. I read a few reviews that mentioned it was difficult to line up the carafe correctly to prevent coffee from spilling down the sides of the carafe, but I haven't had any problems - it would be pretty hard to screw it up. I've used this at least once a day since I received it, and have never had a problem. It makes good coffee that stays hot. The only drawback (and it's a small one) is that it's a little hard to judge just how much coffee is left in the carafe. Overall, I think this is a good buy.
