review/summary: Helps the grocery bill when juicingreview/text: I bought this model to replace juicer that was pretty decent but wasted a lot of what I was juicing and left the pulp too wet for me. I have used this for a few weeks now and love it. It isn't perfect, what juicer is?, but works better to get as much juice out of the produce as possible. They really do mean it when they say to go back and forth between soft and hard produce. The feed tube is smaller than my old unit, which means cutting up items more but it doesn't slow me down because I can cut and feed the tube at the same speed. The clean up on this unit is awesome. Takes me about 2 minutes with only a little scrubbing. The parts dry quick on my dish rack and I reassemble it for the next round without having to wait all day for metal parts to dry (like my old one).I would definitely recommend this juicer.
