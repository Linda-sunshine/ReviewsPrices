review/summary: Great when it works; eventually flows too slowreview/text: Just Google "pur water filter slow". Many people have complained about how the filter works too slowly.It worked fine at first, but after a couple of weeks, the flow from the filter slows significantly. The filter is supposed to last longer than a few weeks and we believe we drink a fairly normal volume of water. Yes, when it works, the water does taste "cleaner" than the water from a Brita filter but if it takes a day to filter a tank of water, who cares?I may switch back to Brita unless Pur addresses these complaints.You may say it's unfair to give this a negative review -- that I should review the filter instead. I want to make sure people people know about the problems with the filters because the dispenser is obviously useless without functional filters.----UPDATE: I switched to the Culligan on-faucet filter which is highly-rated on Amazon. It also has the same problem as the Pur where after about a month, the water flow decreases significantly. Maybe these filters just aren't designed to handle NYC water. I'm currently using this pitcher without the filter installed and filling it up with the water from the Culligan on-faucet filter.
