review/summary: Excellent Quality, that is rarely seen todayreview/text: I had been using a water bath canner and recently decided I wanted to get into using a pressure cooker/canner to tackle something other than jams and jellies. When the AA 921 arrived, I could not believe the quality of the item. It is truly a piece of craftsmanship that will last far longer than I will. Even the box and the instruction booklet have a quality to them that is rarely seen today. You can definitely tell that this item was made here in the U.S.A., because it shows, in every regard. Absolutely fantastic! Thank you to All American for a fantastic product, and thank you to Amazon as well for providing a great service.
