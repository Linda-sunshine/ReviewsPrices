review/summary: Just the right sizereview/text: Had been searching for a reasonable priced personal coffee maker that didn't use the pods. This is the one. Makes a great cup of coffee, simple to use. Easy to clean with the permanent filter - no filters to buy. Nice the coffee mug is included also. I use this all the time now instead of my larger coffee maker and always have a fresh cup.
