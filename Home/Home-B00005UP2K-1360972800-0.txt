review/summary: Holy Freakin!review/text: This beast is amazing. My wife broke her arm in 2011 and i got this for her in 2012. Now it's been a year and this thing has been amazing for her. She shattered her humorous bone and so it's hard to use hand mixers and a lot of those lower quality counter mixers. But this bad boy is freakin awesome! She doesn't have any of the addons, any additional mixer blades but this sucker has done so much from dense pound cake to kickin the crap out of chicken to make into chicken salad. EVERY HOME MUST HAVE THIS!
