review/summary: Small, quiet, and I can't believe it pulls that much water from the airreview/text: We have a tiny, sliding door closet with it's back wall being an outer wall in an apt. building and it pulls all of the moisture to it condensing on the wall and growing mold. We cleaned the wall over and over, week after week with bleach solution. We opened the windows every other day - that didn't work. We turned on the air conditioner for hours while we were out (in the winter mind you) and that didn't work. Then we got those little bead things that absorb moisture and they work, but not enough and not fast enough so we got this and it pulls so much moisture from the air, I have to empty it every night so it doesn't turn off for being full. I had no idea we had that much moisture in the air in there! I hope is just keeps doing what it does for a long time
