review/summary: Actually what I wanted.review/text: This coffee pot is great, simple, easy to clean. I don't care much for drip coffee because it's just not hot enough and microwaving it spoils the taste, this makes it nice and hot.. Electric peculators are nice but this little stove top is better for me. It's easy to make just a few cups (as few as 4 cups) for my morning coffee and it's easier to handle than a big electric peculator.
