review/summary: incredible suction!review/text: i love it, the best i ever had. It is loud but i am deaf in one ear so no problem there. When i get to my few last steps , i need to replug. i wish the cord was 20 feet instead of 16. it works better than great, but i am confused about cleaning the filter. it looks dirty even after i kind of clean it, and we are not supposed to put water on it. the hose is a little short but i just use it 20 min so i can manage. Great product for the price.
