review/summary: Falling apart after 3 short monthsreview/text: Bought this vacuum to replace my really old canister vac. At first, I thought it would be great. It does have great suction. But, the canister gets plugged up easily with pet hair and then it won't pick up until you empty it. The accessory hose is way too short and pretty much useless, but it just fell off of mine today. So, now it's really useless. Not what I expected at all. It was cheap and well, you get what you pay for.
