review/summary: This is THE best blender for the money...review/text: I have been wanting to make smoothies for a while and didn't want to buy the Vitamix for price... after reading reviews I decided to try this hand blender and I was still skeptical that it wouldn't be able to handle frozen fruit and leafy greens... but I was wrong! This thing works great! Check out more (and see a great smoothie recipe) on my blog.[...]
