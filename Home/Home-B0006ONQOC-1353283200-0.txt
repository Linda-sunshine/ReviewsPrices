review/summary: Love It!review/text: I absolutely love this machine. As soon as I received this I put the freezer bowl in the freezer. I wasn't sure when I would have time to make ice cream but I wanted to be prepared. Sooooo,yesterday was my free day. My first recipe was Strawberry Sorbet from the Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream Book. It came out really good. I even ordered containers from Sweet Bliss to help with storage of the 2 qts. All went well. My next recipe is Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Ice Cream. I can't wait.
