review/summary: Well Worth the Moneyreview/text: We've had this ice cream maker for about 6 months and have no complaints. We graduated from an old-school electric ice cream maker that required salt, and ice, and liked to leak all over our floors. Oh, and it was noisy and took forever. We were nervous about shelling out the $$ for an ice cream maker, but it has really worked out well for us! It makes great soft-serve in about 20 minutes, is fairly quiet, and cleans up easily. We keep the bowl in the freezer at all times so that's is always ready to go. Otherwise, you need to freeze the bowl for a solid 24 hours.
