review/summary: good grinder for the pricereview/text: overall a good grinder but not fine for espresso but i think if you take off burr on hopper then add 3 very fine washers to screw holes you can make grind finer but start from 3 dots in front of fine setting then move down dot by dot to get right grind if grinder make screeching noise ease of a dot or 2.
