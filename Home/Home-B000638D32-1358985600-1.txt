review/summary: Every kitchen should have one. Amazing value!review/text: You don't know what you're missing until you have good knives, and this is the one knife to have.I researched a lot of knives before settling on Victorinox. Experienced users know you don't need or want that 32 piece knife set. In fact, many professional cooks use only a single 8 inch chef's knife. Now, they probably use a $300 Shun or german something, but this Victorinox is 90% as good for 10% of the price.
