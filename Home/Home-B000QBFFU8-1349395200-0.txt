review/summary: Holy Carrots! Sorry, SoloStar...this thing is a BEAST!review/text: Just unpacked my fabulously gleaming new juicer and was all smiles as it whizzed effortlessly through a basket full of veggies and fruits. For 7 years I have proudly juiced using my faithful SoloStar II juicer. I believed that I had the best juicer available, one that would deliver the highest yield of fresh, quality juice. I was reluctant to order this newfangled machine with all its stainless steel and sleekly designed juicer parts, but after watching Giada obliterate a stack of greens on her cooking show, I began to question my loyalty. Although I enjoyed my premium juice, it was a painstaking and time consuming effort as I stood forever at the kitchen counter, watching my beloved SoloStar slothfully munch through carrots like an old farmyard heifer.But those days are gone now, now that there's a fashionable new diva on my counter blazing through my stash of organic veggies like a brand new Bugati. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm feeling a bit parched. I think it's time for my evening juice cocktail.
