review/summary: Terrible Packagingreview/text: I have not even opened my purchase yet. This Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner (F5914-900) has been purchased as a Christmas gift for my daughter. I do not want to open the box and disturb the interior until Christmas. However, I feel it is necessary to comment on the delivery. The packaging box looks 100 years old. It is scraped, torn, and dirty. I am 76 years young, and found it difficult to handle. That is not your fault, of course. But I am just hoping that the machine will be fine, and in excellent condition. I, however, want this complaint recorded.
