review/summary: Cast iron rocks!review/text: ok, it is heavy. I wanted this for making big batches of stuff. In this regard it comes up short. While 17" wide, it is shallower than my Calphalon 12" skillet, and, while the pan is 17" wide at the top, it is only ~14" at the inside of the pan bottom. The result is that I doubt if it is much bigger volume-wise that the Calphalon, but it has more bottom for browning, etc. So, why do I like it so much? Cast iron. I was browning some chicken and the browning was fantastic - lots of beautiful stuff on the pan which turned into delicious sauce. Cleaning was a bit different from non-stick. Seemed easy to clean, but needed oiling. Second time didn't use dishsoap (Ew?) and it came out perfect. I recommend it.
