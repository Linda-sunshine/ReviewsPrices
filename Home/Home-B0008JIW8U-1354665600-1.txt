review/summary: Filters for this are hard to find and none included with productreview/text: I'm sorry I am unable to give a balanced review for this product. I have not been able to use this coffee maker because it requires a different filter than what I've used in the past, and Mr Coffee is just to stingy to include a few filters with this coffee maker. I spent the past couple of days trying to find these needed filters - and I live in a big city - and I couldn't find them anywhere. I ended up going on Amazon where the most reasonable bargain for these filters was 23.99 for 1200 filters - much more than I need and more expensive than the coffee maker itself. This does not please me.
