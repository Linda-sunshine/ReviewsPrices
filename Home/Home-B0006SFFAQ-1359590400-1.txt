review/summary: Great coffee - poor machine - poor customer servicereview/text: My machine lasted exactly 2.5 years & Cuisinart will not stand behind their warranty. They will send me a new machine but not until I ship back the old one along with a $10 check (so I can plan on around $30 to get a new machine that will probably crap out again in 2-3 years, based on other reviews). Additionally, the new machine will not have a warranty on it. My old Braun coffee maker lasted 10+ years and cost 1/2 of what this machine did. As long as you don't mind replacing the unit every 2-3 years, it makes great coffee. I do not recommend this brand.
