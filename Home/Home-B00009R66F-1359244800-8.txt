review/summary: Not goodreview/text: Seems to have enough suction but there are a few major drawbacks. First of all the receiving tank is way to small. Have to constantly empty it as the fresh tank is larger. The power cord is too short. It leaks badly. Finally, leaves dark areas after cleaning. Piece of junk. I like Hoover products but this is unacceptable.
