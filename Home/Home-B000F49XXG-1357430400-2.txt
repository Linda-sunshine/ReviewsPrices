review/summary: great coffee shop alternative!review/text: We use this machine everyday!I was skeptical of a espresso machine under $100 because all the good ones seems to be in the $1,000s, but this machine is perfect for our needs. Great for making all sorts of espresso drinks (saves us tons of money because we don't go to coffee shops anymore). Good for a single cup of coffee or hot water for tea too. Highly recommend!
