review/summary: It's better than others.review/text: The popper does exactly what it's supposed to do. I'll usually put about a half cup in, it'll pop most of it, leaving maybe 3 or 4 unpopped kernals. This is better than others I've used.I've had no problems keeping it clean. A barely damp rag cleans the inside just fine. The top comes off for easy cleaning and goes in the dishwasher. There've been no issues.The outside stays cool to touch, though the top does get quite warm.We don't use it all the time but have had it for 9 months now with no technical issues.
