review/summary: Great Coffee!review/text: I got this as a Christmas gift for my son who had longed for "perked" coffee like his Grandmother used to make. He loves the coffee, it tastes great, the only drawback is the time when compared to drip coffee makers! BUT the flavor makes up for the fact that it takes a little longer to brew.
