review/summary: Just what I wanted!review/text: These sheets are great. They fit my queen-sized mattress perfectly. They didn't lose color upon washing (following instructions on affixed tag), nor did they pill. Now, be warned that these sheets are NOT as soft as a baby's bottom. But that's perfect, because I was looking for a stiffer, smoother sheet, because that's my preference. I'm sure they will soften in time with all the washings, but like I said before, these sheets are great.
