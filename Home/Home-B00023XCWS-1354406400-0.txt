review/summary: Works well, no noticable aftertaste in waterreview/text: I took the time to run several rounds of water through this before using it. I have not noticed an aftertaste now that I have actually used it for tea though it certainly had an odor the first couple of boilings. It is fast and easy. It is also very attractive.
