review/summary: Typical Lodge Qualityreview/text: If you like Lodge's pans, you'll probably appreciate the quality and weight of this griddle. I love that it's multi-purpose with two sides, so you're not storing two separate items. We use it primarily to cook home made tortillas two at a time, and it rests perfectly over two of our gas burners to reach a high temperature. Clean it just like any other cast iron pan (no soap) and it will last forever.
