review/summary: Another Satisfied Customer!review/text: The positive reviews on this little vac were what convinced me to buy it, and now I know why many people are so happy with it! I bought it because my dinky little rechargeable hand vac died on me after 6 months. It's powerful and has great suction. The hose is very convenient and I can use my upright vac attachments with it, too. It's perfect for cleaning couches becuase it's lighter and portable. Overall, it is an excellent value for the price, worth every penny!
