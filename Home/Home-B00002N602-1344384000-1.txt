review/summary: Very quick deliveryreview/text: I had bought this pressure cooker before and have been using it for over 15 years - in fact I have two of them, but this purchase was for a family member. It is a basic cooker (some might say old technology) but it is made of stainless steel. The sealing ring and overpressure plug need to be replaced from time to time, maybe every 4-5 years. And the pressure valve that goes on top of the lid eventually wears so it doesn't fit as well but, other than that, it works as advertised. I might add that - my wife cooks with it almost every day and uses it to cook beans, lentils, and other hard legumes, so she 'beats the hell out of it' and it's not suprising the rubber parts get hard and develop small cracks and have to be replaced eventually, but the cooker keeps on working. She also uses it as a steamer to cook rice (in a pot that fits inside the cooker), broccoli and green beans by not using the valve and using a cheap steamer basket - the kind that fans out - to hold the veggies above the 1" of water at the bottom. There are fancier and more expensive brands out there but this serves the basic function just as well, that is, it cooks the food inside.
