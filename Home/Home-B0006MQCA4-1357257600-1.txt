review/summary: Just now set it upreview/text: I received it today after work. Just now followed instructions and tasted my first sips,then tasted the unfiltered well water from the faucet. The filtered tasted better and smelled better too. I'm also doing a boil test,I know(by eye)how much residue I got from 2 10" saucepans simmered down to dry from about a week ago,now I'll do the same with 2 pans of the filtered water and see what's what. With luck my new coffee maker will need cleaning less often and coffee will be better too.I gave 4 star so far but will see how things go and how long the filters work for my situation/needs.Update- The simmer test took 4 hours but is done and results are good. There is about 75% less(by eye) residue/solids left in the pan after simmering two full pans of the filtered water. The only thing remaining is to see how long it takes to clog the filter. If it lasts long enough to be what I consider economical then I'll up it to 5 stars and keep using it. I found filters for just over $5 each(15.99 per 3-pack) at a local store.
