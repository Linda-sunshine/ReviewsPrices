review/summary: I love my personal coffee makerreview/text: It is exactly as advertised. A quick, efficient way to brew your coffee in the morning. Works well. It is fast. Easy to clean and operate. Economic, because when I had a 4 cup one, I never got to drink the last cup so it went to waist. I sure would recommend this coffee maker to anyone looking to make a single serve of coffee in the morning. I would sure recommend this coffee maker to others
