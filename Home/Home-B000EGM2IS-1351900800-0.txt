review/summary: great niche productreview/text: I know a professor that has had one of these for years and uses it daily. I bought mine for my graduate student office because I wanted to make tea in the afternoon and had need of hot water during lunch (during money-short weeks I eat a lot of Ramen). It does a great job. Boils very fast (1-3 min max).
