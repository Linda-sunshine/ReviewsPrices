review/summary: Really nice and has 3 cup sizesreview/text: I really like the fact that I can make one cup at a time. I can make what I want and then my mom can make hers. As well I can just heat water for tea, or anything else. I also got theKeurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter, which allows me to use any kind of coffee that I want and not worry about buying the K-cups. You can also buy theKeurig Water Filter Replacement Starter Kitif you want to filter the water. I always hated making an entire pot of coffee and watch how much went to waste. This way all we need to do in our household is to make a cup of coffee as we want it. I also have k-cups hot chocolate and apple cider, so my 6 year old daughter can enjoy it as well, and she enjoys it. I can even adjust the temp of the water so it is not to hot for her to drink.
