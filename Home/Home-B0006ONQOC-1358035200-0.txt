review/summary: Greatreview/text: This ice cream maker is wonderful. The recipes out of the box are fantastic and the loading window at the top is great for adding ingredients. Be advised, the ice cream bowl scratches very easily. So, if you are a scratch freak, don't use metal objects to scrape the ice cream out of the mixing bowl.
