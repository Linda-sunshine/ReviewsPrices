review/summary: 4 years later and still FANTASTICreview/text: I got this rice cooker as a wedding present four years ago. My hubby and I have used it 1-3 times a week, and it still works like new. It makes perfect, delicious rice every time! Yes, it does not make massive quantities, but we have fed 4 people rice with dinner if your portions are not too big. Highly recommend!
