review/summary: One Powerful Little Sucker!review/text: I was a little skeptical about buying a small handheld vacuum cleaner - fearing that it would be too weak to get the job done. After reading the reviews for this one, however, I decided to give it a shot. We have only an upright vacuum cleaner with no hose attachment so we can't clean the edges and corners well. So I was looking for something to not only do quick clean ups, but clean those "hard to get" areas.My initial impression upon turning it on was that it gave out a nice roar for a small vacuum. I immediately went to the corner of our bedroom and clean the edges. I used the hose (pulled it out from the holder) and was pleased to see that it "stretches" and I went at it. The powerful suction sucked up everything in it's path....I was shocked to see how much dust and lint this little sucker picked up! A very versatile machine- hose detaches or you can leave it on for regular vacuuming and you can even activate the roller brush for carpets. Overall, very happy with this purchase!
