review/summary: KITCHEN ESSENTIALreview/text: I got a small Le Creuset dutch oven when I moved and let me just say that it is dusty on a shelf in my kitchen bc I'm constantly using this lodge piece! The color looks even more vibrant in person and I love serving in it. I own a lot of cast iron pots/pans/etc. and lodge is definitely the highest quality, especially for the price. My WAY smaller high-end enamel dutch oven cost about 3x what I paid for this and I really only use that for small batches of soup or sauces. To people complaining about it not being dishwasher safe: just add some water to the pot and let it come to a hard simmer, then scrub it out like you would anything else. It's crazy easy to clean! I highly reccomend this over higher end models and if you're really concerned with brands just tell everyone it's Le Creuset, they won't be able to tell the difference ;)
