review/summary: Like it but...review/text: I think for the price it's a good machine for home use. HOWEVER, it vibrates something terrible! It sounds like a tool grinder that you would have in your garage. It vibrates so much, you have to stand there holding the cup underneath it to keep it from vibrating off the stand.
