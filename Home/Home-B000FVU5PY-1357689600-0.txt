review/summary: Soft Fabric And Lovely Colorreview/text: I got the Smokey Blue Queen sheets and Love them. I've had the sheets for about a week so I don't know how they'd fare in the long run, but they seem very sturdy so far. The color compliments the rest of my bedroom decor which is a cherry dark brown with lots of warm beige and crisp white colors and florals. I tend to buy more breathable cotton so I don't look for a higher thread count. These sheets are just breathable enough, but the thread count lends a more luxurious almost silky feel. I didn't feel any of the itch that I read about in the other reviews. The sheets feel a bit crisp, and I'm sure with a few more washes they'll probably being to get even more soft, like cotton often does.
