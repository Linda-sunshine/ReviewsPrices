review/summary: Have to babysit the grinderreview/text: Due to a poor design flaw, we have to babysit the grinder as the coffee beans do not flow properly and they get hung up before the beans reach the grinder. We have to shake and/or slap the grinder to get the beans into the grinding/burr area, it will work for a while but then it gets hung up again as we grind for the 18 cup marker. This is extremely annoying.
