review/summary: Best Coffee Percolator for the price.review/text: I've been using a plastic drip coffee maker for years and recently switched to this stainless steel percolator for these reasons.Concerns about plastic leaching into my coffee from drip coffee makersPercolators make stronger coffeeI use less coffee beansI can get by with a cheaper grinderCoarse ground coffee is much easier to clean out of a grinderSince switching to this stainless steel percolator I can enjoy better tasting, strong coffee like I get at Starbucks and save a lot of money on expensive coffee beans. (I can now make stronger coffee with 50% less beans.)The longer you percolate the coffee the stronger it gets. It takes 5 - 7 minutes from the time the water starts boiling. If you percolate too long the coffee might not taste good.You can see how dark the coffee is getting through the plastic top. (As the coffee percolates, it shoots up into the top.)I'll update you if problems arise in the future, but this looks like a quality percolator (made in China). Unfortunately the 'glass' top appears to be plastic like others have mentioned. I may upgrade it later to glass, but for now it's fine.The base of the unit is 6 1/8 inches which means it fits perfectly on the small burner of my electric glass top stove. The handle never gets hot and there's not much that can go wrong with it. It's easy to clean out and there's no paper filters to buy.According to the instructions, this is an 8 cup percolator that makes 4-8 cups of coffee. There are hard to see marks inside the percolator from 4 - 6 - 8 so you know how much water to put in the pot.Coffee also tastes better with 'High Energy Water'. It's less acidic, stronger tasting, and has more flavor.If you like strong coffee and saving money on coffee beans, this appears to be a really good percolator for the price.
