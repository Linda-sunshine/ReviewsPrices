review/summary: I would have given this 5 stars..................review/text: I love this product and it makes perfect strong coffee with many different types of ground coffee. The finish on the outside that is near the &#34;little italian man&#34; symbol looks smudged and looks like the 2inch area where an oily substance got on it and then the aluminum was coated in a shiny finish throughout the whole thing.A+ coffee making qualityA+ design and parts are excellentC- for the outside aluminum smudges because it looks used even though it is brand-new from the factory.OVERALL= B-I would suggest to pay 40$ and buy the bialetti moka crem over this product because of the polished aluminum finish and higher quality metal of the moka crem pot.I am the owner of the bialetti moka crem and this bialetti 6800 pot(6cup).enjoy
