review/summary: Over 2 years and just ordering another for a friendreview/text: I never write reviews but I have 4 of these that go with me everywhere, everyday and I couldn't be happier. I also have 1 of the hot versions for my coffee and I can't say enough good things about these. My recommendation would be to buy the stainless outside as mine are brown and the brown paint or whatever they use doesn't hold up to the abuse I've put it through....everything else most definitely does!Absolutely a 5 star product with a stainless internal keeping my water cold even in the sun with leak free performance (do not wash in the dishwasher per their recommendations -- I have washed the tops a couple times with no problems)
