review/summary: yum!review/text: I think this is great! I have learned how bad microwave popcorn can be for you and we are big popcorn eaters in our family. I have never owned or used a hot air popcorn popper. This is great.. easy to clean pops like crazy. For this reason have a big bowl and something to block random popping kernels. Sometimes they will pop in the bowl. I use a handled strainer held over the bowl and that worked well.I melt butter in the microwave and don't use the butter melter on the unit, but it does get pretty hot so it might work.Good purchase for the money. Hard to find in stores, I looked at the major big box retailers with no luck.
