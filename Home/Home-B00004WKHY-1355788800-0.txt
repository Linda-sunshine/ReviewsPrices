review/summary: Food Processorreview/text: Look for a long time for the right one and this was it.I am very pleased that I purchased this one. 9-Cup is plenty big. Doesn't really take up much space on the counter that a 13-Cup one would. So wished I had purchased one before this as it really gets the job(s) done.
