review/summary: Works Wellreview/text: This thing won't actually make your dog smell better. Or your 12 year old's gym shoes. Or the socks shoved under his bed. But as long as you keep your face out of the immediate vicinity of any of those items, you will notice that the rest of the room's air smells fresher and cleaner. Plus this little guy doesn't need a lot of space to sit. Well worth the investment.
