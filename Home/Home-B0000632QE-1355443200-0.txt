review/summary: Good productreview/text: This is another product that works quite well except for a few things. Maybe I just don't know how to use it properly. I wanted it to shred cabbage but the holder will not keep the cabbage together and will not cut down as far as I would like so I end up using my fingers and risking a cut as the blades are extremely sharp.
