review/summary: Cooks anything wonderfullyreview/text: I received one of these as an engagement gift this year and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE it! I cooks everything perfectly and it is a non-stick pot without using tephlon, which is always a huge plus. I have cooked rice, pasta, and soup in this dutch oven so far and everything comes out perfect. The cast-iron really holds the heat unbelievably well and distributes the heat evenly, which makes a huge difference to me right now being forced to use an electric raised-coil stove where there coils are uneven and do not heat evenly in our rental. :-( This dutch oven is definitely worth it if you want a Le Creuset brand dutch oven but can't afford them. I would honestly take the lodge cast-iron dutch oven over Le Creuset anytime.
