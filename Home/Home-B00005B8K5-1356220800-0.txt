review/summary: Excellent productreview/text: I was looking for non-reactive containers (not plastic). These are a good size for storage. They aren't large but I have found that to be a plus. The lids fit very well. When I store hot food I put wax paper under the lids for transport. The larger pieces hold plenty and the small containers are perfect for individual servings. I like them so much I ordered a second set. The glass is sturdy and resistant to breakage and the lids are substantial.
