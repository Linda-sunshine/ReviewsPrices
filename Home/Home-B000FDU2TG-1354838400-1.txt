review/summary: KitchenAid can't be beatreview/text: I recently received the KitchenAid Blender as a gift. I do not have a problem with any of the settings. I usually blend strawberries, bananas, orange juice with ice cubes to make my own smoothie. It is also great for making milkshakes with or without fruit added.
