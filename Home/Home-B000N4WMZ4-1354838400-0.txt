review/summary: Lodge dutch ovenreview/text: I had been out shopping for a dutch oven. The prices in the stores were quite expensive for a high quality one so I came home without one. I decided to look on line . This dutch oven is wonderful and the price was the best out there for the quality. I have no problem with the lid fitting tightly as some reviews stated. Perhaps the flaw has been taken care of. I use it for soups and it heats evenly. The pot roasts come out to perfection...I can't say enough good things about this dutch oven. I purchased the blue color and find it very nice. I certainly would recomend this to anyone looking for quality at a great price.
