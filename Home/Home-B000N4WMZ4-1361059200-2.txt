review/summary: Fantastic product for the moneyreview/text: Great product. No, I don't think the enamel coating is quite up to the same thickness and quality as at the Staub or the Le Creuset, but it's pretty darn good, and should last you many years with some care. With this, you're buying a nice pot that will last you for many years. With the Staub and the Le Creuset, you're buying a family heirloom that can be passed down to your children or grand children.The cast iron on this one is nice and thick and heavy, better than the other Chinese made Dutch oven's (Emeril, Tramontina, etc.) You're getting 80% of the Le Creuset's durability, and 99% of it's performance for 1/6th the cost. Not a bad deal. Yes, it is made in China if that affects your decision. Other than the Staub and the Le Creuset, as far as I can tell, they all are.Just a note, but the listings and pictures can be a bit confusing. The one that I ordered (the Island Spice Red) did in fact come with the Stainless knob, and not the plastic knob. If you're not going to use it to bake bread with, the plastic knob is fine in a 350 oven, which is where most people braise, or on the stovetop. If you get a plastic knob, spend $10 and get the stainless knob. It's indestructible, and can survive any oven temp.Also, I've used mine about 10x so far, mostly to braise things in the oven, and I baked bread a few times. There is some faint brown staining on the white interior. I haven't used anything except soap and water on it so far, so I imagine some baking soda and vinegar would probably get it off, but even if it doesn't, it's not a big deal to me.
