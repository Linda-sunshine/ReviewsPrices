review/summary: Lots of power!!review/text: For a small vac, this packs a lot of power. We previously had a hand-vac Bissell (similar to all the Dirt Devils out there), that was good, but parts started to break after about a year of use. We use this vacuum strictly for the tiles in our kitchen and would get daily use. I debated between a replacement $20 replacement to what we had vs. this Hoover and although it's greater in cost, we've not second-guessed that decision. What we like:1. Power. Lots of suction power -- more so than hand vacs2. Longer cord.3. Easy canister access to empty out debris4. Vacuum head design. Pretty darn maneuverable especially in tight places. Has a few degrees of freedom to help maneuver tight places; reminds me of our Dyson.5. Weight. Feels hefty, like it's solidly built.6. Hook on handle to hang when not in use.7. Versatile. We use it predominantly on our kitchen tiles (we have a 21-mo old); but th Flair also has an option to engage the brushes on the head to vacuum carpet. Though we have a Dyson for that, this gives us added flexibility and options.
