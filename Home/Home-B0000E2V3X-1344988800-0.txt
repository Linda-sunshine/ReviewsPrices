review/summary: Better than expected!review/text: I bought this pan instead of a pizza stone. It has many uses. I put this pan under the broiler in the oven and heat it up, then take it out and cook fajitas on it. It is great for thin sliced pork chops, fajita meat, and chicken.It works great for pizza, also. Gives a nice brown crunchy crust. It is a tad heavy, but works well in the oven with the handles.Would recommend this product - more versatile than a pizza stone.
