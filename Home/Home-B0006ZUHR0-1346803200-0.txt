review/summary: Easy Ironerreview/text: So far the iron is all that was stated in the blurb about it. I just hope that it doen't quit like my last iron after only three months. In fact, that is why I purchased the Black and Decker Iron. It is heavy enough that the wrinkles come out easily and the iron gets hot enough for cotton and cool enough for blends.
