review/summary: "Toy" meat grinder that worksreview/text: If you are deciding whether or not to grind your own meat, or need to grind small quantitites (up to two pounds) of meat, this is a very good buy -- provided you are clever in accommodating its limitations. Most of the complaints are from people who did not take the time and trouble to learn how to use it optimally.1) The rubber suction cup gripper must be engaged or you will end up trying to grind and anchor the machine at the same time, which cannot be done. Use the enclosed tool to turn the knob that makes the vacuum seal. The rubber cup is slightly too big to make a vacuum seal on kitchen counter tiles, so use a smooth flat plastic, porcelain or metal surface like a bathroom sink, toilet top, or washer-dryer top.2) Make sure the blade is installed in the correct directon; otherwise it will not grind.3) Cut meat into strips and semi-freeze before grinding; this allows the plastic screw to grab the meat and push it through. I have not tried it for moist pasta dough or re-grinding mushy meat, but I believe the negative reviews that it lacks the power to handle such loads nicely.4) It is easy to disassemble parts after use and to clean them thorougly with hot soapy water in the tub used to collect the ground meat. The parts are easily stored in that tub but be sure to cover it with a plastic-wrap cover (and rubber band) so parts do not become lost.I ground 1.6 pounds of lean lamb in less than 10 minutes and liked the results. This product is perfect for small casseroles and the like. I plan to use it until the need for something bigger and heftier arises, and by then I'll know enough about meat grinding to make an informed choice of a higher-end grinder.
