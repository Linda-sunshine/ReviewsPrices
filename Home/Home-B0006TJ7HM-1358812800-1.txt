review/summary: Okay, with some flaws.review/text: VERY VERY SHARP. The slightest touch will cut skin. Does a good job of cutting, but not on the big jobs. They also get dark water stains on them that will not come off. Like them for dinner time and smaller vegetables, but don't like them for cutting raw meat or large vegetables.
