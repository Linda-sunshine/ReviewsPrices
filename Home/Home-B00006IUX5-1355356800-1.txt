review/summary: No frills, works greatreview/text: I needed a grinder with few features and a cheap price - this one fits the bill! The retractable cord is excellent for storing this away in a cabinet. Easy to clean, too. The actual grinding 'container' (the plastic dome on top) is smaller than I expected, but it grinds so quickly that loading in a second/third bunch of coffee beans is not a big deal.
