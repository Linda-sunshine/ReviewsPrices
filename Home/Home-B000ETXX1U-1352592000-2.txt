review/summary: My house guest was thrilled!review/text: I purchased this bed because I had a guest coming to stay for a week (which is a little too long to sleep on the tiny couch in our one-bedroom apartment). I am very pleased with this product. The bed is very, very comfortable and my house guest was very comfortable while he stayed with us! The price was very reasonable considering how awesome this bed is.
