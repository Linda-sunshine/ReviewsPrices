review/summary: Well Madereview/text: Stays in place even on my slippery end tables. Keeps coffee warm...better in some of my ceramic mugs than others....tall mugs that are wider at the top, don't heat up to the top, but generally my normal size mugs are kept at a drinkable temperature allowing me to enjoy my coffee for a longer time. The cord is exceptionally long....nice perk. Has a turn on turn off button, with a red alert light when on. Nice purchase.
