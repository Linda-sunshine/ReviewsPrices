review/summary: Serviceablereview/text: The instructions could be a bit more clear.The clock brightness has 2 settings, high and low. Low is barely visible. High isn't, its what I normally expect on a low setting.Alarm volume. Again loud isn't very loud. Previous clock's alarm was audible in the next room on loud setting. This one can't even be heard in the walk-in closet of the bedroom the clock is in.It's serviceable but I'm going to continue to look for another dual alarm clock with some better features.
