review/summary: Radient heat is the best kind of heatreview/text: I could use the central air system to heat up my whole house, or I could set this little thing near to me when I sit in my tv watching chair (which is also my kindle reading chair).If I set it at four and a half feet from my person, I can feel the heat it creates, even using the lower setting, the 400 watt setting. There are two quartz heating elements in this heater, and you have the choice of using just one (400 watts) or both (800 watts). This is a radient type heater. No fan. If you want a fan forced air flow of heat, this is not what you want. If you like the feeling of radient heat (fireplace type heat), this thing works as a reasonable reproduction of that.From four and a half feet away, you can notice a difference in how warm you feel, even using the 400 watt setting (this heater also has an 800 watt setting).I would buy another one of these as a first choice if I needed another radient heating device.12/4/12: This heater is working fine. I used it for maybe three hours a night last month in 400 watt mode. My electric bill was increased by eight bucks (but there are other electric usage items involved in that increase). When it gets cold outside I can easily go through three or four bucks worth of propane a day to heat my place - having this heater next to me during reading and tv watching hours really helps cut down on propane usage.
