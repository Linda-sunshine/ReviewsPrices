review/summary: Too humid? You need one of these!review/text: My search for a simple, low cost dehumidifier brought me here! I started out with one to place out in our spare car to control the humidity. It worked better than I thought it would, so now I have 4 of these. one in each vehicle & one in my garage office/shop/computer lab. :)The pros:+ It may seem expensive, but considering the damage too much moisture can cause, it's resonable & free shipping is included.+ Low power use.+ Very quiet operation.+ No maintenance, other than emptying the water. It even shuts off & signals (LED lights) when that's needed!The cons:- It may have been my fault? The water catch tank has to be lined up correctly, before it's pushed back into the dehumidifier. If it's not lined up, the guide rail on the tank will break off. The tank will still be 100% functional, but it can be a bit more difficult to line-up after the guide rail is broken off. I only did this on the first one, being more careful after the mishap. :)Purchase history:&#9642; I bought the first one of these in 2010, three in 2011 & I just bought another one to remove excess moisture from a problem area. I've had "zero" problems with any of the previous units & I expect this one to be 100% trouble free. :)Notes:&#9642; The operation of this dehumidifier can be improved by simply removing the restrictive plastic screen on the fan exhaust. Just pull off the large exhaust grille located on top, then pop off the attached grille with the small holes. Reattach the large grille & that's it!&#9642; Some reviewers have been concerned with the wall wart... power transformer getting very warm to hot. They do get very warm... not sure I'd say hot. None of our 5 units have had any problems with the power transformer overheating.
