review/summary: A good buyreview/text: So far we've bought 4 of these, a much cheaper replacement than our slow at the best of times, broke the rest of the time Ice maker. they make nice sized cubes, are easily cleaned, are durable, and unlike cheaper silicon/rubber trays are sturdy with some oomph, and support. Also the ice is extremely easy to get out.
