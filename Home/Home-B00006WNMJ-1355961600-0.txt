review/summary: Tastes better than bottled water and more convenient.review/text: I bought the Culligan water filter because it removes lead, not all filters do that. The water doesn't have that chlorine taste anymore. It is also a lot cheaper and easier than carrying gallon bottles of water up from the basement.
