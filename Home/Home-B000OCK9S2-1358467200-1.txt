review/summary: Quirky but works so farreview/text: My 11 yr old son loves his new clock radio. I discovered that if you push the radio button, you can't go to just any old sound from there. You have to push the upper right sound button first, then you can select your favorite background sound from there. Also we lost the instructions in the Christmas hubub and setting the alarm has not been figured out. Should be obvious...
