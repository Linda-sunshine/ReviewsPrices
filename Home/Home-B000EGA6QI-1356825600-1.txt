review/summary: What a great tool!review/text: I love this hand blender! It works as advertised. I'm not a fan of chunky foods and use it to pur&eacute;e tomato sauce, pea soup and the like and even used it to made a quick batch of humus. The blender is so powerful the suction it creates actually causes it it &#34;stick&#34; to the bottom of my pots. So I do not use it on an coated non- stick pots or pans.
