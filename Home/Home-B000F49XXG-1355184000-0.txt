review/summary: Not the right one if you are particular about your Espresso and Cappucinoreview/text: Earlier used a stove top espresso maker until I got this as a gift. Although it is easier to make espresso with this, the following are the issues:1) The espresso strength is not consistent.2) Set up time is long. Need to turn it on for a long time, before the machine gets ready. So, if you are making 1 or 2 shots of espresso, takes about 30 minutes to make it.3) Milk warmer and froth not great.4) Difficult to clean.I continue to use it because it is easier than the alternative of a stove top espresso and much cheaper than a high-end espresso and cappucino maker.
