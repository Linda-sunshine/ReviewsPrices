review/summary: Buy this!review/text: Bought this after struggling with getting decent coffee from a cheap drip brewer and not being happy with the results of my french press. I was leery about trying to get good results from a pour over brewer. I was considering dropping a couple of hundred for a Bonavita or Technivorm so I'm glad I came across this before I pulled the trigger. It looks like something from an austin power's movie but it makes spectacular coffee and seems to be very consistent. Lots of different ways you can change up your brew if you look for methods online like the 'inverted' method, etc. However I find that you get great results with just a straight forward simple process and fresh locally roasted french roast beans that I grind right before brewing.I keep it on my desk at work along with my grinder and electric kettle and make a cup when I need it. Clean up is extremely simple if you're within distance of a sink. You could probably make do without a sink for a period of time but I'd recommend one.
