review/summary: A real workhorsereview/text: I got this juicer after seeing Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead. I wanted to not spend a ton of money on a juicer because frankly, I wasn't sure if the juice thing was going to work... I've been juicing for about 8 months now, with a four month hiatus, so admittedly, I'm not experienced as most. However, I will recommend this juicer. Here's why: I am not patient when it comes to figuring things out. This juicer is easy to use. You put fruits and vegetables in, put this stopper thingie down and you get juice. To clean it, it's just a few pieces that come off and it fits in the dishwasher after a good rinse with the sprayer. The screen and blade take a little more effort, but the brush that comes with the machine is really perfect for it. Also perfect, the back of the brush allows you to scoop out the pulp, really simplifying the process. I've run just about anything I can think of through the juicer. Not super with bananas or softer fruits. I haven't tried wheatgrass because of this. But I juice a lot of carrots, apples and kale and the juicer works perfectly for those things. I also like the measuring cup -- I make a jug of juice a week and two measuring cups = one jug. I know you're supposed to make it fresh, but... well... I don't have that kind of time. I paid a little more than what the price is now and I still thought it was a really good value for the money. I'm really happy with this juicer.
