review/summary: Works great at first... BUTreview/text: I've gone through 2 of these now. I decided to try a second one after reading reviews from people providing a couple of tips, including releasing the pressure after every use. Nothing helps. It works amazing at first, but over time (just after a month in both of my experiences) other problems begin, including clogging or the seal not being able to hold pressure anymore. Pieces of junk. It's too bad, I wanted to believe! I can't find any information on getting in touch with the company either.
