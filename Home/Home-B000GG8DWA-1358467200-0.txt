review/summary: Quartz Heaters Last Virtually Foreverreview/text: I want to clarify: I can't speak on how well this unit will heat a room because I don't own this specific model, but I do own a quartz two-element (750/1500w fan forced) portable heater that is no doubt has been out of production for decades, but I just want to comment on the longevity of this type of heater --- if mine is any indicator --- they will last indefinitely if not a lifetime. All I can say is that I've used mine on average about 4 hours per day (yearly average) for the last 29+ (90% at 750w/single element use --- with both elements on, this unit produces powerful heat) years, and it's always produced nice heat and it is still going strong!Brand: True ValueModel: N/ACirca: December 1983Recommendation: Run both elements occasionally (90/10 should be satisfactory) even if not needed and clean it behind the grill every 1-2 years for best performance.
