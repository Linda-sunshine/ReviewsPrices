review/summary: Great Product (metallic chrome)review/text: I don't cook so I can't speak for all its capabilities. I bought this mainly to make smoothies and margaritas. :D and it does this well. Kitchen aid makes durable, quality products and this is no exception. I've had mine about 5 years with no issues, granted, I don't use it on a daily basis.Its crushes the ice from my refrigerator with no problems. It blends my smoothies just right. It has served me well so far.The metallic part isn't metal and feels like cheap plastic but it matches well with the stainless steel appliances.
