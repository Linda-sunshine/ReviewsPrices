review/summary: no complaintsreview/text: I am a writer, which means I get carried away at the keyboard and my coffee grows cold if my mind isn't on it, which it isn't. My mind is on writing. Therefore, I am deeply grateful for this product. When I reach for my coffee, it is hot everytime. I don't have to sigh with disappointment, heave myself from my writing chair, and trek to the kitchen to pour out the cold and fill my mug with warm that is itself destined to grow cold from neglect. The warmer works well. I like it.
