review/summary: Best Quality Cannerreview/text: This canner is the best quality canner I have seen. Unlike the twist on lids, this has the bolt on lid and is screwed down which in my opinion is much safer. The other canners do have a higher chance of exploding if unattended.This is of very thick and heavy metal and will last for generations to come with proper care.I highly recommend this canner to others.
