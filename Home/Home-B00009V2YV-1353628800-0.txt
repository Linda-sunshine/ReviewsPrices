review/summary: Only Alarms when you need it to do soreview/text: My previous weather radio alarmed all the time to the point that I pulled the plug and the batteries. It didn't have an off switchThis MidLand weather radio is great! You can set it up for the county you live in and you can de-activate any alarms you do not need. I had it for over 6 weeks before the alarm went off AND, it was a useful alarm. No more being woke up for something that doesn't concern you. Well worth the money.
