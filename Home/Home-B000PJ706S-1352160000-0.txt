review/summary: DON'T BUYreview/text: I bought this kettle not from Amazon, but I feel I need to add my two cents. This kettle kept knocking off the power in my house. The fouls odour /smell was not realy a big concern as I thought with time it will disappear, but anytime I put it on, all power is gone. I plugged other kettles into the same outlet - no problem. I 've since returned it.
