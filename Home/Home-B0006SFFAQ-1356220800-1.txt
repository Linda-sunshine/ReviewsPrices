review/summary: Very nice product only one small drawbackreview/text: When the coffeemaker is not in programmble mode it does not maintain heat. There is no way to override this except to keep flipping the &#34;on&#34; button. I chose the black because the material has a more sturdy surface than the other glitizer plastic finish - albeit- in great colors.
