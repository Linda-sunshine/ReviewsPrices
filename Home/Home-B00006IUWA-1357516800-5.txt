review/summary: Pops Popcornreview/text: I needed to replace my West Bend popper which was over ten years old and barely popped anymore. The reviews for the newer West Bend poppers was not good but this one seemed better reviewed. Have used it about six times so far and very happy so far.There is always a few (ten or less) unpopped kernels but have always had that with previous poppers. A few (two or three) end up outside the bowl which is also normal. Some people expect absolute perfection but realize hot air is not a perfect science. This one is pretty close.For those new to hot air poppers, I do recommend completely following the directions. Most failures I have seen are because of this problem. First, If you are waiting for only those last two kernels to pop you might burn the unit out. They are not designed to run for long periods of time. Two minutes and you will have a big bowl of fresh popcorn. Don't worry about those last two kernels that will probably never pop. Second, only put in the measured amount of kernels. These poppers have small fans and there is a limit on how much popcorn they can blow out.Love hot air popcorn. So much better and healthier than microwave or made in oil.
