review/summary: does what it saysreview/text: This juicer does everything it says. It is easy to clean. Pulp is very dry-all juice is extracted. It is reasonably priced and I'm glad I didn't spend more money on a higher priced brand. I have only had it for about a month, but use it every day and could not be more pleased with my purchase.
