review/summary: Good expresso, great foam; durable?review/text: I replaced by similar XP4030 Krups machine with this one, although I was happy with the Krups and would have bought another one if it hadn't been discontinued.I found the De'Longhi a little more temperamental--the heating element doesn't keep a sustained temperature for very long, so the timing in pulling the shot is important, although I think I have the hang of it now; and in emptying the basket of used grounds, it is difficult not to make a mess. I am quite pleased with the force and effect of the foamer--I'm getting a foamier beaker of froth than the Krups machine gave me, which is more satisfying for the product I prefer (a Spanish cortado). I may as well also point out that, although the De'Longhi is not as noisy as the Krups, the vibrations from the pump cause the cup to jiggle out of place even more than those of the Krups did--you need to keep pushing it back into place while pulling the shot.My main misgiving is the force required to lock the filled basket into position, which requires steadying the machine with one hand and applying considerable torque with the other. This operation, in itself, is not a big problem, but I have misgivings that in doing so I am stressing the gasket, and that it will have to be replaced regularly. So the machine is satisfactory for now, but I worry about the sustainability of what it delivers over the medium-term.
