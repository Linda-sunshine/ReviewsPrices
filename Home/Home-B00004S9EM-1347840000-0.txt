review/summary: Poor product, motor no longer made wellreview/text: My first Cuisinart was purchased in 1998. At that time, Cuisinart was it's own corporation. They made quality products. I purchased this Cuisinart and immediately noticed that the motor does not have the strength or precision that the prior Cuisinart had. I realized that Cuisinart was purchased by Conair Corporation and Conair has ruined the product through cheap production methods. You can break the unit simply by making a thick dough. I would avoid Cuisinart products as they are cheaply made in China and are no longer a useful tool for a serious chef. Also, their customer service is lacking at the corporate level. I have only had my Cuisinart for 3 years and already it is experiencing serious technical issues with the motor. Buyer Beware. I would shop other brands.
