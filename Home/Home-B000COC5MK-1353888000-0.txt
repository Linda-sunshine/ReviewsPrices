review/summary: After a few months, throw it awayreview/text: Once the teflon on the built-in corkscrew wears out, it shreds corks. Apparently there is no way to replace the teflon-coated corkscrew. Oster provides no instructions or any means to replace this part. On manual wine openers, this part is replaceable. On the Oster it is not. I guess the only option is to toss it away, eat the cost and return to your manual cork puller. It was great while it lasted, which isn't long if you drink wine every night as I do.
