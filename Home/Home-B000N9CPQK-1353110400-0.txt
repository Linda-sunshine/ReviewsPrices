review/summary: Pain in my buttreview/text: So, it is a filter and it does collect a lot of dust for being so small. I like the idea of the permanent filter. And it has helped with alergens.To explain how it works - the prefilter is a thin sponge that fits into the front plate and behind that is the silicone sealed permanent filter, which is like a car air filter with a wire grid over it. The air is taken through the filter and blown out the back. The button on the top left is the fan and the one on the right is to function the ionizer, which also turns on a green led on the top. There is another button in the middle of the knobs to activate another green light for a nightlight or whatever.CONSDue to to how small it is, it does require frequent cleaning (rinsing the prefilter and vacuuming the perm filter)the filter is roughly 10" by almost 4"The front plate is very difficult to remove on mine. Not sure if they're all like that but I have to really squeeze the side buttons to clean the filter.The ion function LED is bright, so you'll likely shut it off at night if it's going to be in your roomoverall it's a pain in my butt and I plan on purchasing something better. I'll continue to use this one until the front plate ends up breaking. Advice, pay the extra money and get something bigger and with a better review.
