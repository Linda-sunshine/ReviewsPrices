review/summary: just like Joe Dimaggio used before he met Mr. Coffeereview/text: Do you ever long for the simple days of your youth? You did not have to buckle up in the car because your car had no seat belts. In those days, everybody smoked cigarettes. Nobody planned for retirement because nobody lived long enough to retire. Nowadays, it costs less to fund a 401k than it does to buy a carton of smokes. This coffee maker will take you right back to the good old days. Turn off your television, make a pot of jo and relax in the barka lounger with an old Sears catalogue (if you can find one). and, during the next electric outage, you won't feel so powerless when you perc some coffee over a log in the fireplace.
