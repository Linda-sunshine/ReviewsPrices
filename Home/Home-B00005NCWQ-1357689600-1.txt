review/summary: I love perked coffee. and this is pot is easy to use. Goes right on the burner, easy access, not much in way of grounds in watereview/text: This is pot is easy to use. Goes right on the burner. Grounds don't get all over the place or in the coffee. It is big enough to make enough coffee for two people and small enough to take with camping, etc. I would recommend.
