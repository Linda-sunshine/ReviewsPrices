review/summary: Looks nice, but...review/text: I love the idea of this garbage can, too bad it doesn't work as it should. Out of the box it looks great and is easy to set up. Unfortunately the first one I received didn't function at all. I contacted the warranty department and they informed me that they would replace the lid under warranty but I would have to pay the shipping fees. I told them this was unacceptable and they sent me the new lid at no cost. I was a little surprised they tried to charge me for shipping but I appreciate they sent one out to me for free. The new lid does function, just not all the time. There doesn't seem to be any pattern I can follow to when it works and when it doesn't, the sensor is clean, power is on, batteries are good but sometimes it just doesn't work. I've read previous reviewers instructions on what worked for them, and the manufacturer sent me troubleshooting instructions. Sometimes these things work and sometimes they don't, however, I expect this to work every time I need it to, not only after I remove the lid, remove the batteries, clean the sensor, set it aside for a few hours and then reassemble. Most of the time I just end up manually opening the lid. On the plus side, the filter does seem to take some of the garbage smell away.
