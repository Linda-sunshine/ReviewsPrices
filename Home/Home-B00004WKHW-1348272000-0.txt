review/summary: Excellent Food Processorreview/text: Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Food Processor is perfect for those simple pestos and sauces for meals. My husband and I love trying new recipes and the mini processor allows us to make small portions and samples. The Food Processor blades are perfect for handling small, but tough jobs. Clean up is easy and the blades have stayed pretty sharp through some heavy duty ingredients.We love it, and are happy with our purhcase. We are looking to buy a larger one in the future!!
