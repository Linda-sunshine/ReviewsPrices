review/summary: I love the support that Kitchen Aid givesreview/text: I have always wanted a Kitchen Aid, its what my mother had so I saved up and got this one. The original one had a defect, but Kitchen Aid replaced it immediately - no problem. Then they checked back with me to be sure I was happy.They do piggy back offers for magazines and extended warranties but its just a little irritation. The mixer has power for heavier doughs. Be sure to use the beater that's appropriate for what you are making. Their recipes are excellent.
