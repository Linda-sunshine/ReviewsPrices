review/summary: Like sleeping on strawreview/text: I read the reviews of these before purchasing, and saw that some customers remarked these are pretty scratchy, however, others said that by soaking the starch out of the sheets, they would be soft. When they arrived, they had a nice sheen & felt pretty smooth, so of course I threw all the packaging away. I washed them, soaking for 30 minutes to remove any statch and was excited to use my new sheets that night. After taking them out of the dryer, I was horrified to feel how scratchy they felt! I put them on the bed anyway, and didn't make it through the night with them on. They are incredibly scratchy that it feels very unpleasant to have any skin contact with the sheets. I'm very disappointed. =(
