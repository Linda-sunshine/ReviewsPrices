review/summary: Great lightweight chef's knifereview/text: This is part of the Victorinox "Fibrox" product line. The "Fibrox" refers to the fiberglass-infused resin used to make the handle. This makes for a handle that is light, strong, comfy, and quite grippy, even when wet or greasy. It is also dishwasher safe.For most tasks that a chef's knife is used for, it is great. The lightness reduces fatigue and makes the blade very easy to maneuver. However the stamped blade (while quite sharp and in no way inferior for cutting) is not ideal for tasks which require a thick, heavy, blade that you push down own. For instance, while it's great for dicing onions, for tasks like chopping chocolate is really not viable, as the top of the blade will uncomfortably press into your hand as you push it into the chocolate.Every cook should own one of these (and many do), as the price can't be beat for the quality knife you get. But you'll have to supplement it with a traditional forged knife for some limited tasks.
