review/summary: GREAT humidifier, but it requires some regular maintenance (changing water, clean with vinegar solution weekly)review/text: cute looking humidifier comes in different animals. cool mist is great and it can really put out some volume. Holding tank holds plenty of water for overnight. these things are a must if you ever experience the dryness that comes from running your heater in the winter. Humidity helps with dry throat or sinuses or coughing. also just makes the ambient air more comfortable. My only gripe is that these humidifiers require frequent care and cleaning. you need to change the water regularly and clean with vinegar solution weekly to prevent mold. There are warm air humidifiers that heat the mist, killing any spores. But this one is really good and I recommend it.
