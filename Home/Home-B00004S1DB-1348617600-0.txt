review/summary: A great productreview/text: Like most of the other reviews - this coffee press is excellent. I've owned no less than six or seven in my life and most of them broke due to the glass. I had a stainless still press from Starbucks that I also loved, but gave it to my parents. After replacing it with this, I noticed that this excels over Starbucks in price and in terms of keeping the coffee hot for a longer time. Plus, the thing feels solid and so if you drop it it won't die. Great coffee press.
