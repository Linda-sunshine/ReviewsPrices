review/summary: noticeable difference in taste over my britareview/text: #1 plus = noticeable taste over my brita and improved! (at the finish, no weird taste). we've been brita users for years.#2 plus = location of the actual dispenser . on the brita, the dispenser is further away from the bottom. so i have to tilt the counter dispenser to get more water out w/o refilling. the pur, it's closer to the bottom.#3 plus = the dispenser can lock so it continuously dispense w/o holding the dispensing tab. this is great when filling up containers larger than a glass.
