review/summary: I love this little pot!review/text: I purchased this little and by little I mean "cute as a button" pot because I was wasting too much espresso when using the 9-cup for just myself. It was too much of a waste of money and I hate waste in general. The 3-cup pot is perfect for my needs. I heat up 6-ish oz of milk and blend with my espresso after brewing. It is pretty strong and rich...I tend to drink less of a latte than a normal cup of coffee. I am glad that I have the 9-cup for company. If making espresso for more than one person I would probably get the 9-cup instead of the 6-cup. Though I did purchase the 6-cup as a Christmas gift for a family member. More than happy with these lovely Moka Pots!
