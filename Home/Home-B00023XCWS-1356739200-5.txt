review/summary: Electric Kettlereview/text: One of the best things I ever bought for myself. I love this. I drink instant coffee and hated boiling water and heating my house. This is perfect. I use it absolutely every single day. I do not know how I lived this long without this product. I will never not have one of these in my home ever again. Only flaw is there are some sharp edges on the inside and you have to be careful when cleaning, but it only takes once to figure this out and to avoid that pain again. This is a wonderful product.
