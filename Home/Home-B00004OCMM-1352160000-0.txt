review/summary: The Cadillac of can openersreview/text: I got this in Dec.'09 and it still looks like new. Soft comfy handle, soft comfy knob, easy to start a cut in a can lid and best of all -- it's totally quiet. There's no loud, grinding whir. There's no uncertainty whether or not a can will fall out of an electric can opener's feeble grasp. I love it and you will too.
