review/summary: iTouchless Trash Canreview/text: This is a great concept - but, a few words of wisdom:The lid pops open when someone walks by; even if they aren't wanting to use the trash canBattery consumption b/c of the note above is highUse an A/C adapter; if possibleThe air filter inside the lid only last a week...fell off inside and was thrown out with the trashWe do like the trash can, and we use an A/C adapter...so, I still give it 4/5 stars. Fix the concerns above, and it gets a 5.
