review/summary: Still going strong after 2.5 years!review/text: This thing, by far, makes some of the best coffee I've had! It makes coffee in record time and to top it off...the coffee is HOT!!! I usually have to let my coffee stand for a good 10 minutes after pouring so that I don't burn the tar out of myself. The only reason I gave this a 4 is because I have noticed that if I don't turn it off within about an hour or two of brewing my coffee it will usually scorch it! Being a mother of two small ones it can sometimes take me a few hours to consume 2 cups of coffee and by then it's burnt or cold because I had to turn it off to prevent it from burning. With that said, I still love this and it blows coffee makers out of the water with quality. I also can't seem to find perk filters in the grocery stores where I live but managed to find them on Amazon for a fair price.After two and a half years, this thing still works like a charm! Very happy...
