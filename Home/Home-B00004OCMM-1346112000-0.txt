review/summary: Great openerreview/text: This is by far the easiest to use and clean and operate can opener I have ever used. It opens wide for cleaning,takes minimal effort to use and works flawlessly. I know it is expensive but it sure saves your arms, hands, shoulders and mind!! compared to others out there. You do not have to struggle like some others to get them to work, if at all. Very efficient and enjoyable to use and easy to clean. Looks nice and is relatively lightweight.
