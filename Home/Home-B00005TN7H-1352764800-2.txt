review/summary: Awesome for dry goods storagereview/text: I use these for sealing layered salads in a jar, side dishes, snacks for my family, and dry goods storage.It works to seal the jars quickly and extends the life of perishable foods like steamed veg and salads plus seal bulk food items economically for pantry storage. For the money, this thing has saved me so much in wasted food plus it mbrought my foodsaver machine out of retirement.You can use it with the tiny jars so long as ou insert an extra lid inside the top during the seal process. I use the little jars for kid sized homemade and healthy yogurt fruit mixtures, applesauce,etc. Seal a week's worth of homemade snacks for 7-10 days in about 10 minutes. Then it's grab n go.Def worth buying.
