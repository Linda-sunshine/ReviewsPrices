review/summary: Love these knives!review/text: Love these knives, they're so cheap and they stay sharp forever. You just can't beat them. I expected the quality to be terrible but it's actually really good and they stay sharp for a long time too. These are serrated on both sides and cut straight. Very sharp though - take care. I love them. Sleek design and I've received so many compliments on them. Much better than more expensive knives I've tried (and had to donate to charity). Wonderful!
