review/summary: Makes very nice cubes, but can be tough to get out of the trayreview/text: I bought these ice cube trays for making baby food. It's excellent for that purpose. Each cube is 1 oz, so it's easy to know how much food my baby is consuming. In addition, the cubes fit nice inside a standard size baby food jar, meaning I can defrost the food in a few existing baby food jars I own.In general, the shape of the cubes is pleasing. As others have mentioned, it's harder to get the cubes out of the try. I end up removing them one or two at a time. We have an icemaker. If I was constantly using ice on a daily basis, I think I'd find this very irritating and buy a plastic rather than rubber ice cube tray. However, if you want to be able to remove one or two cubes without making an icy mess, this style has its benefits.
