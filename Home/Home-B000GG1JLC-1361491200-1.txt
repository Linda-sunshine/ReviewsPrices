review/summary: Twirl-a-Tie Tie Rack/Organizerreview/text: Honestly I was surprised when I got it in the mail. It's very tiny! I expected a little bigger that, it barely hold my sash. I thought tie and sash is not much different in size, so I bought this to organize my sash..now I think I will use this to organize my belts instead.
