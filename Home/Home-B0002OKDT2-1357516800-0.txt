review/summary: Love my new Omega juicer!review/text: I love the fact that this is a masticating juicer and preserves the nutrients. Being new to juicing, it is easy to use and cleanup is not difficult. Although this juicer is know for getting the most juice and leaving a dry pulp, my only concern with most juicers is how much are we leaving behind in the pulp.
