review/summary: Good for quick sharpening, but not for fine workreview/text: This is a good sharpener for basic kitchen knives. It does a reasonably good job and is easy to use. It can remove too much metal if you're not careful, but it isn't a sharpener I'd recommend for anyone wanting a shaving edge - for that, you have to do it manually with a good stone sharpener. That said, I use this to keep my kitchen knives sharp and it's great for that use so I'd recommend it. I'm docking one star only because I don't think it would be a good sharpener for delicate knives and, even for kitchen knives, it's hard to get a consistent sharpening angle on the curves.
