review/summary: I would buy this product again.review/text: The aeropress is simply the best and most cost effective way to make an excellent cup without a pricey espresso machine. Its quicker to use and easier to clean than a french press and it produces a clean ground free cup. It is simple and easy to use, you just put coffee in, put filter in lid, fill with water stir and press into your cup.This press seriously makes damn fine cup. I wish I would have found this sooner. Great for dorms, great for travelers, and great for a couple who want a good coffee first thing in the morning or a tasty cup on a lazy sunday afternoon. We no longer have a coffee pot permanently taking up space on our counter because this lil thing makes a better cup. I still keep the big pot for company as this would be too much of a pain for serving multiple people. That said, i'm saving my good beans for myself and the spouse. You do need either a microwave or electric kettle to boil the water as this is super low tech. However, in a post apocalyptic world if you have the aeropress, a stash of coffee and a supply of filters you can still make a good cup when you boil your water on the wood fire. You cannot do that with a keurig.
