review/summary: Believe the hype! AMAZING!review/text: This is an incredible non-stick skillet that can easily compete with other pans in the $100-$200 range. In fact, it's BETTER than most pans in that price range. I was looking for a superior non-stick skillet that could be used for everyday cooking without oil. After reading the Cook's Illustrated article and reviewing other brands carried by Williams-Sonoma, Sur la Table, etc., I couldn't wait to try this one. I can saut&eacute; anything in this pan with ZERO oil, and absolutely nothing sticks. Don't be fooled by the other T-Fal pans you see in Target -- these are NOT the same pans. This is the T-Fal PROFESSIONAL line. Best $$$ ever spent on a skillet.
