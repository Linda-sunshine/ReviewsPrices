review/summary: Beginner's Path to No-knead Breadreview/text: I bought this dutch oven as a cheap way to get into no-knead bread making with Jim Lahey's 'My Bread' method. As I wasn't sure how committed I would be to doing this regularly, I didn't want to spend a ton of money and wanted something versatile that I could also do some slow cooking in.This thing is heavy and built like a tank! I certainly wouldn't want to accidentally drop it on my foot, but the case iron conducts and holds temperature very well. 6-Qts is on the large side unless you're cooking for 4-5 people. The enamel coating helps make clean up a bit easier, but well seasoned cast iron should be pretty fuss free too. A down side is that the lid handle is phenolic and only rated to 450F or so and lower than the temperatures I need to use. It's easy enough remove and replace with a metal drawer knob from a hardware store though.I'm now looking to get an earthenware container to add to this mostly because it would be lighter and more enjoyable to work with, but this certainly does the job.
