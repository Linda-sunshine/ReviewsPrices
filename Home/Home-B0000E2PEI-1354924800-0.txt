review/summary: So inaccurate!review/text: After reading consumer reports I choose this model for its accuracy, according to there testing. I don't know who tested it but I either got a dud or they were &#34;blind&#34;. It was 7-8 lbs. off in comparison to gym, physician, & another home scales. Nice looking but I returned it. I followed the directions for setting it up explicitly, leveling, stablizing, etc. I'll keep looking!
