review/summary: A great wake up!review/text: As advertised, the clock set itself to the correct time as soon as it was pluged in, a great feature. The fact that both the digital LED brightness and alarm sound level are adjustable are pluses Another great feature is a push botton that shuts off the alarm and leaves the alarm reset for the next day. Setting an alarm is easy with a rotary knob that enables you to go forward or backward with ease.
