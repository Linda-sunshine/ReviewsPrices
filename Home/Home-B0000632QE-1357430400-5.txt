review/summary: Sharp and does what it is supposed toreview/text: I've not used a mandoline before, so this was my first purchase.The Swissmar Borner V-Slicer seems very sharp and zips through vegetables. I think the V shape helps here because the shallow angle of the blades makes shorter work of tougher vegetables like carrots.The holder thing seems very secure and I don't feel in danger of cutting myself at all when using it. You do, however, lose the last, perhaps, quarter of an inch of vegetable, which remains unsliced, as the holder loses its grip on the last stub of each item. I guess there's not much it could do about this, although it seems a shame, and seems more wasteful when cutting smaller vegetables (and if you try to cut carrots lengthways you lose that last piece, unsliced, along the entire length of your carrot, so to speak.I have found it is best to get some momentum up with the cutter as well or you can end up half way through a swipe and it stalls and you then have to very carefully extract it or push it through without the holder.One other comment - not really a gripe because it's as described - but it would be nice to be able to adjust the slice thickness more precisely. The thick slices are great for crudit&eacute;s but the thin slice is still too thick for potato crisps (chips). An option for thinner slicing would have been handy, in hindsight.It is very easy to clean if you do it straight away. Just set up (30s), slice like crazy (really quick) and then give it a quick rince/wash under the tap and you can set it to try. I'm very pleased with it!
