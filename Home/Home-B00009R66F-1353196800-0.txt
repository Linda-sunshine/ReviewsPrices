review/summary: Impressive, to say the leastreview/text: I'll be honest...the instructions on how to use this product confused me a bit. There are two triggers that do different things, and I don't know if I had a case of ADD or just didn't care. So, I started cleaning the carpet. I'm squeezing one trigger, then the other, like I know what I'm doing. I don't; and this machine didn't care. It cleaned the carpets magnificently! I highly recommend this product. Let me tell you why.I have two new puppies in the house and they occasionally get "excited" to see my wife and me, so they leave little piddle trails on the carpet. Pretty gross. My wife wanted to rent a professional machine, but I figured if we were going to have "mishaps" from time to time, wouldn't it be better to have a machine handy for such occurrences? So we dabbled with the idea of renting a pro machine to establish a baseline and then buy one for upkeep. So I figured, why not try out the "upkeep" machine first. Right? Well, I would bet money that any other machine would not clean the carpets better than this one. Stains gone, carpet cleaned, end of story. We walk barefoot on the carpet a lot and this carpet feels softer and cushier than ever. I almost want to spill something on it so I can have an excuse to clean it again. Buy this machine...you will not be disappointed.
