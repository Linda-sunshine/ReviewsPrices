review/summary: soothing warmth, doesnt dry the room outreview/text: This is my second winter using these amazing little heaters. I've always used a portable oil filled radiator with a timer in my bedroom (a small unfinished attic) and last year used one of these as a "supplement" Well, the timer gave out on my radiator at the beginning of this season, so I brought up my second little heater from downstairs. The two of them together sometimes even get too warm! I have one on a outlet timer to heat the room up about an hour before bed, then turn the second one on if it is a particularly cold night. My house is pretty tight to keep out the winter chill, but even on nights that get down to the upper 20's, theses guys do the trick. I have very dry eyes and use only heaters that don't drop the humidity in the house. This has become my new favorite. Wish it had a remote control, but value for cost was most important when I bought them. They are very light weight, so keep the box and you can store them safely up and away for the the warm months of the year. Love the safety feature also , just lifts up millimeters before it shuts off. Got one for my mom for her bedroom as it is safe, lightweight and easy to use - the knob is large and easy to turn. I marked the knobs on the top so I could see the power options better - o/w you have to look at the side of the knob to see them.
