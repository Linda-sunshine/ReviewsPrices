review/summary: Perfect Size for a one personreview/text: Ok I read all the reviews. Something my husband taught me before investing in any product. I read the ones here and in Walmart site. Amazon reviews are more thorough. I had no problems with this Brew 'n go. Unlike some comments about it not being hot coffee or tasting like bad coffee. I prepared myself by simply placing a #1 filter on it. Yes I know it comes per-filtered. I used only 1 coffee scoop instead of 2 1/2 as directions indicated. I like my coffee light! It filled the mug 2/3 's of the way almost full. IT is not pipping hot! But it is not luke warm or cold like some reviews state. It is perfect temperature, as matter of fact I left the brew on making coffee while I dropped my kids of at school. Fifteen min. later I came and my coffee tasted nice and hot. It was perfect. I thing I should tell you I do use distilled water and I option for the filter because of the comments mentioned on the coffee not processing correctly. I first heard of this Brew n' go at a company that I used to work for that sold merchandise to Hotels. I wanted one personally but they were always on back order for the Hotels and business, so I couldn't see myself getting one anytime soon. Im glad I waited because the price went down significantly. The Hotels like that it saves them on plastic cups and filters. I have no complaints. Except that if you complained about bad coffee. I deeply suggest trying distilled or filtered water, sometimes I even add one bottled water. IF you don't like the way it process with the inserted filter, try your own. I sincerely bought this not to save me money on filters but because out of my whole household I'm the only one that drinks coffee. For some years now I have been making 8 cups of coffee and I can't finish it all by myself. Brew n'go will save me money on coffee.
