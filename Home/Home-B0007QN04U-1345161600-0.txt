review/summary: pro 600 is really a proreview/text: The pro 600 really has the power to get through the big batches of cookies my wife makes. I was worried, from some other reviews, that it was going to be a noisy mixer, but it really hasn't bothered us. We got a great deal by selecting one of the less popular colors, pearl metallic I believe. I ended paying only $20 dollars more than the cheapest artisan, well worth it and the color is great.
