review/summary: Buying a second one!review/text: I was looking for a canner I could use with my glass top stove and this one fits the bill perfectly. I used it almost daily during the past canning season and am still using it for meats and such. No problem at all on my stove.It is large enough for almost all my needs and replacement parts are readily available through Amazon. That being said I think I will just go ahead and purchase another one as a back up and also for using when I am canning a lot at one time. The price is great on Amazon and it works so well.Only one thing I purchased extra. A pressure regulator (rocker). It just adds that bit of sureness to my canning that just the gauge leaves off. Other than that this item has been perfect for my needs.
