review/summary: Gets the job donereview/text: It is very fast but i noticed pieces of fruit or veggies fly out and since I'm eye level with the machine it sometimes gets in my face or hair. (very small pieces- but I don't think I should have stuff flying in my face as I juice) haha. It is Very fast and I don't think it takes 100% of the juice out. I tried to put the leftovers in for a second run and it works but then I have to put it thru a sifter in order to get all the juice. I am a beginner juicer so like the title says- it gets the job done.
