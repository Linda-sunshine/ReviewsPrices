review/summary: Popper throws hot kernelsreview/text: Popper does nice job of poping popcorn. However, safety concern with hot kernels flying out of machine and not landing in the bowl. If you have children you must make sure they are standing a safe distance from popper. I don't understand how these companies can make poppers that throw hot kernels on the market. FYI i did try other poppers and this one is better than others, but still a safety concern with hot kernels
