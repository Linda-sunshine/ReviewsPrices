review/summary: Mediocrereview/text: Got this for my daughter, who weighs about 115 lbs. Good enough as short term, stop-gap measure, but even for a small person is pretty &#34;mushy&#34; feeling -insubstantial with little support. Handle with care - this topper feels like it will tear easily. Out of the 10-15 memory foam padsI've bought over the years, this is perhaps the poorest quality
