review/summary: AWESOME but be careful with spices...review/text: I have had one of these for so long...well over 10 years. Still works like a charm, although the lever that activates the grinder will fall off for awhile. The same thing happened to my boyfriend's unit too.I ground some whole cloves in this which was a mistake. The cloves were nicely powdered but the cloves ate the bottom of the clear top and the rest of it was scratched badly. I chalked it up to my own mistake but I would not market this as a spice grinder.
