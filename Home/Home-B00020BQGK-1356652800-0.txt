review/summary: Love this toolreview/text: This small tool is a life saver for me - I hate having to sweep all my tile floors - all the time. And dragging out my big vacuum is a pain just to do a quick touch up on the floors. This little tool is very easy for me to use, lightweight. No it doesn't have a huge vacuum motor in it - it isn't meant to do huge or heavy jobs - but it does just fine doing a light run over the floors in-between big cleaning days. Have never used it on carpet - so I can't vouch for that. Knowing the tool I am assuming it isn't meant to do heavy duty carpet cleaning. Needless to say I love it, it has made my life easier.
