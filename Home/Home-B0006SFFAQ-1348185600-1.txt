review/summary: poor quality productreview/text: Bought it thinking it was going to be a ideal coffee maker, wow were we wrong, worst 6 months of coffee ever! Took 15 mins at least to brew...sometimes it just wouldn't work....and this was right out to the box! i recommend that you spend the extra money and get a nice one!
