review/summary: I like them so much, I'm thinking about buying a second set...review/text: These sheets had a lot of negative reviews with most of the reviewers complaining about them being scratchy... I honestly don't know what they are talking about. They're soft to the touch, wash up very nicely, and are a really beautiful shade of blue. I haven't experienced any pilling or tearing after washing. I was pretty impressed with the fabric weight. These sheets are a good bit heavier than other sheet sets I've had that were far more expensive. I'm very pleased with the quality - I like them so much, I'm thinking about buying another set!
