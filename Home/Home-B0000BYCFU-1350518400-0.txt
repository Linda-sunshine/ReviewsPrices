review/summary: PRODUCT & SERVICE ARE BOTH FANTASTICreview/text: This is the second of these pressure cookers that I have bought. I wasn't sure about purchasing the first one, as I like to see what I am buying first. However, I went ahead, despite the high shipping costs to Thailand, but I will come back to that.I am so happy with the pressure cooker It has been used every day for the past 10 months, without a problem. (I cook 12 Kilo of chicken, bone in for my family of Mastiffs & the chicken bones are soft enough for them to eat.) I decided I couldn't live without it,so I just had to buy one for spare & added some spare sealing rubber rings into the order, A good idea, I didn't with the first one, but no problems to date.I placed the order, it was dispatched by Amazon the next day & arrived at my door in Thailand, amazingly, only 5 days later. The cost of the shipping is WELL WORTH IT. Deliveries from Bangkok, sometimes take longer!!!The total cost of the item was $116, shipping $156 & Import TAX, (which is high in Thailand) $96. A total of $368.I saw a similar one in Bangkok, not even as big, for over $1,000. Nearly 3 times the price.IN SHORT, I AM DELIGHTED WITH THE PRODUCT & THE SERVICE PROVIDED BY THE VENDOR ON AMAZON.If you are deliberating.... GO FOR IT, before there are none left!!!Nick ThailandPresto 01781 23-Quart Pressure Canner and Cooker
