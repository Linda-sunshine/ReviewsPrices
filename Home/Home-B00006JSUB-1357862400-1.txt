review/summary: Every cook should have at least on of these pans in their kitchenreview/text: I can't believe I waited this long to buy one of these pans. I got a gift certificate for Christmas not knowing exactly what I wanted. I stumbled upon this skillet (i love to cook by the way). I have every type of pan you can think of but this is now my absolute favorite. I will be using this pan until the day I die.
