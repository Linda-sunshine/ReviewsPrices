review/summary: Not for Mereview/text: I had been struggling with whether to buy a Keurig when my daughter moved in with us, and our "coffee mornings" now include this particular model.There are several nice features, including the fact that it has a large reservoir of water, it heats quickly, and you can trick it into making hot water for tea.I tend to be a "flavored decaf" drinker, and her reusable cup with filter lets me brew that as well.However, since you can't adjust the amount of coffee inside of the cups, your only solution to making your coffee stronger or weaker involves the size of the cup. This features 6, 8, and 12 ounces. All use the same size cup. So making a large cup of coffee means it is really weak.I also tried the hot chocolate. I found it was perfect ... IF I added a couple of ounces of milk, a little chocolate, and frothed it with myAerolatte Milk Frother, Satin. It took a lot less time to go back to myMr. Coffee BVMC-EL1 Cafe Latteand make it exactly the way I want.I can see that this is a cool appliance, and it likely is perfect for a lot of people. It is especially nice for brewing just a single cup of coffee. However, I tend to like my coffee (and hot chocolate, and lattes) just the way I like them, so this standardized coffee maker isn't really the best choice for me.
