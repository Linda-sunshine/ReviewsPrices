review/summary: Love It Love It Love Itreview/text: I really love my juicer. I bought it initially so my daughter would have fresh nutrients from fruit and vegetables every day. It's very powerful and works really well. I do recommend halving most things that go into it other than celery or carrots, but it really produces good juice and pulp. I've made all types of drinks with it and have even used pulp to make apple butter. The unit is good construction and is very easy to clean. This is by no means a commercial product, but a mid to high grade unit for a home for sure.
