review/summary: works okayreview/text: it runs pretty high rpm when it going. very handheld but the hose itself isnt that long but the cord is. it seems like they want you to buy a lot of filters b/c they get filled up fast. like a printer/ink idea where printer cost nothing but ink cost same amount and you have to replace the ink every couple months
