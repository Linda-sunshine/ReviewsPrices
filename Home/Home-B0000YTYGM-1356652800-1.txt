review/summary: Great Coffee Makerreview/text: I like the sleek looks. It brews wonderful, flavorful cups of coffee (if you use quality coffee). The carafe keeps the coffee hot for many hours. --- At the beginning I found the lid a bit tricky to get into the right position for tightening. It might be worth including the instruction to have the pour sign in the opposite direction of the lip.In all I am very happy with this product.
