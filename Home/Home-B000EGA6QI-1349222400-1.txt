review/summary: Much easier than the Oster $20 one...review/text: OK, so I'll keep this short. I can't speak for how long this will last, nor how long the Oster will last.(I borrowed the Cuisinart one and just bought the Oster one.)**This Cuisinart SmartStick is MUCH easier to use than the Oster one. Even if they both break after one year, it's worth paying the extra $15 for the Cuisinart because it handles so much better. The Oster one has WAY too much suction and it's like trying to ride a rodeo bull. The Cuisinart is SMOOTH and lighter weight.**
