review/summary: Good Water Filterreview/text: This is a decent filter considering the price. It does what it is supposed to do. I just wish that the replacement filter was a bit cheaper because the price tends to fluctuate between $11 and $12 whereas it can be bought from another website for $10 and $2 saved adds up!
