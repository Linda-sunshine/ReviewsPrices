review/summary: Cuisinart DCC-1200BW Brew Central 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker...review/text: I traded out my Mr Coffee because the drip stop didn't work very well from the beginning. After I would pull out the carrafe, it would drip once or twice, every time. The burner was rusting out. I decided to upgrade to this Cuisinart because I googled &#34;best coffee maker&#34; and this is what showed up as #1 in two different surveys. I'm really glad that I did. This is a very solid coffee maker, not plastic. The dripstop works every time, the carrafe pours with no drips and the coffee tastes great. Noticeable difference from the old coffee maker. Easy to use and it has a little chime when the coffee is ready. For just a few dollars more, this is a whole lot more coffee maker. I highly recommend.
