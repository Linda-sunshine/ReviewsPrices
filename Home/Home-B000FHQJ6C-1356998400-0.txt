review/summary: Best customer service, EVER!review/text: I bought this juicer over 3 years ago, and I had a problem with it recently. As it is not expensive, I was prepared to just buy a new one, but I contacted the manufacturer first to see if they could help. Without hesitation, they told me they were sending me a replacement, and to send back my existing one with a shipping label they provided! After all this time, they would replace it for me for free! I am incredibly impressed, and not only was I thrilled with the juicer for the last 3 years, but now they have a customer for life, and I am buying a second one for my office! I had the $500 Breville before this, which I returned after 3 days; If you're choosing between the two, hands down this one was a better choice!
