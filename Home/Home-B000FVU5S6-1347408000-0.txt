review/summary: Quality matches pricereview/text: Selected this sheet set based on reviews, fabric, color and availability of extra pillow cases. Full set has been washed a few times. The color (chestnut) has held well and the fabric is starting to soften without pilling. Construction seems to be sturdy however I'm wary of the hemstitch. No flaws or unraveling there yet. Why introduce weakness at a seam? Extra pillow cases match sheet set perfectly in color, fabric & construction. Based on the current performance, I would buy them again unless I could find comparable made in the U.S. or without the hemstitching.
