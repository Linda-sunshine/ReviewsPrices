review/summary: Like it!review/text: I bought this because I just bought a house with a large apple and pear orchard. I read the positive Amazon reviews and echo them. Easily handles large fruit such as an apple or pear, and the juice is delicious. Cleaning is easy except for the metal screen. It comes with a brush and is not too bad. Make sure you clean it immediately after use. Apple and pear juice, which is what I bought it for, are awesome. But what is fun is experimenting with other foods. Honeydew? OMG that was delicious! Highly recommend this for the price.
