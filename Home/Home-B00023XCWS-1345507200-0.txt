review/summary: Good Quality productreview/text: This electric kettle does exactly what it is supposed to, it heats water. It does so pretty quickly. I use this for making a cup of tea or a warm bottle for me baby. I wish it held more water but for it being so cheap, its not a hassle to refill it more often. If you plan to use it a ton, get one that holds more water at a time. I have no issues with this kettle, it works perfect and is fast!
