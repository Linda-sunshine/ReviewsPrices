review/summary: Bad QC & warrantee policy (updated)review/text: It looks good and heats water fast, but mine leaked when it arrived and the unit does not automatically shut off until the water has boiled for nearly a minute (these two issues are actually related since the auto shutoff can be affected by water on the base plate). If Aroma had a simple quality control they would have noted the leak before shipping. Warrantee is good for a year, but the customer pays shipping BOTH ways and it takes 2-4 weeks. Since it cost $31 new, $25 to ship it two ways is a bit stupid. Amazon would take it back within 30 days, but since I bought this as a gift, it wasn't put into use for 35 days so I'm stuck.--Update--13 Sep 2012The written warrantee is restrictive, but I emailed Aroma explaining that the item was leaking from day 1 and they graciously sent a new one at no cost to me. I stand by the QC issue since good quality control would have tested and noted the leak before it was boxed up and put on a shelf for sale. And the written warrantee is too restrictive, so I still think a one-star ding is applicable. But because they corrected their error at no cost to me, I'm adding back two stars. I should mention as well that Aroma upgraded my pot to the next higher one in their line when they sent the free replacement.
