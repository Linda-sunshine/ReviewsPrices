review/summary: Love this coffee maker but...review/text: Makes great coffee and fast. Before purchasing I saw a few reviews stating that the heating element goes bad. I only saw a few reviews stating this and decided to take the chance and purchase.Purchased June 2, 2012Heating Element Bad November 14, 2012I went through about 70 filters meaning the heating element lasted for approximately 70 brews before making warm coffee. Now I am reheating each cup in the microwave.If it werent for this problem, I would give the product a full 5 stars.
