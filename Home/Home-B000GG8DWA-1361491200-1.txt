review/summary: Great little heaterreview/text: I now own two of these. Got the first one to heat the bathroom, warms the area up quickly and runs quietly. Got the second to warm whatever room I am working in, also does a good job of bringing the temp. up quickly. Highly recommend. Only downside is it is very light and needs to be placed so it is not easly knocked over.
