review/summary: DANGEROUSreview/text: DANGER! Unsafe product -- do not use with hot liquids! I wanted to make iced tea so I took this pitcher off the shelf, put some tea bags in, and poured in hot water (to brew, and then cool down and ice later). The pitcher literally exploded spilling 42 or 50 ounces or whatever it is of boiling water all over my legs and feet. As it was a hot day, I was in shorts and no shoes, so it all went straight to skin. I got a significant burn on my right leg, the tops of both feet and a small burn on my left leg. Zero stars -- unsafe product, definitely not recommended.
