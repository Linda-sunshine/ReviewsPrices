review/summary: Could have driven to Starbucks and back faster than this thing makes espressoreview/text: DH got this espresso maker for me as a Christmas gift to replace our aging steam espresso maker. We immediately noticed some design flaws:1. The clearance between the spout and drip tray is so small that I literally don't have a cup small enough to fit under it and had to resort to a small dish to catch the water for the prep cycles;2. The clearance under the steam wand is also very small, though slightly more functional than the espresso spout. I was able to use my existing frothing pitcher by picking up the whole machine and setting it down with the wand in the pitcher.Getting past these annoying issues, we then discovered that the machine is VERY loud and takes several minutes just to pump water through. It also vibrates so badly that the dish would not stay under the spout unless I held it. We'd already waited for the 15 min. warm-up and then waited almost 5 min. to run through the amount of water for a double shot of espresso. I tried again, as you're supposed to run five cups through the unit before making coffee. Still slow. After running through the requisite five cups of water, I decided to try it with espresso grounds. Took several minutes of shaking and loud noise before producing an admittedly yummy espresso.All in all, the coffee wasn't worth the wait and we sent the unit back to Amazon. Would not recommend.
