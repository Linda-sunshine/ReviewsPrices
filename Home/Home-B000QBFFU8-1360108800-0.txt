review/summary: Love this juicer!review/text: I received this juicer for Christmas after spending 6 MONTHS researching and reviewing most of the juicers that are out there. I wanted a masticating juicer but since I'm new to juicing, I figured I would try this out first to see if it is something I would stick with. Well....I am VERY PLEASED with this juicer. It makes great juice in no time and the clean up doesn't take long at all. The pulp is much drier than I expected and there is almost no froth. And what little froth there is, I actually enjoy it! I have no complaints with this juicer , and I will continue to use it until I can splurge on the masticating juicer.
