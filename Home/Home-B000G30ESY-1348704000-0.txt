review/summary: Perfect Little Machinereview/text: I bought this item for the sole purpose of making brown rice. It was a lot to spend for that one reason, but I am glad I did. It makes perfect brown rice, and keeps it perfect for several hours. I like to set the machine when I go out to do errands or to get fresh vegetables; just knowing that fresh brown rice is waiting for me helps me resist snacking along the way. Clean up is a snap. The small size is just what I wanted and it is sleek looking, so you can keep it at the ready on the counter top.
