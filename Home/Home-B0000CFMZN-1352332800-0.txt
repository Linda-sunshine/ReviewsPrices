review/summary: The only one to usereview/text: I ordered this because a review on America's Test Kitchen said Pyrex was changing the design, which would make it harder to read the measurements. I bought the 1-cup, the 2-cup, and the 1-quart cup also. The 1-cup measure is also tall enough so you can add some other ingredients without spilling. They are nice and heavy, which will mean they should be around for a long time. The handle is a great design for versatility and larger hands because it is open at the bottom. Easy-to-read measurements. They stack well together. And they are made in the USA!
