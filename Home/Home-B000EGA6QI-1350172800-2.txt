review/summary: Great so far!review/text: I've had this blender for about five months and it's been great so far. It's clearly not for "heavy duty" work, but it's great for completing quick, simple blending jobs with minimal mess (which is most of the blending jobs I ever need to do, myself). I heeded the other reviews and got some of the sturdier metal blending cups to use instead of the plastic one that's included (never even bothered using it with the blender, so it's made a great measuring cup, instead!).
