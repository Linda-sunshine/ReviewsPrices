review/summary: Potential Fire Hazard if Overfilled!!!review/text: If the bowl is overfilled with liquid (beyond the max fill line), the liquid may be forced up into the motor housing by the spinning blade. A short circuit, accompanied by sparks and smoke, will be the result, and where there's smoke...I gave this device 4 stars despite this flaw because of its great price and utility, as other reviewers have described.I discovered the potential hazard yesterday by filling the bowl almost to the top, way beyond the fill line, with soapy water and then running it, a cleaning tactic I'd been getting away with for the 15 months I've been using this chopper. It's a quick way to clean the blades, bowl and underside of the motor housing; the latter functions as the lid for the bowl and collects food particles. What I didn't realize until last night is that the drive shaft for the blade is not sealed. About 5 hours after I'd used and cleaned the chopper, it suddenly turned itself on and I observed sparks and smoke and smelled frying circuitry before I pulled the plug. I'm fortunate that I was in my kitchen when the incident occurred.So don't overfill this chopper, don't use my cleaning shortcut, and unplug the chopper when it's not in use.I've reported this incident to Black & Decker: they're sending me a replacement (kudos for great customer service!!) and I hope they'll emphasize the hazard of overfilling in their instructions and/or refine the design of the drive shaft and interlock switch to prevent the incursion of liquids.Perhaps a chopper with the electricals underneath the bowl rather than above it is safer, but maybe not, and that configuration is more expensive to manufacture.
