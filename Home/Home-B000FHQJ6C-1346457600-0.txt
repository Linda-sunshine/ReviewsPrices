review/summary: Ok while it lasted....a little too loudreview/text: My first time juicing and i decided to go with this model cause it seemed to be as powerful and cheaper ($40). The centrifuge spinner started spinning off center after about 2 weeks and burning the rims of the plastic. returned - not happy with this product and it was very loud (i live in an apartment so i have to be very conscious of the noise level).
