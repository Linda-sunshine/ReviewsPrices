review/summary: Worth every penny, make no doubtreview/text: Used nearly every day, and wish I had more of them. This just works. Cleans easily, great for cookies, and can see what all the fuss was about. No more baking sprays or aluminum foil, and keeps cookie sheets clean.Only complaint? I wish they were cheaper so I could buy more of them.
