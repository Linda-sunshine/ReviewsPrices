review/summary: Great Valuereview/text: I bought this dutch oven to make bread as described in &#34;Flour, Water, Salt, Yeast&#34;. I looked at dutch ovens in local stores and found Amazon had the same one for much less money. It does everything I wanted and is a solid piece that should last a century or more.
