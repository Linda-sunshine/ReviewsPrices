review/summary: permanent plastic smellreview/text: The plastic smell never goes away. After a year of almost daily use I'm back on Amazon looking for a glass or steel model. In fairness, this model has a detachable cord, and an auto shut off. It heats water in reasonable time. Inside is an exposed coiled chrome heating element which looks hard to clean so I've only ever used it for heating water. If you have the means, I'd highly recommend spending your money on a steel or glass model.
