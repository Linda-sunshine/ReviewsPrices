review/summary: My first bread makerreview/text: This is my first bread maker, and I'm very pleased with it so far. I've had it for 3 months, and made at least 10 loaves. The bread comes out soft and evenly baked, and most of the settings I've tried work well. I just make the medium loaves, since I live alone, and can't eat more than that before it goes bad. The unit is pretty loud while dispensing yeast and kneading, but not loud enough to wake me up in the night from across the house. I also haven't experienced the "jumping around" that other reviewers have. It wobbles while kneading, but doesn't actually move. The timer is great. A few times I've set it to finish as I'm waking up, and taken the fresh loaf in to work. Cleanup is also pretty easy, due to the nonstick finish. If the blade gets stuck in the loaf, just let it cool for a while, and use your fingers. Metal WILL scratch the coating, even if you're gentle. I've found that a toothpick and a little water works well for digging bits of bread out from around the post that the blade sits on. All in all, I'd recommend this bread maker to anyone in the market for one. It hasn't let me down yet!
