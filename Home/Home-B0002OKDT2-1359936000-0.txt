review/summary: Received brokenreview/text: I received the juicer as a gift. I put it all together, plugged it in and it didn't not work. Wouldn't even turn on. Tried contacting Omega several times through phone and email with NO response. I can return with Amazon,but have to pay shipping since past return window. Guess this is when it is beneficial to buy an actual store front. Doesn't help if you get a better price if the product doesn't work.
