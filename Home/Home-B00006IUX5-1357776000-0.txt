review/summary: cheap, but works GREATreview/text: We accidently ordered our organic coffee in whole bean instead of ground (thru Amazon) and rather than try to return we decided to try this inexpensive grinder and hopefully have this excellent coffee FRESH GROUND. It's a small and sortof cheap looking unit, but it works quickly and easily and it was inexpensive - so we're pretty happy with it. Also, it can be cleaned pretty easily so I could also grind spices or whatever with it as well if I wish.I would recommend this to anyone who just needs to grind enough for 1 pot of coffee each day.BTW - while I have your ear I would love to recommend to you the organic coffee we love (it's awesome tasting AND it will help your body be LESS acidic, more alkaline like it's supposed to be) - the coffee is: Cafe Britt, Organic, shade grown 100% arabica coffee from Costa Rica. (Look up the product here on Amazon.com for more info)
