review/summary: Great for a first time userreview/text: I really got into juicing a year ago and didn't want to splurge on the spiffy $400 models so I got this. First off this juicer is really fast and can leave your juicing a bit messy. Changing out the leftovers is a real hassle aswell but it gets the job done and I would highly recommend this item if you are a beginner.
