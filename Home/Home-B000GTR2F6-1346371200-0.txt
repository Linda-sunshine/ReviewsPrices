review/summary: Stopped Working!review/text: I received this as a gift one Christmas. I'm not one to write bad reviews, but I felt inclined to share my experience with this item. In the first couple of months this Keurig was awesome. After that it stopped making full cups of coffee even when setting on largest cup size! After close observation, I noticed that as the coffee is brewing, some of the water runs back into the water chamber through the tube. I'm not sure if this happened before this machine gave me problems. I followed the instructions on cleaning/de-scaling with no luck. I still would get less than a teacup on the largest setting. Ok so this would just be a minor annoyance that I could look past, but after using it after about 7 months, this coffee maker stopped working! It turns on but will not brew at all, not one drip of coffee. I am very disappointed in Keurig's products. I will never buy anything else from this brand! This happens quite often. My in-laws' machine stopped producing the right amount of coffee. Next, it will probably stop working all together. Please save yourself some cash and stay away from Keurig! I wish I can give zero stars.
