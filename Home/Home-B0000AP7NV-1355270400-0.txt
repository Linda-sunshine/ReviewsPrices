review/summary: Best-tasting water ever!review/text: Changing filters is a bit of a nuisance (you can't just pop the old one out and a new one in, there's a bit of preparation) and about half of the time when you go to pop the lid off the whole unit comes out of the pitcher with it, but these are minor problems for what you get. I thought we already had good water in our county, but drinking it after it's been through the Brita filter is a whole new experience. I had no idea tap water could taste so good!The slim pitcher fits nicely in the refrigerator, too, as promised, hardly taking up any space at all. I wish I could give this 4-1/2 stars, because it's that close to perfect.
