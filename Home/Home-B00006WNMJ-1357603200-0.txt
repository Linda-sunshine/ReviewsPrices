review/summary: Better than Purreview/text: I don't like the taste of water out of the faucet so I use a filter on mine. I use to be an avid Pur filter water user until the Pur filters began to leak and spray water all over the place. I looked to see if I could find another brand to use and found Culligan had one. I bought it to try and am sold on it. It is not only lighter than Pur and it also gives the water a nice clean taste, plus it costs less than Pur. So if you are tired of replacing Pur filter faucet mounts try Culligan. It doesn't tell you when the filter needs to be changed but they do give you a stamp to put on your calendar to let you know when the two months are up. Sometimes bells and whistles aren't worth the extra money especially when the product doesn't last long.
