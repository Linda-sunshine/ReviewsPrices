review/summary: Sleek, cool to the touch and perfect non-plastic kettlereview/text: Aesthetically and functionally, this kettle is great. No excess plastic on the inside, though technically the lid has some but since it doesn't directly touch the water, I don't mind.Looks nice, functions great a year later and I recommend this kettle to anyone that asks me about it. Though everyone that has seen it in my kitchen already likes it since I use it all the time and it really makes my life easier, preboiled water for pasta, quick boiling water for tea and coffee, and I even use it for clean up. Wastes far less water than waiting for my hot water to eventually arrive in the kitchen. And because it is insulated, it boils super quick and the time it takes to get to boil has not changed,but for some reason, every kettle seems to let the water boil longer the longer you own it. I just flip it off so it doesn't boil unnecessarily. It would shut off on its own, but what can I say, I'm impatient!I would like to point out that the rust looking stuff at the bottum of the kettle did occur once to me early on... It's easily cleaned and not really rust. I think I left warm water in it and may have boiled the same water a couple times or something. Turns out it was algae or something else in the water, just a good scrub with a plastic scrubber and it was as good as new (it really did look like rust, but it was not).Great kettle and I highly recommend it!
