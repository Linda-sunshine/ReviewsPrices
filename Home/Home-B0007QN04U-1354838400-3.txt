review/summary: Best mixer...ever!review/text: First, I must cofess...I got it for the best price, but thats because I have an Amazon Visa card and had over $300 stashed in reserve. My purchase price was just over $109.00. Yes, I paid for shipping (that's included in my final price), but I didn't pay tax. I had an older KitchenAid, so I didn't feel I could justify the pricey upgrade. That said...I love this new mixer - I wasn't slumming it with the old one, but this one just seems that much better. I won't deny, the price I paid made it that much sweeter. Whatever your reason might be...tell you one thing...you're worth it! I thought I was and I was right!!!
