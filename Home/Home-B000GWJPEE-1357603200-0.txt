review/summary: Cutest little humidifier EVERreview/text: My six year old is really into dragons and when his plain, boring old humidifier died, I was tickled pink to find this one. We've been using it daily for a couple of months with no problems whatsoever. It's quiet and produces TONS of cool mist which helps ease his breathing and helps with dry skin. I have found the mist sort of condenses and makes the area around the humidifier get a little wet, but this is just science and not a defect. I just put a disposable waterproof pad or a towel under the humidifier while we are running it.This unit is very, very easy to set up, clean and use. My son loves it and he gets a lot of comments when people visit him (he is bedridden) and see his cute dragon with misty fog coming out. It looks like it is a fire-breathing dragon LOL.
