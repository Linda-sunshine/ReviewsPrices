review/summary: It does the job mostlyreview/text: I am a college student on a budget, and got this for my apartment. I felt pretty bad as I feel like the term canister is misleading...this is a BAG vaccuum. I had a suspicion this was the case but the product description skillfully led me to believe that there was just a canister part you empty out. Nope, it's a bag.The suction is average. The wheels on the part that is the floor/carpet attachment are such poor quality they leave marks on my hardwood. I often have to run over a scrap of paper 2-3 times before it is suctioned in.I got this because hey, $60 is a bargain. But a vacuum is something you need to maintain a clean environment, and that is something I value more than my roommate at least. I'd definitely shell out for something more expensive if I had to buy another one (and probably will soon, after a normal use in a medium apartment...this thing is hot enough to cook breakfast on. Feel it's only a matter of time before the motor burns out.
