review/summary: Nesco FD-75PR food dehydratorreview/text: Just the right size to take care of the tail end of my garden. It has a small foot print on my shelf, is easy to clean, drys in a reasonable amount of time and you do not have to shuffle the trays to get equal drying. I am pleased with this product and have given them as gifts on two occasions.
