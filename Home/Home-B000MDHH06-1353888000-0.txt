review/summary: I wish I could like this juicerreview/text: I became interested in juicing when my daughter-in-law demonstrated her Bella juicer to me. After researching and reading customer reviews, I settled on this Breville model. It's not getting much use. It does a fine job on carrots, and a good job on beets, but with leafy greens and the fruits I've tried (pears, apples and peaches) it produced around 50% foam instead of juice. While the foam can be consumed, it has a very unpleasant mouth feel and ends up in the compost bin. This is a lot of wasted fruit and the money to buy it. The juicer, while easy to clean, has turned into an expensive dust catcher on my counter top. I'd never recommend this model to friends unless they planned to process only hard vegetables.
