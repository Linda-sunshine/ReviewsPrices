review/summary: Extremely Comfortablereview/text: These are some of the most comfortable sheets that I have ever slept it. I found myself lying in bed the other day thinking just how soft they felt on my skin. These are definitely softer than most of the flannel sheets I have used before and I absolutely love them. They feel like you're lying on a bed of fluffy cotton balls. I'm really glad that Amazon has come out with this line of bed sheets and will definitely look to them in the future as well.
