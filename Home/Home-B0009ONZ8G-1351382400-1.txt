review/summary: Cheaply madereview/text: I have to agree with some other reviewers who noted the flaws in this vacuum. The plastic parts are not well designed and fall off so often that I'm thinking of gluing them on. The hose is stiff and trying to use the handheld tools inevitably ends up with the hose becoming disconnected from the intake port. Relatively minor issues I suppose, but annoying none the less. Ultimately I think I would spend a little more and get something different if I could do it over.
