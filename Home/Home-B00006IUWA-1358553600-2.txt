review/summary: Healthier than microwavereview/text: Pops popcorn in the same time as microwave popcorn, about two minutes. It can be a little messy--until the heating chamber fills up with popped corn, an occasional kernel can be ejected by the force of other kernels exploding. A really big catch bowl helps minimize this issue. Careful, the hood gets very hot, but cools in minutes.Recent reports indicate microwave popcorn bags are lined with a potentially carcinogenic anti-stick substance. Also, microwave popcorn contains oil. This popper cooks without oil--an added health benefit! And if the chamber is cleared right after the popping is done, I can't possibly see how anything could ever burn.Put butter on if you want. We heat ours separately, rather than using the built in butter melter. Or for a more healthy topping, use extra virgin olive oil, it's pretty tasty. This popper will pay for itself after about 40 servings--or one large microwave popcorn box purchase. Overall it's excellent and highly recommended.
