review/summary: A Gift for Momreview/text: This was purchased for my mom who only uses Presto Pressure Cookers, the problem is hers are all aluminum and my husband and I have been after her to replace them with stainless steel. While visiting her over the Christmas holidays, we ordered her this pressure cooker which arrived while we are still there....quick delivery, that's an Amazon Prime perk!!! Needless to say she immediately throw out the old aluminum pressure cooker. She is very happy with her new one and so are we.
