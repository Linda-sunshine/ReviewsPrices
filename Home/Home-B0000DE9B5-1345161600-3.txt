review/summary: Product Mislabeledreview/text: Now that I bought it and it arrived it clearly looks very small. And I noticed someone posted a label that says two liter aka 66 oz (although it seems smaller to me). So if you want this in 66 oz buy it it seems ok but if you want a 781/2 oz do not buy this product and look elsewhere. Best. I just wish I had though the pic below before so I would not have the hassle of a return.http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B0000DE9B5/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_2?ie=UTF8&index;=2
