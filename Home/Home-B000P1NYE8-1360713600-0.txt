review/summary: Great for the pricereview/text: This scale is great value for the price. It really is a small pocket scale, but is exactly the right size for me. Mine is accurate without calibration, and I am happy with this purchase. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to weigh small things and doesn't want to pay for a pricey scale.
