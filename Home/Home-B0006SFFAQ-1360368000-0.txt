review/summary: Makes the BEST coffeereview/text: I have owned this coffee maker (cone brew style) for the last 10 yrs. I love that you can adjust the temperature of the warming plate to low, medium or high and have always kept it on low and my coffee has never been cold or boiled off to make it bitter. I also love the slow brew feature that is for smaller pots of coffee though I use it for full pots as well. Makes an excellent pot of coffee and has lasted a long time. I do believe they have changed the on/off switch though to a knob rather then the flip switch pictured. I had one with the flip switch and it stopped working and the replacement I purchased has a knob you twist to turn on. (is still going after 10 years) Love the auto off and that you can program how long to have that set for or not at all. Search and find your best price - but stop wasting your money buying cheaper lower quality machines over and over when this one will last for years!
