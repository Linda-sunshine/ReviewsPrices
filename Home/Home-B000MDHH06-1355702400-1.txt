review/summary: I use it all the time!review/text: Started using this juicer a week ago and it works better than I expected! I've put in whole cucumbers and apples without having to chop them up first. You have to make sure you use the pitcher it comes with, otherwise it'll make a big mess. Everything cleans off easily, it evens comes with a brush for the strainer. But I think with any juicer, cleaning up takes a while. Otherwise, I love it!
