review/summary: Hamilton Beach Toastationreview/text: I must have gotten a defective product. My mother had loved and worn out two of these, but mine will not pop up the toast. It just continues to burn unless I pop it up manually. Unfortunately for me, I threw out the box and papers before we tried it, so I am unable to return it.
