review/summary: Unfortunately Not for the Long Haulreview/text: I upgraded to a pump machine with this unit, and have been very happy with it; however, I do make several cups a day, and often leave it on between them. Apparently it's not made to stand up to this type of regular use: after just about a year, I'm having a problem with intermittent but serious leaking--from various parts of the machine.I'm really sad--it's been great, and the coffee is delicious. But it looks like I'm going to have to replace it, and probably with something more substantial.
