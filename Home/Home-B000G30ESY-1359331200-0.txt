review/summary: Makes Great Rice with conditonsreview/text: I would give this machine 5 stars for the quality of the rice it puts out. However, there are some points that I hope will spare others the issues I had. First of all, this the second model I had to try to get one that would cook brown rice. The white 3 cup model cooks a special brown rice that I have never heard of. It took a call to the wonderful customer service folks to learn this. Second, and this is very important, forget everything you ever thought you knew about cooking rice. Yes, this machine comes with directions, and those directions are in large print. But I kept looking for the ratio of water to rice. There is none with this machine. You use the same amount of water as rice. Also very important, using the cup that comes with the machine, measure your rice. Then fill with water to the same number level inside the pan, paying attention to what kind of rice you are making. One cup brown rice, measure water to the number one on the brown rice scale.Also the key to this great rice is rinsing, rinsing and rinsing, then pat down the rice in the pan before adding the water.Secondly, the directions will tell you that once the steam begins, the number of minutes left will display. It will not. Only the last few minutes of time will display. Until I trusted this machine, I was timing using my timer on my stove. One more helpful tip, this machine takes a while, Oh well, nothing good happens fast. So it goes with rice.
