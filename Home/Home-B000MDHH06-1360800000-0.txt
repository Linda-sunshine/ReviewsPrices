review/summary: Good juice.review/text: I bought this with the intention of going on a 10 day juice fast. It ended up lasting 7, but I'm glad I did it. The taste of the juice certainly took some getting used to. I've found that Apples, Pears, Lemons, and Ginger (and I'm not much of a ginger fan normally) help a lot to handle the taste of green juice. On the 8th day I passed out...perhaps I wasn't drinking enough juice, or my blood sugar was too low. I'm not blaming the juicer for it, since I was not taking any food or anything else along with it.
