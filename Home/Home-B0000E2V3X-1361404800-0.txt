review/summary: Simple heavy weight poductreview/text: Following recommendation from America&#8217;s Test Kitchen Radio program, got it (2), used it (&#8216;em&#8221;), LOVE them. Quicker to heat than pizza stone, the surface begins to season (cast iron, right?) and becomes more non-stick as you go &#8211; not that anything stuck at the beginning. Solid heat transfer is what you&#8217;re looking for and this delivers: pizza, breads, baked fries (very little oil needed), etc.
