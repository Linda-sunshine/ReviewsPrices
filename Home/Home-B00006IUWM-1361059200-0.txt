review/summary: Great Lil Sharpner without setting the satchel down.review/text: Sharpened several kitchen knives and it put the factory edge back on them. Seems to be a real quality product. Beats the stone any day. So far I love it. Doesn't seem to take much of the steel either. It is great to have sharp knives again! Affordable but works great!
