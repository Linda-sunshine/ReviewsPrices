review/summary: Nice, Quite Humidifierreview/text: After purchasing another name-brand humidifier and HATING how loud it was when in use, we purchased the Penguin Crane Adorable Humidifier to use in our baby's room. This humidifier is 100 times better than the previous humidifier we purchased. The sound is very quiet, even when on the highest setting. It makes a very faint bubbling sound, which our daughter likes. You can see the mist coming out of the humidifier, so you know it is working, and the light changes from green to red when the water is empty. The only issue we have is that the wood floors became slick after using the humidifier, because the mist comes out horizontally from the beak of the Penguin. We just set a towel next to it now, and it is not a problem, but if the mist came straight up from the humidifier this probably wouldn't be a problem. Overall we are very pleased with this product!
