review/summary: Makes squeaking sounds and glider spring comes outreview/text: one of the glider springs came out within a week and it was dangerous as the mother could have fallen inside. I had a very tough time getting it fixed. sometimes the glider make squeaking sounds. Would not recommend this to anyone else.The manufacturers should fix the spring so that it does not come out.
