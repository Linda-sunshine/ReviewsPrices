review/summary: Great vacuumreview/text: I was tired of lugging our shop vac and house vac outside to detail our cars. I bought this handheld because someone said it worked as good as the hand held Dyson. I don't have a Dyson so I cannot compare, but I can tell you this works really well. I have two dogs, both of whom shed and this does wonders on dog hair. Also good for around the bed and the baseboards where it's tough to get the vacuum. Works well in the car as well. Someone complained about the cord not staying wrapped, but mine stays put. The hose works pretty well too. Perfect for the car. If it has one flaw it's that it doesn't have a way to hang it. This is something I'd hang in the garage, but not an option.
