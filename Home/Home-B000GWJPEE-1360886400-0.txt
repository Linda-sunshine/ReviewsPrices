review/summary: Get the Elephant or Penguin.review/text: I have now owned 3 Crane Adorable humidifiers for my children, all 3 were different animals/characters. The first that I bought was the elephant. I was very happy with the humidifier, but I live in an area with very hard water and the humifier after 4 years of use finally died. I replaced it with the frog for my son and the owl for my daughter. The first owl I received had a broken tank, which amazon replaced right away. When I set up the new owl I noticed that the top of the owl head didn't fit snugly and all the humidity spilled out the top of the tank. I still had the broken humidifer, so I switched lids and the replacent lid fit snugly. I was happy. The diference that I am seeing now is that the elephant trunk directs the humidity away from the furniture into the room. On the owl and frog the humidity sort of spills out the slots on top and pools as water on my furniture around the base of the humidifier. This had ruined one dresser. I now have it sitting on a towel, which is entirely soaked by morning and is replaced daily. If I had it to do over again, I would buy either the penguin or the elephant which have spouts that project out the front of the humidifier instead of slots on the top. Otherwise I like the product.
