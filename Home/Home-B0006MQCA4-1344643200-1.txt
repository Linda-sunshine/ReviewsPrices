review/summary: happy happy happy!review/text: I bought this because the tap water in our area is beyond disgusting. This is totally amazing - I am only upset that I didnt buy this about 5 years ago when I moved here! It totally gets rid of all chlorine taste (or any bad taste) and is large enough that you dont have to refill it every minute. We refill it every evening and have enough water for the next day (2 adults, 2 kids and a dog). Perfect and fits easily in the fridge for awesome chilled water.
