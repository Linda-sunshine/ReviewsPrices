review/summary: Not a 12 cup coffee makerreview/text: Despite the description this is not a 12 cup coffee maker. It is a 7 cup coffee maker with a 12 cup carafe. The Specialty Coffee Association of America specifies 10g or 2 tablespoons of coffee per 5 ounce cup of coffee. If you put 120g of coffee into this maker it would overflow. The most I can get in is 70g or enough for 7 cups. Even with just 70g the coffee overflows the filter a bit. The filter and filter holder are simply not big enough to brew 12 cups of coffee. Cuisinart should be ashamed. I'd send it back but then I wouldn't have any coffee maker at all.We bought this to replace a brokenNewco OCS-12 coffee maker. Surprisingly, the carafes in the Newco and this Cuisinart are identical. The OCS-12 is a terrible coffee maker that makes 12 cups of great coffee when it works. This Cuisinart is very similar except for the filter. If it had the same filter as the OCS-12, I'd be much happier with it. Though I must admit the OCS-12 carafe shed broken parts almost from the day we got it. That doesn't promise much for the Cuisinart.We want a 12 cup thermal carafe coffee maker. This seemed to be the best of a very poor bunch, but the tiny filter means it really isn't a 12 cup coffee maker. The Newco OCS-12 can make 12 cups of great coffee, when it works, but it is very expensive, unreliable, and has terrible customer support. TheKitchenAidhas even worse reviews than this one and theVikingis worse still. Why is it so hard to make a 12 cup thermal carafe coffee maker? My current plan is to rebuild the Newco to use aBunn commercial filter basketsince Newco does not have replacements for the one that broke.
