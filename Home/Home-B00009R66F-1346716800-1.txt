review/summary: impressive cleaning capabilityreview/text: with 2,000 positive reviews, doubt you need another.Easy to assemble. clear instructions. in fact, the unit itself has appropriately marked parts which give excellent instruction on what to add, how to attach, where to store, etc.Of course our carpets and upholstery look brand new after one usage. Can't wait to clean the boat carpets again with this thing (they hadn't been cleaned in three years and now look great!)POssibly the most well-thought-out product i've ever bought. Hope it holds up!
