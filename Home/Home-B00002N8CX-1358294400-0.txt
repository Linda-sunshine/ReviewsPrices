review/summary: Great for stairs and the car.review/text: I'm really glad that I bought this vacuum. I have three floors worth of carpeted stairs in my home and this makes cleaning them a breeze. I also us it to vacuum the cars and the upholstery. The suction is great.Pros: Lightweight, versatile, great suction, good accessory and cord storage.Cons: Can't really think of anything. I remember some other reviews said it was loud, but that was compared to vacuums that cost 5 times as much.If you need a small vacuum to get to those hard to reach places a larger vacuum won't go--this is a great buy.
