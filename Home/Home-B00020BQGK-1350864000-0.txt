review/summary: Just what I hoped forreview/text: I had replaced another vacumm that had a user selectable brush with one that didn't even though it had decent reviews for picking up off area rugs. Well it didn't and I would have to use a regular vacuum to do the two area rugs we had. This was kind of tedious as most of our house is laminate except for the bedrooms and they get very limited traffic so once a week was all they needed with the regular full size vac.The laminate however I do every day alomg with the area rugs and the non brushed model just couldn't hack it. The Hoover Flair is just what the doctor ordered. Easy to put together, goes pretty low to get under low tables and entertainment centers and really has a strong suction. This in my opinion is one of hte best out there for the cost and the performance will not disappoint. Highly recommended.
