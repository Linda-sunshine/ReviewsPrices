review/summary: Easy to use, easy clean up!review/text: This is the first juicer I've owned, so I have no reference point. After research, Breville seemed to be a favorite for many and I can see why! It's very user friendly, makes great juice and clean up takes no time at all, espeically with the brush it comes with for the screen. The safety latch is nice and secure. It's a simple, and great machine. I definitely suggest trying it, great for the price.
