review/summary: Excellent little device!review/text: Very convenient little device. It looks great on the kitchen counter and works like a charm. I wasn't sure if this would work with all shapes of wine bottles, but so far it's worked with all that we've tried it with. Takes only a few seconds to remove a cork. The cork also rolls right back off the curved blade like thing after removal. No damage to it, much like opening it with a regular opener. Have had this for almost a year now, so far no issues.
