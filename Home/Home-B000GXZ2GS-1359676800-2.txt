review/summary: I can finally make delicious coffee!review/text: I'm very picky about my coffee. I shun drip-coffee machines, so I've always used a 32 oz stainless steel French press to make my coffee every morning (I also grind my beans using a Capresso Infinity Conical Burr Grinder - fantastic grinder). However, I've always had trouble making a perfect cup of coffee. My coffee would often be too weak/watery or too strong/bitter, and I'd get that characteristic French press &#34;sludge&#34; at the bottom of my cup (even with coarse ground coffee). I prefer stronger coffee, so I opted for the strong/bitter option and added sugar/soymilk to balance it. Not the best coffee though. After reading many positive reviews for the AeroPress, I finally decided to get it.After two uses, I'm already hooked. This is an idiot-proof way to make DELICIOUS coffee. No more bitter aftertaste or coffee sludge. AeroPress coffee has that delicious subtle sweetness that you usually only get with espresso - I don't add any sugar to my coffee any more. I did find the directions to be a little off if you prefer strong coffee (like I do after years of bitter French press coffee). I follow the directions for the &#34;4&#34; level (four scoops of fine ground coffee, fill to the top of the 4 circle) and top up the water to 15 oz, leaving room for 1 oz of soymilk (so everything fits perfectly in my 16 oz travel mug).Pros:- Cheap- Idiot-proof- Easy to clean- Coffee easily customizable- No bitterness/sludge- Coffee is delicious and sweet!Cons:- Consumes a LOT of coffee grounds- Can be a little difficult to press plunger- Takes longer than the directions sayBottom line: give the AeroPress a try! I'm so glad I did.
