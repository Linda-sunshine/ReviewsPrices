review/summary: Just okayreview/text: This isn't a great rocker but it works. Biggest complaints: seat cushion is a little too thin and the rocker often has an annoying squeak. It seems that it is very susceptible to changes in temperature and humidity. I live in a pretty mild climate (Southern CA) and it still seems finicky. Sometimes there's no squeak issue and other times I have to adjust how I rock to avoid the sound. Annoying. Still, I'm able to rock my baby to sleep every night and I enjoy the motion of the chair.
