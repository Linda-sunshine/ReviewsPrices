review/summary: Works Like A Charmreview/text: Today was the first time that I kept this on all day at work. I sip a little tea here and there, then I forget that I made it! Today I had a sore throat and decided that a cup of hot tea would help. I made it at 8:00 this morning. At 4:00 p.m. the tea was still hot! I told you I only sip it here and there. I was using a ceramic mug, which stayed warm on the outside. Tea was a perfect temperature to drink, even at 4:00 p.m. I'm going to buy more as gifts now! You will not regret purchasing this if you tend to leave a cup of tea or coffee lay for a little while. No more nuking it!
