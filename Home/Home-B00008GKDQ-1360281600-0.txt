review/summary: We use this almost every day!review/text: Santa brought me this last year, so we could make steaks at home after I got sick of searing them on an antique silver dollar cast iron pan turned upside-down. The key for even heating (for searing fancy steaks) is to put it in the oven under the broiler for 20 minutes to let the grill come to an even temp. before putting the meat on it.We also use Borsari seasoning on chicken and fish, and the grill makes the best chicken leg/thigh quarters with the seasoning on it EVER! Just make sure to put the grill pan in the oven while you're preheating and let it sit there for a good 15-20 minutes before putting the chicken/fish on.As for cleanup - if it's really stuck on, like if we used barbecue sauce, just run a little HOT water over it and let it sit for 5 or so minutes. Then, liberally pour salt over the surfaces and grooves, and scrub with a paper towel. This won't take the seasoning off the surface, but gets it super clean without soap. Salt is also a natural disinfectant. Throw it on the burners and heat it up for about a minute and it will dry nicely.We have had to use soap a couple of times after leaving our Weimaraner unattended with it before it was washed. He steals it off the stovetop and dents our wooden floors. But we love him. And re-seasoning, as other reviewers have mentioned, is very easy.
