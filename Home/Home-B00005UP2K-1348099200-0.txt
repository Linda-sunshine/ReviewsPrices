review/summary: My wife loves it!!!!review/text: KitchenAid's mixers have a reputation for reliability. That reputation still holds true today. I've had no issues with this mixer for more than a year! It works like a charm. Next Christmas I'm going to start buying the attachments (pasta roller and sausage grinder).
