review/summary: Love this so much that my mom, 3 best girlfriends and sister-in-law now have onereview/text: This small appliance will change your cooking life forever. Everything cooks quickly with excellent results!I work lots of hours but enjoy having healthy, home-cooked meals; with this pressure cooker I can cook great food in no time. I can do other chores around the house and just listen for the beep indicating the cook time is complete. I don't have to worry about this sitting on the stove waiting for it to reach pressure to set my time. I just set it and leave it without a worry.This is great for soups that would regularly have to simmer for hours with lots of checking and sturing. For example: bean soups I can go from un-soaked dried beans to a complete soup in an hour; split pea soup can be made in less than and hour, chicken stock takes about an hour and can be made in 10-cup batches.Risotto is my favorite dish to cook using the pressure cooker. It takes about 20 minutes from start to finish to make risotto, no sturing and adding stock in batches. This is a great week-night dinner to cook that packs well the next day as lunch. I also like to serve risotto for dinner parties, it is an impressive dish that can be made with little effort.Will it explode? NO!!!!!! There are so many safety mechanisms built in, you would have to intentionally alter the cooker to become unsafe. All of my girlfriends have had nerves about the noises the pot makes getting up to pressure, this is normally! Think about how much noise a pot makes when it boils...The instruction booklet and recipe guide that comes with the cooker has great directions and recipes.
