review/summary: Broke within 5 minutesreview/text: I couldn't have been more disappointed with this product. It is made from a flimsy plastic and literally broke in less than 5 minutes. It couldn't even handle a zucchini, which is one of the softest vegetables you could use. Would love to find a better product to replace this one.
