review/summary: Great plastic capsreview/text: These caps are essential if you want to use the jars for regular storage. I used these with the 4oz jelly jars and store homemade baby food in them. I haven't had any issues with them, They aren't as sturdy as other plastic caps the come with the store bought jelly or peanut butter but they are already. I dropped one of the jars once and the cap cracked pretty badly, so I do have to be careful with them. Overall I do like them and would buy them again.
