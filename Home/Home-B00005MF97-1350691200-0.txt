review/summary: Broke after the first use! Do NOT buy this chopper.review/text: I used this chopper for the first time to make some simple Chocolate Hazelnut butter. I chopped up the Hazelnuts and added a few other ingredients, and within 3 minutes of using it, the motor broke! Will be attempting to deal with the company to get my money back, what a RIP OFF!! I realize this was only 15 dollars, but it shouldn't break after using it for 3 minutes!!!
