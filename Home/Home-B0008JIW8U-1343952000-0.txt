review/summary: A good little coffee makerreview/text: We recently bought this to replace the French press we had been using for a few years. He loves it. It is simple to use and has held up so far. We love it and really appreciate the place to store the electric cord.Edit: After having this thing for a while, it leaks every time we use it. It is very annoying and thus in only a few short months it isn't being used much anymore.
