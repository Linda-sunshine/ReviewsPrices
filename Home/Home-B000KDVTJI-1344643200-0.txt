review/summary: Kettle leaks and does not turn off automatically.review/text: I have had the kettle for about a month. Like others who have reviewed this product, I also have found that it does not always turn off when the water reaches boiling, so you cannot leave it unattended.I also have noticed in the past week that it has started leaking. The water is coming out near the switch. If you hold the kettle up, I can see it slowly dripping out of that location.With these problems, I do not recommend this product.I subsequently purchased the Adagio Teas 3 UtiliTEA Variable-Temperature 30-Ounce Electric Kettle and found it to be a much more reliable product. The Aroma has been sent to my local electronics recycler.
