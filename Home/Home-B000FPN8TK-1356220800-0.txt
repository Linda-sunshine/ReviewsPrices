review/summary: Perfect for loose teareview/text: I give these for gifts for loose-tea-lovers that like strong tea. It's the best little tea pot ever, just put loose leaves in it, pour boiling water over, steep and place it over your mug and watch it drip. Voila. You can use it a couple of times with the same leaves.
