review/summary: Must havereview/text: This small food processor is great and so handy for small jobs. I use it most of all to make frozen yogurt. Using frozen berries or bite size larger fruit with fat free yogurt and some artificial sweetener, process until smooth makes a great healthy treat or desert. Try it. Josianne S
