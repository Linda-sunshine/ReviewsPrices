review/summary: Great and inexpensive cast ironreview/text: I cook a lot of meat and eggs, and this large, inexpensive cast iron skillet is a great way to produce satisfying meals. I have had mine for almost a year, and it shows no wear. Cast iron is just vastly superior to most other types of frying pans.
