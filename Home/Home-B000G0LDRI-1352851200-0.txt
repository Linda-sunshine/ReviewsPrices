review/summary: It kinda sucksreview/text: What can I say.... Im not impressed. I own two of these things now in a space 1/4 of the size of what the box says it should humidify and its still bone dry. These are rated for 9 gallons a day yet they hold only two gallons at a time. That leads me to believe that on maximum I should have to fill up the humidifier at least 4 times a day. Instead on maximum I fill the humidifier once every two and a half days. So no they do not push 9 gallons of water into the air daily. They push 1 gallon. Did I get a faulty unit? Well since I have two of them and they both act the same way Im gonna have to say they just suck. Id return them in an instant but the boxes were mistakenly tossed out. Buyer be warned these are not high output humidifiers.
