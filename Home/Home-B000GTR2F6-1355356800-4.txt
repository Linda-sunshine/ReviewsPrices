review/summary: Fantastic concept but machine is unreliablereview/text: I received this Keurig for Christmas from a friend who had one and loved it. It quickly became our go-to for coffee, tea, hot chocolate and chai as our traditional brewer sat collecting dust. Bought the folks one for their Anniversary and they were tickled pink. All the siblings learned about it and decided to purchase their own. Unfortunately, all of these have the same problem: they stop working at various points of their lifespan. The pump must go bad. The brew cycle shorts the water leaving a partially filled cup or not filling at all. Despite following all the descaling procedures, using bottled filtered water and the Keurig filters, it wouldn't brew a proper cup anymore. Then, it decided to power itself off and would never come back on.Mine lasted the longest -- 24 months. My folks, 3 months. My siblings went before the year warranty was up. Keurig will replace the unit up to one year under warranty. Sadly, mine was out of warranty at 24 months. Keurig did offer to SELL me another at a small discount. But, since all seven of us have had the same problem at various times, it didn't make sense to risk investing in a new one knowing that it may give out anywhere from 3 to 24+ months. This is disappointing especially because I have cases of K-cups that were just begging to be brewed. Great concept for a single brew, fresh coffee. But, the expense of the machine should provide a better lifespan performance.I'd recommend passing this unit up entirely. Instead, recommend investigating other Keurig models for performance & user reviews before purchasing if you want to go Keurig. Otherwise, there are lots of new competitors to the market to explore.
