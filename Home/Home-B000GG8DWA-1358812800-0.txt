review/summary: Great, but produces a weird heater smellreview/text: Overall this heater is great, but when I first started using it, it produced an unpleasant, &#34;heater&#34; smell. Sometimes the smell would make me feel a little nauseous. However, after a while the smell stopped.The great part about this heater is the topple auto safety; less worry about knocking over the heater.
