review/summary: WOW!review/text: I just received this little hand vac and I must say all of the reviews for this product is almost right on the money. First, let me say that I own an Elextrolux Canister vacuumn that I paid over $700 for years ago. To me, there is no vacuumn in the world that picks up dirt like an Electrolux. But.....I was so amazed when I plugged this one on I could not believe the suction this little vac had. It was almost exactly like my Electrolux! I was shocked! The reason I did not give it 5 stars was because as previous reviewers stated it is a little on the heavy side and the hose is made I think for left handed people. But considering how this picks up dirt I can live with those minor annoyances. Excellent product.
