review/summary: Big shiny water tub!review/text: Pros=I like the look of it. Shiny, modern. Heats water in a matter of minutes! After it is off, keeps the water warm/hot for quite some time. I personally like the top of it- how it opens/closes. The handle is thick and easier to carry Water meter indicator on the tub part- inside of the handle area makes it easy to see how much water you have when you place it on the unit heater. Red light at the bottom to let you know that it's on. My hand fits down into the tub to clean it-(right in between a small-medium size hands). So if you have big stubby wide hands..you may have a hard time doing so....bottle brush would work perfectly for it.Cons- The outside of the tub gets too hot to the touch. The unit is a bit loud as it is heating the water up. So if you were to use it in a dorm like setting with a roommate-could be bothersome. I ordered it for my cubicle..and noticed that it echos to adjacent areas and I warned/let my co-workers know that I have a water heater. They don't mind it. I just feel bad that it's so loud.I do dislike how short the unit cord is..it's about maybe 2 feet, 2 1/2 feet? I was hoping to wrap this towards the back of my desk and down to the power unit. I just had to move some things to make it work, but it works.So make sure you have an area with a power source near by that does not require more than 2+ feet to access/set the unit down. Keep up high from kids/small areas as they may burn themselves on the sides. Overall it's convenient for my tea!
