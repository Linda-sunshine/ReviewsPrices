review/summary: I can't say enough good things about this Cannerreview/text: I had always wanted an All American Canner simply because I was afraid of pressure canning. My sister's best friend was killed in the 50's by an exploding pressure canner and her mother who was standing nearby lost an eye and damaged her hearing. Therefore, my mother put the fear of God in us about pressure canners. She water bathed everything and by the grace of God none of us got sick. Now that we know that you can not WB all foods, you have to pressure can. This canner is built like a Sherman Tank and has both a weight and dial for safety. It holds it's pressure level great and I have no fear when I use it. My sister uses one of the cheap pressure canners that are so popular and she laughed and said that compared to my All American her's looks like a toy! This canner will last for generations! Very heavy canner.
