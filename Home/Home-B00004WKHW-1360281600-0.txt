review/summary: A-freakin'-stonishing!review/text: First, I love purple. So cool that they have this color. Second, I hadn't cooked for about a week, so I hadn't used it yet when I suddenly decided to make deviled eggs. (Don't ask!) It was sitting right on the counter, begging for its maiden voyage. So I threw in the yolks, etc. OMG! This thing is super fast, super sharp, super easy to use and super easy to clean. I wish I'd bought it years ago. This is truly an exceptional product. Bravo Cuisinart!
