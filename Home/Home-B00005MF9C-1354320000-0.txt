review/summary: Works well in my officereview/text: I share a small office with two others. There is a mini fridge in the office where this little coffee maker sits. It gets used two or three times a day at least 3 days a week.The quality of construction is not great but seems adequate for the price. It's definitely not silent, but the noise isn't too distracting. Though this machine comes with a permanent filter - the coffee tastes much better if you use a #2 paper filter.
