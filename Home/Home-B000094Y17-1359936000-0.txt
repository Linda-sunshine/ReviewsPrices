review/summary: Just a disappointment!review/text: I have enjoyed an older Brita filter pitcher for years and thought it was time for an upgrade. I have regretted this purchase primarily because the top doesn't fit securely. Twice now it has popped off resulting in a flood of water, just not cool. Avoid this one.
