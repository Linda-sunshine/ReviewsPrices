review/summary: Decent Coffee Maker, but Failed After a Few Yearsreview/text: My wife and I received this coffee maker as a wedding gift five years ago. Our jobs (we work together) take us out of town for a year+ at a time, so really our coffee maker only had about 2-3 years of actual service on it. Anyway, it gave up the ghost a few months ago and it seems to be a common problem with this model judging from our research. I've contacted manufacturers for other items I felt prematurely failed and they typically will send a coupon of sorts for a small discount off the purchase of another of their products. Cuisinart just said sorry 'bout it!Otherwise, it was a good coffee maker while it lived. It was very annoying that all of the condensed water would spill down the back of the coffee maker when the cover was opened - some even speculate of this being the reason this model tends to prematurely fail. The designers obviously were aware of the issue since they designed in a little catch lip, but they just didn't make it big enough.
