review/summary: Don't Cry Over Noisily Ground Clumped Coffeereview/text: This grinder seemed like a great value from a respected brand manufacturer. I own several other Krups kitchen appliances and expected this appliance to be top notch as well.Then I actually tried it. WRONG...Why? Because it's noisy, and difficult to empty/clean.It makes a deafening loud noise when grinding coffee beans. I would expect some noise, but this is totally unsilenced or muffled. The motor isn't particularly loud, the noise is produced from the contact of the blades with the beans while being ground. (So why not add a rubberized outer shell around the molded plastic cover to help with sound reduction and create a nice gripping surface - not that a better grip is needed)The ground coffee ALWAYS sticks and clumps in the base as well as on the cover. Shaking or tilting the base or cover doesn't get very much out. I have to manually dig the ground coffee out with a small spoon or brush.Got to love the marketing and packaging guys!! They must be adding some other beverages to their coffee. Because they claim (taken directly from the product packaging) """Unique oval shape ensures uniform grinding results and allows for convenient pouring of contents."""I can't speak as to whether these characteristics are typical with most other coffee grinders, but I can speak to this one and will be looking for a replacement that is quieter and easier to empty.
