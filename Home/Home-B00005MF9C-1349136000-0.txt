review/summary: Don't lose any PARTS!review/text: This single cup (14 ounce) coffee maker is good. It makes a single cup very quickly. My personal issue with multi-cup coffee pots is that I always left them on and burned the pot. On this coffeemaker there is no heating unit to keep the pot warm, the coffee goes hot directly into the supplied cup and you drink it.There are 2 items which are replaceable according to the manual. One is the filter basket. If you lose it, you can track it down through Black and Deckers Web site and/or call and find out that the REPLACEMENT COST is 10.85 + Shipping + TAX. Grand total for this Consumer Replaceable Part is over $21. Amazon has the whole shebang for $19.99 (stainless Steel Cup) + tax. and $18.11 with the non Stainless mug.I speculate that Black and Decker uses the SHIPPING "costs" as part of their profits.Black and Decker needs to understand that a Consumer Replaceable Part should not cost more that the original unit costs.Similar "permanent filters" cost about $3 - $9 on amazon.
