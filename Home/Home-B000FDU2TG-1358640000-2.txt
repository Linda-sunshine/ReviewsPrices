review/summary: The Beast from the Northeast: Tales of a Smoothie Monsterreview/text: I've only had this blender for one week, but so far, I'm beyond impressed, and completely satisfied. Since I live in New England, I've taken to calling this new member of my kitchen "The Beast from the Northeast", because it's so absurdly powerful and smooth, particularly when considering it's low price ($100). Yes, I know that the VitaMix and BlendTech are even more powerful, but the dramatic jump in price for those brands doesn't make sense to me. This KitchenAid is something like 900 or 1000 watts, and the others are 1500 watts... yet they cost $400-$500. So you get 50% more power, but at 4-5 times the cost.In any regard, this thing has done a fine job of liquefying anything that I throw into it, including big ol' ice cubes, so I have no idea why I would need more power. I'm really enjoying it for making smoothies, and as a result, it's enabling me to get healthier foods into my diet. I also love the design- it looks really sharp on the countertop, and it looks far more modern and well built than its competitors (including the super pricey ones, which look very boxy). Initially, I wasn't crazy about the buttons, but after using them, I'm very impressed with how well they respond to touch, and I like how their implementation results in a smooth, easy-to-clean surface. The jar is well built and heavy; feels like it won't break easily, and it's size is so large, I could probably make five or six smoothies in here at once. The base is very heavy and solid, instilling confidence, and indicating the powerful motor that lies within.The Beast is a welcome addition to my home, and I only wish I had acquired it earlier... this is one of the best birthday presents I've ever received!
