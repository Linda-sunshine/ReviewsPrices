review/summary: It's a treat!review/text: I've been using electric can openers for almost 50 years, and have never liked one as much as this one. It is very easy to connect the can to the location of the cutter, it is quiet and efficient. The taller height makes it possible to open large/tall cans with no problem. It looks nice on my counter without taking up lots of space. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a hassle-free can opening experience.
