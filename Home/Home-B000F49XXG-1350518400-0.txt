review/summary: Good While It Lastedreview/text: Purchased this item June of 2012, A mear 4 months ago. Should have paid attention to the reviews. Pump stopped working this morning, was so looking forward to a great cup of coffee, which this machine did produce. Very frustrating to pay good money for a product that quits pumping the water. DeLonghi needs to look closely at this item. I'll never buy this type again.
