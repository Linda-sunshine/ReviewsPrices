review/summary: Faulty power switchreview/text: I used to have one of these and really loved it, but after a few years the dispensing lever broke. I was happy to find that the Proctor Silex Hot Shot was still available, so quickly ordered a replacement. It came promptly and was packaged well, but, sad to say, the unit didn't work properly. The "power on" switch was faulty. Trying to get it to heat at all was frustrating, and forget about re-warming a forgotten pot or heating a second one; that just didn't work at all.Reading the other reviews now, it seems that the manufacturing quailty on this item has really deterioriated, so I don't think I'll try re-ordering it. Too bad, as I'm not thrilled with the very few alternatives I can find.
