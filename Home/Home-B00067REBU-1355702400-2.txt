review/summary: large and noisy, but who doesn't love fresh bread?review/text: So far so good, one batch of white challah and one batch of honey whole wheat oat bread. The machine squeaks and shimmies but hasn't fallen off the counter yet ;) It's ridiculously easy to use and prep is fast! Just add the ingredients to the pan in order and close the lid; it takes care of the rest. I've been using regular flour and I'm sure high gluten bread flour would turn out even better results, but the bread I've made has been pretty good too.
