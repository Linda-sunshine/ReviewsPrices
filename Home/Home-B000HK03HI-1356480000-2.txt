review/summary: NOT ALL CAN OPENERS ARE MADE EQUAL!review/text: and this one takes the cake!Seriously, I thought a can opener is a can opener, but this can opener is AWESOME. Super comfortable ergonomic design, I love the locking mechanism that really sticks to the can, and the little magnet tip for retrieving lids that fall inside is amazing!This can opener gets a very high recommendation from me.
