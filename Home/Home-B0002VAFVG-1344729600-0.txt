review/summary: Just started using it.review/text: I just started using this beast yesterday , but it's a monster. It has had no problem with any fruits or vegetables yet. It chews em up and spits out the juice. I'm use to using the old Champion juicer and it was a lot of work, cutting up vege's, stuffing them down the the small opening, and cleaning up.I like the big feeding tube. The motor seems way powerful enough. I'm still trying to figure out the high and low speeds, to see if that's worth it. And, the clean up is way easier then the old days. Whoever left the tip about putting a plastic bag in the trash/pulp container, Thank You. Great idea.So far this machine has lived up to all advanced billing. At this point, it's a home run for me.
