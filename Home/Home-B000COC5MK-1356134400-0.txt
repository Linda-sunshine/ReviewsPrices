review/summary: Awesomereview/text: This wine opener is awesome. I have given it to everyone I know who drinks wine. I've received my first one as a gift many years ago. I would not be without this wine opener. I keep a couple on hand in the event I want to bring a gift to a dinner party or if I discover there is someone I know that doesn't have one. It's easy to use and holds a charge for several days, sometimes weeks, depending on how much I'm using it. It's affordable, easy to use and the perfect gift for your wine loving friends. You won't be disappointed with this product.
