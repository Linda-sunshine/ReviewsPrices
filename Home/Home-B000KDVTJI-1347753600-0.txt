review/summary: Doesn't last!review/text: We've had two of these in the last 3 months. The first one started leaking less than a month after we started using it at the seam where the metal on the outside of the kettle meets the black plastic bottom on the kettle. We called Amazon and they shipped out a replacement. We've had that one now for about 2 months and it has started leaking at exactly the same place!Too bad, it works well (though is a bit loud) but if it doesn't last more than a month or two who cares how well it works or not?Terrible!
