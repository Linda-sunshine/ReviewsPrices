review/summary: Pretty nice little coffee pot..review/text: I've had mine for about a week now and I really like it. I use it every day, some days for coffee and some days for tea, and there are a lot of features I like about it:- Starts brewing within seconds of being turned on- Finishes brewing within 3 minutes- Comes with a travel mug with lid and handle- Travel mug makes pouring the water into the pot very easy- Comes with permanent removable filter- Everything is super easy to take apart and clean- Nice size, does not take up a lot of counter spaceThe only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because a small piece broke off literally the first time I opened the lid when I received it. It was tiny, nothing essential and it did not impact the functionality of the machine, but for it to break like that meant the pot was made with cheaper plastic. The piece that broke was just a little clip under the lid that also lifted up the filter lid when the main lid was opened, so it wasn't anything critical. The filter lid can still be easily lifted by hand.Overall, I'm happy with my little coffee pot and would recommend it to anyone looking for a machine that's fast, small, and easy to clean.
