review/summary: Hype sells, but fails to make better coffeereview/text: This device failed to deliver better tasting coffee then my oxo french press.As a result I see no reason to continue with its use for my regular coffees.Especially due to the approximately twice the coffee consumption of requiredThat said, I I will not be selling or giving away my aeropress... I does make great cup of coffee when camping.Also coffee brewed with aeropress tends to last longer brewed/stored in coffee thermos vs similar coffee press prepared coffee.I estimate the full 4 cup capacity only 350ml
