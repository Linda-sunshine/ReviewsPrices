review/summary: Lovely Productreview/text: This is much better than I had expected. I make cookies every weekend and was hoping this product would help speed up the process - since of the entire process putting the cookies on the pan is my least favorite part. This makes cookies all the same size, is very easy to use, and really speeds up the process. I have also used this for meatballs - and it is perfect. It makes perfect sized meatballs. No more dividing the mixture, rolling the meatball - just scoop and drop - perfect meatballs. Then just throw it in the dishwasher and it is ready to go again.
