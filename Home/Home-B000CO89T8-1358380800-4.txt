review/summary: Satisfactoryreview/text: I find that it isn't keeping my coffee as warm as I expected. I even switched to a traditional, flat bottom coffee cup to see if that helped. I am comparing it to another Mr.Coffee warmer that I use at my desk that works really well but it is slightly different as it has an automatic on/off to it instead of the manual on/off switch on this second one I purchased. I wish I had gotten the other style again instead.
