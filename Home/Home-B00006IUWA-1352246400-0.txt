review/summary: Very powerful appliance!review/text: I love the fact that this machine does the job. My only problem/issue is that you have to make the maximum amount of popcorn allowed in order to keep the popcorn kernels from blasting all over the place. When you try to pop less than the maximum kernels, there is less weight in the popper and more kernels get blown out of the popper due to the high intensity of the heatwave. This, by the way, is not that big a deal. For those that choose to pop a mere personal bowlful at a time, be aware that you have to tip the popcorn maker a bit so that the kernels by means of gravity, fall back into the popper. This does not change my rating from a 5 star. It is merely an observation. It does the job with intensity!!!
