review/summary: Poor build quality, but gets the job done!review/text: Ok, as a avid espresso fan, I was very eager to get an espresso machine that fits my budget.While it produces good espresso, you definitely gets what you paid for: flimsy handle that does not fit perfectly, cheap plastic body, a steamer that doesn't really work.Again, the espresso does come out. But I would not bet that this product can last.
