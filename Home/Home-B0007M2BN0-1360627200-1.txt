review/summary: Great!review/text: This egg boiler is impressive. There is a youtube video that explains the science behind the microwave and how this egg boiler works. Basically there is an aluminum shield that holds the eggs. Water is below in a simple chamber. The microwave bypasses the eggs inside the aluminum shield and super heats the water below. So, you actually get unmicrowaved eggs and they are perfect every time. Just like boiled eggs! Hard. Medium. Soft. There is a timing chart with times for different egg hardness. I made my own chart based on my microwave. It is fairly cThis is so worth it for time savings and clean up is sooo easy!!
