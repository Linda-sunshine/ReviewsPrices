review/summary: Good opener but difficult to usereview/text: I would gift this opener five starts, but it just isn't the easiest to use. I love Zyliss products - very high quality and this one doesn't disappoint there. However, you have to apply the opener perfectly or it doesn't close smoothly. Also, it is difficult to use the magnet. By the time you release the opener and position it just perfectly to get the lid, the lid has already started to sink into the can. Now, once you get the lid, the magnet release is a really neat feature. I just wish it was a little easier on the hands.
