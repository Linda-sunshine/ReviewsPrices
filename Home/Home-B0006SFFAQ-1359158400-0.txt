review/summary: Doesn't grind coffee and no troubleshooting availablereview/text: We took this out, cleaned everything and read the instructions, poured some fancy coffee in the top and turned it on. Nothing happened! For the life of us we could not figure out what was wrong. Took the whole thing apart spilling my fancy coffee everywhere and tried again. After three times it still wouldn't grind (although it sounded like it was working) so we switched back to our old coffee grinder. What gives!?!?
