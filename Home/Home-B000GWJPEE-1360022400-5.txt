review/summary: Broke Down after 4 weeksreview/text: Followed directions to the letter..was trying to clean with vingear this afternoon, and sitting it in the wash basin, it broke--agh plastic stuff--this product is not sturdy enough to last. Cute, but useless...it lasted only 4 weeks..Diane Werneke
