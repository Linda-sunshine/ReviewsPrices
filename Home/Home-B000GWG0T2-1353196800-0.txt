review/summary: Great Panreview/text: I bought this after reading a review in a newspaper and reading the Amazon reviews. It is a fantastic pan. It is light weight, cooks slow and balanced and the clean up is excellent. We use it for eggs which tend to be hard on pans but this one has held up great so far.
