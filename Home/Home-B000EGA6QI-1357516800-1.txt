review/summary: Quit working after 3 monthsreview/text: I bought this item in October. I used it several times on soups and smoothies and it was great. All of the sudden, it just stopped working. The motor runs but the blades do not turn. I take excellent care of my appliances. I hand washed this and kept it in the original box, stored in my cupboard and not getting much wear and tear at all. It was used to blend only easy to blend items since I am a vegetarian. There is NO reason for something to break down under these conditions. I would never recommend this item to another buyer. Oh, and I'm a month past my return date, so I am stuck with buying a different brand and hoping for better.
