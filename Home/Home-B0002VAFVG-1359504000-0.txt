review/summary: Top of the line juicerreview/text: I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband, per his specific request. Now we are going broke because he is constantly buying fresh fruits and veggies to JUICE! He uses the juicer almost daily. My toddler hears it from another room and says, &#34;Daddy's juicing!&#34; The operation is very clean. Put a plastic bag in the pulp-catcher for easy clean-up, and read the product instructions for cleaning the filter. It's very easy clean-up, other than brushing the filter out; but it comes with a cleaning brush. It's a big, tall machine that has taken over a couple of square feet of my counter space. Nevertheless, it's become our most-used appliance so it's worth it. My husband has recommended it to friends, as well.
