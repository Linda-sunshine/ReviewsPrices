review/summary: It's plastic, but it's okreview/text: I am not a fan of mixing hot water with plastic. People think that BPA is the only thing that can leak into water, but BPA is just one of many things that plastic leaches with hot water contact. Of coarse there are currently no studies looking into whether these chemicals are harmful to humans or not but I hate taking the chance. (Remembering how the Roman elite used to bathe in Lead bathtubs not knowing why they were getting sick and how our grandparents would grab asbestos with their bare hands not understanding why they had respiratory problems.) There are likely many things we do today that our great grand-children will gasp in disbelief at how we are unknowingly harming ourselves. But that is life. So I must admit that I love this thing. It works so well. and with the millions of teapots out there very few have infusers that allow the leaves to fully move and bloom like this baby does. I just wish they made a stainless steel or glass version. It being plastic makes me not use it as much as some other infusers I have... but it could all just be needless worry. I just wish there was another option so I wouldn't have to worry.
