review/summary: Uses its own electrical outlet!review/text: You have to plug this into its own outlet. If you plug it into an outlet that has other appliances plugged into it or into a power surge protector, it will not have enough power to function. I thought mines was broken out of the box because barely any vapor came out on low setting, but once I switched it over to another outlet, with no other electronics plugged into it, it blew a lot of a vapor out on the same low setting. It has a quiet hum to it, nothing that should keep you awake at night. You'll also hear water dropping, which shouldn't be keeping you up at night either. Overall, this product is decent for the price. I'll only be using it roughly 3 months out of the year when it gets really cold in California.
