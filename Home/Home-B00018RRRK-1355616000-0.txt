review/summary: Stopped workingreview/text: We have had our grinder for about 2 years; it is noisy but it worked ok. We grind fresh coffee beans usually every day. This morning, it just stopped working. It ground enough beans for one cup and just quit. Upon inspection down into the area of the grinder, nothing was obstructing the operation. Apparently the off/on switch just failed. It's of no use to us now. Into the trash it goes. This unit should have given more years of service than just two.
