review/summary: Cheap and Efficientreview/text: This product meets my needs. I leave it in the office and it works fine. The coffee doesn't taste bad (note I am not a connoisseur of the finer beans that are found in the deep jungles of Columbia...but I digress)It works and makes hot coffee, therefore I am satisfied.
