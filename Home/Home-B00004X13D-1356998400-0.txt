review/summary: Wow'd with this waffle bakerreview/text: Bought this a year ago after tiring a local cafe that charged $10+ for a meal of these Belgian waffles/per person in our family and realized we should be making them at home! This makes fabulous Belgian waffles, just scrumptious. Don't bother with the expensive other irons out there, this one is fabulous. I've entertained using this and blown away guest. Professional quality and comes with great recipes.... just wish it made more than 1 at a time but it isn't that big of a deal breaker.
