review/summary: Nice Coffee Makerreview/text: This is a replacement for my last Cuisinart 12 cup coffee maker (which was probably 6 plus years old); it is almost identical; the only upgrade is this one comes with a little metal coffee filter; you have the option of removing this metal cone and using the paper filters. From what I have read, I have decided to just use the paper ones as they remove more sediment and oil. I like a mild, bitter free coffee (so I use a Chemex whenever I have time--BEST COFFEE MAKER IN THE WORLD IN MY OPINION--but not a good unit when you are going to work or in a hurry--see my review on it). Anyway, when time is short, this coffee maker is simple to operate, has a small clock (that you can't see very well as it is very small and inconspicuous); the machine is programmable as advertised. The unit has a small charcoal filter that is easily accessible (it's at the end of the plastic piece that fits in the top left corner of the machine where you put the water in), and it is very easy to change (the plastic double piece just pops open and then you can remove the old filter). The controls are pretty much the same as my old unit except there is now an off/on switch (my old one you just moved the dial to brew, and presto it started working). This unit (like the old one) has a 1 to 4 cup brewing option. I guess what I am saying is if it isn't broke don't fix it (or if you have a good product don't make a lot of changes to it--it should last well if you take care of it--like most things in life). I think it is the best electrical unit on the market for the money.
