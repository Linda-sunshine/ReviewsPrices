review/summary: HOTreview/text: The other reviews which said that it does not get hot must have had a different production run than the one I have. This thing gets hot! It is very small but works great and takes up very little room, this means you can throw it in the cupboard and save on counter space. Takes about 2 minutes to brew a cup and there is no scalding like with the heater element coffee makers. A note... this brews directly onto the lid so the lid must be placed with the large hold pointing away from the machine. The base that holds the cup is on a slight decline to allow for the brew to drain into the cup and this works perfectly. I was worried that it might over run because it would brew faster than the hole could accept the liquid but this does not happen. Good Product and works great for what it was designed to do .
