review/summary: Powerful machine!review/text: I have used this juicer every day since I purchased it. Amazon almost always come through with the best price.The juicer is very powerful. It makes about 2 cups of juice at a time and is quick, easy and does a fantastic job.The only downside, and I'm sure this is true of most juicers, is cleaning it out. This comes with its own brush, but the handle portion is what I use most to get the pulp out of the collection part.The mesh screen does have to be scrubbed. Most of the main parts are dish-washer safe - however, be warned that if you don't clean it out first, the pulp will bake on the parts during the heat cycle.And as another reviewer said, it is a very strong motor! Smaller leafy items, like kale, will come flying out when you move the food pusher out to add more. Keep your hand over the opening!
