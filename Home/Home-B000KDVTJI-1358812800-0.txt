review/summary: Hot Hot Hot in the good wayreview/text: Love the Kettle. It is pretty and sleek and the water gets nice and hot. And then it keeps the water I don't use hot so I can come back for a second cup. There was a warning about the metal part getting hot but it wasn't dangerously or uncomfortably so.
