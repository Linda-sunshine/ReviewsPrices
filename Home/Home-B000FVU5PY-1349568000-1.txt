review/summary: Not happyreview/text: Nice sheets, or so I thought. The first time I washed them they shrunk badly, and I faithfully followed the washing instructions. Now the fitted sheet takes two people to force on, and the pillowcases are so shrunk I can't use them.I will not buy this brand again.
