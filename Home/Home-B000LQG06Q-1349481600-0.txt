review/summary: Minty smell masking chemical outgassingreview/text: For five days, I aired out this (queen-size) topper as best I could in a spare bedroom. I finally gave up and bought a water-proof mattress cover (protector) to put it in. Too large, of course, but easy enough to take up the slack. This brought the smell down to a manageable level, and by now I imagine the minty scent has mostly dissipated.It seems that this minty scent is a new gimmick appearing in many companies' sleeping products that is used to mask the unavoidable outgassing of noxious chemicals in newly fabricated materials. After all, if the minty scent were a true feature, why would they design it to fade over the course of a few days or weeks? I would rather have an unmasked product so I can tell when the majority of the outgassing is complete, and so begin to use the product. Or have a product that is pre-outgassed by not going directly from manufacture to packaging, even if it costs a little more.In any case, this product performs its function well enough for the price, but it feels more like classic foam rubber than a much denser and more expensive topper (such as an old twin-size topper I own). My queen-size mattress is 8-1/2" thick and correspondingly cropped in length and width, so the topper fits it almost precisely. My fitted sheet has trouble staying on properly, but I can live with that.
