review/summary: Takes a long timereview/text: Bought this dehydrator because the reviews said it work great and dried fast. Mine takes about 3 times as it says it should to dry fruit. At first I thought it was becasue we were doing fruit leather at the same time as fruit, but now we have done just fruit and it took over 12 hours to dry thin sliced peaches. I do like the fruit leather trays.
