review/summary: A Dream Come True- Ditch Boiling On The Stove- Get Thisreview/text: This is a dream come true. Love this product. Works exactly as it says. In the directions it tells you how many minutes to boil based on the watts of your microwave which is really nice. Perfectly hard boiled egss the first time I used it. So glad, I do not have to boil eggs on the stove ever again. Only draw back- wish it boiled more than 4 eggs at a time but that hardly is a draw back for me considering how great this product works! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
