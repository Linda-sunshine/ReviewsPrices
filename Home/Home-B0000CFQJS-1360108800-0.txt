review/summary: Very good, but depends on your preferencesreview/text: I like the difference in flavor from this permanent coffee filter compared to a paper filter -- but my wife does not like the very small grounds in the bottom of the coffee pot that come through the fine mesh. I didn't really notice them when drinking the coffee, but I could see them in the bottom of the pot. If you grind your own coffee coarsely or if you don't mind small particles, I definitely recommend this item.
