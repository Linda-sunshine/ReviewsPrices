review/summary: Great functionality, mediocre design.review/text: The kettle itself runs great. It heats up water quickly and holds a decent amount. However the filling to the recommended level or above reveals a design flaw in the production of the kettle. On the inside of the kettle of where the handle is attached, there is a tiny black opening that leads to the inside of the handle itself, which drains out to the bottom of the kettle on the EXTERIOR. Meaning that if you fill it anywhere close to the recommended level, when it boils the water itself spills out onto your counter or wherever you've placed it. This is a nightmare waiting to happen especially if you have it sitting on a bedroom dresser for quick access in the middle of the night.
