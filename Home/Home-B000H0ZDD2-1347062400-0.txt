review/summary: Mislabeled Productreview/text: They sell one version called the "Eva-dry Electric Petite Dehumidifier" and this one, currently called the "Eva Dry Petite Dehumidifier" and currently costing about $5 more.Both seem to have identical specs, so you would think the word "electric" was the difference? This one may be battery powered? Nope, still powered by a cord.They need to relabel this product and make it more specific. I still can't see the difference, they look 100% identical. Did I just pay $5 for nothing?
