review/summary: Great cast iron product!review/text: We are very pleased with this griddle/grill. We have used it on the oblong burner as well as two burners on our gas stove. Works great with both. We have grilled hamburgers and salmon on it. Also cooked pancakes, bacon etc. on the griddle.We've ditched the electric griddle (was just taking up space) and the grill has been awesome when we don't want to go outside when it's so cold.It did come seasoned but of course will take many uses to get to where you want it but will be well worth the wait!!I do recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good cast iron product. Cleans up good and I always lightly oil it after it is cleaned.
