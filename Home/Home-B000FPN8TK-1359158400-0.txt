review/summary: Not 32 oz.!review/text: I bought the 32 oz. teapot. I haven't even used it yet because I was struck by its small size. I used a measuring cup to fill it up, and I got to about 28 oz, and that's filling it up dangerously high. I sent an email to the company asking where the other 4 oz went. I'll update if I hear a response. Someone else had a similar review so I know I'm not the only one, and its not my math!
