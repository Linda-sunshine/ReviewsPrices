review/summary: Gets the Job Done but Loud!review/text: I bought this Air Purifier for use during spring time while I was in college. During the spring and summer time, pollen counts were high where I was living at and I would always be sneezing or have runny nose.Since I got this unit, I basically left it on when I'm not in my room, usually for about 8 to 10 hours. After leaving it on for first the day, I started to notice improvement. Less runny nose and the air felt cleaner. However, why would I only leave it on while I'm gone? Well, the unit is quite loud, especially too loud when I sleep.Overall, this unit gets the job done, but it is quite loud while in use. It's good for the price, but minus 1 star for it's loudness.
