review/summary: Everything I want or need.review/text: This coffee maker is everything I want or need. It is easy to prepare, easy to clean, takes very little counter space. The timed auto-start feature means by the time i get to the kitchen, the coffee's made. The auto off feature means no burned coffee in the bottom of the pot. It makes just enough without waste, but If I want more, it takes just a minute to make more. It is perfect. Thanks!
