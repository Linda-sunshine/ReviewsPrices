review/summary: Love it but LOTS of cleaningreview/text: I was so excited to have fresh juices daily, but didn't realize just how much cleanup is involved. The juicer is really powerful and I really can't say I have any complaints other than the outermost shell seems to be permanently fogged up after one week of use (possibly from cleaning regularly?). The cleaning brush tool is very handy and at the opposite end the brush can also be used as a scraper to clean out all the extra pulp and what not in those tiny little nooks and crannies. Also worth mentioning you can only make one juice at a time without cleaning the entire thing out and starting over again... kind of annoying.
