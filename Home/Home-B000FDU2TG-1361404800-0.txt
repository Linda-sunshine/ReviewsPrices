review/summary: Great!review/text: I bought this product for use outside the USA, 3 times the price for the local version!!Has heaps of grunt and is well made. I misread the opening description and didn't realise the jar is plastic (polycarbonate) not glass. My fault not Amazons, but dont get caught like I did.I have read after a year or so the jar can leak, so far no problem but will report back if mine does.
