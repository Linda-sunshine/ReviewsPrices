review/summary: you've gotta be kiddingreview/text: I am so amazed that this vacuum cleaner rates well on various websites - many calling it the best value canister vacuum!... Yes, it is very reasonably priced (ie.. cheap), but it does not make up for the fact that it is a crappy (I probably should have known from the ugly yellow color they gave it..)I had a MIghty Mite for many years and was so happy with it, I thought it would be a no-brainer to replace it with the same. But the new one (3670G) is so cheaply made that it's shocking, The (12 amp) machine and the suction are totally fine, but the hose, arm and head are so cheaply made (light and thin plastic) that they bend almost in half with smallest amount of pressure. This makes it almost impossible to pass it over any carpeting (even low carpet). In addition, the main brush head has gotten much smaller (from 12&#34; down to 10&#34;) giving it a reduced cleaning swath.I would have kept the new machine and just attached the hose and head from my older one (since it was so cheap, but the head attachment is what broke (after 15yrs) and why I needed to replace my previous MIght Mite. If you only have to use it for easy cleaning on hard floors with no carpeting then I suppose you could get by with it and be happy.I am returning this one - it seems more like a toy than a real vacuum cleaner.
