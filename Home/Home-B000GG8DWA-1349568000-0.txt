review/summary: Potential Safety Risk You Should Know About-Consumer Reportsreview/text: In the November 2012 Consumer Reports, this heater is cited as a safety risk. They state it was the only heater in their tests of 19 models that set clothes on fire.When Consumer Reports contacted Optimus, they were told the company fixed the problems for 2012 models. I bought this in 2009 from Amazon and the date on the back is July 2008, so not sure what model would be shipped to you if you purchase it here.Consumer Reports states they are asking the Consumer Product Safety Commission to recall this model and state that if you already own it, to stop using and ask the retailer for a refund.
