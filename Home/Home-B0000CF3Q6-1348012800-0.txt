review/summary: The classic, realible, always efficient Bialettireview/text: I come from Italy. In my home I am used to prepare the coffee either with an espresso machine or with the Moka. The Bialetti is the Mocka par excellence. There are many other coffeepot, made up of aluminium, or of steel... There is the difficult of choosing. Some of them are interesting for the design. The Moka of Bialetti, however, can never disappoint you. If used following the few instructions, it always makes a good coffee.
