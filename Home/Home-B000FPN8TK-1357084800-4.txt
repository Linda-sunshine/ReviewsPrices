review/summary: Really usefulreview/text: I use this daily. It hasn't stained, and works well.The only undesirable is that the teapot is so light, when there is just a half teaspoon of tea left, it's not heavy enough to keep the bottom valve open, so I have to push up with my finger to keep the valve open. Not a big deal.
