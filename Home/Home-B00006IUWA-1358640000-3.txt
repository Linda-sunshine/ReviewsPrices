review/summary: noisyreview/text: Fairly loud compared to our 15 year old air popper. But it does work. We get about 10 unpopped kernals per pop. But it does do what you need it to do. This is the cheaper version versus the Orvile Redenbackers?? but why pay more for basicly the same product.If you like cooking with air instead of oil this is the unit for you.
