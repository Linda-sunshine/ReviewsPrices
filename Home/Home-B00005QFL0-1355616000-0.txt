review/summary: one at a timereview/text: Its only two of us, so making one bread at a time is fine. I have not a clue how to bake bread, or anything for that matter, from scratch. But I sure did bake a good one on my first attempt just by following the instructions. After a few successes, I have been experimenting with the recipes. yes, I have been having fun acting like I can bake.
