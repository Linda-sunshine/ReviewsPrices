review/summary: Handy Toolreview/text: This is a kitchen gem. It is small enough to tuck away when not in use. However, it has so many uses you will want to have it around. It chops fruit for jam making or baking, onions for any purpose, celery for chicken or tuna salad, etc. The chopped veggies are on the small side, but this can be advantageous when you want to sneak some into a sauce, meatloaf or stuffing. Be careful with very liquid ingredients, as they can splatter. It is easy to clean. My only wish is for a more sturdy canister. Good buy.
