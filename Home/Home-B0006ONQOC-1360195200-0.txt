review/summary: Works Very Wellreview/text: It does what it says very well. The ice cream is creamy in about 30 mins. The problem is it requires significant pre-planning. You have to place the freeze bowl in your freezer 24 hours before you want to make the ice cream. For those of us with smaller freezers or do not have much room in our freezer, it is hard to store this bowl in your freezer all the time. It takes up a great deal of space and before you can begin to make the ice cream, this bowl has to be frozen solid. This requires you to empty some part of your freezer 24 hours before you plan to make ice cream, place this bowl in your freezer and leave it there all day. After it is frozen solid, you can begin to make ice cream. The machine makes ice cream well, no complaints there at all. It is the pre-planning and the freezer space arrangements that make it a bit of a hassle.
