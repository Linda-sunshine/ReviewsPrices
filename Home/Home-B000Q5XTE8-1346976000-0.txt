review/summary: Buying a second chairreview/text: I work from home and have had back surgery so a good chair is important to me. At a past company we had >$1K Aeron chairs that I loved, but that was too steep for a home office so the reviews led me to buying the Lorell Executive High Back chair. It arrived in 48 hours and was quick to assemble. The chair was 3 adjustment: back tilt, seat tilt, and seat height via levers on the right. I basically set them and have never needed to change them. The lumbar support is built into the shape of the back and cannot be adjusted although it works perfectly for both me and my wife. That is what is leading me to a buy a second chair since my wife works from home 2 days a week and we fight over this chair since she often gets neck and shoulder pains working at the computer for hours. After weeks of using this chair her neck/shoulder pains have gone away. At this price, it was an easy decision to buy a second chair so each of us will have one.BTW, the seat bottom is commercial grade cloth over high density foam similar to most office chairs. Only the back is mesh. This is meant as information, not a judgment. I see pros and cons to complete mesh. The seat is comfortable, but not like the chair I'm replacing that was so fluffy it was deceivingly comfortable when you 1st sit in it but develop leg fatigue in a few hours. I comfortably sit in this chair up to 8 hours a day.
