review/summary: As good as Stanley Steamerreview/text: I bought this carpet cleaner because I was tired of shelling out over a hundred dollars every time I called a carpet cleaner. This cleaner did as good or better in my opinion than Stanley Steamer. It is very easy to use and the carpet was drier after 12 hours than before. I would recommend the Hoover Steam/vac carpet cleaner to anyone considering a do-it-yourself machine.
