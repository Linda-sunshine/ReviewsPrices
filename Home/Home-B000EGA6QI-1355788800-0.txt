review/summary: Started great, stripped out the gear before a year was up!review/text: If I had written this when I first purchased I would give it a 5 star review. It worked great for the first 20 uses. I have owned it about 9 months and it is done. The plastic section inside is stripped. Big bummer. What I read says that although it has a 3 year warranty, the cost to replace that part with shipping makes it half the value. I was so hopeful that this would last longer. We don't even use it that much, mainly for soups....
