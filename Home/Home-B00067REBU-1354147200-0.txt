review/summary: Wrong voltagereview/text: So far I have been unable to use this appliance. Problem, the Sunbeam 5891 Breadmaker, was supplied to me, to be used on a 120V electrical system. The elevtrical system in Australia is 240V. I did not discover this anomaly until I had unpacked the carton, and then I was unable to return the product, because I am unable to afford the $350.00 freight charges. In order to use the appliance I need to purchase a step down transformer, and a 1000 w, which is the size required, range in price from $60 to $ 200. All this is really not the fault of the appliance. The whole experience of this debacle, has taught me that shopping online leaves a lot to be desired. I shall shop 'in person' in future, and certainly not shop with Amazon again.Oh yes, and I am still awaiting the amounts to be credited to my account for the second bread maker, supplied in error, and also for the contribution towards a step down transformer.Altogether, a most unsatisfactory, and costly experience.
