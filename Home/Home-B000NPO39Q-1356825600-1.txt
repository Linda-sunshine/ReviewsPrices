review/summary: Beautiful!review/text: I only have the basic set (Mary & baby, Joseph, shepherd boy, etc) so I was thrilled when my husband gave the stars to me for my birthday! They look beautiful and add a specialness to my little set. Such a simple addition, but big impact :)The stars have a heavier base than I anticipated, but it makes it very stable. A nice, solid piece!
