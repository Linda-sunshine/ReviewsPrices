review/summary: Spoke too soon - quit working after 6 weeksreview/text: Just plugged this in for the first time - hope it works this well for the next few years.HA!Quiet, puts out good humidity.NOT ANYMORE _ Note that was before it quit working after about 6 weeks. After 1 week it made weird sounds when I turned it on. I found that if I turned the wheel in the base a bit it would work but that worked 2x. I think the fan is broken. It creates mist which either stays in with the water or leaks out the back bottom a bit. Not enough fan to get the mist up to the penguin's beak.I spent too much money on this to have it break down after so little use. Will be contacting Crane on Monday for suggestions. I hate filters so will be looking for a better made product that is also filter free.
