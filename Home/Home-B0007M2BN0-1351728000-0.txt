review/summary: Surprisingly, not a gimmickreview/text: I love kitchen gadgets (well, gadgets in general), but as we all know, most such products turn out to be total junk. Bed, Bath & Beyond is literally full of crap just like this. But the surprising thing is...this isn't crap! This little egg cooker does exactly what it promises: four perfectly hard (or soft) boiled eggs in the microwave in about 10 minutes.We've used this a few dozen times already and haven't had any issues. The lid still fits snugly and the eggs come out perfectly!It's a perfect solution to the egg lovers in my household without the hassle of waiting for water to boil!
