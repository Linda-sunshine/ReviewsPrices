review/summary: So far, so goodreview/text: I am liking it. The pulp is not completely dry, but again, what do you expect for the price! If you really want drier pulp then buy a masticating style juicer which is more expensive. I am using mine to do some 10 days juicing, so paying twice the price would not be very beneficial. My friend has a Omega juicer (~ $500 ), but she is daily juicer so it is good for her. But for me, this one is good.
