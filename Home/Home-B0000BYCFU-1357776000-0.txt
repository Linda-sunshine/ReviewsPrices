review/summary: Presto 01781 23 quart pressure canner reviewreview/text: I had a 30 year old 16 quart National canner and wanted to get a new larger one. This canner is much has much thinner material and is much lighter than my old one. You can double stack pints in it so I can process much more in it. I like the fact that it has a gague so I can choose the number of pounds pressure that I use. I can a lot of tomatos, beans and some salsa so it is important to have a good canner. I would suggest this canner to people who do some canning but not not a lot. If you are young and will be canning much from your garden I suggest to get a stainless steel one because you will be able to use it for many years and hand it down to your children. The aluminum ones get hard to open when they get old like my 16 quart one did but I am older and will not need it for 30 more years. The fact that it is lighter makes it easier for me to lift and clean.
