review/summary: Great Burr Grinderreview/text: I purchased this unit for my mother-in-law, and she loves it. Now her setup is exactly like mine :). She came to my house more than a year ago, and I offered her a cup of espresso. She loved it...the taste and the crema that it produces. So I got her the same espresso maker to replace her old one, which wasn't doing a good job of making espresso. However, she was using a spice grinder to grind her beans. I hate having to scoop the coffee out of that as you have to get between the blades. Besides, it doesn't produce consistent same size grounds. So I got her this for Xmas. Now she produces the same quality espresso every single time. She loves it, and her friends loves her espresso when they come over. Better yet, when my wife and I visit, we also get the same espresso :)I own one of these Capresso Burr Grinder (stainless steal) a while back, which I purchased through Costco.com. It's still working great. When I used the new grinder at my in-law, it seemed quieter than mine. May be because it's still new. Will have to wait and see. A lot of folks complained about the static that makes the grounds stick to everything, and I have to agree with the unit that I have at home long back. I didn't observe that with this new unit at my in-law. After several days of grounding, it was nice and clean. I don't know, but I think may be it's been improved. Again, will have to wait and see. So I will post again some time later with updates.
