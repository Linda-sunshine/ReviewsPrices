review/summary: Works greatreview/text: The slicer works great. We have eliminated wheat from our diet (read Wheat Belly and you will too) but were missing spaghetti. The slicer makes wonderful "noodles" out of zucchini and yellow squash that are a tasty and healthy "noodle" to go with marinara. My daughter ran an apple through the slicer and had great fun eating apple curls. Cleanup was easy.
