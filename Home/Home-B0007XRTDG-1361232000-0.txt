review/summary: Just what I wantedreview/text: I had an old electric skillet that was in really bad shape. I could not have asked for anything better to replace it.I can make a large meal when my family comes over, and best of all I can make a lot of pancakes or french toast at the same time. They will be hot when served. They taste so much better that way.
