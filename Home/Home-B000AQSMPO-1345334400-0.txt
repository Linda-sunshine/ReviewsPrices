review/summary: Dissappointed with this Brewerreview/text: I have owned 3 Keurig's in the past 4 years. I was always a believer. I got 2 family members to buy it as well. Unfortunately, They do tend to have some problems with the water levels, amongst other issues. Keurig did replace my last brewer after owning it for 7 months. The customer service was always very helpful to me. Sometimes the cup is full and sometimes very little water comes out. The one I just recieved was a defective coffee pot. I set it up and everytime I added the water to the tank, it all leaked out the bottom , flooding my kitchen. Not only did I not get to enjoy a cup of coffee, but had a load of laundry to do. I returned this immediately and was credited within 24 hrs. I decided to get the Breville Brewing system. I love it so far. It has a nice look to it and many more features.
