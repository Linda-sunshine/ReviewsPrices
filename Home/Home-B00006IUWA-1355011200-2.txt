review/summary: Pops Quick and with a few Shakes Most Kernelsreview/text: This was a gift and replaced an older air popper. It heats up quick and pops most of the kernels. Once the popper chamber starts to fill with popped corn I shake it a bit to get the remaining kernels to settle on the bottom of the chamber. It helps in popping more kernels. The blower is strong enough to clear the chamber and keeps the popping going.
