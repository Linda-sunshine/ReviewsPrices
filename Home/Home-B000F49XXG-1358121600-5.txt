review/summary: Excellent Product!!review/text: An excellent product!!*It doesn't take up too much room on the counter and looks nice with it's silver metal accents.*The water reservoir is a good size, you can make about 8-10 shots before you need to refill it, which is very easy to do, and there is a clear section behind the basket which shows the water level.*Fast heat-up time (only about a minute), good frothing wand, no wait time between frothing and brewing (though you do have to wait a little between brewing and frothing).De'Longhi EC155 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker
