review/summary: Just what the roaster ordered.review/text: This is just what I have been wanting. Glass presses lose a lot of the heat while they steep, this doesn't. Only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star is that the screen let bit of coffee through. Really not that big of a problem, but always room for improvement.
