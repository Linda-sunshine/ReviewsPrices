review/summary: Lip makes water run down the front of the kettle and onto floor (and feet)review/text: Basics:works oklooks goodboils water fastyou can only fill it half way or it overflows to the counter due to some overfill holeif you walk with the kettle filled even a centimeter over the fill hole, the boiling water sloshes out the hole, out the bottom, and onto your feetthe way the elegant looking lip is, it is impossible to pour without 1/3 of the water running down the underside of the kettle instead of into the cupI HATE this thing. I have burned myself so many times with it. It was a gift or I would return it. Chucking it.
