review/summary: Good waterreview/text: I've only used Britas before really but I inherited a PUR pitcher and so it was time to replace the filter.The water is delicious, what can I say... or, I just don't even notice it, which is probably the best thing I can say for it.I'm using this with LA tap water though and it's not that bad to begin with...at least where I am ;)
