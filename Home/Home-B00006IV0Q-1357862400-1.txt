review/summary: Not all stainless steelreview/text: I just got the 6 cup coffee maker, and chose this model since it said it was stainless steel. I was trying to get away from plastic and aluminum for health reasons. I have recently heard this model may not be all stainless, so I called Presto today. The girl in customer service said all coffee makers have aluminum heating elements and said &#34;good luck&#34; in finding one that did not.
