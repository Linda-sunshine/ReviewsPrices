review/summary: Pretty Goodreview/text: This is a pretty good scale for the price, I'll give it about a year. Which is still good. I weighed a penny (which is 2.5 grams) to make sure it weighed right and it did! It can be a little off sometimes so just make sure you weigh whatever your weighing a few times to make sure. Other than that great product!
