review/summary: Silpat is great for candy-making, but not bakingreview/text: Silpats are wonderful for baking. Peanut brittle, caramel, or anything else that requires a buttered pan works great on a silpat. However, I much prefer parchment paper to silpats when I'm baking. The parchment paper does not mess up the heat distribution, and in my experience, Silpats repel grease more than parchment paper, meaning that when I bake with Silpat, my cookies have more oil left on the bottoms of them (soggy middles) than when I bake on parchment paper. The parchment paper seems to soak up some of the oil, leaving a crispier bottom. Most people probably like Silpats because they're cheaper and easier than parchment paper. I prefer a better product, even if it requires a bit of extra work.
