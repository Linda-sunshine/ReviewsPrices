review/summary: Best purchase of 2012review/text: The Breville juicer is fabulous and the best juicer I've ever owned. Better than the Acme and the Waring Pro. It's solid, juices effortlessly and is pretty simple to clean. Comes apart easily, assembles easily. I was amazed at how quickly it juices carrots, apples and celery for the most delicious juice. I love LOVE this juicer, now my daily routine. Don't hesitate, this is a terrific product.
