review/summary: Great kettle!review/text: Heats up water super fast. No complaints aside from it being pretty small for a serious tea connoiseur and if you don't wash it regularly, it develops a thin film at the bottom. Taking the cover off to wash it is hard, however. Despite this, everyone who has come over has loved it. I have since used this opportunity to give the kettle as a gift and heard nothing but accolades.
