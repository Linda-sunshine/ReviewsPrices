review/summary: French Press stays HOT HOT HOT!review/text: I first used this thermal french press on my sailboatin cold weather 600 miles out in the Atlantic.... I fell in love with it because being a coffee snob sailor means I love french press, my coffee must be hot, but I'm constantly distracted by sailing duties. So, this is the pot to have because it stays hot for hours!! This gets an A++
