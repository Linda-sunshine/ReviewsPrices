review/summary: Gets the job done-smelly and hard to clean thoughreview/text: My first coffee grinder so I'm just getting used to its quirks. Wasn't anticipating the smell of burning rubber each time. Am I doing something wrong? A little disconcerting. Also, cleaning is a pain, thankfully I have small fingers but even still you don't really get all the little grounds out.
