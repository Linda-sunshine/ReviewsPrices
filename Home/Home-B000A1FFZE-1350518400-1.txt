review/summary: Ready, set, toast!review/text: The best feature of this toaster oven is its size. For anyone with limited counter space, it solves the problem. The oven function is fine. However, as other reviewers have noted, toast tends to literally fly out so you need to be prepared. Toasting function is also very uneven: burned edges and under toasted center. I have yet to have an english muffin that didn't have charred edges or an under cooked middle. I yearn for my old Black and Decker spacesaver.
