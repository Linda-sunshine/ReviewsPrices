review/summary: Leaky and almost uselessreview/text: We use mason jars for just about everything, from canning to storage to drinking glasses. I got a set of the plastic lids for shaking up protein mixes, and no matter how tightly I screw them on they just leak all over the place - on the floor, on my shirt, in my gym bag, etc. These might be good for dry goods that don't need an air-tight seal, but otherwise you're better off with old, nearly worn out metal lids.
