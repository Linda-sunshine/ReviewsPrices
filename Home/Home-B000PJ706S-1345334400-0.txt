review/summary: Capresso glass water kettlereview/text: We bought our first Capresso kettle, also from Amazon, three and a half years ago. It is so pretty when it boils! We use it every day at least once. We've recently been having trouble with the switch and have had to resort to using our stove top kettle. It takes the stove top kettle about twice as long to come to the boil as the Capresso. We've used friend's electric kettles and have never come across one that we like as much, both for functionality and appearance.
