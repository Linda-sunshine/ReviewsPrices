review/summary: Great Juicer, with one caveatreview/text: I found myself within a week wishing I had gotten a higher level product. On the other hand, I wouldn't have spent that much on a juicer without knowing if i would like it for sure, so it's been great. But I'm already looking forward to replacing it with a better one! Or, maybe just supplementing with a masticating one. Decisions, decisions...
