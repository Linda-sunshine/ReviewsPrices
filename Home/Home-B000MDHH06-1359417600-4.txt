review/summary: Juicing is a breezereview/text: I am really enjoying my juicer of less than a week. It is easy to use, easy to clean, easy to assemble and just plain easy! I love it so much I bought one for a friend. In minutes I am literally enjoy a glass of healthy delicious juice. I highly recommend it for beginners such as myself, and for the old timers who need to update!
