review/summary: Very Good Knife for a Very Reasonable Pricereview/text: I will admit to being somewhat of a "knife snob." I have been using Henckels and Wusthof knives for years, and thought you had to have a high-end forged knife to get good results. Boy was I wrong! I have to admit America's Test Kitchen and Cooks Illustrated to got this one right. This knife rocks! For a knife that sells for less than 30 bucks here on Amazon at the time of this writing, this knife is a steal.It is lightweight and has a very comfortable handle that is also very nonslip. The instructions say you can put in the dishwasher, but we will hand wash ours, like we do with all our other good knives. Mine arrived razor-sharp and passed the "tomato test" with flying colors. There is sufficient clearance between the handle and the blade so that, even with my ham hands, my knuckles do not hit the cutting board when using the knife.Bottom line: This is a very nice knife. Highly Recommended.
