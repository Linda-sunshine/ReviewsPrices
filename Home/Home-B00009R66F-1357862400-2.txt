review/summary: Works Well and Easy to Usereview/text: I previously had a steam cleaner from another manufacturer with all the bells and whistles. Within one year the heater function had broken. I had it repaired, and it broke again within the next year. So, When I recently started my search for a new steam cleaner, the heating function was not on my list. I was looking for a good price, reliability, and a good thorough cleaner. This is just what I got with this Hoover steam vac. It is easy to use, and if you use very hot tap water, it does the job every bit as well as a unit with a heat function. I recommend this unit!
