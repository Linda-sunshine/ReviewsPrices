review/summary: A Wonderful Electric Kettlereview/text: I have one of these and I love it. The water heats very fast and it has an automatic shut-off. However, youmust have the top cover down securely or it won't automatically shut off.The price is very good. I ordered these for Christmas gifts and I can tell you that my own was twice the price.One of the things I use it for is to boil water quickly when I'm going to cook pasta. Once it's boiled, I pour itinto the pan I will cook the pasta in. It just speeds up things.
