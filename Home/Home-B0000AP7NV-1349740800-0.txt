review/summary: Fantastic product, and great for college students!!review/text: I live in NYC, where the water is safe and clean-tasting straight from the tap...so when I moved into college in Pennsylvania, I could not drink the water here. There's a lot of chlorine in PA water, and drinking it was literally like taking a gulp of pool water, which was even worse for me, since I'm used to such clean tap water. After a couple weeks, my roommate and I both started getting sick from drinking the water. I couldn't afford to keep buying bottled water, and was dehydrating frequently, which was also getting me sick. Clearly, there was a huge problem.So, I invested in one of these. BEST THING I HAVE EVER DONE. I can not think of ANY better way I could have spent $11. My roommate and I immediately noticed a difference in the appearance of the water- it was crystal clear, whereas before it was cloudy and had tiny white things floating around in it. It also took away the chlorine taste COMPLETELY. Neither of us have gotten sick since using it.It's really great for a dorm room, too. We have a micro-fridge unit in our dorm, and it fits perfectly on the small shelf inside the door (It is about the width of one standard water bottle.) It holds a pretty decent amount of water for 2 people. It fills about 2-3 water bottles before you have to refill it. We fill it about 2-4 times a day, but we find that it's really not any hassle at all- whenever we go to the bathroom, we just fill a large plastic bottle with water on the way back and then pour it in. Takes no time at all.In short, this pitcher is easy to store and use, comes at an amazing price, and is a great source of clean, fresh, safe tap water.
