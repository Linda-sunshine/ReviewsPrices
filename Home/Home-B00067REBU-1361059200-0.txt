review/summary: 10 years and two machines laterreview/text: This is a positive review I kill my machines 4 kids i averaged about 4 loafs a day 4 types and it ran night and day to keep up with demand my first machine literally fell off counter and still worked but walked after that so my husband bought me another brand i was honorably it had no jam setting it made butter and the bread was raw inside so he bought me another Sunbeam and that is the same one i have today. kids are grown now and she grinds a little but i make apple butter and strawberry jelly in it its great for two the strawberry recipe makes 4 pt jars perfect for just us and the apple butter makes 2 1/2 jars perfect every time . i agree with the other reviews on keep it light on the crust the other settings make it to thick and crunchy. i make all my sweet dough in this for Christmas breads and coffee cake. because i have the original book i agree the recipes have change for the worse they need to tell who ever wrote the new ones there fired way to much yeast and not enough of other stuff each time i try ed to make standard white bread it caved in to much water after comparing both books they in crest the water not good get the bread machine cook books there great lots of options and happy bread. if you can find the sunbeam book instructions from 1997 it was copy write with general mills recipes that was the change.hopes this help
