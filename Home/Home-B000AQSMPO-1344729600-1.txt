review/summary: I love EVERYTHINGreview/text: I am not even a big coffee drinker (hardly EVER drink coffee) I wanted this because I thought it would be nice to have to offer to guests and because i wanted to try some of the flavors specifically the Chocolate Glazed Doughnut, and the Cinnamon Roll K cups.I have gone absolutely CRAZY about this device. It's probably my absolute favorite appliance that I own. It's INCREDIBLE. I now drink like 3-4 cups a day. I am thrilled!!! I love everything about this. I am really glad I got the b60 too because I debated between which Keurig I would like best. This one is PERFECT!!!Secondly I don't know if I got lucky or what not HOWEVER my B60 came with a note in the water reservoir that said that I got a new special edition 60 ounce reservoir. SO mine is not 48 ounces but 60. I don't know if all the devices are going to be coming like that or not BUT I thought that was a VERY pleasant surprise. In my personal opinion I think that the Keurig is worth every penny. I would buy it again, and recommend to friends!!I personally also bought a variety pack of kcups off amazon in order to try the different companies and flavors, I think that should be a MUST for anyone who hasn't tried a variety of kcups or coffee flavors. I now have about 10 kcups that I absolutely love!I also make sure to try and use filtered water on my unit.
