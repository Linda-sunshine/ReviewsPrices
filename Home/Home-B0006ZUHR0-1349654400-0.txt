review/summary: Loved it for first 6 months.....review/text: I loved this iron --but the relationship is definitely over. The iron was ideal for the first 6 months: steam that lasted forever and hot as it got --it never burned my clothes. Then, about two months ago, the little bugger started dribbling rust. What a mess... white blouse, beige shorts - all got the brown streak of death. Rust cleaner worked, but two or three days later, and its the same problem again. I am so disappointed -- I thought he was the one!After reading about the awful way some customers were treated by Black and Decker, (replacing junk with garbage -- that's their "replacement policy") I have decided to cut my losses and look for another brand of iron!I have learned that in reading reviews as a way of deciding whether to purchase an item - to give more weight to those reviews written after the reviewer has had the product for a substantial amount of time. Most relationships are great in the beginning...
