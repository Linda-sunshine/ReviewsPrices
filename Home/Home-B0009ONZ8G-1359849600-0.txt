review/summary: Rugged, effective and priced rightreview/text: My Grandmother had a Hoover for many years. The Widepath Tempo model I got at Amazon recently is a modern design that looks and acts like it should also work well for years. It's much lighter, and easier to set up and use and is clearly much more powerful. And with the bagging system on this one I can empty it without the cloud of dust I created emptying my Grandmother's when I was a kid.
