review/summary: Excellent for scalding human skin and destroying wood finishesreview/text: Do you enjoy the feel of sharp, heavy, broken glass? Are you looking for a perfect gag gift for your roommate with the pesky iced tea-making habit? Well look no further! Upon pouring hot water (i.e. 150 degrees F) into this pitcher, the bottom breaks, slides away, and lands (along with the scalding water) on your feet! A wonderful product for a practical joker or sadist.
