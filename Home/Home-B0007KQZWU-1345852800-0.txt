review/summary: Cooks fast, but everything sticks and can't clean!review/text: I bought this set after reading the fabulous reviews, but I seem to be missing something...Everything sticks to the pans, rendering them practically unusable! We've resorted to using our old non-stick pans because these are terrible. No matter how much oil or butter I put in the pan, the food sticks right away and won't come free. Can someone please explain what I'm doing wrong?Then, we have the hardest time cleaning these. Even if I've just boiled some potatoes in the pots, it's practically impossible to clean the residue off. The pans are even more difficult to clean.I'm really disappointed, since we spend all this money on a new set and now don't even want to use it.The only positive about this set, is they do heat up quickly.I've watched a bunch of YouTube videos on how to cook with stainless and how to clean it, I'm not doing anything differently, but yet these still don't work.Would appreciate any techniques people have who enjoy this set.
