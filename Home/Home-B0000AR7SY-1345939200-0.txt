review/summary: Thanks for the great coffee!review/text: For 15 years we have been grinding our coffee with a $10 hand held grinder. We did not know what we were missing. This grinder has been great and makes the job of setting up the coffee maker much more enjoyable, and looks a heck of a lot nicer than our old one. Only one comment for improvement would be to be able to run it for more than 20 seconds at a time.
