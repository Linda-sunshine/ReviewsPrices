4.0
review/summary: If it lasts more than one 1-week use, a 5th starreview/text: So far it's great. Used it with guests for a week - easy to inflate, make and deflate, didn't leak, as advertised. Compact storage. Comfortable for 2 adults, easy to get into and out of (both guests were late 70s, and one has Parkingson's, so this was important). I'm withholding one star until I see how long it lasts.
