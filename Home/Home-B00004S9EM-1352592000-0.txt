review/summary: GREAT KITCHEN HELPERreview/text: I've read so many of the reviews and will just touch on some "seconds" from personal experience; VERY, VERY quiet, almost unusually so. Very easy to clean for me. Some people had a problem with the locking mechanisms. I did not (and I didn't bother to watch the dvd beforehand), i.e. very easy to use (but I did read the book and have experience with food processors. The volumn is perfect for a 4 person family. I have made whipped cream, zucchini bread (grated the veggies and then mixed all, NICE:), pancakes, salad, sliced, etc. and everything worked as they should. Really love this processor with it's powerful motor!! Well worth the money.
