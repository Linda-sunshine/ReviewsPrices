review/summary: Perfect little coffee maker!review/text: I LOVE my Keurig. I cannot even tell you how wonderful this machine has been. I have had mine for almost 2 years now and I use it on a daily basis. I have used the K cups but mostly I use the reusable K cup and put my own coffee in to save money. LOVE IT! This machine has been through a lot and still holds up, it was dropped about a year ago during a move and broke in a couple of places (just the outer plastic). However, the machine itself has continued to work for another year without a single problem! I finally decided to treat myself to an upgraded machine (that is not cracked) just the other day, but wanted to make sure that I left a good review of this one for anyone who is considering one!
