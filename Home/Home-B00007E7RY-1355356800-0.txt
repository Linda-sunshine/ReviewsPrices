review/summary: LARGE & LOUDreview/text: This review is solely for the products size & loudness. Both of which were much more than I was expecting.I'm sure it does an awesome job filtering, but I'm not keeping it long enough to test it out. Out of the box it was already a lot bigger than I had realized it was going to be (a little larger than the standard mini-fridge I have in my room). And within the first few minutes of plugging it in and having it going, it really drowns out any other noise (or conversation) in the room. Even the low setting is equivalent to the highest setting on my old TheraPure filter that I'm getting rid of. You'll have to turn this purifier off at night, or while watching a movie, in order to enjoy either.I wasn't expecting pure silence, but this thing seems like it's built to purify the air in a large garage, gymnasium, or airplane hangar... HahaI do admit fault in that I should have paid more attention to the reviews..& probably should have looked it up on YouTube to see a size comparison to someone.I'm returning it tomorrow & going to find a smaller filter that I can hopefully sleep through.
