review/summary: The Best!!review/text: This (in my opinion) is the best carpet cleaner out on the market. I found out about it because my uncle had one. My mom wanted one too so I bought her the &#34;upgraded&#34; one for Christmas. That was a mistake! Her's has broken. She has only had it for less than 2 years. When I was ready to buy one I ordered this one and I am very happy with my decision. It cleans well, holds a lot of water/cleaning solution and really extracts the dirt. I recommend this for anyone looking for a high quality carpet cleaner!
