review/summary: Top Notchreview/text: I found out about this pressure cooker/canner from a magazine called Back Woodsman. There was an article on canning Venison, and I was impressed and motivated to purchase a pressure cooker before the Pennsylvania archery season opener. I then called my cousins in West Virginia and Maryland and asked them for a recommendation on a pressure cooker. They all owned and used the All American and told me that the All American Pressure Cooker/Canner was the Best of the Best and that I should not even look at any other brands.As the other reviewers mention, the unit is of obvious quality. As soon as you take the unit out of the box, you will be impressed by its heavy duty presence and hardware. Other reviewers also mention that the instruction manual is of high quality as well, and I must agree.The price on Amazon was best I could find and I made my purchase with out remorse. I'm looking forward to getting many years of good use out of this outstanding product.Thank you All American and Amazon.
