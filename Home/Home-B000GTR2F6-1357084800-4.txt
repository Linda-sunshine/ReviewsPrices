review/summary: Great coffee potreview/text: Love my Keurig. I hesitated getting this pot due to the expense of the K-cups. But since I bought it, it has been worth it. My husband gets up earlier than I do and always before, I have had to get my coffee after it had been made 30 or more minutes before. So now I can get up and get a fresh cup. Also I like being able to make different coffee flavor/brand choices. My husband likes one brand/flavor better than I do, so he can choose that one and I can choose one that I prefer. So it's been worth it for that. Also after some trial and error and price-searching, we have found some economical brands to use for our day-t0-day use and we can purchase some of the pricier brands that we like for company and/or special occasions. It is also VERY helpful when we have company and someone wants de-caf and someone else wants &#34;regular&#34;, or someone wants a stronger/bolder blend and someone else prefers a milder blend. So this has been great.
