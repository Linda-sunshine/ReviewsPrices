review/summary: Nice waffle iron for the money!review/text: I made waffles for the first time last night. They came out great, nice and big. Used Krusteaz Belgian Waffle Mix. Clean up is a little bit of a pain since you can't remove the plates, but all in all I'm happy with this waffle iron and would recommend it.
