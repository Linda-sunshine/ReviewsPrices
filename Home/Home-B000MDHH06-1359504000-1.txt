review/summary: works great so farreview/text: I've been using this device for about 2 weeks now, almost daily for vegetable juicing such as carrots, beets, apples, ginger, cucumbers and the like, and it has performed well and suits our purpose perfectly.This is our first extractor of this kind and other than the noise which is par for the course, there are two aspects of usage that are news to us. First, the grinder teeth work best on bulky pieces, e.g., whole carrots, but not pieces or slices. Small pieces get thrown out of the grinder bowl instantly upon contact with the teeth instead of being ground up - unless they are packed and pressed down first, which is hard to accomplish with the machine on. Ditto for leafy items such as spinach, Celery is great since it can be fed whole. Second, as the bulky contents in the tube approach their end, they also get thrown out, usually accompanied by loud claps. Nothing dangerous of course as the whole operation is performed inside enclosure but they take some getting used to. So we learn to push the plunger down steadily and slowly, to allow the grinder time to do its work, but brace ourselves towards the end of the plunger's travel.Highly recommended if your purpose is same as ours.
