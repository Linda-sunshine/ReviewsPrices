review/summary: Best Grinder you will EVER buy!!!review/text: Look no further for another grinder! This does it all. I had one growing up, and purchased the same one about a year ago. It grinds coffee so well, and I love how efficient it is. The con though-isn't there always a downside-is that it can overheat if you use it for too long, and I found this out when trying to grind granular sugar for confectioners sugar. Also, you will have to grind multiple batches, just to have about 3 cups of ground coffee.I would highly recommend that you purchase two (perhaps in two different colors), so that one can be used only for coffee-make sure you wipe it clean after every coffee grind, since the oils in the coffee beans can create a rancid smell-and the other in place of many things you would use for a mortar and pestle.
