review/summary: Great knivesreview/text: I have owned Victorinox knives for years. They retain their edge longer than others. The handle is easy to hold and grip. Very comfortable for someone with joint problems. Almost like an Oxo GoodGrips for knives! I also like the heft of this knife. It feels sturdy without being too heavy. Like my previous Victorinox purchases (10&#34; and paring knives), I'm sure I will enjoy this knife for many years to come. PS: to help keep my others sharp, I just run them through an electric knife sharpener every so often. One other plus: I throw these in the dishwasher without fear of them staining or rusting. Fantastic knives.
