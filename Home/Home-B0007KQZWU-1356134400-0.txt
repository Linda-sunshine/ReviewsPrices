review/summary: the best cookware regardless of the moneyreview/text: We are not professional chefs, but are serious cooks. I believe in Amazon reviews. I paid attention to Some Average Guy "nww" who did unbelievable extensive reviews on this set and the newer set. Thank you nww. Everything was perfect. Finish, lid fit. Handles (they don't get hot on the stove). Very heavy. I use a glass top range, very flat. Almost no stick. Easy clean up. Excellent heat distribution. Some spotting due to my water, but I don't care about those issues; these are for serious cooking, not for display (although they are beautiful). And the price/quality is fantastic. When it was time to buy new cookware, we were ready to spend $600, but got the set for $200. Watch the price. It changes daily, today at $250. All Clad invented this type of cookware and I really wanted to buy All Clad because they deserve it. But a $400 price difference is just too much. And indeed, this tri-ply set is the best on the market.
