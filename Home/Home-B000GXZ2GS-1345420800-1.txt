review/summary: My go-to coffee solution...review/text: I ordered this little guy in 2009. Originally, I bought it for camping, since it's durable plastic and just requires some boiled water. However, it quickly became my primary coffee making tool. I've been doing the "inversion method" for the past year or so, flipping it on the handle and letting the coffee steep longer. I also get two uses per day out of each filter, just rinsing it out in between. If you know someone with an Aeropress, ask for a sample. You'll quickly learn why this is what the Starbucks CEO uses to make the "best cup of coffee known to mankind".I just wanted to add a review here, because I have an old Aeropress with the clear plastic (don't know why some are now darker), and I have never experienced any of the "spidering" that somebody posted a picture of. I pour water straight from the kettle (just after boiling) into the Aeropress, and haven't seen any hint of this. Buy and enjoy with confidence.
