review/summary: 3 YEARS LATER & AND THIS CAN KEEPS GOING AND GOING AND ....review/text: I was going through my order history to find an item that did not stand the test of time. While I was in the process of locating the item, I noticed how long it had been since I bought this amazing device. I think the entire time we've owned it, we've only changed the batteries 2 or 3 times.The benefits of having a touchless trash can are endless. We get so many compliments on it. Not only is the appearance easy on the eyes but this Can keeps the trashy smell from getting out. If I had to do it all over again, knowing what I know today, I would easily pay double what AMAZON is charging right now. Do yourself and your family a favour and just order it. Be certain to thank me later under comments, I know you'll love it.
