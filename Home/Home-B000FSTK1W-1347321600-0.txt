review/summary: Great Productreview/text: Finding a decent shower caddy is a difficult task. Most caddies rust out very quickly, go over your shower head (Getting in the way), or are made in China. The caddy itself is made in Canada and the strips to attach it to the wall are made in the United States. The product is easy to attach to the wall (Where ever you want in the shower) and holds up great even with my Sam's Club Size Shampoo loaded in it. There is a place for two bottles of stuff, a bar of soap, and a hook for whatever. Stop searching, just get it!
