review/summary: Amazing!review/text: I received one of these as a gift 4 or 5 years ago, since then I have given them as gifts to several family members who also drink loose tea frequently. The new model doesn't have a loose filter like my old one, that was my only complaint but it wasn't a deal breaker.Loose tea is often meant to be used more than once, and this allows you to drain out your tea before you start extracting bitterness. It's convenient at work, where I have access to the water cooler and the saucer keeps me from making a mess on my desk.I would definitely buy another one if mine were to break because I love it so much!
