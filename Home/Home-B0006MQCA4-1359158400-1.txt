review/summary: So far, so good!review/text: It is slender so it fits very well on the counter top. The water does not drip after pouring a glass of water. The water taste is just fine. I like the simple calendar to show when to replace the filter.I plan to give this to my daughter and her family who lives in Indiana where the water tastes yucky!
