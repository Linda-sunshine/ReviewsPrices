review/summary: Great giftreview/text: I bought this for my daughter mainly for her coffee beans. I read reviews on nearly every coffee grinder,and when I saw the reviews on this one,they were the best.I bought it for her birthday. She LOVES it and uses it for more then just coffee beans. She uses it for her spices and nuts etc. I am happy I purchased it.
