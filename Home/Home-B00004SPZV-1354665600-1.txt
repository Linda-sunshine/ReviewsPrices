review/summary: It works well but needs maintenancereview/text: I bought one of these and absolutely love it. It sprays evenly and doesn't take much to pump it. It saves me money, so I can just refill it with oil I have on hand instead of buying another $4 can. I'm going to buy a second one to put a lighter oil in for baking. I also like that it's a "green" product. I can reuse it for a long time, and don't have to worry about throwing away countless cans a year. BUT it tends to clog and deliver a stream of oil instead of a mist and needs to be cleaned. Just unscrew the sprayer, submerse it in water and pump water through it with the cap just as when you want to pump the sprayer up. This forces water through it and so far, it's done a good job for me. I also found that it helps to unscrew it just enough to release the pressure before storing. using olive oil is another reason to release the air. olive oil does not like air. When olive oil is exposed to heat, light, and air the valuable nutrients in the oil begin to oxidize and it will begin to lose its fruit flavors.
