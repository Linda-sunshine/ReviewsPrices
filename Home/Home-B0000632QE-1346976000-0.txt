review/summary: This really is a DANGEROUS tool, and missing a partreview/text: I managed to slice my finger on it the 2nd time using it.(I consider myself very coordinated and not accident prone by the way) It's not easy to clean either since the blades are so sharp. So, I'd guess one would need to settle on some veggie stains. They say all you need to do is rinse of water and store in it's safety box, but just a rinse doesn't get things off. If you soak it in sudsy sink.. you might cut yourself going into the bubble blind to fetch the pieces to clean.Also mine shipped with two 7mm julienne pieces. i was missing the 3.5mm piece. The sole reason I bought this was to make zucchinni noodles. It made great thick 7mm noodles but the process to obtain these noodles was risky.
