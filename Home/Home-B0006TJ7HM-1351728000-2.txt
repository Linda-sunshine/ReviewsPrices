review/summary: Don't get serratedreview/text: I bought the black block set and became disappointed after a month of use. The edges cannot be sharpened without a special sharpener that costs twice as much as the block set.These are made with soft, cheap steel that rusts and gets dull after a few uses. If you can afford it, spend twenty dollars on a set with flat edges. It can be sharpened and will extend the life of your block set for years.Go up to a $100 budget and you can get a Victorinox, Wusthof or Henckels. Those German knives will last a lifetime.
