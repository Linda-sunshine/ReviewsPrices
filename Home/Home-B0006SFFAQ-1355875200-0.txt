review/summary: Best coffee maker ever!review/text: I've gone through maybe half a dozen coffee machines in the 30+ years that I've been drinking coffee. I've had expensive machines, cheap machines, major brands and generics... I've spent anywhere from $19 to $120 on coffee machines but this one is the very best one I've ever had the pleasure of owning. I don't know why people are complaining about the the size or placement of the water reservoir, it's perfect since the carafe is pretty much spill-proof... unlike the cheapo machine it replaced that spilled coffee or water everywhere. The functions, buttons and controls are so easy to understand. I love the elegant, retro simplicity of the design and the metallic red is so, so very pretty! The charcoal filter makes the coffee even smoother-tasting even though my water is filtered through a high pH water ionizer. Coffee brews quickly, and I love that it signals the end of brewing with a few melodic chimes. I truly love everything about this machine!
