review/summary: Most comfortable chair I've hadreview/text: I'm absolutely thrilled with my new chair purchase. I read many reviews and I decided to give this one a try. First it arrived even before the expected delivery date (plesantly surprised). Second, super easy assembly (only a few steps). It's very adjustable including the arm rests. I appreciate the mesh backing as it molds to my back. I sit for 8+ hours a day and since I started using this chair no more back pain at the end of the day. I would highly recommend this one.
