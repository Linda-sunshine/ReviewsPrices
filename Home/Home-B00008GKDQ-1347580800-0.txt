review/summary: It's ok..review/text: Heats unevenly. Or maybe it's just my (electric) stove. Either way, the griddle only gets hot directly above the burners, the middle of the griddle gets warm but not enough to actually cook anything there. I've tried different temperature settings, different pre-heating and warming times, different pairs of burners, everything possible. Maybe it would work better on a gas stove..So far I've only used it to make grilled cheese sandwiches and pancakes. And I've only used the smooth side, not the grill side. The last time I used it for pancakes, they stuck and nearly all burned because I had to pry them off, even though I had sprayed it with cooking spray like usual. Perhaps it needs to be seasoned again.Overall it's an "ok" griddle. It's my first griddle, so I can't really compare it to anything. It could probably be better, but it could probably also be a lot worse. But I don't think I would recommend this one..
