review/summary: Enjoy it while it lasts (about two years usually)review/text: I ordered this from QVC about two years ago and it worked fantastically well and I fell in love with it. For about three months. it started to say 'brewing' but wouldn't brew anything. I called customer service and, rather than offer any fixes, they just told me to throw it out and sent a new one. The new one did the same thing occasionally but unplugging it and plugging it back in seemed to do the trick. Last week it started not brewing again, wouldn't even take in water to brew with. I tried EVERYTHING I found to fix it but nothing worked so I called again. I told customer service I had done everything to fix it but they ignored me and directed me to troubleshooting videos on their site, saying they were sure cleaning the needles (which I'd already done twice) would fix the problem. I called back and, of course, it's now out of warranty so all they did was offer to sell me one for $80. Which I'm sure they'd also be happy to do AGAIN in a year when that one went out.I loved the machine while it worked but I should get more than a year and change out of a coffee maker that cost almost $200. I assumed the first brewer was just defective and trusted the second one would last. But after a few searches and reading reviews on the Keurig website, it seems as if this is a known issue and a lot of people get less than three years out of their machines. What Keurig apparently counts on is that you'll be just out of warranty by the time it fails, so they don't have to send you a replacement. I'll probably be looking into getting something non-Keurig branded now. Stay away unless you can afford to replace this every year or so.
