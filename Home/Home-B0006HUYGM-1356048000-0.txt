review/summary: Simply amazingreview/text: I purchased this handheld unit for vacuuming my cars and for quick pickups in my home, such as using on my carpeted stairs. About a week prior to my purchasing this Eureka handheld unit, I had bought a full sized Dyson for $550 for use in my home. After using both, I daresay that the suction/cleaning power of this little Eureka rivals that of my Dyson upright, on a relative basis. Don't get me wrong. I love my Dyson and it is an absolute necessity for cleaning a full sized room. And it is impossible for the Eureka to literally pack the same power as a full sized Dyson. However, I couldn't help but notice how powerful this Eureka is for a handheld to where it could hold its own with my Dyson, when it comes to tackling the small cleanup jobs.
