review/summary: Poor filtration of important items....review/text: I have this system and just recently discovered that it does not REMOVE the chlorine. It only helps the smell and taste so you are still drinking the chlorine. It also leaves in FLORIDE and if you still think it is good for you and prevents cavities, think again. In Europe they outlawed it being added to drinking water and consider it a poison. It is a by-product of the aluminum industry and they found a way to get paid for getting rid of it! Just do a little research and you will see for yourself. About all I can find that takes care of both of these chemicals for drinking is the Reverse osmosis water you can refill in gallon jugs from walmart, meijers, and most large grocery stores.
