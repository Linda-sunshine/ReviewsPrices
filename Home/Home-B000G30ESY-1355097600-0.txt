review/summary: Perfect ricereview/text: You wouldn't be paying this price for a rice cooker if you weren't interested in making very good rice. So if you were willing to pay this price take just a few minutes and figure out how to get the proportions right. If you do this rice cooker will reward you with perfect rice every time. White rice brown rice it doesn't matter. I cooked cracked wheat cereal and steel cut oatmeal as well and both came out perfectly.
