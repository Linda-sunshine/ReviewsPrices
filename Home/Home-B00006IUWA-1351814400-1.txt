review/summary: Fast, fun, inexpensive snacks!review/text: I purchased the Presto after reading other Amazon reviews. Thanks for the good advice guys! I love my Presto. It's stayed on my counter and at the ready since it arrived! It is inexpensive and it works well: It's fast, not really so noisy, and pops practically every kernel. I don't understand what the big deal is about having to plug it in rather than using an on/off switch. Plugging it in is simple. Don't forget--popcorn is a whole grain! If you are smart about the toppings, it's even healthy!
