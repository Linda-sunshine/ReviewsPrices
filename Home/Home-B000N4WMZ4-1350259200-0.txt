review/summary: Yummy!review/text: I just love this! The day I got the dutch over I got busy and made a nice roast. I think this is so much better then a crock pot because I can set the tempture and know how it is cooking. I browned the meat in the pot ( saves another pan to wash) and all the little bits are right in the pot, no scraping or deglazing! The lid is so heavy it almost like a pressure cooker. I have made everything from beans to soup and all my dishes have been perfect with no burning. Love, love it! I don't know why anyone would spend more on the high priced one with the French name, Lodge is Perfect for me.
