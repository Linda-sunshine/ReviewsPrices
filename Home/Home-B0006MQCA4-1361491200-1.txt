review/summary: No complaints so far... loving it.review/text: I was skeptical about getting this product since there were complaints about leakage and slow filtering. Yes, it filters slowly, but you just fill up the large well at the top, put it in your fridge, and let it filter... it isn't a big deal for me. I haven't had any problems with it leaking through the spigot at all... it is a solid seal. The handles make it easy for me to load and unload out of the fridge. The water tastes great... the same as the bottled water I used to buy at the store. No more lugging those home and no more recycling all of those bottles. This purchase has probably already paid for itself since I am no longer purchasing bottled water and haven't been for 2 months. Love this dispenser so far!
