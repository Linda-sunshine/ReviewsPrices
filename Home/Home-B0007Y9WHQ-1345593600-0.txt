review/summary: Life Changingreview/text: Every now and then I pick something up that changes my life. Last time it was a Blend-Tec blender. I got this spiral slicer, intrigued by the notion of using vegetables to replace pasta. I was very surprised at how well this product works, and this is a very good way to reduce caloric intake of pasta, while also getting extra nutrition from the vegetables.I must question the intelligence of anyone that couldn't figure out how to use this product. My unborn child was able to figure it out.
