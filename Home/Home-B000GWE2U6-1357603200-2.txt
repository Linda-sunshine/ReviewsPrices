review/summary: Just perfect (and cute)review/text: We needed a humidifier in our girl's bedroom and couldn't be happier with what we got.Thanks to the way Amazon's page is organized, she was able to pick the one she wanted (Hello Kitty) herself so she thought she knew what she was getting but what we received exceeded our expectations. From our daughter's point of view, the Kitty is as cute as in Amazon's picture but she's so much bigger - hard to hold one gallon of water in a small kitty - and, besides blowing steam through her ears she can also double as a night light, in this case a soft purple.When it comes to operation, assembly and maintenance, it can't get much better. Assembly was quick and taking the tank out for refills is easy enough for our 10 yr. old to do it herself. As far as cleaning and maintenance, haven't done any yet because we've only used it for a few days but, according to the manual, a little bleach should clean the tank and wiping the other parts with water and vinegar is all it takes.There's not much more to say. Once plugged in, you can control the amount of steam that comes out. It operates quietly and, for as long as you set the steam level right and your replace the water when needed, all is well.
