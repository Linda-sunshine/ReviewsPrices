review/summary: great purchasereview/text: I bought this item along with My Bread: the revolutionary no-work, no-knead method by Jim Lahey. The Dutch oven is heavy and well-made. It has worked flawlessly, and has actually gotten better with use. It was an amazing purchase at about $30. I have already suggested it to friends and purchased two as gifts for family members. I have only used it for making bread, but my wife users it to roast chicken and stew. No doubt it will be a staple cooking utensil in our home for years to come.
