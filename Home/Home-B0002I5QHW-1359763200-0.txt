review/summary: Pleasantly surprisedreview/text: When I first took this product out of the box, I was very skeptical. It looked flimsy, small, and was mostly plastic. Despite my reservations, I put this product together. I was impressed that the suction/power lock actually stuck the machine to the table- I was able to lift the table with the machine without the machine coming off! The only thing is that the machine must be attached close to the edge of the table so that the handle can turn, since the handle is longer than the body of the machine.So far, I have made 2 batches of pasta, which turned out pretty well and were fairly easy to make. Also, I have made a large batch of ground meats. I am incredibly impressed with the meat grinding function of this machine. It was actually easier to grind the meats than to make the pasta. I was able to process (slice into thin strips) and grind 8 lbs of pork and 3.5 lbs of beef in about an hour, which surprisingly is much faster than my old iron grinder. I am very satisfied with this purchase because the savings from grinding the meat have already made up the cost of the machine. I would recommend this machine to anyone looking for a compact, budget-friendly grinder.
