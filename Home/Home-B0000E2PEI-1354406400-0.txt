review/summary: Does what it is meant to doreview/text: Very cheap, looks modern, and fits well in my bathroom.I had to stand on it once when I first set it down to get it synchronized, and now all I have to do is just step on it.It feels very solid and durable, then numbers read very clear and large.I am very satisfied that I bought this.
