review/summary: Not the best choice for people who chop a lot of vegetables.review/text: I cook a lot of stir fry's to bring to work for lunch, and let me tell you, it takes more effort to chop a ton of vegetables day in and day out with a serrated edge in comparison to a straight edge. For the price, it would be a good buy though; just plan on updating if you do some intense chopping.
