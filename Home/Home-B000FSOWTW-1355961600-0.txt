review/summary: Save yourself some embarassement if you think of this as a giftreview/text: I bought this wine opener with chiller last Christmas and gave it to my friend. Next time we gathered at his home, he had a chilled white wine waiting for us. he tried to open the wine with this opener for the first time, in our presence, and he couldn't. I tried it with another wine and I couldn't either. We finally used another manual opener and enjoyed out wine. I told him that I will replace his gift with another, but he insisted that he liked the chiller and would rather keep it. If you think the chiller alone is worth the money, go ahead, if not save yourself some money.
