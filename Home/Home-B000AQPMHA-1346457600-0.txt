review/summary: Underwhelming compared to Nespressoreview/text: I purchased the Keuring as a Christmas gift for my family, and the product turned out to be completely underwhelming. When I want to make two 'tall' coffees, 100% times the sizes come out unequal- one cup of coffee will be less full than the other. The taste of the Keurig-brewed coffee is, well, average at best. If you want to buy a coffee machine that will deliver every single time you use it, with quality and depth to the coffeee brewed, try any of the Nespresso coffee machines and inserts.I used Nespresso for 3 years while I lived in Europe, and had to say goodbye to the machine when we moved back to the US, because of the difference in voltage/electrical plugs. Now, I went the "cheap route" and thought that Keuring (which is about 100 bucks less expensive) will be just as good as Nespresso. I was wrong....
