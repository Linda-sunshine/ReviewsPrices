review/summary: Last for many yearsreview/text: Have had the Cuisinart Round Waffle Maker for years and now the top iron is starting to leave the waffle only partial cooked on top; so I think it is time to get another one. These are excellent waffle makers. The $75.00 suggested retail price on Amazon.com is far too high. Cuisinart Webstore sell the item for $39.95 plus shipping. So gettting this waffle maker from Amazon is not saving you much money but you receive free shipping and the great Amazon customer service. Amazon is where I will purchase my replacement waffle maker.
