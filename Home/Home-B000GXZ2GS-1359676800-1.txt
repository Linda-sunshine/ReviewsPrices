review/summary: Nice replacement for French Pressreview/text: So I broke my glass French Press as I was leaving on a trip.I liked its portability, though not its fragility. I used this to replace it. I think any coffee connoisseur will find the following:1) The AeroPress makes great coffee (ala Americano - weaken the brew with hot water to desired strength)2) The AeroPress makes semi-decent Espresso. The quality will not compare to a nice Espresso maker, but it is decent.3) Whatever comes out of this while camping is absolutely the best thing you'll ever drink. It seems that while camping, this unit improves its product by a factor of 10. Or maybe it is that my standards sink a bit while roughing it.Either way, this is a great way to make coffee on the road. I even use it at home when I just want a single cup of coffee.Here's how I use it:Measure the coffee/water according to the directions given in the manual. Pour the water on top of the grounds, never grounds on top of coffee.I let this set for 10 seconds, I stir with the included stir stick for 10 seconds. Then use the press. This should take 20 seconds from putting the plunger in the unit until you are squeezing out the last bit of water from the bottom.I've never brewed a bad cup, and always follow the above directions.
