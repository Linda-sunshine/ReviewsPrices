review/summary: Very good Value for price paidreview/text: Got it for my wife. She loves it. Its sturdy and has great power. She particularly loves the fact that the blade is sharp and will shop many large items. Some other blenders have a dull blade and they will wear out faster. The only negative is that the finish indicated brushed chrome so I thought that the body was made from metal and not the heavy duty plastic. She has used it numerous times already. It is fast and cleans up easily.
