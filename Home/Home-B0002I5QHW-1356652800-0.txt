review/summary: Grated a whole turkeyreview/text: My cat required raw meat along with occasional grizzle and small bits of bone. This has now done 2 whole turkeys and is so easy to clean. The engineering seems to be super. I wonder if it will hold up for turkey #9 and #10??? Well worth the &#34;small&#34; price tag.
