review/summary: Its worth itreview/text: Best 'cheap' juicer! Nice and compact. Easy to put together, takes about 5 minutes to clean with brush that was included. Just make sure when u take pulp catcher out that you cover the spout with your finger to prevent drips all over your kitchen counter/ floor.
