review/summary: Disapointedreview/text: This is second KitchenAid product that failed miserably. First one is my $1500 three year old stove that continues to have failures of various kind. Now the blander. I love the heavy base and the good motor but I really do not appreciate the connection between the base unit and the pitcher. It is made out of cheep plastic and it wore out on me quickly due to high revolutions and heavier blending (I was making humus). I thought I can just buy a replacement part but product is not designed to be repaired. Blades are stamped in and I really do not see much difference between this one and a $25 blander.I will not buy a KitchenAid product again.
