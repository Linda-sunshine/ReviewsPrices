review/summary: Waste of money ....review/text: Thank God I did not pay what they say was full price for this product ($299.00). There is nothing special about this product. I bought it because being a widower now I don't need a full pot of coffee and the idea of gettng one cup seemed perfect for me - no waste. Well if I can get to work that would be a great concept. It is either constantly going into &#34;prime&#34; mode or it wont' pull water through and at times the noise it makes sounds like it going to blow up. So I have a bunch of K-cups to use - all Starbucks and I will keep on trying to get it to work once in awhile and when the K-cups are gone the coffee make will be gone also. I have to keep it unplugged and water out of the water well to dry everytime before I can get another cup ... so I am getting maybe 3 cups a week.
