review/summary: Poor Qualityreview/text: Very disappointed in this product. I purchased the Midland WR300 thinking I was upgrading my old weather radio. Even though it was fairly easy to program, the clarity of the alerts and weather info was extremly hard to understand. Very garbled no matter where I positioned it in the house.
