review/summary: I love itreview/text: There's already so many good reviews out there that I don't really need to say anymore than it's a great purchase. It's my first juicer and I wanted to make sure I got a good one. I shove pretty much everything in there whole and with seeds and skin and everything and this baby does all the work. I love it and would probably just keep replacing this one when the time came every so years.I made the note of what other people have said also in that it will probably last longer if you wash it by hand and not with the dishwasher so that's what I do after every use of it- straight away. Easy peasy to clean up too because you just get rid of the left over pulp anyway you like- I don't put it down my sink because I don't want it clogging, I put it on my garden. Then you just wash it with hot water. I don't really even use detergent because I don't want to introduce chemicals into my future juices but I use boiling hot water.
