review/summary: Good Car Vacreview/text: I would have given it 5 stars had the flexible tubing been longer. I need about a 3-4 ft. extension. Fortunately,I had another flexible that fit it and that worked out fine. Probably would never have purchased the Eureka anyway, good as it is, had I taken apart the older hand vac and found the bungee cord ( with ball end) keeping other stuff lodged in the tubing. But then I would not have supposed I'd sucked up a bungee cord. Oh well, now I've got 2!!!Good stuff:Got here in 2 daysin perfect conditionPowerful..Got in those narrow places with narrow accessory headLong power cordNewFits other Vac accessoriesEasily move it around in the carNot too loud (anyway couldn't hear the ringing in my ears :)Slightly not good stuff:It is sort of heavy, but I just set it down in the car, then vacuum.Definitely recommend this if you do not have a hand vac (and have other flexible tubing).
