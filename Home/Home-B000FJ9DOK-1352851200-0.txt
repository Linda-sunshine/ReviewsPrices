review/summary: Nice to have cold water on the hottest daysreview/text: We carry two of these bottles in the car. They can sit in hot conditions for hours and still have ice left in them. The seal has never failed us and the way the top pops open is handy when I am driving. After half a dozen other water bottles, we have the ones we will use for a long time. The larger capacity bottle might be a consideration if you are a heavy drinker.
