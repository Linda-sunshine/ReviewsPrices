review/summary: super stormreview/text: During super storm Sandy I had to heat water for coffee on my bar-b-que, then pour the water through my drip coffee maker. My stove is electric. Right after I got my electricity back, I ordered a percolator so next year when I go 8 or 9 days without power, at least I'll make cofee a little easier. Oh, an I also bought a gas stove. This pot is very nice. You can use a filter with it, but I find that wetting the coffee before you perk it keeps the grounds from settling in the pot. A good buy.
