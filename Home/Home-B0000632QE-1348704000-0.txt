review/summary: I ask myself two questions.....review/text: Since purchasing this mandolin I have been asking myself two questions: 1) How have I managed forty years preparing meals without it, and 2) Why do I bother to put it away? In the past I have used a salad shooter, a food processor, various slicers and my paring knife for slicing and dicing; but now I use this mandolin for everything. It is so easy to use and easy to clean (I usually just rinse and allow it to air dry because the blades are very sharp). I find that we are now eating much healthier because I can prepare sliced vegetables, chopped salads, sliced potatoes, hash browns, you name it, from fresh produce quickly and easily, avoiding costly packaging and preservatives. My only warning is that the blades are super sharp and vegetables slice so easily that you must be very careful and follow the directions for proper use. Love it!
