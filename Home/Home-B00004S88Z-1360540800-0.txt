review/summary: Well builtreview/text: Outstanding canner that works well. I like the pressure weight that sets the pressure at 5,10,15. The gauge does not exactly match at 10 and 15. For the long term, I wish it did not have an emergency rubber plug that will have to be replaced sometime in the future.
