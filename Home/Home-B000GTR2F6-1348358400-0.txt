review/summary: Awesome, but know your travel mug size!review/text: With 1500 reviews, there's little point in my commenting much but the travel mug size thing is one no one appears to have commented on, didn't appear to be on the details on the product, and was something I really wanted to know, so I figured I'd tell folks what I've figured out.Basically your mug can be about 6" tall (absolute max at 6 1/8th) and still be able to use the removable drip tray. If you remove the drip tray your mug can be basically no taller than 7 1/4" (you can angle it slightly to wiggle it in at about 7 3/8", but I wouldn't recommend it).Other than that... yup, this thing is great. Everyone knows it. Buy it.
