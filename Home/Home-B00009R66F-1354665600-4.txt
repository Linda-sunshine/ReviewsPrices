review/summary: Works on heavily stained carpetreview/text: We bought this with the hope that it would restore our carpet from the years of puppy/cat stains, and heavily soiled areas near the doors. I will keep it simple. It works on old tough stains with ease with the supplied cleaner, Hot tap water, and a spray bottle of Simple green to pre treat the bad areas. I have not experienced any leaks from it, nor was it difficult to clean afterwards. I don't see the need to spend any more money on a version that produces its own hot water.
