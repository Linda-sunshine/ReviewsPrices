review/summary: Nice productreview/text: &#34;Old school&#34; was what she wanted. This unit works well and is very well made. A little tough to clean up, but we are somewhat spoiled with the ease of K Cups in our coffee world. Good, study product. Takes about 10 minutes on medium gas heat to brew, well work it for a classic taste!
