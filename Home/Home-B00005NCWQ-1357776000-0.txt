review/summary: Nice Pot - Like Mom and Dad Used to Use....Except....review/text: I really purchased this pot as part of my survival inventory to use if we ever lost power. Right off the bat it brought back memories of how my parents used to make coffee back in the 60's when I was a kid.It's a good pot and it does brew a good cup of coffee or tee. Is it as well made as the old ones from way back...well no it's not. Metal is a bit thinner, especially the basket and stem, but by today's standards it pretty well made. My only real issue with it and why it only got four stars is the plastic percolator/viewing cap. For such a nice pot I would think it would have a glass cap. I was a little disappointed.Overall though it's a nice pot and I am happy with the purchase.
