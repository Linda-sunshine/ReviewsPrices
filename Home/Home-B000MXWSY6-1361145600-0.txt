review/summary: Is great for different timesreview/text: I bought this alarm clock because I kept messing with my husband's alarm. I use one alarm for super early work out morningsmand the other alarm for &#34;regular&#34; mornings. The brightness levels are great, my husband is sensitve to light and he has not complained about this one.
