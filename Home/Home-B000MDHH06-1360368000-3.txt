review/summary: Great Juicer!review/text: It extracts so much from the vegetables/fruit. Hardly any need to chop, for instance, it takes whole apples. It is easy to clean. In fact, I bought a second one to keep at work. I juice at least once a day up to 20 oz. It's inexpensive. And, the first one I bought, soon after my purchase, I happened to knock over the basket that collects the pulp. It hit the floor hard and cracked. Breville replaced it for me (and Amazon was willing to do so as well) - even though it was totally my fault! I applaud the manufacturer for that and therefore trust in their products and am a very happy customer.
