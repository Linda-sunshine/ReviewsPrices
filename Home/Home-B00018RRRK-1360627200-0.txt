review/summary: I'd rather use my old blade grinder, thanksreview/text: When my old cheapo blade grinder died (the black plastic knob on top of the blade came off, and bounced around in there with the beans - yikes!), I saw this model on sale elsewhere and asked my husband to get it for me for Christmas. What a mistake. The combination of coffee dust and static cling is incredibly irritating, as is trying to get it all to grind - there's always one or two pieces bouncing around, refusing to go down through the grinder, which means I run the noisy thing longer than I should. There's coffee dust all over the place, all of the time. The coffee isn't very evenly ground either, IMHO. Does it make a better-tasting cup? I'm not enough of a pro to be able to tell, but I know it was a MUCH simpler process with my blade grinder, and a great deal less messy. I regret asking my husband to buy this big, loud, messy monstrosity for me. I actually grind coffee less often. The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because some of this might be my own inexperience, and I have yet to try using it to grind finer-grind coffee...if it makes a good cup of Greek coffee or espresso, I might forgive it.
