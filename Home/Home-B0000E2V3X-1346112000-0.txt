review/summary: Best Pizza Pan, Ever!review/text: I've owned many pizza pans over the years, aluminum, nonstick, airbake, pizza stone, you name it. Also, I've been trying to get rid of all the aluminum cookware in my kitchen. However, my husband is a 'pizza officianato' which means he can be quite picky about what his zaa is cooked on and refused to get rid of the last bastion of aluminum, the old pizza pan. I decided to take the risk and bought one of these knowing how well cast iron skillets cook and brown lots of other foods. I made a homemade pizza dough and after preheating the pan in the oven, I slathered the pan with olive oil and slapped the dough onto it's flaming hot surface. It sizzled and smelled fantastic, like our favorite pizzeria! There were no leftovers, it was that good! If you love pizza but hate soggy, mushy crust, then I highly reccommend this pan. (Pre-heating the pan is the key to a crisp crust.) It is quite heavy but the handles make it much easier to maneuver. I may even use this pan for tortillas or free-form loaves of bread.
