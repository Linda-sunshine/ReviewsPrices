review/summary: Weak probereview/text: I was happy with it for a while, with the alarm, timer and whatnot. Then out of the blue a short seems to have developed near the probe itself. *sigh* Now the temp jumps to &#34;high&#34; and goes crazy if I move the wire a bit. Amazon however rocks and are going to replace the unit for me. So, Amazon gets 5 stars!
