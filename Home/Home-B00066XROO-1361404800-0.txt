review/summary: First one lasted 5 years...about to replace it with another just like it! Not perfect, but I LOVE the cooking space.review/text: Loved this! I went from preparing one serving at a time to two, and for a family of 5, that's awesome! I quickly learned and adapted to the fact that the food cooked fastest at the point closest to the insertion of the heating element. Most would call this a big issue; I loved the price and added cooking space so much that I simply poured the slower spot first. It ended up working quite nicely when it came time to flip, which goes a little slower than pouring. I've used it for 5 years, and finally the coating started peeling where nothing had been cooked (between the pancakes). I had been trying to even this out, but evidently started too late. I'm about to order another. As non-metal spatulas consistently melt on me, I use metal ones with extreme caution, not scraping the surface. I taught my kids to do the same, but of course kids....They did learn, but it took time. But I was impressed! The surface never scratched from that. Good product for the price! I'm about to buy it all over again, I think! Certainly no gripes to prevent buying another, but one always likes to check the market!
