review/summary: SHEET SNOB HEREreview/text: Disclaimer: I won't even put sheets on my bed that don't pass my eye/feeling test. I am VERY picky, and I run hot at night so I need something that will stay cool.These sheets PASS the test. I wash them in cold water and dry them on low heat and haven't had any shrinking problems. They are some of the most comfortable sheets I've ever slept on. I love white sheets, because I have dogs and they allow me to throw a little bleach in with my washer loads and they go back to new (plus the bleach makes em crispy just like I like em). I will be buying backup sets from here again, regardless of price. You sleep a 1/3 of your life, no cost is too much.
