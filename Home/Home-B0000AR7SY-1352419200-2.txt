review/summary: Great coffee grinderreview/text: If you use a drip or enjoy a french press this is the grinder for you, it's a nice quiet grinder that does a great job in grinding fresh coffee beans, I previously owned a flat burr grinder that sounded like a Jet taking off in the morning and it did not do as well a job as the Capresso.I use a Technivorm Moccamaster coffee maker and freshly roasted beans and my morning cuppa joe is awesome., I highly recommend this grinder.
