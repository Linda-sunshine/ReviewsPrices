review/summary: Works well - no complaints!review/text: My first immersion hand blender. Got it in March, and after 9 months it is still working well.It feels solid and well built and I don't have any complaints.This seems to be a pretty basic appliance. I don't see why anyone would spend more for a more deluxe version.
