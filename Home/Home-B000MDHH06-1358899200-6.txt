review/summary: Powerful little juicer!review/text: I'd borrowed another Breville from my sister-in-law before commiting to this purchase, and I have to say that this compact juicer seems just as powerful as the larger model I'd tried out. So far it's held up to near-daily use and takes up much less space than its larger counterparts. Highly recommend!
