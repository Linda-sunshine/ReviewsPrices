review/summary: warms mug of coffeereview/text: I got this to keep a cup of coffee warm and it does the job. I don't expect it to heat up anything. Two years of use and still going strong. Only 4 stars because the paint is wearing off. Seems more cosmetic than anything. Plus a plastic piece of the edge recently broke. A touch of glue fixed it and I expect it will continue do its job. It stays in one place and isn't subject to abuse or bumps etc so I was a bit taken aback by the piece breaking off.
