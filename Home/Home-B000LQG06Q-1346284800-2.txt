review/summary: Revolting, powerful odorreview/text: There's a small slip of paper included with this product that warns that the product may have a "Fresh Foam" smell.If you're set on buying this, make sure you have an outdoor space you can air this out for at least a few days. I live in an apartment where no such space exists. My entire apartment now strongly reeks of "Fresh Foam," which, to me, smells like being trapped inside a box of Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies. The odor is so strong in my apartment that I'm literally dizzy. Sleeping on the pad, even with it wrapped in layers of sheets, is impossible. I cannot overstate how powerful the scent is.Needless to say, I'm sending this back to Amazon. I need to get it out of my apartment as fast as possible. I'll never buy bedding online again.
