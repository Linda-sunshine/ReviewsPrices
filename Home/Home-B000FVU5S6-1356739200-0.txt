review/summary: Comfortablereview/text: Purchased sheets for my daughter, Xmas present. She claims they are comfortable but not that special. Came out of the wash very wrinkled but were fine out of the dryer. I have had egyptian cotton sheets for a few years and these are noticeably not as soft. Obviously, there are differences in quality available.
