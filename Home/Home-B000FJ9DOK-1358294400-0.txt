review/summary: Great water bottle for every day usereview/text: I've been using this water bottle for the past 3 years. The only incident I've had was a brief leakage problem due to user error. The blue ring that keeps the top water-tight fell off during a washing. I left it on the sink, not knowing it was from my water bottle. Called customer service and they sent me a replacement for free.Other than that, no leakage problems. Very sturdy, easy to clean.
