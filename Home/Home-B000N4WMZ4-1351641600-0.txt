review/summary: Dangerous enamel coatingreview/text: I owned two Lodge pots as well as LeCreuset Pots. The lodge pots seem like a great deal for the price. The reality is they are dangerous. My wife was sauteing onions in some olive oil. Fortunately she turned away from the pot and was facing the sink when we heard a loud pop like a light bulb bursting and hot oil and what looked like pieces of glass were on the stove. When I looked in the pot, part of the enamel coating was missing exposing the cast iron. Had she been looking over the pot stirring the onions she could have been scalded with hot oil or worse blinded by oil and fragments of the enamel. After examining the fragment it was apparent that the enamel coating is paper thin compared to LeCreuset's coating. I'm thankful that no one was injured and they should pull these pots off of the market for safety reasons. You pay more for LeCreuset for a reason. Don't put yourself at risk for serious injury to save a few bucks. I threw my Lodge pots out and won't ever consider buying another.
