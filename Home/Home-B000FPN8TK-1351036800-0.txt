review/summary: Brilliant design, easy to cleanreview/text: This is such a simple, yet brilliant design. It takes the chore out of making loose leaf tea, which includes the ease of cleanup. The only complaint I have is how easy it is to engage the dispenser at the bottom. It's not really complaint, just a word of caution of how little pressure it takes to make the tea flow. Beyond that, it's a joy to brew up a pot of herbal goodness.
