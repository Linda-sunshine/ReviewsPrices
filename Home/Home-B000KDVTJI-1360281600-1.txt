review/summary: coffee/tea OCD here...this kettle is GREATreview/text: I drink a lot of coffee & tea. I love to have a quick cup of coffee brewed via a "pour over" method. I have boiled water in a pan for quite some time to accommodate for my coffee/tea. I looked at many different kettles for a while before finally purchasing this one. I AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED.I love the fact that it is entirely stainless steel. NO PLASTIC/CHEMICAL smell at all.Some have complained that it is loud. Really? Most are because they are boiling water internally. That just seems a bit 'knit-picky' to me. It is not overly loud. It does make noise, but if you grind coffee beans, that makes a lot of noise as well.The beauty is the quickness & auto-shutoff. Unlike boiling water in a pan (& I've let the water boil down to nothing & it about ruined the pan & stove), this I can turn on & WALK AWAY... & if I get pre-occupied with something, the water STAYS HOT for some time!!!I recently boiled 3.5 cups in this pot & boiled 3.5 cups in a pot on the stove for a comparison. The Aroma pot clicked off at 4:26 where the pot on the stove took 10:06 to come to a rapid boil. PRETTY GOOD!!!Buy this, you won't regret it... plus it looks GREAT
