review/summary: Jury is still out with this onereview/text: We bought this because we were tired of the cheap electric griddles and their uneven heat. The last electric we bought was so bad there were literally stripes on our pancakes where the element was. We read good reviews for this and bought it. We use it on a gas range over two burners. We typically use it for pancakes, bacon and such. The bacon cooked up well but we still had some hot spots where the actual burners are but the bacon cooked up good. Pancakes have not been good at all. We have tried low settings, pre-heating for 15-20 minutes and nothing really worked. We had pancakes burning in spots and hardly cooked in others (same pancake)! We have finally gone to only cooking one pancake at each burner location and that seems to work but of course we waste all the space that could be used. Maybe we just haven't learned the trick of cooking with cast iron but for now I can only give it three stars.
