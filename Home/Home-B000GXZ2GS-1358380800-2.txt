review/summary: Really Cool, Works well, no batista herereview/text: This is my third espresso maker, I have a lavazza espresso point, an espresso percolator, and now the Aeropress. The Aeropress is well made, plastic, but not flimsy or cheap feeling. There's definitely a learning curve with it, first few tries were either bitter or used way too much espresso. BUT It works well, it's not necessarily common sense, but doesn't take long to figure out and use appropriately. I think for the price its a good buy for anyone who puts a little extra thought into their coffee.It looses a point purely because you loose out on the foam topping that I've come to expect from both of my other espresso machines.
