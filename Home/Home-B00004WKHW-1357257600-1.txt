review/summary: Great food processor, until it stopped working.review/text: I have a 'regular size' food processor, but I wanted one for mincing garlic. I use a lot of garlic in my pasta sauce, and the press that I have, which was not cheap, just took so long.This was very nice to have. I used it more than the larger Cuisanart processor, for garlic, shakes, chopping nuts. And it's so easy to put away.One night, I chopped some garlic, wonder of wonders. It worked fine. I left the base out because I need chopped walnuts in the morning. The next morning, kaput. About 14 hours previously, it had worked fine. The base didn't get wet, and I ensured many times that that the bowl was on properly, as well as the lid. Still, nothing.What the heck?I bought the 4-cup Mini-Prep for my son for Christmas. I hope that one doesn't die after six months.
