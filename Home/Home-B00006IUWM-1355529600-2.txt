review/summary: This is AWSOMEreview/text: For our wedding we got a really nice kitchen knife set, but then a few years have gone by and I have not always had the best sharpening ritual. It got to the point that most of the knifes were useless and I had considered doing what my parents have done and get them professionally sharpened until I saw the price. I saw this online with great reviews and took a chance and I couldn't be happier. My knives went from useless to brand new in just a few minutes. I have recommended this to all of my family members. Don't hesitate to buy.
