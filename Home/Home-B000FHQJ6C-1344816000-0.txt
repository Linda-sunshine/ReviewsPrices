review/summary: Very pleased.review/text: Solid product. This is my second juicer. I like it enough that I bought the same one for my sister. Makes damp carrot pulp, wetter apple pulp.Powerful enough that some veggies have bounced nearly out before I could put the pusher into the feed. Not too noisy, but it will wake people up in a quiet house. It's pretty neat to see the juice being extracted from very dry-ish type leaves like curly kale, but the green will spill.I definitely think it's easy to use, it also comes with a scrubby brush, which is handy. I compost most of the pulp unless it's plain carrot, and then I save the pulp for nutburgers. The hardest parts to clean are the circular blade (because the little holes will pluggle up if you let it dry out) and the body (because the pulp gathers into the hard plastic seams.) If I juice in the morning, I just fill up a tub of water in the sink and soak all the components until I get home to scrub them. Otherwise, I just use it once or twice a day on weekends and just clean off the blade.Easy, solid, powerful. This is a no brainer. I almost bought the more expensive breville juice fountain, and I am happy as a clam with this juicer.I have no cons. My last juicer was from 2003, not used often, and was not even comparable.
