review/summary: Love this trash can!!review/text: I've had this can 2 years now and love it. The only problem I had was after about 1.5 years, the lid started closing on its own immediately after openning. After a little investinging and tinkering I discovered this was easy to fix by just adding some more pre-load on the openner spring cartridge. Works like new again. I still give it 5 stars. Batteries last a long time. Funny thing is I've gotten so used to the convenience that when I go to other people's houses I find myself waving my hand at their kitchen can and wondering why it won't open!!
