review/summary: SUCKS don't waste your moneyreview/text: The pour spout on this kettle is non existant. Don't waist your money it spills boiling water everywhere. It has an awkward shape, and it just feels cheap. Find something else be sure to look for something with a good spout. I am returning this tomorrow.
