review/summary: Fits Perfectly in My Fridgereview/text: I like this water pitcher because it fits perfectly in my fridge not taking up too much room so I can fit more food in it. I actually like the smaller sized pitcher because it doesn't hold too much water so I refill it with fresh water every glass. I don't like it when water has been sitting stagnant in my fridge for days. It holds about three and a half glasses of water.
