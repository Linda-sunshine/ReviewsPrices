review/summary: Great tasting coffee and fun procesreview/text: Makes wonderful coffee via a fun and easy process. I love watching this thing work and the final product is always worth the short wait. I wish I had gone with the 6 cup but that is my own fault not the Moka pots. It's a well made product and I highly recommend it.
