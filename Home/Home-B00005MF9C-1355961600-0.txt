review/summary: Don't need a Keurig with this babyreview/text: I have thought about getting a coffeemaker for myself since my girlfriend doesn't drink tea or coffee - weirdo. I haven't had any issues this far and for the price I have a great value out of this.Pros:-Cheap, light, and easy to store-Ready out of the box; simple to use-Makes a great cup of coffee (I used to work at Starbucks but for regular coffee, I dont notice any loss in quality form expensive Keurigs or paper basket coffee makers)-Good build-Comes with stainless thermos (other Keurigs do not)-CompactCons:-Cleaning up filter can be annoying if you wait until grinds are cooled off (advantage of K Cups)-Single cup coffee only but that's what this is designed for-Coffee takes 3-5 minutes until it drips out (but plan your morning, breakfast, etc. around this like I do)Overall, I am very happy I tried this above other more expensive coffee makers. I know there are others out there that are in a lower price range like Hamilton Beach but this is my very first coffee maker. If you need a coffee maker for one or two people and don't want to make a whole pot, this is perfect. Other reviews here helped me out as well.
