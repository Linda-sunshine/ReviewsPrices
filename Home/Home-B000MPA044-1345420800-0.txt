review/summary: Cuisinart 1000 Watt 6 Quart Pressure Cookerreview/text: I heard about this product from of friend so I thought I would give it a try. I have used it now four time and I love it. I made a pot roast with deer meat two times and I was amazed how tender the meat came out. I was able to pull it off the bone with a fork. The veg. only taking 15 min came out perfect. I also made ribs in it and they almost fell off the bone. I look forward to trying to trying more recipes out in it.
