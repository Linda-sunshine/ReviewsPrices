review/summary: Powerful, Great vaccum for the pricereview/text: I got this vacuum for around $50 some 8 months back. I have used several other brands like Eureka & Bissel (models approx this price range). I would say, this one is the best by far.If you do not want to spent $100 or above & want one, which performs to that level, this one would be your best bet. It picks up dirt like a real sucker ! Hairs were another problem at my place & this one picks up that, pretty well too.So far no complaints.. & I am pretty happy with this purchase.PROS:- Good performance & picks up dirt real good.- very light weight.- Easy to use, clean, store, maintain.- Good value for money.Cons:The only minor issue I have with this is that, there is a brush which comes with this as attachment. But there is no slot behind the cleaner to keep this. Usually other vacuums comes with a slot to fit in all the pieces. But this one, I've to search around my house each time I do my vacuum to find that brush. Also the performance with the attachments are not so good.
