review/summary: Perfect for my needs.review/text: Got this for my college apartment twin xl matteress, and it fits perfectly unlike the tommy sheet set I purchased. The tommy fitted sheet fit fine on the corners of the mattress, holding it well in place, but was too big on the sides which came out regularly after a night of sleep. For a couple of nights before my sheet set was delivered, I even slept on this mattress pad without any fitted sheets, and it never caused any trouble of coming out of the mattress.It is also decently thick, and definitely makes a difference in the comfort of the mattress, helping me get sleep quickly. Perfect...
