review/summary: LOVE IT!review/text: Not only did I love the price that I got it for during a lightening deal, but the first time I used it, I knew it was worth the investment. It's easy to use and cleans very well. My cream color, dog trampled carpets looked brand new! My only disappointment is that the bare floor attachment is sold separately.
