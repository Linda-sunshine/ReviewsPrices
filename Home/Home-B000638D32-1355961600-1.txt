review/summary: Large, sharp, holds its edgereview/text: I bought this over a year ago. Its had heavy use on all manner of veggies and still cuts like the dickens. I ruined the knife it replaced with a cheap knife sharpener so I've babied this one along (only hand washed it and only used it on a cutting board) and its still cutting with ease. Much better than I expected for the price!
