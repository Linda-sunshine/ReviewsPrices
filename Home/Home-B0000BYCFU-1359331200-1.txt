review/summary: Solid performance!review/text: I priced an introductory canner for my wife in several places. We like to do things on a big scale. The 16 qt version at satan's box store was only about $15 less. We love it. First ever canning attempt was successful on 6 out of 8 jars. Instructions were easy to follow, cleans up nice, we're hooked!
