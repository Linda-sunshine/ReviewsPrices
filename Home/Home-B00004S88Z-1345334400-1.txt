review/summary: All American Cannerreview/text: Although I purchased this canner back in March, I did not get the opportunity to use it until yesterday. I have done plenty of water bath canning but this is the first pressure canner I have ever used and I love it. I was intimidated at first, but after reading the very helpful manual and putting the canner in action I found it was relatively easy to use. It is too big and heavy to put on a stove top, so I used a propane camp stove set up in the garage with plenty of ventilation. This canner will be used plenty during the next couple of months. I love that it was manufactured in the USA.
