review/summary: Worst knife I own.review/text: I purchased this knife based on the excellent reviews from America's Test Kitchen. This is by far the worst knife I've ever owned. It is uncomfortable to use, cheaply made and was dull right out of the packaging. I should have returned. Nothing makes cooking easier than a great knife..look elsewhere.
