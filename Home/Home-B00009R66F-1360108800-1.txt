review/summary: NOT WORTH THE MONEYreview/text: I have bought two Hoover Steam Cleaners, and BOTH stopped working within a short time after very little use. The first one I chalked up to just a dud machine, but when the second went bad after about five uses I contacted Hoover and offered them the chance to make it right. They sent me a generic email explaining how I could fix the problem (no suction) but I took the machine to a professional and he told me it would cost more to fix than to buy a new one. I am out about $328 (not including shipping) and the cost of the attempted repair. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. .
