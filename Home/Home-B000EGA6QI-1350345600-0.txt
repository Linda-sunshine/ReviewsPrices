review/summary: Easy to clean & use; solid productreview/text: This is my first immersion hand blender, so I wasn't sure which to buy. I decided to go with this one because it seemed affordable for the quality it offered. It has not yet disappointed. I will write back later after more time passes to note how durable it is.From my experience with this product, it is both easy to use and easy to clean. We use it often in my household to make shakes and mix soups. It has taken the place of our food processor and blenders in these cases, and is so much easier to clean than the other two. We simply detach the blender from the handle and run the blade under water.One last point to make, this is an item easy to store as it doesn't take up much space.- Easy to use.- Easy to clean.- Easy to store.- Affordable quality.Very happy with my purchase.
