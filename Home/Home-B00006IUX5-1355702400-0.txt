review/summary: Great for seedsreview/text: I use this grinder for seeds (flax, sunflower, hemp) and oats. It's quick and easy to use and stores nicely. You just wind up the cord and pop it in a cabinet. It is difficult to clean because you can't get the insides wet and I have a feeling it won't last very long. I've had it for 3 years so far but it's already starting to sound weaker.
