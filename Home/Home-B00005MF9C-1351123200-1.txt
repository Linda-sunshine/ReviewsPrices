review/summary: Perfect size, portion & easy cleanupreview/text: This coffeemaker is perfect if you don't drink coffee too often but you like a nice cup once in a while. For me it's the perfect size and doesn't take up a lot of counter space.This product fits my household needs perfectly. It makes about 12-oz cup of coffee (maybe a little more).Another important feature is the reusable filter, no need to purchase disposable paper filters. Just rinse it out after brewing.There's only one button, just push down when you're ready to brew and it's all set.It heats up real nice, I personally like scalding coffee but this is a great in-between.You can also use it to brew hot water for tea, just place the mug with the teabag and add water.It comes with its own thermos. I like the size and shape, very simple design and cute. My only issue (and this is my own preference) is that the lid doesn't close. There's a small slit to drink from which is fine but I like to be able to keep my coffee warm by closing the lid.I would definitely recommend this product.
