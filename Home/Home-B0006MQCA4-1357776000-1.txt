review/summary: One of my all time favorite purchasesreview/text: we drink a LOT of filtered water, and this pitcher allows me to fill it once and have it for a few days, without constantly refilling it. It filters the water well (we use the 2 stage filters) and makes tap water taste like bottled water. We are considering getting one for husbands office refrigerator next.
