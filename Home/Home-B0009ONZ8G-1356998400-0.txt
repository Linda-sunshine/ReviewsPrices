review/summary: Great Vacuumreview/text: So I just ordered a replacement belt for this vacuum and Amazon was kind enough to tell me that I had already ordered a replacement back in 2009. I remember I ordered a spare when I ordered the vac but I lost it. Anyway, I thought I would mention after 3 plus years of ownership, the vacuum is running great. We have the "newer" version without the headlight and with the cheap plastic, but it works fine for us. Our entire upstairs is carpeted with a deep shag and we have a dog and a teenager. This vacuum has been old reliable. I remember thinking that for the price I didn't expect it to work long, but it has absolutely outlived my expectations. I've purchased vacuums at twice the price that didn't last as long as this one. We really like the bags - they're easier than dumping the bagless stuff. The suction is powerful - I've used it to vacuum the car a time or two and it worked great. Just needs a longer hose for that task. Anyway, two thumps up. :)
