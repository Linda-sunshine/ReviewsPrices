review/summary: For The Best Coffeereview/text: I have had one of these grinders for years. I bought this one for my daughter. When I learned that burr grinders are the way to go, I got a Capresso. I have not been sorry for a single day. This grinder is expensive, but does an excellent job. A word of advice: keep the grinder clean! I think this applies to any grinder, but if you want good coffee, if you want your grinder to work properly, then regular maintenance is required. I buy whole beans from Peets, 16oz bags. I clean my grinder's interior after emptying each bag. It seems to keep it in good shape, and I recommend using a similar schedule.
