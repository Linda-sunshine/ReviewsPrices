review/summary: Even better than expected!review/text: I purchased this as a gift for my mom, who wanted a cast iron dutch oven for Christmas. She had asked for one she saw for $20 at a local store but after looking at the ones in the store I was a little underwhelmed. I did my research and found that if you want a good cast iron dutch oven and can't afford the expensive price tags of le crucet then this Lodge dutch oven is perfect!Amazon offered a variety of colors, I went with the blue one because it was cheapest and my mom didn't care what color it was. I was a little worried the bright color might make it look cheap, but it really is beautiful in person. I was also impressed with the packaging, very sturdy for such a heavy item. I am very happy with this purchase.
