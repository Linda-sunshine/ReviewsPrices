review/summary: Good, Easy Coffeereview/text: Using the instructions provided here:[...], this brewer will, I think, produce the best cup of coffee one could make without spending significantly more on sophisticated equipment. I use this, a hario skerton grinder, and coffee I roast myself, to make coffee which is better than any I can find in my area. When friends try my coffee, they typically question if I added sugar or some sort of syrup to the coffee, when in fact I have not, due to the effectiveness of this brewer at preserving the natural sweetness of coffee, unlike the auto-drip machines many are used to which dull the flavor of the coffee.
