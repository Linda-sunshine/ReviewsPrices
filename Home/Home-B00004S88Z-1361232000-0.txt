review/summary: Made over 1,000 jars last year alonereview/text: This canner is the best. Out of 1,000 jars only broke 1 and about 5 didnt seal. Worth every penny. If I had to do it over, i would have bought the 42 quart so that I could do twice as many jars at a time. I probably will buy that and give this one to my mom, as she is still using the cheap canner with the rubber seals. One bummer on this is that the top can sometimes get stuck, but it's easily popped upen using a prying action between the top and bottom. The metal inserts to put on the bottom and in between layers of jars are kinda flimsy. Best canner out there. Period.
