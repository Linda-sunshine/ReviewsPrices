review/summary: Nice sheets!review/text: Not sure why other reviewers mentioned &#34;scratchiness&#34; of the sheets being a problem. Yes, they're stiff out of the package, but one regular washing immediately solved the problem. The sheets are comfy and soft and so far no problem, but it's only been a week or so. The color is pretty much exactly like it showed on my monitor, I wouldn't quite say &#34;plum&#34; (I think much darker), but it's a deep lilac. I did notice that while the fitted sheet fits perfectly now, I hope that doesn't change after several more washings due to shrinkage. It does have extra room for mattresses with a thick pillow-top, but we don't have that on our full-size mattress.
