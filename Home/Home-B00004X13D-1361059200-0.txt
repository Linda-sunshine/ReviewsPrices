review/summary: Reliable waffle maker and so easy to store!review/text: This waffle maker makes crispy, yet moist waffles. They bake evenly and fast. Storage isn't much of a problem as it stands on end or lays flat; doesn't take much room and is lightweight. Easy clean up when done when cool and it is folded, stored and ready for the next time.
