review/summary: Four years and still pumping.review/text: Our Keurig B60 has been in service for four years (2008). It continues to work flawlessly.We have always used filtered water (from the frig). Between the two of us, we brew several cups a day.It has never required any maintenance aside from an occasional wipe down.The coffee from this machine tastes great.There are many K-cups to select from. You have to try many from the vast selection to find your favorites.We love the convenience and ease of use this machine provides.
