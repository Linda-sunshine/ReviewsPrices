review/summary: Works Wellreview/text: Great product for quick clean ups. Works well on stairs, great suction, lightweight. Cord is plenty long. Very satisfied with this product. Only downfall is the exhaust blows out of the back of it so you have to keep your mess in front of you or you end up blowing it around.
