review/summary: Love my juice fountain!!!review/text: I recently fell in love with juices from "Organic Avenue" but the $12/bottle price made me consider buying a juicer. A lot of my friends are avid juicers and I surveyed a lot of them to see which was best. A lot of people recommended Breville or Jack Lalanne.After reading A LOT of reviews and comparing a lot I finally chose this model. My reasons: great reviews, size (I hate having a cluttered countertop), appearance, and volume (I knew I'd be juicing just for myself--this guy makes about 18-20oz.)It's been nearly two months since I excitedly ripped this baby out of the box. I absolutely LOVE this product. I recommend it to all my family, friends and co-workers.I juice almost every day now and it is EXCEEDINGLY easy to set up, use and clean. All-in-all the juicing/cleaning process takes me 5-10 minutes. I haven't juiced anything extra staining (like beets) yet. But I regularly juice kale and so far I have not had any trouble with stains/clean-up. (I clean it as soon as I've finished juicing.)Why I love this:- The pitcher it comes with is perfect. I also love that it holds back the foam for you if you prefer.- Easy to use. The instructions are easy to follow and it comes with a booklet of recipes.- The included scrub brush makes cleaning that much easier! It's very effective for cleaning the filter!- It's pretty compact - Slightly larger than I imagined but small for a juicer.- It looks very nice and sleek.- Small details like the easy to remove plug make it that much better!
