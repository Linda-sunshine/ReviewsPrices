review/summary: Runs well, but inconsistentreview/text: I've used it thrice, and so far it's working alright. But don't get this grinder if you need any kind of consistency to your grind -- e.g. you're using a French press or cold brew. After pressing the button for a few seconds, I've ended up with still intact beans along with grounds that were too fine all in the same batch together (sort of like when your hot pocket comes out of the microwave steaming hot on the outside and ice cold on the inside). It also doesn't have a huge capacity -- about 3 ounces or so.
