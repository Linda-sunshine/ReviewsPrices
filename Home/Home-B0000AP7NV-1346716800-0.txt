review/summary: Pretty good for a Dormreview/text: I bought this water filter for my dorm room in college, and I would say that its pretty good for a dorm. If I were living in any bigger accommodations (even a small apartment) I would get the bigger sized one. This one works well and will fill about 3 big cups of water so you do have to refill it a lot. The main thing I don't like about this water filter is that the lid often pops off which can be really annoying over time, and even more annoying is occasionally the filter will pop out of its spot when you're pouring water and a bunch of black dots rush into the main compartment which forces you to pour out all the water and clean it.Overall though for 11$ its a great buy for a dorm room, but I would steer clear of it in any other situation. I would probably even recommend a water bottle that has a filter in it instead of this for college students if they were considering that.
