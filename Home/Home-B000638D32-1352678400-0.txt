review/summary: 1 year reviewreview/text: I've had this knife for a year now. I've put it through the ringer. It survived being thrown into the kitchen sink by my brother, that chipped the knife, but surprisingly effected it very little. I love this knife because its cheap enough to be a beater knife. I'd be too afraid of damaging a $100 knife to use it all the time for every task.I've heard people describe that this knife only needs 3-4 licks on the sharpening steel and it is "razor sharp". That is a cute way of saying that after dicing 4-5 onions, it becomes dull as shit, and you need to sharpen it again. Sharpening it does make it good as new, but that only lasts an extremely short while. It's kind of a pain in the ass to takes breaks to sharpen your knife in the middle of dicing vegetables.Overall given the price, I can't complain too much about this knife. It has gives the most bang for your buck.
