review/summary: Juicerreview/text: Purchased this product to begin the new year 2013 juicing. It works okay not the best. My pulp is really wet and I feel like I am waisting a lot of produce. If you want dry pulp you may have to spend a little more. Will continue to use as it does the trick just not happy with the wetness of the pulp. Feels like you could squeeze more juice out.
