review/summary: Awesome!review/text: Purchased a second set of this cookware for my families cabin as I was so impressed with the set I bought for myself. I have a truly dated kitchen with a marginal electric stove which one day will hopefully be upgraded. This cookwares ability to conduct heat with such a lousy heat source is truly impressive. I feel like I'm cooking on a gas stove top! I love this product and would highly recommend it.
