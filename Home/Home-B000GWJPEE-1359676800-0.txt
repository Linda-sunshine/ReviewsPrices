review/summary: Works ok, but messyreview/text: I bought this for my child when he is having bad allergies. Before buying this, I've been using the Air-O-Swiss which I was very satisfied with. According to Consumer Reports, the Crane humidifiers are better than the Air-O-Swiss, so I decided to give it a try. I was sorta disappointed. It's really cute. It's simple to use. Just one knob. But my problem with is when you try to lift up the head to refill, water spills everywhere. This doesn't happen with my Air-O-Swiss. I know it's not a defective product, but rather a design flaw. Overall, if you're looking for something cheap and fool-proof to use, this is it for you. But if you're looking for something nicer and sturdier, buy an Air-O-Swiss. I would've liked this product more if it comes with a humidity-gauge, which the Air-O-Swiss had.
