review/summary: I wish the griddle were of thicker bottom.review/text: Since the griddle is somewhat light weight, it heats up quickly, That results in food sticking to the surface. The seasoned surface got stripped off when the cured turkey bacon was fried. Now food sticks to it despite re-seasoning the surface.
