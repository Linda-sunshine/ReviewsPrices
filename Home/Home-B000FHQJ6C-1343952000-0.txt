review/summary: Best Juicer ever!review/text: I'm a big fan of fresh juice, and I've used many other much more expensive brands but so far this is the best juicer I've used. Love it. It takes me 3 minutes to clean everytime I juice. No wonder this juicer got so many good reviews. 5 star raking for this juicer.
