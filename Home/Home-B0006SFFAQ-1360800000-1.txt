review/summary: Nice but not dependable!review/text: I love this pot, and so ice tried to overlook one big, messy flaw - sometimes you'll end up with a counter full of grounds & hot water - for no apparent reason! After reading some reviews here, I'm going to try to use compressed air to blow out whatever might be stuck so the water/coffee gets into the pot. I'd rather that I had these problems every time I used it - then I could just toss it. But because it doesn't happen every time, I keep thinking I've found the solution - until the NEXT time it overflows! After reading many reviews, I'm now sending it back & will try another brand. Oh - for what it's worth, the design flaw that has the water reservoir at the BACK of the machine is really irritating.
