review/summary: Great for the pricereview/text: I want to preface this by saying that I upgraded to these from probably the cheapest knives you can buy. The ones I had before were thin, light and very dull with cheap plastic handles, I could hardly slice a tomato without squishing it.I finally decided I needed some better knives, but I didn't want to spend very much. I only paid about $30 for these and I think they're fantastic for the price. I haven't had them long enough yet to comment on the rust issues talked about in other reviews, I'm hoping that hand-washing and drying them immediately after use will prevent that.I will update if I find any issues but so far, I am very happy with my purchase!
