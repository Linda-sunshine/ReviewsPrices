review/summary: Too many long winded reviews herereview/text: Here's the bottom line.Power. Not enough for most breads. Plenty for cakes and light stuff; the same stuff a hand mixer does competently...Extra attachments. We've bought a few and are disappointed. The attachments don't work well and are very expensive. My feeling is that the Kitchenaid design of the drive mechanism on the top front is simply a bad design. Read reviews of the pasta maker for examples.Efficiency: Sub-par. This machine is not engineered well IMHO. The attachments do not come anywhere near to the sides of the Kitchenaid bowls so we are constantly having to dangerously stick spatulas into the bowl to get the attachments to mix everything.Portability: This thing is surprisingly heavy. The weight appears to be in the case and not more importantly in the electric motor and gears. You won't be moving this out of a pantry when you want to use it so plan on a permanent counter-top position: it's tall, heavy and unweildly. Essentially it will be on display. Which brings me to the final element...Appearance: Good and interesting color selection. But the design itself is without any discernible design. It's dull without any flourishes. How difficult would the task have been to make levers more interesting, bowls more elegant, the case more timeless? Too difficult it appears for Kitchenaid.Final words?This is a $150 mixers on sale for $400! So you need to see $250 in value for having the Kitchenaid logo nameplate on display in your kitchen for this to make sense.Alternatives available here on Amazon are well reviewed here: [...]
