review/summary: Great Product, could use some refinementreview/text: I think it's a great product, makes bottle opening quick and painless.Was unintuitive for someone that didn't read the instructions (hold down button until it stops on it's own, then up button to push out the cork).The reason I don't give it a 5 is primarily because the cork screw always punctures the cork. I'd like to think they can engineer it a little better to not go through the cork. I know there are other brands (smaller units) on the market, I haven't used them b/c so far this one is good enough for our purposes.Also - two other nits - I think it could be faster and I think it could be more intuitive.
