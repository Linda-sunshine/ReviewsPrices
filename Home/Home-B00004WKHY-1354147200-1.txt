review/summary: Short livedreview/text: Started using it for the first time mixing a batter - the food Processor began to smoke and smell hot, before I could unplug it, it stopped working. It was dead after that. Returned it the next day and ordered a Kitchen Aide, haven't had a chance to try it yet. Had to repackage it and pay the shipping to return it. Not a good experience.
