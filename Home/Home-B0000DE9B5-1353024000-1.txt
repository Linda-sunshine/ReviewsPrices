review/summary: Strong Glass, Great Design, Lid is Easy to Usereview/text: THE LID=======================To be honest, without sounding like a wise-guy, I don't understand the problem people are having with the lid. It seemed very intuitive to me. The lid is made of 3 pieces, 2 concentric circles and an O-ring rubber washer. The "inner" circle turns, so when you turn Clockwise you expand the O-ring which makes the O-Ring push up against the glass making it air tight, when you turn counter-clockwise, the O-Ring does not expand and loosens allowing you to take the lid off. It really is very very intuitive. This type of contraption even allows natural pouring, with one hand on handle, you use your thumb to hold the "outer" circle in place, while your other hand loosens and takes off the lid to pour. Really its very very natural and intuitive. There is simply no need for a manual or instructions to operate. The O-ring separates and allows you to wash it conveniently.THE SIZE AND VOLUME========================Now to the Jug, its 2-liters, which holds the same volume as your typical 2 liter soda bottle. However it looks a lot smaller in person, deceptively small, the dimensions are 7.2" high, and the base is 5.5" by 5.5". I have confirmed that the Jug actually holds 2.25 liters from bottom to top. So the Jug does not skimp, its not 2-liters from bottom to top, but a full 2.25 liters.THE GLASS========================The glass feels very solid and thick. How thick I'm not sure, but I estimate its 4mm or about 1/8" thick. It feels solid regardless. There are no markings on the Glass, no measurement markings, its simply just clear glass. There also does not appear to be a tint, just appears to be clear. There does appear to be some air bubbles within the glass, but rare and not many throughout the jug.THE POURING AND DRIPPING========================I don't have a problem with excessive dripping when pouring. Half the time, there is one drop after pouring and the other half of the time not even a drop, its a perfect no drop from the start of pouring to the end of pouring. The spout is small, but I believe it is by design so that it is resilent to chipping. Simply it does its job, very decent pouring experience.THE HANDLE========================If you look at the the gap between the handle and the jug is 3/4", I believe this is for durability, you don't want the handle extended out and having it break off. If you look t the picture you see its likely optimal. Personally I have no issue with it, when you get use to it, it is fine.THE WEIGHT========================Imagine your standard Coffee Pot filled to the brim with water, its slightly heavier than that. I don't find it excessively heavy or heavy at all, and I'm not very strong, just your average person.DELIVERY AND PACKAGING========================I bought this directly from Amazon, the Jug was wrapped in 2 layers of the typical small bubble wrap, then placed in a Amazon delivery box. It does not have a Branded box that you typically see with Retail items. There is a simple label and slip in the Jug with the branding. The box it arrived in bulged a little bit. With only 3 layers of small bubble wrap I'm surprised it arrived unbroken, but it did and I'm actually assuming I got lucky in that respect. Recently bought a 2nd one from a 3rd Party Vendor (Trend Marketing) fullfilled by Amazon. This one did not have any bubble wrap, just merely placed in a shipping box, it appeared to arrived used and had a hairline scratch of about 3 to 4 inches on it. That one I am attempting to exchange. I will likely wait for Amazon directly to supply the next one I buy as I do not want to go through the hassle of another exchange.SUMMARY========================This Jug is as perfect as it gets on the market. Personally I think people expecting more are just too picky, point me to another better one if it exist. My only complaint is that it doesn't come in a 3 liter, as I mentioned the 2 liter is deceptively compact. Thank you for reading. Overall a good Jug, I will be buying 2 more.
