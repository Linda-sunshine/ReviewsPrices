review/summary: Treat Yourselfreview/text: I love to cook and a few years ago I finally broke down and bought my first KitchenAid Artisan Standing mixer. In the past I have always had a hand held mixer, but everyone who has a standing mixer told me that I need to buy one.I have to say that I have not used it as much as I thought I would, partially because it is heavy and I am just not in the habit of using a standing mixer.I have to say that my new mixer is very well built and durable and it will probably out live me.It is great to have the freedom to do other things while it is mixing. It really is a luzury to have one, but if you enjoy and do a lot of baking and cooking, it is worth the money.
