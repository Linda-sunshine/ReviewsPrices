review/summary: Just receivedreview/text: I bought this larger caddy after thinking I might need 2 smaller ones and after reading a few really great reviews about how well this product stays attached to the shower wall. I have tried the suction cup variety and like them, except when they lose suction and crash to the shower floor. So, cross my fingers, this will stay up longer. Even if it eventually falls, I can replace the Command strips! It actually came with enough strips that when I placed it on the wall crookedly, I was able to take it off and replace it nicely. I recommend standing in the shower/tub facing the area you want to place it...I know...it should be obvious, but it's worth saying because once it's placed, you can't unstick and restick without replacing the strips and it would be better to have the extras later if you need them. It seems durable, but only time will tell.
