review/summary: Hand tool hookup leaksreview/text: The cleaner itself, used on carpets, worked fine. However, when it came time to hook up the hand tool to clean the upholstery, the unit leaked terribly. In fact, while I had my back turned to the unit to clean the chair, the entire gallon of cleaning fluid was leaking out under the machine into my carpet. This has left a permanent stain on the carpet, which I have been unable to remove. I contacted Hoover, who troubleshooted the machine, determining that it was hooked up properly and was malfunctioning, and that I should take it to a repair facility - so the 3 day old machine needed to be transported an hour away for repairs. I declined and am returning the unit and my carpet that I was trying to clean is now worse than it was because of the huge water ring.
