review/summary: I'm glad you askedreview/text: I have had several juice extractors. The last one was a Juice Man Jr which is still working after 4 years of hard use. This Hamilton Beach Big Mouth was poorly designed to begin with. I can't imagine that management allowed it to be produced. Management is not doing there job in my opinion. There is an air vent in the cover of the disposal attachment where all the little bits and pieces are discarded. The vent blows these little bits and piece all over the kitchen counter and floor. The clean up takes longer than the juicing does. The machine does have a lot of power and it does the job. However, having to clean my kitchen every time I use this machine is a big negative.
