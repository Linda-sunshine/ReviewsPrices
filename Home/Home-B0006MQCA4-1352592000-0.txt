review/summary: We use this everydayreview/text: This is a great product that we've been using for over a year and a half now. It's slim design fits into the fridge during the summer without taking up too much space and in the winter, it sits on our kitchen counter. I think it holds 8-10 tall glasses of water at full capacity. I was a little afraid the tap part would break, but so far, so good.
