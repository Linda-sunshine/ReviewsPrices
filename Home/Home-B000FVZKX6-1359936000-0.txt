review/summary: Extremely soft, come out of the dryer with minimal wrinklesreview/text: These sheets are the best I've found in years. Both my husband and I love them. They are soft and inviting to crawl into. They are almost wrinkle free and fit our deep pocket mattress well and stay on the bed. These are keeper sheets. They will be around for a long time. After washing them several times I was still so thrilled with them that we purchased two more sets. One set for the guest bed and the other as a spare.
