review/summary: Fantastic tea mugreview/text: This is simply a fantastic tea mug. I purchased a pair of them several years ago and have not regretted my purchase. During the winter months I frequently brew up a mug of tea to carry with me on my way to work. Prior to purchasing these mugs my tea would often go cold by the time I got around to drinking it.The strainer screws in securely into the base and the insulated lid screws into that strainer. It holds a teaspoon full of tea quite easily, even after it expands from the hot water. I typically pour hot water directly over the leaves in the strainer and then secure the lid. After several minutes of brewing I remove the strainer and then screw in the sipping lid. The insulated lid then secures into the sipping lid to create a water and air tight seal. Using this method for brewing my tea remains at a very high temperature for an exceeding amount of time. I've had my tea remain hot for well over an hour.The mug is very durable as well, I've dropped mine several times without damaging the mug or even spilling a drop when the lid was screwed in securely.I'd definitely recommend this tea mug to any tea drinker who likes to had a cup of tea as they travel.
