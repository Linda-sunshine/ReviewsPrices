review/summary: Makes one wonder what is paradise?review/text: This book is great for adults and youth. It really takes just a night to read...at least...I couldn't put it down, but a lifetime to ponder. Whenever people talk about what "paradise" or the afterlife looks like they speak of perfection, but what does that really look like? This book gives an eerie picture that sticks.Lowry walks his audience through the life one boy, who is chosen to learn the secrets of a life his ancestors, chose to leave behind. At first, the world sounded like a place I wish I could live in--children were always provided for, everyone gets along and does their duty or...(this is where Lowry does the psychological shift)...is disposed of. Then the reader is left to ponder how a world so beautiful could be tainted by ritual murders of infants, teens, and adults alike. Then the expos&eacute; begins to occur. There is also no love-making, love, or joy because those come with pain and sorrow which the society was created to destroy.In the end, the reader is left wondering whether one should try to escape such a perfect world or try to fit in to avoid the tragic ending...or was it tragic? It is left up to the reader to decide. Which is more tragic--life where sin exists but also joy or life without either?Which would you choose?
