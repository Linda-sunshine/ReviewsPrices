review/summary: Sleep Studio 2-Inch ViscO2 Mattress Topper, Fullreview/text: Length:: 0:47 MinsVideo in about unpacking and whether it has memory or not.-Arrived on time, great price, well worth it.-Smelled like mint chocolate chip ice cream when I unboxed it, but the odor went away in 1 week, i didn't even air it out.-Current Mattress is Firm.-Topper Soft / slightly firm mix between the two, Has memory capability for about 1-2 Seconds.-Did an amazing job putting me to sleep, I used to have body pains and shoulder issues, most of it has gone away with this topper.-This is my first mattress topper, so i don't really have anything to compare it to.-All i know is I sleep better, I sleep longer, I don't wake up 20 times during the night, I love it.Con:-Slides a bit on my bed, but nothing i cant adjust.-Curious how long it will last, even though it seems durable.
