review/summary: Clicking. Sometimes the buttons lock upreview/text: I have had the Panasonic for about 15 loaves of bread. I received it about a year ago. I know that I only make a loaf of bread on average per month, but I thought I'd better write a review.There is a pretty loud clicking noise that occurs before the bread machine kneeds the dough (about 4-5 times for a few seconds). Doesn't last long, but is annoying if anyone is asleep or stopping buy for a visit. Also, the kneeding makes more noise depending on the ingredients of the bread. A thicker dough= louder kneeding.The buttons have locked up on me a few times and nowhere in the manual does it state this problem. The manual says "Don't press start" (because if you do and find out you made a mistake there isn't a reset button). I tried unplugging for 10-15 minutes and it didn't do anything. I called customer service who said "you need to hold down the start stop button for 3-5 seconds." Why not list that in the manual for self-help?A lot of others stated that measurements have to be precise. It's really hard to mess up a loaf with this machine. I don't measure with a scale or anything. I love the yeast dispenser and bread timer. Due to the clicking noises and noise while kneeding I doubt I'll be buying this particular bread maker again.
