review/summary: Great Can Opener!review/text: Very good product. Has held up well to all the dishwasher cycles I have submitted it to, since I am a bit of a germ freak when it comes to openers that was important to me. It is easy to turn, the other most important quality I look for. The durability seems there, but time will really tell, so far so good. I am a bit frustrated by the locking mechanism, which is all that kept it from getting 5 stars from me, but it is a minor annoyance, and wouldn't prevent me from buying it again.
