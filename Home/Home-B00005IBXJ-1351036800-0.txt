review/summary: Please read this review.review/text: If there is one product I want people to know about it is the Pizzazz. I have purchased 4 of these units over the 11 years I have been using it. Firstly it will cook a Totino's pizza better then any other option available, however, it also will cook or reheat fries, chicken fingers, fish sticks, hot pockets.... pretty much anything that's not more than a few inches thick. All of the units I purchased are still working and the people I purchased them for, love them. This is a very quick set up and easy to clean cooking utensil. I am not kidding! My wife and I have used this almost every day for 11 years. This is the prefect utensil for a dorm room or apartment. Get it!
