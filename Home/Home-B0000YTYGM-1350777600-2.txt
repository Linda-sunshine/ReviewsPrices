review/summary: Nice coffee makerreview/text: It took some experimentation to get the strength right but since then it has worked great. Best thing is there is no heating element to cut off and the coffee stays hot a long time. Just poured out yesterday's coffee it was actually still warm enough to drink. Fits under the cabinet with about 2 inches to spare so you have to pull it out from under the cabinet to load it up. Then push it back for operation. Manual has a misprint about how much coffee to use. Says use 2 tablespoons per cup but should be one. However I use about 9 or ten as I like it striong. Same as my previous coffee maker.So far no problem with leakage at all. Very well made product it seems.
