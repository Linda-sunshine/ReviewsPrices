review/summary: Electric Wine Openerreview/text: Arthritis and tendonitis have made it difficult to open wine bottles. Rather than give up wine, I sought an easier way and this device is it, capital I. Maintains 'oomph' throughout 15 bottles without re-charge; extracts cork smoothly and without strain. Took me a couple of tries to get the right'feel'--center it on the bottle opening, press and hold the switch down. Let it work--it will stop when cork is fully withdrawn. Do not force, twist or rock. Just let it do its thing. Excellent product, well worth the price.
