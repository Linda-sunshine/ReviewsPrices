review/summary: Great!review/text: I bought this for the week following my son's surgery removing his tonsils and adenoids. We had people coming to the house to check on our little Frog (my son's nickname) and received many compliments on the cuteness of his frog humidifier. I loved that I could fill it up in the mornings and it would run all day. Then we filled it again at bedtime and it ran all night. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because my husband hated how the water cap was under the tank. When we go to refill it, we had to carry a towel because it made a mess.
