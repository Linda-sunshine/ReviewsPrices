review/summary: Took a while to get used to.review/text: When I first got this chair, I was fairly upset with the purchase. First off, assembly is an awful procedure... Instructions were extremely vague, and it took me about an hour to put together, and once I was done, realized I had a piece on backwards too.... 1/5 stars for ease of assembly...As far as the chair itself goes, I really didn't like it at first, but as time went on, and I adjusted the variety of seat settings to my liking, I have really come to like this chair. It's definitely more of a "working" chair rather than a lounge chair, but once you find the proper adjustments, it's quite comfortable. My only major gripe with the chair is the armrests, which are a bit wobbly, and also very hard material that hurts my forearms from extended use. I pad it with some extra towels though, and it's dine. Overall, not an amazing chair, but I've come to enjoy it.P.S. I use this chair 10+ hours a day.
