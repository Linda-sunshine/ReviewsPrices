review/summary: Pre-Chop for your Chopperreview/text: You read that right. If I do not pre-chop carrots to 1/2&#34; thickness, the blades don't seem to be able to handle the chopping. What ends up happening is the carrots get stuck in the blades, the chopper turns, but it doesn't do anything beside turning. So I pre-chop the carrots for the chopper. Kind of defeats the purpose, but it is still easier than having to shred them by hand.
