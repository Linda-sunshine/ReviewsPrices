review/summary: Very powerful! Very useful for bare floor!review/text: I love this Eureka 3670G Mighty Mite Canister Vacuum so much. It helped me sweep my laminate floor and tile floor really fast. I can use its brush with a long handle to clean my window screens. It sweeps the dust, hair, and even the small trash in the small corners in the closet, under the bed, table... very fast. I don't have to chase after the dirt when using the broom. This is really a fabulous product with a cheap price. I am going to buy one more for my relative today. This is my first time in my life to write a review. I am really satisfied with this product. It works well and saves my time.
