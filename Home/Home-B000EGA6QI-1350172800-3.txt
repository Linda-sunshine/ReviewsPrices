review/summary: Cuisinart SmartStick: Still going strong...review/text: Have owned thisCuisinart CSB-76BC SmartStick 200-Watt Immersion Hand Blenderin brushed chrome for nearly two years now, and it still surprises me how well it functions on a regular basis. It's a lot easier than using my oldegg beater, as one might guess, yet it takes up little more total space in the drawer than that old kitchen tool.This was bought as a replacement for my old Krups hand unit that was similar, but this Cuisinart SmartStick is more powerful, and has real 'pulling power' in comparison to my old Krups unit. This Cuisinart model has never had the smell of burning electronics they way that my old Krups did, nor has it ever become hot in my hand.I've made a wide variety of things with this handy gadget, from using it for whipped potatoes, simple smoothies, and chopping nuts, to grinding coffee in a pinch, and making cheesecake from scratch. My attempt at making peanut butter was a total disaster, but for that I truthfully cannot blame the unit, only my own ineptitude. Hopefully that will go better next time.It should be noted that if you go to the main product page here, right there under Product Details there is a small link that says View the Product Manual [PDF]. This is a good idea for owners and potential purchasers alike. This manual has not only instructions, but there are some excellent recipes there, and I've tried some and customized them to personal taste as well.Found that it was a good idea to use a little WD-40 in the shaft as a preventative measure, as it will keep the blender operating smoothly, but don't overdo it; a couple of drops does the trick. Also be sure to never, ever try to clear the blades with the unit plugged in, and take care as the blades will cut your fingers quite easily.If this one ever goes, I might consider stepping up to the theCuisinart CSB-77 Smart Stick Hand Blender with Whisk and Chopper Attachments, as the accessories that are included with that model would make it more useful. I've used this model once, and the extras make it worthy of consideration.Whichever way that you go or which color you pick, these Cuisinart SmartStick hand blenders can be great kitchen tools, but be sure to RTFM... read the manual first!10/14/2012
