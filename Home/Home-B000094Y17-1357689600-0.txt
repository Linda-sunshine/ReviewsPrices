review/summary: Big help, awkward to holdreview/text: This Pitcher was a wedding gift and we love it! Always great tasting water and the indicator/filter works well to let us know when its time to change. We have had it for 2 years and appreciate the luxury of having filtered water instead of the calcium-ridden cholorine tasting garbage where we live.Downside to this pitcher; when it is full and you are trying to poor one-handed it is VERY awkward and heavy to hold. I'm usually holding my daughter or trying to do other multi-tasking and am trying to make a bottle or poor a glass of water at the same time; it puts strain on my wrist that I know if we had one of the taller/thinner Brita systems; it would probably eliminate that pain. Our solution is to keep a smaller vessel filled with the filtered water and keep them both in the fridge. All in all; WAY cheaper than getting a big bulky 5 gallon back breaker delievered every couple weeks.
