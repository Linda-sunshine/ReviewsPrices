review/summary: Perfectly shaped cookies all the time!review/text: I have broken two other cookie scoops and bought one last July that looked durable only to find that it gets stuck once in a while, especially when the cookie dough is still chilly from the ref. Then I found this! I love it! It doesn't clog and springs back easily. The grip also feels firm and very durable. Saves me a lot of time when baking cookies. Winner!
