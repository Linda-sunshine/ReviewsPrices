4.0
review/summary: Accurate and looks great.review/text: Rating would be 5 stars except for the fact that the instructions didn't explain how to identify a weak battery versus a defective scale. After weeks of thinking I had to replace the scale it turned out to be a weak original battery that went bad prematurly.I ordered this scale due to a high rating in Consuler Reports. It's pricy but acurrate and looks really nice in my extra room.
