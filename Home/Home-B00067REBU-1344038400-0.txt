review/summary: Easily Makes Delicious Breadreview/text: This breadmaker is a great addition to the kitchen. It makes great bread, and if the power goes out for a second and comes back on, like happens frequently in thunderstorms, or if you unplug the cord by mistake, the machine resumes from where it was interrupted. The bread does not fall (unless you use too much yeast or too little salt), and after the bread is finished cooking, the machine will keep it hot for up to 1 hour, although Sunbeam recommends taking the bread out sooner than that. Unfortunately, the labels on the front of the breadmaker rub completely off after about 2 years.Our breadmaker's gears started grinding after a few years (about 800 loaves); this was probably due to old age. Also, the mixing paddle rubbed on the bottom of the pan, taking off a circle of non-stick coating. We got a new breadmaker (the same kind) that hasn't showed signs of either of those problems after a year, but it still has bad labels.The mixing paddle comes out of the pan inside the cooked bread; to get it out of the bread, use the hook that comes with the machine. Stick the hook into the paddle's hole, and then pull it out. Clean the paddle, and put it back inside the pan. If you don't clean it, it can get stuck in place. It will still work just fine, but it won't come out of the pan again. If you don't want to go to the trouble of pulling a hot paddle out of your bread, you CAN take it out of the pan about an hour and a half before the bake cycle.Here are the settings, along with a few notes:1. Basic (3:00)2. French (3:50) -Kneads bread more than Basic.3. Whole Wheat (3:40)4. Quick (1:40) -Meant for yeast-free recipes, but can work with regular ones.5. Sweet (2:55) -Reduces browning of bread.6. Express Bake 1.5-lb. (0:58) -Makes a loaf of bread in very little time.7. Express Bake 2.0-lb. (0:58) -Same as above.8. Dough (1:30)9. Jam (1:20)10. Cake (2:50)11. Sandwich (3:00)12. Bake (1:00) -There is no selection for loaf weight or color.
