review/summary: Returned itreview/text: Very unhappy with this machine, I returned it. I bought this one because our old one worn out. I only used it 3 times but found the following problems. 1) The circle on top is for yeast, not a window, so you cannot see the bread baking. 2) Most of the recipes in the book call for dry milk (now honestly if I am going to take the time to make my own bread do you think I want to use a processed ingredient?). The only recipe that doesn't call for dry milk is the French bake, but it takes 6 hours to bake 3) If you want to make the larger size bread, the measurements are not normal (ex. For the Basic white bread flour amount you need 3 11/16 cup for the large and 4 and 7/16 for the XL - then then tell you to level off the measuring cup. Who has a 11/16 or a 7/16 measuring cup? Then they suggest that you should weigh the ingredient instead (ex. 1 cup = 4.92 ounces). I'm sorry but even if I did have some type of method to weigh the ingredients, I don't want to be standing in my kitchen using my calculator trying to convert 3 11/16 cups to ounces. 4) They provide a measuring cup for the water but not one for what you really need (the dry ingredients with their crazy measurements). 5) Lastly, after the 3rd time (of me winging it with the measurements), I pulled the pan out of the machine and the bottom smelled like burnt metal. That was it for me, it went back.
