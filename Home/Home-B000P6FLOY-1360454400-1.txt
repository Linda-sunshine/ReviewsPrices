review/summary: Much Worse than Taylor Thermomenterreview/text: I have used digital thermometers in the past and the probe usually fails after a year or two of use (displays LO when plugged in). Since the probe cord is thicker on this unit, my thinking was that it might last longer. Unfortunately, it lasted only 1.5 months. do not waster your money on this product.
