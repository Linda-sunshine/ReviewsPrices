review/summary: Not Waterproofreview/text: I used this thermometer while I was making a batch of beer, and decided to soak it in my sanitizer solution while all my other equipment was being treated. When I pulled the thermometer from the warm solution I noticed that the display was completely wet. There appears to be two layers of plastic that cover the display and water was in between them. The unit still worked, however, was very difficult to read. I was able to dry it out by placing it on top of my furnace register. I will try using it again on my next batch, however, I will not completely immerse it into the water.
