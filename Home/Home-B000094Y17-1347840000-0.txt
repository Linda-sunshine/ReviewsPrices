review/summary: It works, not sure it's the best thoughreview/text: I've owned the green pitcher for about 6 months now. I use it at work in my small office where the city tap water tastes like a pond. The indicator on the top is helpful however I'm guessing it is not very accurate. One would think that the life span of the filter would completely depend on how much water you drink and the quality of the water you are filtering. In my situation, the Brita pitcher seems to do ok for a few weeks however slowly the water starts tasting like a pond again.As far as the physical design, I'm guessing Brita revised it slightly because I haven't noticed any of he problems prior reviewers noted. The tab on the lid that covers the spout floats just fine and never has a problem opening with the pressure of the water flowing out of it and gravity closes it back up again every time. The lid does leak a little if you are pouring it before it has all filtered to the bottom. I just put two fingers on the top when I'm pouring it and that does the trick. Either that or I pour my glass before I full the top back up. Big deal though... how lazy are we?As a whole though, I'm not super impressed with it. A girl in my office uses the PUR pitcher and I have tried her water a few times and it tastes a little cleaner and removes every trace of the pond flavor from the city tap. Whenever I run out of my Brita filters (bought a 5 pack) I'll probably buy the PUR pitcher. The Brita works fine but the ultimate goal is clean water. Semantics aside, I liked the flavor of the PUR water better. The PUR pitcher looks and feels cheaper, but the water tastes better which is the entire purpose of the device to begin with.
