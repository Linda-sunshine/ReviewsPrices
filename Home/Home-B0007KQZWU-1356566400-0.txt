review/summary: Couldn't be happierreview/text: I purchased these a little less two months ago and wanted to give myself a little time with them before putting up a review.We were switching from T-Fal non-stick pans, which were in terrible condition. While I had used stainless steel pans here and there before, I had predominantly cooked on non-stick my whole life. I read-up on reviews and such, initially only wanting to spend about 150 to 175 for a set. However, after reading about the differences in quality we decided to step up our budget a little bit so we could get something of better quality that would last longer.I can tell you it was worth the extra money for us. We've cooked on these almost everyday since buying them and these pans are such great quality and a pleasure to cook with. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a good quality set of stainless steel pans that are not in the ultra-expensive price range.Something to be aware of are that these are not non-stick pans and sometimes things will stick. Also, I read many of the reviews on here and I'm happy to report that I haven't had any of the quality issues mentioned on here. Oh and barkeepers friend is a must if you want to keep these shiny and spotless.
