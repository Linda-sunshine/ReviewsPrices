review/summary: THIS COFFEE GRINDER WORKS GREAT FOR MEreview/text: this being my first coffee grinder I've ever bought I'm impressed with the way it grinds coffee beans it does it very well. if you grind the beans very fine some of the coffee will stick to the sides but no big deal to me, wished it would have came with a scrapper or brush to clean the sides but again no big deal. I'm happy with the way it works, looking forward to see how it works grinding up spices. I think it was worth the money and I would buy this grinder again.
