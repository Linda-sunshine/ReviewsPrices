review/summary: Amazedreview/text: When I first received this heater I thought I would be returning it because it is not a large heater and I thought it would be just an ankle warmer, but I soon found out it really works great! I use it in my bedroom (with the door closed) which is 15' by 15' and I can't believe how warm it gets in there! I am very pleasantly surprised and happy with this purchase. I am seriously thinking about buying one for my bathroom.
