review/summary: Great for the price!review/text: I will start out by saying that one can always buy something better if one is willing to spend the money. Overall, however, I am generally pleased with this purchase considering the overall value of the item.This cleaner is missing a few features I would have appreciated; you can't adjust the height of the base for carpet vs. hard flooring, for example. This makes it somewhat difficult to vacuum hard floors at times. Generally, however, I am pleased with the performance and utility of the cleaner. The on-board tools have come in handy and I am still genuinely surprised that not all vacuums need to utilize actual bags to perform.
