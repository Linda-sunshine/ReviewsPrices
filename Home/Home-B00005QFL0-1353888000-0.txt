review/summary: Just how noisy should this be??review/text: Length:: 0:34 MinsI've never owned a bread machine before, and as far as I can remember, I've also never been around when someone else was using one - at least not during the kneading process.My Panasonic was delivered on Saturday, and tonight is the first chance I've had to make bread in it. I wanted to make sure I would be both home, and awake, for the first loaf so I could observe the process. I will say that right this minute, nothing could induce me to let this thing run while I was asleep or not home. I'll need some reassurance from other owners of this same bread machine first. So many of the reviews brag about how quiet this machine is... mine is so loud it scared my cats - one won't come out from under the coffee table, the other won't come down the stairs.I originally made the video (on my cell phone, so I apologize for the quality) just so I could show my husband how noisy it is when he gets home.It's going to be a few more hours before the bread is finished and I can comment on the quality of it. I will update this review as I have more information. Mostly, I wanted to get the video up here so that hopefully, other owners might be able to comment as to whether this is a normal level of noise... or if I should be sending this back for a replacement.
