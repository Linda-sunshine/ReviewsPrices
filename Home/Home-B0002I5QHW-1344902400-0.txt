review/summary: Sturdy for home usereview/text: This is a good grinder for making small batches of ground meat. My attempt at making pasta was successful. The hardware seems sturdy enough. The base is attached to a smooth work surface through suction. Remember to cut the meat into slices. Be careful if you want to use your finger to push the meat slices into the grinder because you may get hurt. Cleaning is okay, not that big of a hassle. Only problem is I have gotten lazy and have been buying ground meat instead of making my own.
