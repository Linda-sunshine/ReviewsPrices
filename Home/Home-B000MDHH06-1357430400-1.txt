review/summary: Great Beginner/Budget Juicer (Pros and Cons)review/text: I just received this juicer a few days ago and figured I would write a review of the pros and consPros:*easy to set up*smooth juice with little to no produce chunks*doesn't turn on unless set up properly*easy clean up*easy to take apart/reassembleCons:*pulp is still quite wet even after being refed through the juicer twice (wasted juice)So far, I like this juicer a lot. I do wish it would get more juice out of everything, but for the price, I can't complain too much. So far I have juiced beets, greens, carrots, asian pears, limes, cucumbers and apples without any problems other than the wet pulp. I highly recommend this juicer for anyone on a budget or anyone looking for a beginning juicer. If you are serious about juicing, however, and price isn't a big deal, I would pay more for a juicer that gets more juice out of things.
