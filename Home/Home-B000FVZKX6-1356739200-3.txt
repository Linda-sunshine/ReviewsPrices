review/summary: A successful giftreview/text: I bought these as a gift for my husband. He hates climbing into a cold bed. I was resistant to flannel sheets because I had memories of not being able to turn over very well in them during the night, but I decided to get these for him for Christmas. He LOVES them! They are soft and comfortable and when we climb in bed we aren't freezing. I as pretty sure he would like them but was pleasantly surprised to discover how much I enjoy them too. And they don't impede me from turning over during the night.
