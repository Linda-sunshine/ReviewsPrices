review/summary: Very small pillow cases!review/text: I was very excited to get these sheets , after waiting a few months, as they were "out of stock"for a while.The quality of the sheets is very good, but ... A BIG MISS WITH THE PILLOW CASE SIZE !!!Even on cheaper flannel sheet sets you get Queen size pillow cases!!These ware so small, that even after the first wash they are only a standard size!Very disappointed!!
