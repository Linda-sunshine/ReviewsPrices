review/summary: Love it!review/text: It is the perfect size if you live in an apartment and if you need to quickly chop up an onion while cooking or any other vegetable. I hate cutting vegetables when I am cooking and this food processor chops so nicely and makes my cooking more efficient! Definitely recommend it!
