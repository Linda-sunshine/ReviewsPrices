review/summary: Great buy!review/text: I got the skillet for my wife who has just gotten into some serious cooking ventures. She absolutely loves this thing. The first time she used it, it was to sear a couple of NY Strip steaks...Excellent. She has used it for everything from steak, to grilled cheese, to veggies. Not a single thing sticks.
