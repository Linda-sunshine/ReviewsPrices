review/summary: Sturdy, well made, cotton mattress pad!review/text: I bought this to cover our memory foam mattress, as a replacement for a 100% cotton cover. It's surprisingly cool and i love the cover. It was much nicer than I expected for the price (I paid a lot of money for our old cover and this one was actually surprisingly nicer...). I washed it before using it, and if you put it in the dryer on the lowest setting (I was very careful after reading so many negative reviews regarding washing & drying!) -- I had absolutely NO problems with any melting or warping like the reviews mentioned, and it came out nice and fluffy. It fits our deep memory foam mattress very easily (it's a Queen). I am very happy with my purchase and wouldn't hesitate to order another one again in the future for the guest bed!
