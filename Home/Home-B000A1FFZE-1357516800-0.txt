review/summary: Works greatreview/text: I recommend this toaster for families like mine where I like a toaster oven and my husband likes a pop up! It satisfies both in one appliance. It's attractive on the counter, and the pop up slot is roomy. I use homemade bread for toast and I find that the smaller slices don't always stay straight so it browns unevenly, but it's not bad. The oven is small but adequate for what I need. I don't like that there is no bottom tray to open and clean out crumbs. It's a little harder to clean than most toasters, but overall I'm very happy with it.
