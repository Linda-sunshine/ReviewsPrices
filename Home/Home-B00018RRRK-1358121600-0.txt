review/summary: you can keep this one.review/text: The Cuisinart DBM-8 has all the bells and whistles, and it will grind exactly as much coffee as you want, exactly the way you want it...However, after three weeks of use and trying 21 different ways to get the ground coffee out of the incredibly static plagued plastic hopper without getting ground coffee all over the kitchen (and yes that includes slowly and carefully using a brush), it has resisted every effort to do so. As a matter of fact, I have yet to figure out how to get the lid off the hopper without spilling the ground coffee that sticks to it, and have to do so in the sink so clean-up is minimal.
