review/summary: Does the job - a little cheapo and not great engineering.review/text: I got bleary-eyed researching all the coffee maker options out there. My primary requirements were 1). Programmable and 2). Thermal Caraffe. I learned that for some reason most of the cool, high tech coffee makers do not come with the programmable feature (not sure why - does an automatic start in the morning somehow reduce quality of coffee or something?). Anyway, here's my quick and dirty analysis of this product:Pros: Makes coffee. Tastes pretty good. Large thermal caraffe does seem to retain heat well. Programmable feature works.Cons: Ugly (in my view). Kind of cheapo materials and construction - thin plastic, etc. I'd like a little more in that department for a hundred bucks (markup must be huge). Digital programming device is straightforward, but a back light would be nice, as it's already hard for me to read due to its small size. While the caraffe does seem to retain temperature well, the top is a little finicky when you screw it down on the caraffe base. Tends to go on crooked if you don't pay attention. A minor thing, but again, for a hundred bucks, it would be nice if it was engineered better. Pouring is a little slow, but I guess that's the tradeoff for heat retention.Overall: Does the job, but seems expensive for what you get.
