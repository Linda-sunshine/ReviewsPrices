review/summary: Very Comfortablereview/text: I did a lot of research before I purchased this product. They use a green tea treatment to remove odor. However, the tea odor is pretty overpowering. Let it sit out and open a few days before use. I bought Queen size and it fits bed perfectly. I am a big guy and put this on a mattress that already had a pad. I wish I had bought a 2 inch instead of 3. Certain &#34;heavier&#34; parts of my body sink further in than other parts. Over all I love it! I may move it to my spare queen bed and order a 2 inch pad for my bed though. Definately worth the money.
