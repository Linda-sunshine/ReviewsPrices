review/summary: Breville Juice Extractorreview/text: I replaced another juicer that I had with this Breville. I love the ease with which it works and cleans. And I love the very large 3&#34; opening through which I feed the fruits and vegetables. It's very efficient and fast. it's so simple to use, I juice with it every day.
