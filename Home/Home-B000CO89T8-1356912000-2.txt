review/summary: Great Price, Keeps My Drink Warmreview/text: This works great. Don't expect it to heat up cold coffee or tea but it will keep a warm drink warm for as long as you keep it on the warmer. Price was spot on, I'm very satisfied. Be careful if you have a ceramic mug with rough bottom, I scratched up the black surface very quickly. Still works fine, just a cosmetic issue. I'd recommend using a mug with a smooth bottom surface.
