review/summary: Great Juice, but too much excess pulp and goop.review/text: I got this juicer to start eating healthy foods and get my daily intake of fruits and veggies. It works. It's awesome viewing the fruit and veggies get murdered in the juicer. My one thing about this juicer is that I wish it didn't create so much pulp and excess veggie and fruit goop. I still get a lot of juice from a few items, but the pulp and excess just seems like a lot to me. Seems like one could get a little more juice out of those parts.
