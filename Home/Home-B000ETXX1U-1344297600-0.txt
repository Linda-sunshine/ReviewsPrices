review/summary: Worth it to upgradereview/text: I was considering getting a relatively cheap air mattress for about $30. Luckily, I didn't. The quality is amazing and it takes under 1 min to inflate. Very easy and works so well. I just don't like the loud noise it makes, but that's nothing compare to the comfort you feel when you're done inflating it. The grip feature was great! Deflating and wrapping it up was just as easy.
