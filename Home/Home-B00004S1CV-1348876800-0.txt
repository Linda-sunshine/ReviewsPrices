review/summary: Great travel bottle for a single cup of tea.review/text: After reading many reviews I went ahead and ordered this bottle. I was slightly nervous about size and the plastic taste mentioned by several other reviewers, but I have to say that I love it and it is perfect for how I am using it. At first I was surprised at the size.. It seemed reaaaally small. But I am brewing a single cup at a time and I like a strong cup of tea. The blend I am using calls for a 20-30 minute steeping time ( no. It is not bitter. ) which is just how long it takes me to get to work n the morning. I pour my water before I leave.. Pack my sipping top in a small snap ware container and put the bottle in my cup holder upside down on my ride. By the time I get to work it is perfect. I unscrew the basket at my desk and put it into the snap ware and it's done. I do need to leave the top off for a little while because this thing stays HOT. I left it closed for close to 3 hours the first day and burned my mouth on the first sip. I have not noticed any plastic tastes or smells... I love how the bottle looks, how it is perfectly cool to the touch, how it does not leak in my purse and how long the tea stays hot. The strainer mesh is a bit large, and if I was commuting on the train or wanted to drink my tea during my drive I would hate how the basket needed to be switched out and an additional top needed to be carried. I use this cup several times a day and I am so happy with it. It might not be for everyone.. Just think about how you plan to use it before you buy Perfect for me!
