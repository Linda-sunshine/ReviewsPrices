review/summary: Great juicerreview/text: I've had juicers all my life and this one is definitely a slower type of a juicer. Took me a little while to get used to it but I like it a lot so far. Easy to clean (trust me. I'm lazy and I have a cleaning lady for a one bedroom loft) and very easy to use. Because of how easy it is to use, I actually have used it more often than I ever thought I would.
