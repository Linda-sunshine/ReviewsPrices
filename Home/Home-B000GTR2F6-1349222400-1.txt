review/summary: Keurig B70 Platinum Brewing System - GOOD PRODUCTreview/text: The jury is still out with me concerning the longevity of the Keurig dispensers. My first Keurig functioned for approximately 20 months. I like the concept of the single cup, and I was satisfied with my first Keurig (while it worked), so I'm trying this more advanced model. First, it was easy to set up, and it made a great cup of coffee. An advantage of this model is its greater selection of 'cup sizes' than my previous model, which lets you make a 12 oz cup if you so desire. Also has a greater water reservoir capacity. Overall, I like this model better, and I hope it lasts longer than my first.
