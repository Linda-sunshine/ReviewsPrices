review/summary: Excellent Dutch Oven, Very Poor Seasoningreview/text: There are many reviews about this Dutch Oven, so I'll cut to the chase. I struggled with the seasoning for about a year. I kept getting peeling, no matter how many times I tried to re-season over the factory seasoning. Whatever they use just doesn't adhere well, and anything put on top if it will peel, too.I finally solved the problem by putting it in the oven on a clean cycle, which removes everything, and seasoning from scratch. For seasoning, follow Lodge's instructions, with a few modifications. I was told to use olive oil, and it worked great. Your oven should be hotter, 500-550F. The oil should be THIN. Wipe on, and wipe it off. Do 3-4 coats for an hour or more each. It will smoke and smell awful. It will take 4-5 hours. But when you're done, the seasoning will be bulletproof.The only other complaint is how rough the casting is. Before doing the clean cycle, I took a random orbital sander to the inside. I didn't sand it all the way down to smooth, but it's a lot better. I recommend it.Now that it's smoother and has a good finish, it's terrific. If it came like this, I'd easily give it 5 stars. Since I had to do so much work to make it usable, it gets 4.
