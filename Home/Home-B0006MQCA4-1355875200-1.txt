review/summary: Worth the money.review/text: This unit sees a lot of use. It sits on my kitchen counter and gets filled and emptied about 1.5 times a day making tea, coffee and getting tapped for cooking. We've been using the original filter for about three months now, and while we do have a spare filter waiting in the wings, I'm disinclined to install it because the original is still flowing well and doing a good job removing the objectionables (heavy chlorine, slight sulfur odors in our case).I'm not sure I'd recommend this for kids unless you can count on them to respect it- the spigot isn't as robust as I'd like it to be, and I do expect it to eventually fail. If it does, I'll install a nice little copper fixture as a replacement- but not everyone will have the time, ability, or inclination for that.
