review/summary: Handy dandy food processorreview/text: This product was recommended on the Good Housekeeping list as No. 1 in food processors. I've used it twice for making soups and it's very easy to operate. My daughter has used it for a variety of purposes and she's been impressed with its ease and durability. I've had other processors where the food shoots out everywhere and creates a mess. The Cuisinart does not, thank goodness. I've cleaned all the parts in the dishwasher and everything came out clean and ready to use again. So far, so good.
