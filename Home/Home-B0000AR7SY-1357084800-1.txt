review/summary: About what I would expect from a sub $100 Burr Grinderreview/text: Pros- Seems very well made, even though it uses a lot of plastic (what doesn't)- Grinds great, they state the burrs are commercial grade and they seem to be well made.Cons- The grounds container is plastic and static causes the grounds to cling everywhere, kind of annoying.- I have to tap on the machine several times to get all the grounds out, not a big deal for me- To adjust the grind setting you turn the hopper, there is a lot of play when you change direction, so your grind setting won't be exact if changed or you remove the hopper. This clunky to me.This machine grinds how I would expect, for the price I can deal with the grind setting and static cling. If you can't I would consider the higher dollar alternatives, like the breville.
