review/summary: good quality for the price and sizereview/text: In purchasing a mattress topper, I was concerned about both cost and size. As a student at a university far from home, I must pack up all of my possessions at the end of each year. This pad compresses nicely, to almost the same size as it came in the package. With a high quality vacuum bag, it can compress even smaller. With the low quality dollar store bags I have, however, the bag just rips, so I've taken to squishing it down and binding it with several bungee cords.As far as performance, I've found it so satisfactory that I have purchased two of them. I originally had a Twin XL for an extremely uncomfortable dorm bed, and it decidedly improved my sleep quality. When I moved to a full size bed I bought a new one to fit.Several reviewers complained of smell, but I did not have a problem with that. I am very sensitive to chemical odors, and I thought it was a bit strong-smelling immediately after removing it from the packaging, but after letting it breathe for 24 hours it was just fine. If I stick my nose into it, it still smells somewhat, but why would I do that? Through the sheets I don't notice it at all. (This applies to both of the pads I have purchased.)
