review/summary: Great Device For The Pricereview/text: I have to say this device is awesome and has become my go to tool. It has been great for pureeing soups, making whipped cream and making a really quick smoothie or mixed drink. It's a breeze to use, very powerful and I love that the blending part can snap off easily and go straight in the dishwasher along with the beaker. For the price, it's a great deal even if it only lasts a year.
