review/summary: Love this Juicer.review/text: I have been looking for a juicer for a while that was easy to clean and does not take up too much kitchen space. This juicer does all that and more. It is compact and can juice most everything that you can juice. I love the juice collector container because it is spill proof and I can store the excess juice in it. While using this appliance it can sound like a miter saw (not chain saw) but I have never heard of a silent juicer. This juicer is powerful and it takes less than 3 minutes to fill the collector container with juice. The ease of cleaning, storage and quality of juice outweighs the noise. I would highly recommend this juicer. I got it for christmas for $79.99. Love it!
