review/summary: Disappointed in Hooverreview/text: I was extremely disappointed int this Hoover Carpet Cleaner. It was awkward to handleand after washing the carpets several times with this machine they carpets still did notlook clean. It very difficult to clean front portion of the carpet cleaner where the cleanserand water get sucked back into the vacuum. I can't get it completely clean and I am notusing it any longer. I usualy like Hoover's products but not this one.
