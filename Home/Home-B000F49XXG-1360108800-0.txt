review/summary: Great except for the frothing wandreview/text: I love this little machine for the price and for the amazing espresso it puts out. But right from the start, I worried about that dumb little frother. I used the machine 2 to 3 times per day for the last 6 weeks. One month ago, it was spraying steam and hot water out the top part of the plastic frothing unit. I clean it every time I use it and I'm diligent about running it to remove water from the line before steaming milk. But that problem got worse and one week ago, began spraying milk all over my kitchen. It was funny for the first 2.6 seconds, then it was just annoying and the problem would no go away after taking all steps to clean, tighten, loosen, etc. So, it's back to the store now and I'm looking for a better frothing system to match the decent espresso maker they've got here.
