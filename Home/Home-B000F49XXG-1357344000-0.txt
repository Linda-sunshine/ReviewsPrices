review/summary: Nice little espresso machinereview/text: I'll give this a five star rating but I almost left four when my espresso maker arrived in a wet plastic bag. Does the company test them before shipping them or was this a return? I am thinking they test them first so I used it anyways. It is a process to make the cappuccino. But the frother works great. I still need to perfect using the frother. I have tried to make my cappuccino taste like the coffee shop's, but it isn't near there yet. I have a typical blade grinder for my beans, and yes I know to get a higher quality burr grinder but I have to use this for now. I don't know what they have or do but I find I may never duplicate the flavor of the coffee shop. It's a shame. BUT, the built in tamper works just fine, I think it does the job. The machine is small and compact so there's extra room for cups and stuff on the counter next to it. The colors are nice. Black and silver. It doesn't vibrate too hard while brewing, the cup stays in place. The water pitcher is easy to remove but it can be filled just left in too. The instructions are easy to read, and once you get the hang of it a couple times you won't need them anymore. I'm glad I bought this because I get a strong brew something I could never get with my previous machine (Keurig) and that's because I love cappuccino's! A little thing I do is make my froth BEFORE I make my cappuccino coffee, I think it gives the coffee better flavor. fineartamerica.com/profiles/martha-galan.html
