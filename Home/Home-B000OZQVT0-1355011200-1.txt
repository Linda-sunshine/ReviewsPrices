review/summary: terrible odorreview/text: Bought a Real Flame gel case and after using it twice (3 cans each time) in the ventless fireplace, I must say that the "initial" smell that the manufacturer claims that goes away,.. it does not. I think it smells horrible -- a chemical, acrid odor -- not even like wood burning at all , and definitely not odorless. I'll be trying Sungel and other brands before giving up on the ventless fireplace, but this product is definitely not odorless at all.
