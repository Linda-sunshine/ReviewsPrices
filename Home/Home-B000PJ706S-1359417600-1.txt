review/summary: Good for the eyes, not for the nose; tastebuds OKreview/text: Buyer's remorse: I regret I must count myself among the legions of reviewers that report a pretty distinct odor coming from this kettle. The unit works very well and looks very nice, but it undeniably does smell a bit strange. I think the odor is like that from silicone caulking that hasn't dried yet - which would make sense given the silicone seal this thing uses between the glass and the heating element. I am hoping the silicone will cure fully over time and stop smelling. Meanwhile my kids refuse to drink things made from this kettle but it can't taste that bad because if I sneakily make drinks with the kettle water and don't tell them then they drink without complaint (kids!). We have exceptionally soft water here, kettles basically never scale up, maybe that doesn't help the problem?If you are in a store and can verify you are getting an odorless sample of this kettle, then I'd recommend it. I've only had mince a couple of weeks, but no sign of odor abatement yet.I like colored lighting and was excited to read that this unit has a blue LED running when it's heating. Forget it. It's a tiny little light recessed deep into the on/off switch, no light show like the lovely Nespresso Pixie that sits next to it ...
