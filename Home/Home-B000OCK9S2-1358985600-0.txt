review/summary: Horrible and frustrating!review/text: After about two months of use, the plug that goes into the machine became loose. I can not turn it on unless the plug is in a very particular spot, which is often impossible to find. I stand over it and twist and turn the plug and most often I get NOTHING! So frustrating. I own the Conair Sound Therapy that does not have a clock radio. It has worked nightly for my daughter for 5 years. Buy that one instead! Save yourself the headache. When it did work, radio reception was iffy and the alarm clock display too bright.
