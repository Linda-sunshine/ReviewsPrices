review/summary: Great clock radioreview/text: I chose this alarm clock because of the dual alarms. It works just as it says it should. The radio actually has good reception. The alarm is different than the traditional alarm clock sound, it has a quiet beeping sound that gradually gets louder and faster. You can also use the radio as an alarm. There are three choices for how bright the alarm clock gets so it's nice for someone that is light sensitive.
