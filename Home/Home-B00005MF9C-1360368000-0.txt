review/summary: Eco option for the solo coffee drinkerreview/text: I'm the only coffee drink in my household and I don't like using coffee filters due to waste (yes, I know it can be composted, but still it takes forever to break down) and I love this maker.I've never had a problem getting a nice cup of coffee. My only warning is that if you have ground coffee with larger-than-average grounds, it can jam the maker and you'll have grounds in your coffee. I only experienced this with one type of coffee, I switched, and never had the problem again.
