review/summary: Practicalreview/text: This pressure cooker is the first one I use it personally. But when I compare it to the ones that my mum was using, it is more practical and works good. It saves you time. However, the pressure button can stick and it loses air. You should shake it when it is getting up so that it fits to its place and doesn't lose air.
