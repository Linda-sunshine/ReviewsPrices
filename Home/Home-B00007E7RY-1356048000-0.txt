review/summary: HP in St Augustinereview/text: Run this every night in my bedroom and no longer have stuffed up nose at night. It really does the job. I constantly sneezed and coughed in my den but if I run this for a half hour or less the symptoms disappear. Great product with inexpensive filters.
