review/summary: veggie noodles!review/text: I&#8217;ve been low carbing it for a while and I found a zucchini noodle pesto recipe I wanted to try&#8230;The blogger used this tool and had a link to it on Amazon and I thought it looked super cool. I bought it and so far it works as designed! If the zucchini isn&#8217;t perfectly straight it can get off center and make some shorter noodles, but no biggie. I&#8217;ve only used it twice, and only on zucchini, but it makes twirly noodles that are more fun to eat than just strips of zucchini (which I&#8217;ve done in the past&#8230;and didn&#8217;t like it too much). My husband even ate the zucchini noodles!The blades are really sharp so it seems like it&#8217;d work on harder produce too&#8230;so far so good!
