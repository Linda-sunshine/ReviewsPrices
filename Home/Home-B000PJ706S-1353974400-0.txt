review/summary: I have mine for several yearsreview/text: I never noticed any weird taste of smell, and I'm usually pretty sensitive to that kind of thing. My main complaint is that because our water is hard, it was impossible to keep it looking clean without regularly cleaning it with vinegar, which I wasn't interested in doing. My mother-in-law has the same brand (that we bought her) and hers looks great is holding up well, being at least a year old.I had mine for two years, at least, which seems pretty reasonable considering the amount I used it. After nearly a year of multiple daily use, the glue on the handle started to soften and the handle began to very slowly pull away from the side. It was still functional and still felt sturdy enough to trust with pouring hot water, so I continued to use it for almost another year. Eventually, the metallic coating on the lid started to flake off. Eventually, the plastic lid itself fell off. That's when I finally called it quits on that unit and put it in the recycling bin.I have added this model to my Wish List, as well as another brand and model. Whichever one "Santa" brings me, I'm sure I'll be happy with it.
