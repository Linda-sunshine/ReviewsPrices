review/summary: Bought it for a giftreview/text: I bought this for a gift for my son however I have a Breeze which is very compatable. The Dynamite meets all expectations it has great suction and the tools on board is a bonus. I love mine and my son says he loves the way it cleans. No need to purchase an expensive vacuum. I have and Oreck and a Dyson which does not come up to these standards. It is also light weight.
