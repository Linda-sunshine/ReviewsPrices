review/summary: Died after 13 monthsreview/text: When I first bought this platinum Keurig, I was very happy with it. For about 13 months it made a fast cup of delicious coffee. During the middle of the 13th month, it began to get erratic in dispensing the right amount of coffee. By the end of the 13th month it got more erratic until it stopped dispensing coffee at all. I followed all of the cleaning instructions, I used distilled water for making the coffee, and only used keurig cups in the machine. I expected more from a coffee maker that cost as much as this.
