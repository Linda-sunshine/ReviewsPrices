review/summary: Heats up quicklyreview/text: It's light and heats up quickly however, the dial on the side is not marked well and so it's kind of hard to read what setting it's on from the frontal view. You have to go up very close to see it. Maybe using a permanent marker to mark the dial may help as another reviewer has suggested.
