review/summary: good productreview/text: good product. I have had this product for months and it has not disappointed me. The added bottle opener on the back is perfect. I don't have to look around the drawers for one that is barely used. The idea of a push button on the top helps to dislodge the cutting tool for easy cleaning. Very good product
