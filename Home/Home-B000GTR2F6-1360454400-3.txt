review/summary: Really cool single serve brewer!review/text: We've been thinking about getting one of these for a while now, but our old trusty Bunn Coffee maker just wouldn't die. Finally, the Bunn started leaking water and we decided to give this a try. We still drink coffee, but are starting to branch out into other drinks also. Really kinda glad the Bunn finally died, cause this thing is amazing!Very easy to use and the variety of different coffee's and other drinks seems endless. Might be the hardest part of the whole thing just trying to figure out which K-Cups we like the best.We have the timer set to come on in the morning and shut off at night. It is so cool to just quick-brew a cup of coffee, tea, hot chocolate, or whatever, whenever you're in the mood.We got the New Water Filter with ours and it's a nice feature.Can't speak to longevity, but so far, we're lovin the Keurig!
