review/summary: Gotta Have It!review/text: I have this cookie scoop and the smaller one by OXO Good Grips because they work beautifully. Making cookies (especially chocolate chip for this family) is a breeze to plop the dough on the cookie sheet. I like the medium size scoop more for muffins or if I'm in the mood for larger cookies. Dishwasher safe. Lasts forever. What more could you want? I have my friends using these now too.
