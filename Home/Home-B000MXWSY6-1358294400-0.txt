review/summary: I bought 2review/text: I bought 2 of these because I needed a new clock and I am giving the other for a gift. I am so thankful that others wrote their reviews which absolutely influenced me to buy these. I am very impressed with this little bugger I must say !!! So easy to set up, great sound on the radio, easy to read numbers day or night. One tiny flaw though: out of the box when plugged in the time was off by a few minutes. But it is very easy to fix the time and after that I haven't had to touch it. LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SONY !!!
