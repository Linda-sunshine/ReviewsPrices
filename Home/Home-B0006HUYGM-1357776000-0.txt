review/summary: Great!review/text: I have had this for just over a year and a half, and it is still going strong. It picks up sooo much that I have to clean the filter often, but the suction is amazing. I have a small, 1000 sq ft home with just the bedrooms carpeted, plus a few area rugs. This is the only vacuum I own, and my floors are spotless. I use it almost every day and it sucks up so much in crumbs and sand. I keep my house so much cleaner with this little number than I would if I had to haul out a huge upright vac. Every time I think it is dying(as all those crappy battery charged hand vacs have done) I just clean it out and unravel some gunk from the brush roller and it is as good as new. The Dyson Digital Slim used to be my dream vacuum but I'd have to buy 10 of these to add up to the cost and it just isn't necessary.
