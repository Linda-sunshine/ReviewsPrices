review/summary: Needs Engineer to Redesign Drivereview/text: This is lightweight, easy to clean, plenty of power. Perfect for making a quick smoothie or use in a pot.But, there is a weak plastic part that self destructs under normal use. When this part wears down the motor is still good, the blending head is good, but you have a piece of junk. It is not a replaceable part. If you force it into your mix this part strips quickly (months). If you coddle it --it will last only a little bit longer. The part is the friction fit between the drive motor and the blade shaft.
