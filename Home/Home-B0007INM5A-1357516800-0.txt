review/summary: eco pad + amazon = valuereview/text: Recently I purchased the eco pod for my senseo and couldn't be happier. I like most senseo owners are disappointed that the regular pods are hard to find and expensive. This product works great, and though time will tell they seem very durable. I was just ready to give up on this machine when my son visiting from Montana told me he was thinking of getting a coffe maker and asked about my senseo. I wanted to have him use it but didn't want him to have the expense or hassle of finding the pods. If I would of found these reusable pods earlier my son wouldn't of got this machine. Shame on Phillips for all but discontinueing this unit, I truly have not found any one cup coffee brewer that creates a crema like this one. I wish I had more machines and would definitely buy more eco pods....
