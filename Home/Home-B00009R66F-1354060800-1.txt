review/summary: This is EASY!review/text: I bought this on a Lightning deal to do the area rugs in my home and it worked so well and was so easy I did the carpet too. Next is the stairs and dining room chair upholstery! Much easier than I thought it would be to put together and operate. I thought my house was clean until I looked at the dirt and muck in the dirty water bin. Look at the pics that people before me posted - that's what mine looked like even though my rugs and carpets were not visibly dirty. Thanks for the reviews and tips - I used them. Boiling water first is the right thing to do.
