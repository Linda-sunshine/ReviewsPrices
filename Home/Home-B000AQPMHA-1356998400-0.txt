review/summary: a real treat (and a luxury)review/text: My daughter gave me a Keurig B40 Elite Coffee Maker for Christmas. This is a beautiful machine! Very well constructed. Extremely easy to set up. A bonus is a box of sample coffees. Coffee refills can get a bit costly though. What I did was I ordered a package of two refillable filters so I can "load my own" with my usual coffee. That way I'll have a choice of which I want and it'll help my budget a bit when I order coffee packages. Now that I have the filters on the way, I can browse all the varieties that Amazon offers. I'm sure I'll become attached to this nice coffee maker!
