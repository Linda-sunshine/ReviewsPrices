review/summary: lasted 3 monthsreview/text: It is a nice little kettle, looks good, not too heavy, and we never had funny smells; but the kettle burned out after 3 months of use. Also it got a lot of calcification build-up, which for us required cleaning every 2 weeks. We returned this and ended up buying the heavier Breville electric stainless steel kettle and we are very happy with it. I would not recommend buying the Capresso.
