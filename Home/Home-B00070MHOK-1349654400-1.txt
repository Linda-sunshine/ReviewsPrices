review/summary: So mini and so easy to work with~review/text: I bought this for my blouses. It is small and quick, which save a lot of space for me. I just need to put water in it and takes about 1-2 minutes for heating up the water before the steam come out. It work perfect for thin fabric. But it would probably not work for thick fabric. In short, it is cheap and useful for me.
