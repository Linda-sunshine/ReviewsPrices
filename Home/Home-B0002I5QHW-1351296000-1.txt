review/summary: How disappointing!review/text: I bought this grinder to make fresh vegetable relishes. Bad choice! It doesn't grind zuchinni, onions or bell pepper at all. The turning section did not pull the vegetables thru the blade and I couldn't force them thru either. I wouldn't recommend this item to my friends or enemies!
