review/summary: I'll return to my old brandreview/text: After my Capresso died after 3 years of daily use, I decided to purchase the Cuisinart. It was less expensive. The design of the Cuisinart coffee bin makes it difficult to see the amount of beans remaining. The container for the ground coffee is difficult to empty without spilling, and is difficult to re-insert. And this grinder generates a lot more "sludge" than the Capresso.
