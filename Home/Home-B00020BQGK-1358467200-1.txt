review/summary: Lightweight and convenientreview/text: This vacuum is great for the price. I love that its super light and you can pick it up and bring it to any room in a pinch. Its super strong and can get into small spots very well. One flaw i noticed is that because of its lightness, the front part of the vacuum (the part that actually sucks up the dirt) does come up off the floor frequently. I find myself pushing it down with my foot a lot. You also have to make sure that when you stand it up you have it completely upright or it will fall right over. Not a huge problem, just an annoyance. I love that it is bagless, you just have to remember to always empty the chamber so it wont clog. Ive used it several times and have only emptied it once. Overall I would buy this vacuum again.
