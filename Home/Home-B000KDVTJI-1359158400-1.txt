review/summary: Great Productreview/text: I have had my share of coffee makers over the years and not being a coffee drinker, I just thought of it as a waste, but after the last one went to it's reward. It was time for a change. I needed a kettle, that I could turn on in the early hours and walk away from with out fear it would burn the house down and get the water boiling enough either for hot choc, tea or oatmeal. The Aroma electric kettle did just what I needed; has an auto shut off when reaching boiling, water stays hot for quite some time afterwards, pleasant appearance and easy of cleaning when necessary. Made making oatmeal a snap, no more guessing with the microwave...and makes true hot drinks. Never will look at Mr Coffee again!
