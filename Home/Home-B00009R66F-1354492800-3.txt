review/summary: Didn't live up to expectations.review/text: Unfortunately, this was not the product I hoped for. The assembly was more complicated than I anticipated. Small pictures made it difficult for me to interpret the instructions. Larger, clearer pictures would have been a huge help and saved me a lot of trial and error.Once assembled, the unit did not work correctly. No water was going into the lower tank. Could I have made a mistake in the assembly? Sure. But I sure couldn't figure out what I did wrong.I was really looking forward to using this product. Very disappointed.
