review/summary: Fast, reliable kettlereview/text: I have been using the Proctor Silex electric kettle for about three months, and have found it to be amazingly fast at bringing water to a boil. For the price, I can't imagine a better deal. Sure, the cord is short (but do I really want to make a practice of pouring water out of an appliance that is plugged in?) and you have to pour it somewhat slowly, but I'm not about to split hairs; this product works just fine for me.A couple words of advice:I thought I had a lemon when I could not get the unit to work on day one. It turns out that the unit was drawing enough power to trip the Ground Fault Interrupter on the outlets I tried. Once I plugged it into a power strip, it has worked perfectly.For those who have complained of the plastic taste of the water, I had the same experience only one time. I made the mistake of leaving the water in the kettle for 5-10 minutes after boiling, and sure enough, the water tasted bad. If I am not able to use the water as soon as it has been heated, I dump the water out and start over. It only takes about 2-3 minutes to boil it again, so it's not too big an investment.
