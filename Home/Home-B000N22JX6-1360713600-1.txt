review/summary: Very Disappointedreview/text: Not only was the shipping and my receipt of the heater a joke, but had I known that this was the identical heater that Wal-Mart was selling for $35, I most definitely would not have paid Amazon $53.As far as warmth, I almost have to attached myself to it to get warm. I have it under my desk and I have to dang near set on it. I have no idea why there is a &#34;low&#34; option because it does not work. Nor, am I able to use the 60, 65 or 70 degree options - simply won't go there.I have however, been able to warm my feet by keeping them on the electrical cord as it gets rather warm. I would not recommend anyone to leave this running in their absence.Very Disappointed.
