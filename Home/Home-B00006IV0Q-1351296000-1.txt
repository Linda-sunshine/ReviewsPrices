review/summary: Makes decent coffee but is not all stainless steelreview/text: I bought this percolator for my husband and one of the main reasons I did so is because it is advertised as being made from stainless steel. The pot and basket are stainless steel but the socket that the tube fits in to that shoots the hot water up to the basket is NOT. In fact, it is aluminum as is the nut that holds it in place. I did not realize this when purchased as these parts are a silver anodized colored to look like the stainless pot but they have oxidized and turned black in which residue comes off terribly when cleaning. NO, it's not from the coffee, it is oxidation and when you clean the pot with "dip it", it turns a grey color to which a magnet will not stick. Comparing this to an older Farberware brand, it is obvious the parts in question are not stainless steel. We've had this percolator for about 6 months and I'm back to order a new 12 cup Farberware as it still has an all stainless steel interior and we feel that if we are going to develop alzheimers later in life, it's not going to be from drinking aluminum oxide from this pot.
