review/summary: Awesomereview/text: This old fashioned pan is tried and true. I have expensive pans and I have to admit this is my favorite for most cooking. If you want to cook a great steak, chop or any other piece of meat use this pan, sear the meat on the stove and throw the whole thing in the oven. Terrific! And this pan is as easy to clean as any pan I own.
