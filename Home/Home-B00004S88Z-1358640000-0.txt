review/summary: All American 921 21-1/2-Quart Pressure Cooker/Cannerreview/text: Very happy with this purchase....it was actually less expensive to purchase AND less expensive to have it freighted from America to Australia, than it was to purchase within Australia. Despite the purchase being over the Christmas holiday period, the item was here within a week !Item was in perfect condition.Word of warning - make sure you read the usage instructions carefully. I didn't find they were particularly easy to follow, as seem to jump from one topic to another.LUBRICATE your lid/pan seal!!! I was in dire straits trying to remove my lid the first time, as it had vacuumed on. Lubricating fixes it perfectly.Plenty of easier-to-follow instructions available online, make the initial use less daunting.Overall, thrilled with my purchase, time to retire my old Fowlers Vacola water canner!
