review/summary: Best Investment Ever!review/text: My family of 5 drinks a lot of water and we were all drinking it from water bottles bought in packs of 24 at about $4 a pack. We decided to give filtered water a try and bought this dispenser. The water tastes great! The difference between filtered and tap is huge! I highly recommend replacing the filter every 2.5 months or so because the water starts to taste sort of funny. The individual filters are about 7 dollars each but that's fine every couple months or so. This dispenser is easy-to-use and the water is delicious.
