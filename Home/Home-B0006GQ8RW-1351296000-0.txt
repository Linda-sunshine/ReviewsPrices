review/summary: Brita 42432 Water Pitcher Filtersreview/text: I was disappointed that the new filters didn't fit my pitcher perfectly. Ocassionally, the filter would loosen, and water would flow freely from the top to the bottom of the pitcher, which is labelled: OB11/OB03. And the filters didn't look exactly like the old ones.
