review/summary: Stainless Steel wonderreview/text: I have purchased glass French Press Coffee makers in the past but this stainless steel press is so much better. I bought this press for our RV...and now I love this press so much that I am buying one for at home. The coffee remains hot and the internal coffee press is easy to clean. And, oh BTW the lid to this press is so easy to turn into place to pour your hot coffee! Terrific product if you like hot good tasting coffee!
