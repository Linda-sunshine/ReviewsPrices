review/summary: I have this very machine for 5 years of daily use.review/text: I purchased this very machine about 5 years ago. I have used it several times a day since then. I have NO complaints. I have flooded this machine, poured ice cold water in it while it was still hot (something one should never do to a coffee machine such as this) and overall, got more than my money's worth of use out of it.For Christmas this year, I am `gifting myself' with a new one, in a cool new color. Why? Because I was very happy with the last one, which is still working perfectly. I just believe after tens of thousands of cups of coffee, I want a `fresh' machine. I will retire my current Cuisinart to my office.Note: I have been through numerous coffee machines and brands-- all around the same price point, this one is the best for my money. No complaints at all. I would recommend this machine for people that like a fair price point, high quality, and style.
