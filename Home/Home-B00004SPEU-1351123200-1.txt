review/summary: The cord is short!review/text: My old one starts to wear out(about 20 years old) so I bought this new one. Works the same, does good job grinding herb and spice. My only complain is the cord is too short. The old one has a 52" long cord but the new one is almost olny half of it, 28"! Copper must becomes too expensive.
