review/summary: Dead on arrivalreview/text: The pitcher arrived with a giant crack along the front end of the clear container, rendering it useless as a water container. The top of the thing was jammed into the pitcher so far that it left a scuff mark, and was incredibly hard to pry out. Your experience may not be the same, but I was expecting the product to come to me in one piece.
