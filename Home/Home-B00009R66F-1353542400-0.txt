review/summary: Lost suction within monthsreview/text: I might as well have thrown my money in the wind! Within a few months, the cleaner started losing suction. I find myself lucky if the suction stays on for more than 15 seconds. I couldn't return because it was beyond return period. Never buying a Hoover again.
