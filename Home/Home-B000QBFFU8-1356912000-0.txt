review/summary: It works great! At least the first time.review/text: My last breville juicer lasted 2 years. It still works fine but the screen thing broke and they dont make a replacement part for my juicer anymore. Besides, that little screen costs about 60$. So I decided to just buy a new juicer the Ikon. It worked wonderfully the first 2 or 3 times I used it, but now it won't power on. I tried everything, taking it apart and putting it together, changing the outlet...but when I plug it in all I see is the light turn on but the motor doesn't start. It worked perfectly fine just yesterday.
