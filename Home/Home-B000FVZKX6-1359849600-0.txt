review/summary: Sheets great for first few weeksreview/text: My husband and I absolutely love these sheets, however after washing them for the first time and putting them back on the bed, the fitted sheet ripped quite easily. I immediately stitched the rip on my sewing machine and we are continuing to use the sheets which are great for cold winter nights. Just disappointed that they were not better quality resisting tears.
