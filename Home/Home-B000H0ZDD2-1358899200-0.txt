review/summary: Great for apartment living!review/text: I live in a small studio apartment (10' x 14') in downtown Philadelphia. The building is over a hundred years old, relies on steam heat and is not very well insulated. The humidity level in the apartment was 73% and it created a stuffy, musty odor when you walked in the door (plus I think my clothes were starting to smell). I didn't have the finances nor the room for one of the larger dehumidifiers so I was looking for something small. I found this and I couldn't be happier. Within hours of turning this baby on, I was collecting a significant amount of water. Now the humidity level hovers around 51%, which is much more enjoyable. In addition, the stale, musty odor has decreased significantly. I read some reviews that this product was noisy, but I don't agree. Don't get me wrong - it does make noise - but my fridge makes more noise when it kicks on. The soft whirring sound is easily tuned out. If you like dead silence, then you might want to put this in a closet.
