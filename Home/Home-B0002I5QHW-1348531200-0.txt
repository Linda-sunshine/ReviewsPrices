review/summary: False Advertising - Made in Chinareview/text: I just got it in, and to my shock, the product is not as advertised. Not only is it not "made in the USA" as the product info says, it is made in Red China. They could at least consider outsourcing to Taiwan or S. Korea first! Especially with the notorious reputation for inferior quality and health hazards from toxic chemicals and unsound workmanship. I'm sending this back and getting a refund. Amazon should be ashamed for misrepresenting the products they carry.
