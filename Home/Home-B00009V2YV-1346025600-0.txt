review/summary: Perfect for anyone who wants to be updated on developing Weather or other possible Emergency situations!review/text: I have owned several different Weather & Scanner radios over the past 3 decades. This is a very nice home unit.I did not find the button beep to be as loud or annoying as some reviews advised. For several of the functions, you can simply press and hold down the button (only one beep) to quickly proceed thru the setup. No need to press the button multiple times.The setup is very simple and does provide many options to personalize the unit to advise or not to advise (SIREN) of potential emergency situations.My only dislike is; I would like to have had one or two additional display lighting options.Example: I would like a longer light time of 30 seconds before the display light auto shuts off, and/or a lower light setting if you select the display light to be constantly on.
