review/summary: Great cookwarereview/text: I purchased this product after using the cookware I received as a shower gift 28 years ago. Heavy duty and oven safe. I love them. They conduct the heat evenly. Relatively easy to clean. Follow the manufacturers suggestion of putting hot water in them immediately after using, especially if you have something that adheres.
