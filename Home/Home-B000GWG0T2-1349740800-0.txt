review/summary: not so hot -- literallyreview/text: I haven't used it long enough to tell how durable the non-stick coating is but as a fry pan, it's not great.1. there is no anti-drip lip.2. on an induction cooktop it does not heat up as fast as an Ikea 365 fry pan.3. on an induction cooktop it does not heat up as evenly as an Ikea 365 fry pan.4. As many other reviewers have noted, the pan is not flat and oil drains from the center into a ring.I am quite disappointed by this product after the great reviews on ATK. I bet they didn't test with induction.
