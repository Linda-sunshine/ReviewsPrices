review/summary: This skillet has solved several issues I've had.review/text: I took to heart the comments about the size and made sure I knew where I would store it before placing my order. Once it arrived, I cooked large quantities (for me they were large) of chicken. From there, I found I could finally make larger quantities of recipes and use only one pan. The units heats quickly and evenly. Once the temperature is reached, it cycles so as to not overheat. The simmer setting also worked just as I would expect it to. I am choosing to not put it in the dishwasher nor wash it with a strong dish soap. I will also 'season' it just like I do my cast-iron skillets. I do recommend this highly.
