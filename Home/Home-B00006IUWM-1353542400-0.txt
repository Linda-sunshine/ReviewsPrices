review/summary: Why didn't I buy this sooner?review/text: This sharpener is real easy to use and quickly sharpens all the kitchen knives I have. Never owned an electric sharpener before and have always sharpened by hand. To hand sharpen a knife to even adiquated sharpness, It usually takes me 10 minutes or more which means I seldom do it until every usuable knife is dull. I don't know how long it will last as I have only had it a month, but it is stable and the motor sees adiquate. I would buy it again even if it broke in a year for all the time and hassle it has saved me in this one month alone.
