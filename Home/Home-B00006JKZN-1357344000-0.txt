review/summary: I do not recommendreview/text: Liked the price but this waffle maker is small and most importantly hard to handle because the outer portion gets hot. Easy to burn your hand. Also it doesn't the feature that lets you know when the waffle is ready. Suggest a buyer spend a few more dollars to get a better product which I did. Gave this one to the Thrift Shop.
