review/summary: great little gadgetreview/text: I figured out how much I was actually paying for the Keurig "K-cups" and decided that, maybe it was time it went to live in the camper. I looked over recommended one-cup brewers and this stood out. I like Black and Decker, generally, so decided to give it a try. I just made me first cuppa, using one of my own cups instead of the travel mug..meaning you don't HAVE to use it. Excellent cuppa! I cut down some larger paper filters, since I did not have the right size, and clean-up was a breeze. You could do the same thing by boiling some water and pouring it over filtered grounds in one of those old plastic thingies, but, this is faster and you can do something else while it's making.Very happy with this product and it's saving me a bunch of money.
