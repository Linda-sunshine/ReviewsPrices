review/summary: Tea Drinker...very pleasedreview/text: I got this at a raffle and didn't think I would use it since I don't drink coffee...I use it multiple times a day, every day.I invested the extra couple of bucks for the tea "adapter" and I put loose tea or rip open a tea bag to make my favorite brands or flavors, since I'm not a huge fan of the tea selection from Keurig. This thing cranks out the hot water with three sizes (though I wish there was a travel cup size, you have to run it twice to fill most travel cups) and it's pretty quick too.I have small kids that love hot chocolate, and while the Keurig selection doesn't quite taste right, it's perfect if you have a Swiss Miss type packet.
