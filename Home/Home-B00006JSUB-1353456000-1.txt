review/summary: Buy Now!review/text: If you are on the fence, don't hesitate and get at least the L8SK3[10-1/4"] and L10SK3[12"]. Well made and made USA which is great to see. Like some have suggested, buy locally if you can. My local Walmart had these in stock, drove down and picked one of each that had a fairly smooth cooking surface. Cost was about the same just had to pay for tax, so like ~$3 more.Wanted to smooth the cooking surface a bit more, this what I did:First used 150 grit sandpaper and finished with 400 grit wet sandpaper. Just on the cooking surface, to sand down/remove any high spots. One can sand even more[mirror like finish], but this was enough for the skillets bought and not really necessary.Wash well with soap and a scouring pad or similar. Rinse/Dry immediately and throughly, then rub in a very thin coat of coconut[my preference] or vegetable oil; all over the skillets.Then re-season the skillets. Place them in the oven at 500F upside down on the top rack and with aluminum foil on the bottom rack to catch drips. For 1 hour, let it cool down for ~30 minutes and repeat the re-seasoning process 3-5 times to get them well seasoned again.First time use was great. Cooked some sausage and scrambled eggs. The eggs did stick a little, but that is to be expected; as more seasoning/cooking is done that will be a thing of the past.For cleaning one can use a scrub brush as suggested or salt. Cleaning with salt works great, got the idea from [0].[0] http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PKIOBGJ0W2M3/ref=cm_cr_rev_detmd_pl?ie=UTF8&asin;=B0002F9AH2&cdForum;=Fx3EC6KN3NF72WV&cdMsgID;=Mx3D5X25IWG9ME6&cdMsgNo;=1&cdPage;=1&cdSort;=oldest&cdThread;=Tx36UJEPNPG0XE7&store;=home-garden#Mx3D5X25IWG9ME6Basically just pour some salt on the skillet and rub a bit[not hard, just enough to remove any stuck bits] with a paper towel.Rinse well with water [if skillet is warm/hot; use hot water], over the surface of the skillet. Dry immediately with paper/cloth towel throughly; place back on the stove/oven to fully dry, then rub in a very thin coat of coconut[my preference] or vegetable oil; all over the skillet while still warm/hot.Put away in a cool dry place with a paper towel over the skillet cooking surface to prevent rust[which should not happen; just as a precaution].
