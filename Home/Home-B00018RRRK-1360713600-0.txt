review/summary: Works like a chartreview/text: I love the upgrade to a grinder that I press once and then it does the work. It looks nice on the counter and does its job. I was hopeful that it would be easier to dump the ground coffee into my coffee pot but it does still require a clean up or too. Far superior to the old press it grinder I had before.
