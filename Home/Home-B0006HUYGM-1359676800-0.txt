review/summary: Pretty good suction, but too bigreview/text: I purchased this to vacuum out our vehicles. As such, it lives in the garage and I've never used it in the house.Pros:It has pretty good suction.The crevice tool is easy to get to and use.Cons:It is too big to completely clean the foot wells in our compact SUV so I end up using the crevice tool more often than I expected. In this respect, It does a better job in our sedan.Even with the SUV or sedan in the garage and the vac plugged into the outlet in the garage, the cord is too short to do the entire vehicle without digging out the extension cord.All in all, it beats driving to the car wash to use their vacuums.
