review/summary: Good productreview/text: Have purchased 2 of these - one for our home and one for our vacation home. Slept on it for a month ourselves. Pumps up quickly, used fitted sheets - stays on fine. You need to put more air in every 3-4 days and takes a bit to get it to your comfort level - but other than that, it is a comfortable bed. Put it on a carpet - otherwise it does move around a bit. Also put a mattress cover on it and a flannel sheet - as it can be cold on a tile floor. Deflates quickly.Great for a spare room when you don't have much room and don't need a bed all the time. Great for company.
