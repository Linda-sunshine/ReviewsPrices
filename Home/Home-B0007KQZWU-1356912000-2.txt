review/summary: Stick To It!review/text: After shopping around for months to find a great set of stainless steel cookware, I think I have found it. The selling points for me are (1) good quality, (2) good looking, and (3) good price.So, here are the reasons to buy this cookware: (1) aluminum core that extends up the sides for even heat distribution, (2) very attractive, heavy-duty, should last a lifetime, and (3) didn't stick a scrambled egg. Yes, you read right, the skillet did not stick an egg. Here's the secret, pre-heat the skillet on medium high, add a couple of pats of butter rolling it around the sides to get a good coverage, and cook it. Oh, yea, the price is awesome.Here's some quick tips - (1) always pre-heat your skillets on medium-high, (2) add fat [butter, oil, etc.], (3) let your item cook [my wife turns stuff too much], (4) buy Barkeeper's Friend [for cleanup if needed], and (5) you don't have to cook everything on high!I thought about buy the rest of the pieces or maybe another set!
