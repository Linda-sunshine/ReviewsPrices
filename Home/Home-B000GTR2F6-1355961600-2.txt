review/summary: Quite good overall! I would recommend.review/text: This unit is very good, I have a B60 at home and love it, bought this for use in the room at my office. It works great, lots of control options, great cup size selections. Good heat time, and the reservoir is awesome as it came with the upgraded 72oz one.There is only one issue I noticed, and Im not sure if its the cups or the machine, occasionally when a cup is put in and the machine cycles, it spits the coffee out the front of the machine and makes a mess, This happens 1 in 25 roughly, but it happens and Im not fully prepared to blame the Keurig as it could be the cups. All the same, I wish the Keurig was designed to seal shut to prevent a poorly designed K-Cup from spraying coffee around the counter or on me.All in all, a great unit though, and I would recommend anyone to purchase that wants a Keurig Brewer
