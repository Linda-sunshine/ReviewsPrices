review/summary: Had to get a replacement bowlreview/text: Initially, the ice cream never firmed up and it stayed soupy (nice milkshake). Turns out the freezing container had been underfilled with whatever material is in there to hold in the cold. After getting a replacement, and after being sure that the mixture was thoroughly chilled as well before trying to make ice cream, we got it to work acceptably.
