review/summary: heating plate stopped workingreview/text: i only had this coffee maker a couple of weeks and the heating plate quit working i have had a lot of bad luck with coffee makers the last few months.i bought it at jcpennys and they were great they took it back and gave me a refund no question asked.it did make real good tasting coffee but you expect it to work longer than a couple of weeks. oh well my quest gones on for a good reliable coffee maker
