review/summary: the most fun you can have in your kitchen without getting arrestedreview/text: For those of us who get a thrill out of shredding paper and using a wood chipper we now have an entertainment center in the kitchen. While my wife does most of the cooking I have been known to dabble in the culinary arts. This food processor makes short work of even tough root veges and the selection of blades pretty much cover the gamut of cutting needs. The unit is easy to assemble and colors (I have the blue one...) are bright without a cheap sheen. Safeties prevent accidents, despite my best efforts, and the unit is well-designed as a whole. Cooking with power has never been more fun.
