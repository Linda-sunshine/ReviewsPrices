review/summary: Uncomfortablereview/text: We bought this chair because of the good reviews but turned out to be very uncomfortable for us. Different people in the family tried before returning the chair and all had problems. It gave me a lower back pain. The chair didn't support my lower back as well as my old chair. This chair goes back and my old chair is back in use for many more years :)
