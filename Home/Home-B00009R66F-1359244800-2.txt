review/summary: Good, not great.review/text: For the price, you are getting what you pay for. It works well on most lower traffic areas, but if you are trying to get deep/set-in stains or dingy carpet from high traffic areas, this won't be the one for you. If you used it frequently in your home, it should suit the purpose. I attempted to clean a rental unit that I had, and the difference in the carpet was barely noticable. I would not buy this if your place is in need of a nice deep steam cleaning. The warmest you will get this water from the cleaner is as hot as your tap water will go.
