review/summary: Doesn't get any better than thisreview/text: Why anyone would spend hundreds on a big clunky espresso maker is beyond me. I prefer this to the espresso my boyfriend makes with his $800 machine. The only downside is the cleanup is kind of messy but you really can't get any better than this little one. The 3-Cup makes about two good-sized coffees.
