review/summary: Works As advertisedreview/text: I've used the waffle maker a half dozen times since it was delivered. I agree with the comments regarding the adjuster. It's flimsy. The good thing is that I only had to set it once on number 3 setting. I really don't understand why you would constantly have to fiddle with it. Just set it and forget it. My first waffle stuck to the top and was ruined. I expected that. After that, I very lightly sprayed it with vegetable oil and have not had a problem since. The first few waffles spilled out over the edge, but with a little practice that has'nt happened again. The waffles come out looking and tasting great. Clean up is no big deal. I let it cool, and wipe it with a dry paper towel.
