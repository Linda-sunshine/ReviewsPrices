review/summary: Typical high-quality Lodge, but less useful than the same-sized skillet?review/text: Lodge makes top-quality cast iron skillets and griddles. There's no arguing that. Their products may be the best available.The question here is how useful this griddle is compared against a similar skillet. The major differences in favor of the griddle will be a lower weight, slightly lower cost, and less to wash.However, the much lower sides of the griddle make it far less useful than its skillet counterpart. You run the risk of spillovers with food items such as eggs.If used as a cooking surface when backpacking, where bulkiness is an issue, perhaps this is the better option. Otherwise, get the skillet. It's more adaptable and useful.
