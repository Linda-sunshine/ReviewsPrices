review/summary: Second Generation Cuisinart....You gotta love it!review/text: I was using a Cuisinart that had belonged to my mother-in-law. It had to be 20 years old and had made a lot of noodles in its day. It was still working but my kids gave me money for my birthday and I bought the Cuisinart. I was shocked by how quickly it worked and how powerful it was. Thanks for a great product and a great price.
