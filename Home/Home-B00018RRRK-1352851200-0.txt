review/summary: Plastic inside simply disintegratedreview/text: It never did grind coarse enough for my French press, but I liked that it came apart easily for cleaning. Problem was very very low quality plastic on the inside that came off a piece at a time until it just simply disintegrated. Lasted less than a year.
