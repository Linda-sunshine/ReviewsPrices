review/summary: Once you go cast iron, you never go backreview/text: Lodge is the only cast iron I've owned and once I learned how to use and take care of cast iron, I became hooked. Now I own a griddle, a large pot with a convertible lid/pan, and a smaller pan for frying eggs. Love 'em all and they're made in the U.S.A!
