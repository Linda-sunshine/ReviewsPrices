review/summary: Actually didn't get to use this product, but...review/text: Gave three stars because I didn't actually get to use the product, and there wasn't a "don't know" option. I'm really reviewing Amazon MINUS the issue with the unit, and not the unit itself. Amazon gets a "Five Star" rating, and my "No Star" rating for not having been able to try the product would make it a "Zero Star". I was so excited when I got my new burr grinder (had never tried one before), and the reviews on this one were pretty good for the price. This was an order from a shipper other than Amazon, and it was listed as used, but in like new condition. When I opened the shipping box, the grinder was in it's original packaging, and I was very optomistic about what was inside. I always read the instructions before I try any new product, so I read those and I read the description of what was included with the unit. Having done all of my home work, I proceded to inventory the unit to make sure that it was all there. It wasn't. I don't know whether it would have worked without the missing part or not, but I am all about safety, and it didn't seem as if it would be safe without a missing collar. So, back it went. I must remark that sending it back couldn't have been easier, and my refund was issued promptly. It's about a month later now, and I just received my new Bodum Burr Grinder (in the loveliest shade of lime green), and I made my first pot of coffee with beans ground in it. I used our standard drip coffee-maker, but am looking forward to trying it out with our french press. We let our old espresso machine go when we downsized our household to move cross-country, so we will have to withhold judgement on that method as well. Sorry that this was not an actual review of the machine listed and how it works, but it was a good review for Amazon and their contractors.
