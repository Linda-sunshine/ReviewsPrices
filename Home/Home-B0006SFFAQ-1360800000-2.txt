review/summary: Makes great coffee, but has its problemsreview/text: I've had this coffeemaker for a few years and it makes the best coffee of any one I've ever had. However, I would never buy it again because it turns itself off randomly. I thought it was just my pot that did it, but I found my niece has the same one and has the same problem. Then when I looked it up online, it appears that this is a common problem for everyone. My coffee will brew, I'll pour a cup and walk away, and when I look back, it's turned off. I turn it back on, and it turns off again. Some days it's fine, so there's nothing specific that causes the problem, it's just a problem with their switch, I presume.It's a shame, because as I said, it makes the best coffee.
