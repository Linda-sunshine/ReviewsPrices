review/summary: Mehreview/text: It is what it is, but it's really hard to pull the plastic cover off after grinding without spilling coffee everywhere. It has a cheap plastic latch that gets jammed up with coffee grounds or something, you end up having to pull really hard, and it never really grinds very fine either. I'd go for more expensive and better options, in the end this one is penny wise and pound foolish and I regret going cheap.
