review/summary: Good results but too much trouble for my taste...review/text: I bought this three years ago with the intention of using at work - the only time I really need one cup at a time. It made a good cup of coffee, but was just too much of a hassle with the paper filters and messy clean up. I used it off and on for a few months and then it sat in my desk drawer until I left my job. Then it sat in my kitchen for another year and then I gave it away. Neat gadget, but just not for me!
