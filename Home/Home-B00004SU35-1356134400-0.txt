review/summary: Wowreview/text: I love this popper, but I do wish it were stainless steel instead of aluminum. When you put it in the sink to wash it out it leaves little metal scratches in the sink. These need to be scoured out with comet after washing the pot. They say you can just wipe it down with a paper towel if you use it more than once a week. I can't imagine doing that. In my opinion, it needs washed. It popped every last darn kernel and it was super fast.
