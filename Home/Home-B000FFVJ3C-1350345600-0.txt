review/summary: Excellent! Easy! Efficient!review/text: Our first Dehydrator ... why didn't we do this earlier!!?? Reasonable price, reasonably quiet ( no louder than a quiet microwave), functional thermostat, easy to clean, faster than the booklet indicates for fruit drying. Time for more trays!!Only CON we have for it is that it has no on/off switch as others have said. That is easily corrected with an in-line toggle switch that can be inserted in the cord, available at any hardware store (or Amazon! http://www.amazon.com/Heavy-Duty-Cord-Switch-Ivory/dp/B000UVOPWS/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&qid;=1350451632&sr;=8-13&keywords;=inline+switch)
