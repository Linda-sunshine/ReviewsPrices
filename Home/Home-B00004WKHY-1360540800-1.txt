review/summary: Excellent food processorreview/text: I had a GE brand food processor from Walmart prior to purchasing the Cuisinart Stainless Steel Prep 9 Food Processor. I put the Cuisinart through its paces this weekend. Chopping onions and celery is a breeze. It sliced potatoes in a flash. I like that the buttons are easy to clean since I tend to get everything messy when I cook. Looks great and super powerful. The bowl and attachments on this model are much sturdier than my last processor.I looked at the local Walmart before purchasing and I'm glad I paid a little more for the Cuisinart brand.I am very happy with my purchase.
