review/summary: Best One I've Ever Used!review/text: I bought one of these in dark blue to use with protein shakes. I was surprised how powerful the suction is and it works great on mixing up all the protein powder. It also chops up ice and frozen fruit quickly! I subsequently bought another one in turquoise to give to my daughter for her birthday and she loves it as well. I think I made the best choice.
