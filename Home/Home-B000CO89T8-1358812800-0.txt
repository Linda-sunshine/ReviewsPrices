review/summary: Almost dangerousreview/text: I used these as candle warmers rather than coffee mug warmers. I bought 5 of these and would turn them on probably 15-20 minutes at a time. They ended up almost exploding or busting open after a while and exposed the insides. It scared me. One of them just stopped working altogether. I'm completely disappointed with this product.
