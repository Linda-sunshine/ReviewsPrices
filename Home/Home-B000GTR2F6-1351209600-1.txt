review/summary: Keeps on pumping out good coffeereview/text: While I wouldn't say this machine is for the gourmet coffee drinker, it does the job for everyday coffee drinking. In fact I have come to prefer it to our Saeco automatic epresso machine (because I can buy one of these for the same price of ONE saeco repair). My parents' have had this machine for about 2 years and it has made hundreds of cups of coffee without a glitch. So I bought one myself. Hopefully it will hold up as well. It makes an easy, predictable cup of coffee every time.
