review/summary: Padermo Would Cuisine Spiral Slicerreview/text: Great product. Great customer service for the wife. The company was very courteous and answered all her questions.Just to let you know if you are a lefty like she is, you may have to turn the handle with your right hand or turn it around the opposite way of the item shown on the picture. No problem though. Perfect salads every time.
