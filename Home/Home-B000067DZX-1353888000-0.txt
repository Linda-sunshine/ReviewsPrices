review/summary: These filters are the best that are readily commercially availablereview/text: And Amazon is the least expensive place to get them. I have been using these in my big dispenser pitcher for five years. The Pur pitchers and filters do not have BPA in them, and the cost per gallon of water, even at supermarket prices for the filters, is a lot less than what you pay for a gallon jug. Less plastic waste, too.
