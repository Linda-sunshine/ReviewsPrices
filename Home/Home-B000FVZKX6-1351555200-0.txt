review/summary: so soft!review/text: These sheets are awesome! Very veeery soft and warm and I love the color. I can tell these sheets are going to hold up for at least a few years...probably more. They are very thick and seem to be well made. I'd never tried flannel sheets before but I love them! I read maaanny mixed reviews on many different kind of sheets and finally took the risk with these...I'm glad I did.
