review/summary: GREAT TASTE TERRIBLE FILTERING TIMEreview/text: I love the taste from PUR water filters. I've been using them for about 18 months and in that time I have had a bad time with over half of them. The problem doesn't develop right away, but will manifest itself after 1 to 3 weeks of use. The water suddenly begins to drain from the top through the filter VERY SLOWLY. It can take over 3 hours for the top of a small pitcher to drain through. A rigorous shaking sometimes improves things temporarily. When this 3-pack is done I will be switching to another brand.
