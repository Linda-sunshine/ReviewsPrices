review/summary: Thank you Cuisinart for this set.review/text: I have wanted to purchase a set of All Clad cookware for a long time but could never bring myself to spend so much on them. Cuisinart has created a set that has the same construction as All Clad cookware for a fraction of the price. The even distribution of heat is excellent and they are not so heavy that you can barely lift them when they are full which is the case with other high quality cookware like All Clad and LeCreuset. I love to cook, and this set, with a few extra pieces of iron cookware that I have purchased in France, (exactly like LeCreuset but without the name) have me covered for just about anything I cook or want to cook.
