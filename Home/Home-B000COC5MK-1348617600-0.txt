review/summary: Awesome Item available through Amazonreview/text: I do not know who invented this Oster wine bottle opener but they are awesome. The opener is easy to use and eliminates dropping the bottle after using a manual corkscrew (which I have done more than once). Not that I am clumsy but I like my wine chilled and it makes the bottle slippery. It also has eliminated dropping pieces of the cork down in the wine due to uneven pressure on a manual corkscrew. I was in Florida recently and some friends were going to serve wine. Someone had given them one of these openers and they used it at the table. I was so impressed I ordered one from Amazon the minute that I got home. When mine came I charged it overnight and used it the next evening. It worked so well I had to stop myself from opening another bottle immmediately. Thanks Oster and thanks Amazon for distributing this great produce.
