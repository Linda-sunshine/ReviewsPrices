review/summary: Excellent!review/text: Okay, after reading the reviews I was 50/50 on buying this bed topper. I always go through the bad reviews and over analyzing everything about a product before I make a decision to buy or not. One thing that sparked my attention is that its not quite as advertised when they say "memory foam". The foam certainly does feel and look like actually memory foam, it just lacks the actual memory effect. Someone actually posted a video on this. When you push on actual memory foam, its supposed to hold its form. Although this product doesn't hold form, it is every bit as comfortable as the real thing. I also read some concerns about the mint smell being too strong and being described as a "chemical smell". Contrary to this statement, the smell is just like mint chocolate ice cream but not like any of that run of the mill stuff you can pick up at a grocery store. This stuff is a whole different caliber. Closest thing I could even begin to describe it even remotely smelling like would have to be Jesus's farts. The only actual problem I had was a tear in the material approximately 3 inches in length. It is completely unnoticeable when laid down but when you roll over it, it becomes a gaping hole. If it weren't for that I would had absolutely rated this item a 4 or 5 stars. I am also uploading a picture of this tear for others to see.
