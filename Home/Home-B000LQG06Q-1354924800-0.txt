review/summary: Get this if you have back painreview/text: I normally write long reviews, but there's not much to say about this product--it just flatout works if your mattress causes you to wake up with back pain.A lot of people attribute back pain to a hard mattress, but I made the mistake of getting a soft mattress that didn't provide enough back support. And that became even more true as the mattress was quickly affected by my sitting on it all the time in the same places, causing it to lose even more firmness and even-ness. This lack of back support started to affect my sleep and had me waking up in pain both in the middle of the night and in the mornings.I started looking at new mattresses and was surprised by how expensive they are. I wanted to find a cheaper option and was eventually led to this product on Amazon. I ordered it a few months ago, and I haven't had back pain since. My bed is incredibly comfortable. I just came back today to order my mother one for her bed, since she also has back pain from an uneven mattress.Amazing product that I would recommend to anyone to save money on a new mattress.
