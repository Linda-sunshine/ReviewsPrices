review/summary: Can't. Stop. Juicing.review/text: This thing is amazing. Ordered this after watching &#34;Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead&#34; and I couldn't be happier. Been juicing everything.In hindsight, the only regret I have is not spring the extra $50 for the one with the tank for the pulp. This one shoots it off into the circular tank on top. While it's not a total pain to clean, I have a friend who has one with a tank and it seems a bit easier.
