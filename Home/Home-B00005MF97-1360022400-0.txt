review/summary: Amazing product, Does what it saysreview/text: I have had this for a month or so, it does an amazing job chopping up veggies. Here are the following things I have been able to process:- Ginger/Garlic- Ocra- Carrots- Cauliflower- OnionsEasy to clean and dry. In addition,the plastic lid that it comes with, makes storing the contents inside the fridge an easy job (no additional dishes needed).
