review/summary: Nice jar. Plastic top could better quality.review/text: I'm happy I purchased this glass jug. It's a decent size and perfect for what I need it for. Only problem is that the top of the jug is a pretty poor quality plastic. This doesn't matter much, it's just that it would be nicer if it was made out of a better plastic or other material.
