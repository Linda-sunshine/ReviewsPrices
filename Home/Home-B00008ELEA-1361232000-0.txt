review/summary: Finally - no more drip coffee!review/text: I love this coffee pot - in my mind there are 3 good ways to make coffee - cold brew, French Press, and Percolator. The first two can be sort of a pain to make - so I am using my new Percolator. Drip coffee makers just don't measure up to a good perked cup of coffee. Farberware is an excellent brand.The only thing I would like to see differently is the measuring marks plainer to see - otherwise, everything is good.
