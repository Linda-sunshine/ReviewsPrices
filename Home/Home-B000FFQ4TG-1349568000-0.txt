review/summary: Pleased with my purchasereview/text: I've owned mine for two years and it serves the best tasting cup of coffee I've ever had at home. The only negative would be water loss. Frequently, I'll pour 10 cups of water in the machine and it only makes 8-9 cups. I've learned to compensate for this, so it's not an issue any longer. I would recommend to anyone.
