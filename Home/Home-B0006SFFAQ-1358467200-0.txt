review/summary: Smoking/burning problem with mine,tooreview/text: Some of you may have had this machine for a few months to a year or more and think you're in the clear. I've had mine for just over 2 years and it was working great and we kept it safe/clean, etc the whole time and there are no cord abuse issues on our part.I had the same smoking from inside where the cord goes into the back of the machine this morning. I bought the machine in early DEC 2010. It is still under 3 yr warranty, so Cuisinart is sending me (7-10 business days) a replacement and having me cut the cord close to the machine and send it back with a service # when the replacement comes. I asked about if it's happened before and they admitted yes. I asked about a recall and she said not that she knew of. Looks like this has been going on for about 3 yrs and even the 2012 models are having the same issue. So I'm thinking this may happen to us again with the replacement based on these reviews. Would maybe Better Business Bureau have some weight on this? I appreciate the free replacement and return shipping, but what about the hazard to all the customer's other personal belongings, home, lives (not just me, but my children & spouse, etc)? If it's so well known, why don't they FIX IT?
