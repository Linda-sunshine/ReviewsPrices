review/summary: I love my new juicer!review/text: I love my new Hamilton Beach juicer. I have heard stories about people getting tired of their juicers and only using them for a little while before putting them on the back shelf or giving them away. This juicer is super easy to use, easy to clean and can hold lots of pulp so you can make extra juice to drink later. The only minor issue I have with it is that it's noisy - but I guess that's why it gets through all of the hard vegetables and fruits that I put in it.
