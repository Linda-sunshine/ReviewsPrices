review/summary: Great Gadgetreview/text: This little thing works great for hard boiled eggs and one of the best things is that the eggs peel with absolutely no effort. One caution, and it's included in the instructions, be sure that the top is securely on. If it isn't, the eggs may explode. The tray they sit on is metal and this has to be covered during cooking. It doesn't screw on but it doesn't need to. It just needs to sit squarely on so that microwaves don't reach inside. It cooks by steaming the egg. Works GREAT!
