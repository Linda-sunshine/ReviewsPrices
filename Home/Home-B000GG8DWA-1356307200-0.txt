review/summary: Small, cheap, effective for its purposereview/text: I just wanted a small inexpensive heater for under the desk. It does perfect for that purpose. As the unit has no blower don't expect it to heat a large area quickly. It's a close proximity type of device and should be purchased with that in mind. Also note when they say &#34;Low (400 watts) and high (800 watts)&#34; they mean you're either turning on one (the top) or both heating elements. I feel that's worth mentioning because logically the top element will probably be the first thing to break if/when the unit comes to its eventual end.
