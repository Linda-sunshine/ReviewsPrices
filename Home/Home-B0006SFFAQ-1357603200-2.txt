review/summary: Cuisinart DCC-1200 frustrationreview/text: Bought the DC-1200 coffee maker 3 plus years ago to coordinate with other kitchen finishes and CR reviews.After 3 years of light use the unit has stopped working.This is wrong.For the price,anyone should expectbetter reliability.My 10 year old Mr. Coffee is back on the counter and is working very well after it's3 year vacation.Price is not always a predicter of quality.
