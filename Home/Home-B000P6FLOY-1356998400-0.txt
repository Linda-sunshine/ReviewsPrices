review/summary: Easy to use and Works Wellreview/text: I initially purchased this for home brewing, to have better control over temperature of my brews. For this purpose the thermometer excelled.The instant feed back of temperature is extremely useful.I have used this product for it's intended use as well and it works like a charm. It has an alarm when the preset temperature is reached so you can take the guess work out of preparing that perfect rib roast. while a traditional meat thermometer would work just fine taking the meats out of the oven to check the temperature is conter-productive, the length of the probe wire allows the probe to stay in the oven while the read out gives instant temperature readouts.
