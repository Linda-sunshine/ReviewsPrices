review/summary: almost terrific!review/text: I initially purchased a Keurig around 2005. It worked great until recently - even went thru a move to Hawaii with it's destructive humidity and back to the mainland. In the first 30 days of our owning our new Keurig, we've had to clean the flow thru the needle that punctures the K cup 4 times. When calling, the technician said that hot chocolate cups will leave a residue that causes the coffee grounds to stick. One problem - I only use coffee or put hot water thru the needle for use with tea bags. Why did this NEVER happen previously and now it's happening about once a week. If this could be corrected, this appliance would again be at the top of my favorite kitchen tools with 5+ stars!!!
