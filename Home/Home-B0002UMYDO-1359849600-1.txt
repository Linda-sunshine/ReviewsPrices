review/summary: Best Can Opener for the Pricereview/text: I needed a can opener that was sturdy and safe to use. This one is quiet, has a smooth motion, includes a strong magnet, and the cutting mechanism is removable for easy cleaning in the dishwasher. It is a great assistive device for people will hand/wrist conditions. Love it.
