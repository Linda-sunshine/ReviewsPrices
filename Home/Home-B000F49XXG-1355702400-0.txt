review/summary: Nice & economicalreview/text: My very old machine died so I chose this one as a birthday gift in October. The handle doesn't turn to center like the photo shows, but seems to work fine. The coffee is good and fast (doesn't take 15 minutes to heat up like the instructions say.) I like that I can make more than one latte because of the water reservoir for steaming the milk. As in the reviews I read before purchase, the steam spout is short and low, but I can deal with that for the price.
