review/summary: Good Brew, Not reliablereview/text: Got this coffee maker in Jan of 2011. In July of that year it stopped working, sent it in for repair (which took a month). As of Aug 2012 it failed again. Unit is out of 1 year warranty so I'm sunk. Can't say I've been real happy with the coffee maker.Pros- Makes a good cup of joe, plenty hot and the jets spray the grounds in a good pattern. Carafe is excellent at holding heat.Cons- 1.5 years old, already repaired once and it's given up the ghost. Coffee maker before this one worked 7 years before the carafe cracked. Also, the #4 filters that this uses don't fit perfectly in the brew area, never seemed to matter but a minor annoyance.
