review/summary: works greatreview/text: I have been using this for about 2 months. My cookies bake up nice and plump, without burning at all on the bottoms. 6000ft. baking can be tricky sometimes. It does have a bit of a slime feel to it, but that's ok, because I know it is clean. It is just the non stick surface. After I wash it, I hang it from my frig off one of my magnet clips, then I lay it over my cookie sheet in my bottom oven when it is dry. It does tend to attract lint, so I don't dry it with a towel. Beware of dog hair sticking to it!
