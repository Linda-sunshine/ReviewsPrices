review/summary: Not worth any price. Horribly inconsistent grinds. Awful taste.review/text: Really disappointed in this grinder. I'm returning it to Costco Korea, where I live. My model is identical to this, but carries the KR designation for being sold in Korea.The photos someone else provided showing the inconsistency in grind are true. Mine was exactly this bad. I get a big chunk of dust stuck along the top and down along the back inside the pile of grains -- so basically, this is a useless grinder. Coffee comes out tasting terrible. I had a cheap hand grinder I almost threw out, and I'm glad I didn't. This Cuisinart grinder is going back as soon as I can return it. I have to wonder how many other people have returned these to Costco, and if they plan on continuing to carry them.Really, I have not experienced a worse grinder than this -- ever. Yes, it runs. Yes, it grinds the coffee. But it doesn't matter what setting you use, you will end up with a big blob of powdered coffee mixed into the grains.Awful.
