review/summary: Addictive, fun, precise, HEALTHY!!review/text: I'm enjoying this spiral slicer so mcuch and wowing my friends with the outcome! It's been reliable, quick and easy to use, a breeze to rinse off/clean up. If I could upload a photo I'd do it b/c I sent one to my friends of a finished dish. I haven't tried spiraling smaller veggies, like radishes, so haven't encountered the issues regarding the center being cored out. I suppose I'll use a mandoline for smaller veggies. For other veggies (other than onions) I just hand over that cored piece to my pups for a delight treat for them, reuse it for juicing/saving for stews, or it gets tossed into the compost pile. No waste with this machine.
