review/summary: I named my Penguin Stevereview/text: This is Steve the cool mist humidifier. He's easy to use and maintain. I covered that annoying green light that comes on to show that he is turned on. Honestly with the lights off (and you should be sleeping in pitch black) the light is pretty annoying.Anywho, I keep steve in my bedroom, I notice with my hygrometer he will raise humidity maybe 7-10% RH (I'm a mechanical engineer) after 8 hours or so.
