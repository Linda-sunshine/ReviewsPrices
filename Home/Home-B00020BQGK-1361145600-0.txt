review/summary: Amazing carpet cleaning, especially for pet hairreview/text: This is a truly amazing little vacuum cleaner, one that I can whip out and use with little trouble - powerful, strong, efficient, light, easy to use and empty out. Does a wonderful job of removing pet hair and cleaning carpets. I cannot recommend it strongly enough. The one negative is how loud it is. Oh well, one can't have everything.
