review/summary: Soft yet firmreview/text: Having read some of the more recent reviews commenting that the material was not memory foam, I was a little skeptical but made the purchase. I bought the queen size for my full size firm futon and it was a good fit. While I started to use it right away, it certainly was more memory foam-like after a few days. I am not very heavy (120lbs) and the topper is the perfect thickness for me. I sleep so much better now and am able to sleep on my front (which I could not comfortably do before... my futon was really firm). It also feels a lot more comfortable to sleep on my side now. The topper does hold body heat, so it does get warm in bed, not hot, just a little warm, which I like. Overall, I am really satisfied with my purchase, it took me a few days to get used to it, but now that I have, it's great. I am also definitely sleeping better.
