review/summary: Capresso 560 Coffee Bean Grinderreview/text: The Capresso 560 has made making fresh coffee so easy. The grinder is a burr grinder and does not heat the beans during the grinding process to prematurely extract oil and flavor. I located the grinder near to the coffee maker on the counter. It is very simple to use; just fill the bean container, which last us about 3-4 four days, then set the timer to the amount of grounds desired to make the coffee strength desired. Also I like the extra fine grind as we like coffee with bold flavor. After grinding the set amount, it is loaded into the coffee maker and voila! the process is completed in about one minute. The Capresso 560 has made it easier to grind fresh beans that to use pre-ground coffee. No fussing with a measuring cup and spilling grounds on the counter. I love the simplicity and resultant high quality coffee flavor that I am able to create. Highly recommend this product.
