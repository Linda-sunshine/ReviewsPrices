review/summary: Very basicreview/text: This is the most basic version of Keurig's machines. It worked well for the first six months, and then started to develop problems. I have since purchased higher-end model of this machine, which works perfectly.If you like Keurig, buy the better model. You will end up wasting your money on this particular model.
