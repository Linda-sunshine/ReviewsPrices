review/summary: WRINKLES WRINKLES arghreview/text: My husband prefers Egyptian Cotton and due to us upgrading to a king bed, I had to make the purchase. Lovely sheen, mind you, but always washing my sheets before using...my smile turned into a frown upon unloading the dryer. Oh the WRINKLES are horrible...any suggestions other than ironing? Hectic lives call for easy care...help!!! :(
