review/summary: Guys like me: Measure before purchasereview/text: If you're like me, and your significant other has asked for a LARGE cast-iron skillet, know that 15/17 inches is enormous in the world of skillets. They probably meant 11/12in. I bought this b/c it was the largest I saw. When it showed up I just laughed, b/c I'm an idiot. Don't by like me. Use a ruler.Otherwise, great skillet.
