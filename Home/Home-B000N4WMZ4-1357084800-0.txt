review/summary: Money well spent, my husband loves itreview/text: I was debating long whether to get the super expensive Le Creuset dutch oven instead, but I just could not make myself to pay the $200+ those cost. I am so glad I decided on this one! We love it, and use it all the time, for stews, meats, anything. Cooks beautifully. It works great, by husband even bakes bread in it (and that means really heave use as we need to heat it up to 500F empty....) We are very happy with this purchase.
