review/summary: Perfect corncakes, this performs perfectly, now I want a bigger one to add to my collection.review/text: My partner has been making us corncakes for breakfast, and my non-stick pan was well.... allowing them to stick. I went to Cooks Illustrated to check out their recs for skillets, since my non-stick is a quasi wok and I figured it'd be good to have more flat area.We couldn't be happier with this pan. The corncakes came out perfectly, and we can fit three in the pan at a time. Clean up was barely worth mentioning, and NOTHING stuck at all.Today I made eggs in the skillet, and used to my old pan I looked away for a second, the eggs cooked so fast I had to dash to turn them over. Again, no sticking, cleanup is beautiful.Now all I could wish for is an even bigger one to become available, so we can make more corn cakes at a time. This has taken it's place on my 'wall of honor' above my stove where I always keep two pots and pans to have at the ready. The only thing keeping me using my here-to-fore beloved green pan wok is that the skillet is so small. I need something bigger for some meals I make.
