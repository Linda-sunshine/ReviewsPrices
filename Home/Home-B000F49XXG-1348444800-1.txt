review/summary: Fantastic Espresso Makerreview/text: I have had this espresso maker for just over 6 months and I love it. I use it on average about 5 times a week with Lavazza espresso pods, making roughly 1.5oz shots. Produces a nice creama, though not nearly as much as shown in some of the user submitted pictures. However its enough that after drinking a shot, the walls of the espresso shot will be coated.To bring the machine up to temperature, I tend to use the approach of passing water through it a few times. This also helps to clean out the system from previous use. You will notice that sometimes (even after prewarming it for a long time or with water rinses), the temperature light wont stay on for very long when you are actually making your espresso. But have no worries, because even if the light turns off at the beginning, your espresso will still be piping hot. And remember that Caffeine is very water soluble, so the extreme temperatures are not really needed to get the most caffeine out.That aside, this is a fantastic little machine that makes delicious espresso. There is a Lavazza cafe right down the street from me, and I actually think the espresso from this machine tastes better. If you have ever been to Italy, it will bring back fine memories
