review/summary: Extremely Happy!review/text: I recently got two dogs, umm they were not potty trained and now they are. However, they've left horrible stains and messes in my playroom. I though I would have to replace my carpet. I'm very happy that I got this machine, and it literally cleaned the cr@p out of my dirty carpet. I had to go over the spots about 3 or 4 times (because I wanted to make sure everything was super clean). I think the average carpet needs 1 or 2 passes. I could've rented a machine for 1/2 of what this one cost, but I own this one and can use it anytime, anyday!!! Thank Goodness :)
