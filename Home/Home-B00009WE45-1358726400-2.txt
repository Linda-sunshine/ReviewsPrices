review/summary: Commercial Waterproof Thermometerreview/text: Not so waterproof, I washed it upon arrival to use it to cook a roast. I didn't even submerge it in water and the digital readout could not be read because of moisture or condensation built up inside covering the readout. Removed the battery and put the thermometer in the sun for a couple of hours and the condensation dissipated. Cooked with the thermometer and it worked well and the temp. displayed was quite accurate. There are alot of choices in thermometers out there and I would try a different one if I need to purchase again.
