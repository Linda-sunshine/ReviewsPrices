review/summary: VERY DISAPPOINTEDreview/text: I just don't get it. I was satisfied at first. Yes, it is very loud but that didn't matter to me as the suction was good. HOWEVER, for some reason the hose suction is nil. I have to pick up what I am going for and put it inside the hose. This makes is somewhat worthless to me. I have had it for a couple of years but hardly used it.
