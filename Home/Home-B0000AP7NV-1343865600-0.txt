review/summary: It's ok but!review/text: This Brita water pitcher is ok when it comes to its size and filtering of water, BUT you have to pour the water very slowly otherwise some runs down the filter itself and unto the floor or countertop. I wouldn't buy it again. I don't know if the same problem exists with the other sizes, so I may try a different size.
