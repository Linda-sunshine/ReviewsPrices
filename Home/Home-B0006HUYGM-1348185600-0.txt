review/summary: Just perfect. Not heavy or noisy, with excellent motorized brushreview/text: For what it does, it's not heavy or noisy, like many people said. The motorized brush works perfectly. It would be perfect if they actually sell a simple long handle which can be added to an existing hole at the back side. Would make it better than my house vacuum.
