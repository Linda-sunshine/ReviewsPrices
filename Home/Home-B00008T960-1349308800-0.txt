review/summary: great for fondant, doughs & baking anything!review/text: For years I have seen this product in stores. After buying one and using it over & over again, I am a believer. Great for candies, chocolates, fondant, dough, bread, you name it. I never had a great place to roll out pie dough...now I do. Bake anything on it and it wipes clean. Fondant peels right off, royal icing cake decorations too. Nothing sticks on it, I love it. I don't have to buy parchment paper anymore..so it saves money in the long run. I also don't need to ever grease a pan with butter or pam, which saves more money. Saves time too, washing-pans only need a rinse instead of a soak & scrub.
