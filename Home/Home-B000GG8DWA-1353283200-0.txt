review/summary: Nice heater for the price.review/text: I have two of these and they heat up the room quite nicely. A little bit of a plastic smell when they first heat up out of the box, but that goes away after a while and now I notice no odor. The one in my bathroom is older and tends to overheat with both coils on since the room is so small so I just keep that one on one coil.
