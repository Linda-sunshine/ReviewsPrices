review/summary: Perfect cup of coffeereview/text: Seems the Senseo choices are getting farther and farther between, or else they are just selling really well. Was concerned they would disappear at some point, and our Senseo machine would be worthless. Had tried the duck-style product for your own coffee, but really didn't like it. The machine wouldn't stop and there was no light froth on the top. With these, it works perfectly. Add whatever coffee we want, and it works just like a pod, with a light froth. Only down side is you have to dump the coffee which may make some mess, vs. pods. We use the pods mostly, but will have these for backups if we are out, or want another coffee.
