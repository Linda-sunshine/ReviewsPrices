review/summary: Great productreview/text: Very well thought-out product. They did not leave a single stone unturned. Has everything you would need, just read the directions, do a couple of practice runs, and play around with the temp of the water and the bean you are using. Some like it at 200, some at 175. First thing I did was find the temp that the bean tasted best at and then practiced it on my microwave so I know exactly 1 min and 45 seconds gives me water thats 175 so I have one less step to do in the morning. The last thing I did was grind a weeks worth of beans. This way I get up, pop in the water, pour the grind in and go. Very easy cleanup. I am used to taking apart a Bialletti every morning, sometimes 3 times a morning. This is soooooo much easier! No burnt after taste on my espresso, now I just have to figure out how to get the crema. Invert?
