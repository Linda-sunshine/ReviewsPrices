review/summary: Love this press!review/text: I got tired of replacing those glass French Presses. Those things just fall apart after a while. So I went ahead and bought this one instead. It's nice not to have to baby the press, like I use to with the glass version. This press can hold it's heat well, so be careful. Press time is also different due to the temperature difference, vs the older glass one. Did I say I love this thing? Guess what...I love this thing!
