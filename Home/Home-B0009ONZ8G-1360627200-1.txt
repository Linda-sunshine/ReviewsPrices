review/summary: Hoover has priorities right for a cheap vacuumreview/text: I have a 700.00 Oreck with the 21 year warranty. That vacuum was worth every penny. But I needed a backup for when my Oreck is in the shop. And I am so impressed with this Hoover.Honestly when I'm buying a cheapo vacuum all I care about is that it eliminates dust and particles so we can breathe.This vacuum is very heavy, clunky, and not a great turning radius, and won't last more than a few years.But it ELIMINATES dust with its **powerful** motor. So I think it's an awesome deal for 75.00 because Hoover knows what the priority is.If you buy a cheap vacuum you can't have it all. But with this one you can be clean and allergy free. And that's what matters.
