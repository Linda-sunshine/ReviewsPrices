review/summary: deserves half a star for performance and a negative one for the company for sending duplicate stuff.review/text: It was clearly cheating. The blender worked for precisely 3 months and then died. I called Cuisinart and an extremely rude customer service representative answered the phone and told me to find a number on the blender which is not there.There is one simple explanation and it is that they sent me duplicate stuff .
