review/summary: ITS GREAT!review/text: I guess the products you get may be defected because of the ratings I've read so far about how it makes a loud noise. I just got mine to work and it's been very quiet with the setting on low. I smoke in my room often and with a window open, the smell of the cigarette just vanishes instantly with the use of this product. An ideal air purifier with easy to clean access for the price.
