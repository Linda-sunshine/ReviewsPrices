review/summary: 13 Years of faithful Service..review/text: We received our Pizza Pizzazz as a Birthday present 13 years ago. We used it at least 5 times a week, not only for pizza. We used it for most of our quick oven needs. From french fries and crispy crowns to hot wings. Sadly ours died, I almost wanted to cry. I just ordered a new one, cause our home just wouldn't be the same without it.
