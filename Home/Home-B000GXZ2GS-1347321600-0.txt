review/summary: great value and good tastereview/text: Bought this because my office moved farther away from the office espresso bar and it's working great. Wife likes the taste also. We took it on a trip and had espresso in the hotel room (way better than the crappy hotel coffee). Also using regular grind is nice. I feel like the stirrer could have been integrated into the scoop somehow (and in fact in the hotel the stirrer got lost in my my bag and I did use the other end of the scoop - later found the stirrer, but not sure why it's necessary).
