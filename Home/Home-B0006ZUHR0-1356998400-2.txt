review/summary: Expected much more from Black & Deckerreview/text: I strongly agree with the reviews regarding the water cover. It keeps on opening and feels very cheap.Though it's overall a good iron, it isn't worth the price. The worst design flaw is the cover, but my biggest concern is its effectiveness. My previous Braun iron could get much warmer and therefore was twice as effective when it came to cotton clothes.I do think that the LED display is useful and I appreciate that it never sticks to the clothes (at least it never has during the 14 months I've been using it).
