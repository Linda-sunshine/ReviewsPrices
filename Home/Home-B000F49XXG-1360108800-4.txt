review/summary: Great starter machine, but spend more on a grinderreview/text: I knew very little about espresso when I bought this, but I knew I wanted to get into it. There's a few craft coffee shops around here that make amazing latte art, and I wanted that at home.The internals of this machine seem to do just fine, and after two months I still don't see any fault in that. Others are right: the steam wand is short, but you can't get too fancy with it anyways. The built-in tamper isn't worth your time, so buy a 52mm one with the machine.If all you care about is cappuccinos or Starbucks lattes, this machine will be good enough for you as-is.If you're a hobbyist or obsessive (like me), and your goal is to make smooth lattes or straight espresso, there are a few potential downsides:- The FILTER BASKETS are pressurized (meaning it creates resistance even if the coffee isn't properly ground), but the pressurizer can be removed for those wanting to hone their skills more. I've replaced the basket altogether with a Delonghi 607706 (from another model); it took a bit of handsaw work to modify the portafilter, but now it's bottomless, so I can diagnose my shots visually.- NOTE: If you use an unpressurized basket, your grind becomes really important, because grind consistency and adjustability is key. The rule of thumb is that if you spend 100 on the espresso machine, you'll probably want to spend 150 (or more) on the grinder. I have an old Capresso Infinity (~$90), and I'm looking to replace it with a $350-ish grinder (like the Rancilio Rocky doserless).- The STEAM WAND doesn't let you create latte art-quality microfoam. I've since replaced it with the steam wand from the Rancilio Silvia (v1 or v2; v3 won't fit), which wasn't a trivial task, but worth it. That wand gives it a lot more reach, and it upgrades you to a steam wand that you can't normally get until you pay several hundred dollars on a machine.
