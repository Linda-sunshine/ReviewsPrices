review/summary: Great for the moneyreview/text: We wanted to up the ante on our coffee experience once we got a nice espresso machine, so we made the switch from a blade grinder to a burr grinder. This machine works really well. We're very happy with it. It does require regular cleaning, as the grounds get caught up where they come out into the catcher. This part is difficult to clean. But other than that, a great little tool for a nice cup of coffee.
