review/summary: Don't buy it!review/text: After about 7 months of using this machine, the coffee comes out barely warm. I have the temperature set on the hottest setting, but I now have to microwave the coffee to get it to be hot enough to drink. I'm very disappointed with this machine because it was extremely expensive and I just want a good, hot cup of coffee.Also, the taste of the coffee starts to lose strength as well over time. I grind my beans daily but it doesn't make any difference now. My mom bought a cheap, $20.00 coffee maker and it makes better coffee than this machine. Don't waste your money, you will be disappointed within the year!
