review/summary: Good, but....review/text: We have had this grinder for a few years now and it works great and my husband likes it for his daily french pressed coffee. But, I wish it was designed better to not create so much mess! There is a significant amount of coffee that gets trapped in and behind the cup that is meant to catch the coffee. It is impossible not to get grounds all over your counter. It is a constant clean up issue, which makes it problemmatic.If there is an equally good grinder that contains the coffee better, I will look for it if and when this one quits. For now, it is high maintenance.
