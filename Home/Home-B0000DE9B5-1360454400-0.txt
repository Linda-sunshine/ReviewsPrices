review/summary: Goodreview/text: I bought this because I wanted a glass pitcher that sealed conveniently. It meets those two criteria just like it says it will. The lid is an unusual design that takes two hands to seal (hold the outer part of the lid still while turning the handle on the inner part), but it's not some complicated mechanism with tiny spaces that makes it hard to clean. It seals tightly; I've turned the pitcher upside down while it is partially filled just to test it and nothing leaked out.The reason for four stars instead of five is because of the way it pours. The spout requires slow pouring - very slow in my experience. Tipping it too far too quickly results in its contents dribbling down the front of the pitcher, which is annoying. That threshold seems low to me - it pours without spilling at less than half the rate I'm used to pouring things.
