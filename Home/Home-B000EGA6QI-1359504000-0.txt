review/summary: Cuisineart CSB-76BC Smartstick 200-Watt immersion Hand Blender, Brushedreview/text: The Smart Stick was recommended to me by my sister in Germany. She enjoys it so much. Now I found the Smartstick here in the States and purchased one. I use it mainly for my daily smoothies, mashed potatoes, soups, tomato sauce, and more. I recommend it highly. It is so easy to clean and to handle, since there are just two pieces to put together.Rita Malsch
