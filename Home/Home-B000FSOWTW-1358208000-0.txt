review/summary: wife LOVES itreview/text: OK, after reading many reviews (and focusing on the negative ones of course) I chose to go ahead and get this. My wife's had it a month now(and has been well used over the past month). She is very happy with it and works like a charm.I think that there are some givens:1) you shouldn't plan on just plowing forward in using this... monitor your cork as it extracts. shredded corks are seldom the cause of a corkscrew and almost always the cause of an old or bad cork.2) read the instructions. This will make your experience a positive on (sans defective hardware).3) only a food would use any automated corkscrew on a super-nice bottle of wine. The only way is the good ol' fashioned way of doing it manually! this gives you total control and will aide in preventing a shredded cork.4) charge fully before use... read the directions...5) never try to use on a bottle with a screw-top cap. (then again, what are you doing to yourself anyway???)6) the faux cork... go for it head-long... you can't shred that thing if you had to.in summary... it's a pretty darn good product that will make HER happy... as Nike says, JUST DO IT!
