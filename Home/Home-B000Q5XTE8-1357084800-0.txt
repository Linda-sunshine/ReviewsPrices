review/summary: Deceiving Descriptionreview/text: This chair is much smaller than the chair it is replacing. It is NOT an &#34;Executive, high-back chair&#34;...it is more like a conference room chair. My mistake was not measuring the old chair before ordering this one. I am 6 ft, 245 lbs. I work 10 hour days from home, and most of those hours are sitting at my desk. On this chair, my butt aches after about 2 hours. It is NOT the comfortable chair others have described on this site. Disappointing...
