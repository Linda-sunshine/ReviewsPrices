review/summary: Good Skilletreview/text: I bought this skillet about six months ago for my new apartment, and I do use it pretty often (which is easy, since it's the only large one I have). It still doesn't seem fully seasoned, yet, though. Food still sticks, and I have to scrub the stuck-on food with the rough side of a sponge each time I use it. However, I read that it takes a long time for cast iron to be fully seasoned. It is a little annoying to have to grease it up after each use (I use coconut oil), but I really wanted to avoid synthetic pans.Most of all, I'm glad I chose this larger size (in comparison to the 10 inch one). Even though I just cook for my partner and I, I usually cook a lot of food for leftovers, so the larger size is necessary.I also have the dutch oven with the top also serving as a skillet, which I also enjoy!
