review/summary: Great alarm clock!review/text: Love everything about this clock radio. Easy to program, love the dual alarms (I use one for weekdays, one for weekends). Especially love the way the alarm increases in volume if you don't shut it off right away. Also like being able to choose from 90, 60, or 30 minute timer for automatic shut-off at night. You're not getting fine stereo sound, but that's not the purpose of this clock radio. Does the job at a reasonable price.
