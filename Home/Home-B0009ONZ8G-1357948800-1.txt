review/summary: WOW - Awesome, Very Reasonably Priced Vacuumreview/text: Just got this today and I LOVE it. I knew my current 3-year old vacuum (a bagless Bissell) was not picking up as it should even though I cleaned it after nearly every use (plus what's the use of a bagless when the dust goes everywhere when you empty the cartridge). Anyhow, after my first couple back-and-forths with the Hoover Tempo, I could tell my carpet was really getting clean. It was pulling the pile up and when I finished it looked like I had shampooed the carpet! We have a chihuahua and I knew there was hair getting left behind by my Bissell, but, oh my gosh - when I took the bag off the Hoover Tempo after going over all my floors (small living room and 3 bedrooms) I was compelled to snip the bag open just to see what it picked up. The bag was absolutely FULL - dust, hair, and yuck!!! I had so much fun vacuuming with this Hoover and seeing what it picked up that I might just vacuum again tomorrow! Love that my carpet looks nearly new and it even feels softer to walk on. Hopefully with this awesome vacuum I'll do less dusting the furniture since it sure picked up everything! If you're considering any vacuum - get the Hoover Tempo!
