review/summary: Fortunately I have had the opportunity to read the book!!review/text: I have had the opportunity to read this book in the school for class reading matter. At the beginning it was a little boring but then the story becomes very exciting. It describes a imaginary life where there are rules that are never possible in our world. The part that I like more is when Jonas receives the memories from the Giver. It is a very nice passage where the author describes in what kind of world the people live there. It's a perfect book for adults and also for children.
