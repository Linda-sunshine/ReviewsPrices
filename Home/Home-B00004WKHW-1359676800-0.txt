review/summary: Excellent productreview/text: This is the second Cuisinart Mini I've owned.The first one lasted about 5 yrs. It still works just fine but I broke the lid, the keywords being &#34;I broke it&#34; It wasn't caused by any defect in the lid . I'm sure I'll get 5 yrs+ yrs use from this one also. And since I've learned that the plastic lid is no match for a hot and heavy cast iron dutch oven being dropped on it, ( This is where you say Duhhhh ! !) I hopefully won't break this one. I use it on a daily basis.
