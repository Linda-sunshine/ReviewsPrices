review/summary: Great Little Percolatorreview/text: I have had this percolator for a few years now, and it's still going strong! I highly prefer percolated coffee, and everyone who has tried mine has said it is great. Everything about this percolator (except for the sub-par plastic cap and metal fitting) seems high quality.The only problem I have had is that the plastic top that came with the percolator long since deteriorated. It was yellow and cracked, and had apparently shrunk, as it no longer fit the lid at all and just lifted/fell out. I was about ready to toss the percolator due to this, until I found the Fitz-All Replacement Percolator Top. It is an attractive glass top (with metal ring), that fits my percolator like it was made for it. It has been used about once or twice a week for almost 6 months now, and is still in like-new condition. Why doesn't the percolator come standard with this top? It has greatly extended the life of my percolator.Fitz-All Replacement Percolator Top, Small
