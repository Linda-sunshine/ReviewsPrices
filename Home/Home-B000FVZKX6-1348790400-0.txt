review/summary: AMAZING!review/text: I received my order within 6 days of purchase and was very pleased with the product. I washed the sheets in the laundry detergent that keeps the color dark, and I had no fading. They are so beautiful and fit like a charm. I love the quality. They didn't shrink, wrinkle, fade and they are warm and soft. I wish there was more quality like this on amazon. totally satisfied.
