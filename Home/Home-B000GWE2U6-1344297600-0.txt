review/summary: Helps dry-cough from AZ dust & keeps room cool!review/text: I live in Arizona - this cool mist humidifier is the only non-medication product that helps my dry-cough allergies from dust. It also helps keep my room cool - I just put it behind my fan and it blows out cool air. I have noticed that this model (elephant) requires you to dial up the level high in order for the cool mist to come out vs. the frog model that only requires the dial to be set at low to get a good amount of mist to come out.
