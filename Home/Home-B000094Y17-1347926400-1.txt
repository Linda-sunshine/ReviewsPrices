review/summary: terriblereview/text: The ergonomics are terrible, the lid falls off at the slightest angle, the filter also dislodges at moderate angles, and it lets carbon bits get EVERYWHERE. Worst Brita model by far.Do yourselves a favor and buy theBrita Marina Complete Water Filtration Pitcher, Clear/Whiteinstead. I bought it as a replacement for the Grand, and every day feel a sense of great relief.
