review/summary: defective designreview/text: I wanted a small sized food chopper for everyday cooking,so after a lot of looking over the net and reading great reviews about this product went ahead and ordered this chopper from amazon.As always received it in no time,but just after a couple of uses,i'm disappointed with this chopper.I've used black and decker products earlier and i find them good,but not this one.I used this chopper to chop ginger,garlic,chunks of onion and tomatoes and other veggies.As many others have mentioned,chunks of veggies that naturally go beneath the blade,DO NOT chop!Basically it fails in doing the job.And the other pain is the CLEANING part.The upper part that holds the motor,which comes in contact with food while chopping,cannot be washed.All i could do is clean it with a wet paper towel.The food stuck in the fine crevices of the screw doesnt come-off and poses a hygiene problem while reusing.I've stopped using this chopper now.Im now ordering a procter silex food chopper which i've used everyday for a long time earlier.Though it dies quickly, atleast it's great as long as it works.For the price(14$ on amazon)its not expensive to reorder.
