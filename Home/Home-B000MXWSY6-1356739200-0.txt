review/summary: Great clockreview/text: This is a fantastic clock. I bought one for myself and a second for my wife a few months later. With LED brightness adjustment, easy alarm setting and 2 seperate alarm times this is a fantastic clock. I would have preferred red LEDs but aside from that this is a great unit.
