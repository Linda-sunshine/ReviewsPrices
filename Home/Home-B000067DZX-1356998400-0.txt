review/summary: Makes great waterreview/text: If you're buying this, it means you own a PUR water pitcher of some kind and don't have much choice about your filter purchase. Same here. But these make great tasting water, last fairly long, and are relatively inexpensive. I only gave it 4 stars, because I just can't get excited enough about a water filter to give it 5 stars. I don't have any complaints.
