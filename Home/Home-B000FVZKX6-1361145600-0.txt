review/summary: Quality SOFT deep pocket sheetsreview/text: I ordered a pair of flannel sheets from overstock and enjoyed them so much I couldnt resist ordering these. These are even higher quality than the overstock ones. They are extremely soft and warm and just all around amazing! The fitted sheet is large and fits even the thickest mattress. Mine is about 15&#34; and it fit with plenty of extra room. The flat sheet is extra large as well. They are such great sheets!!
