review/summary: it works goodreview/text: Im not as impressed as some others, Takes time to work out wrinkles, only reaches up so high, I have 110&#34; curtains, and cant reach up all the way. but for steaming stuff man is it hot and heats fast. If I had it to do all over I'd use the hand held version, or one like this that was metal, not plastic. Overall good value
