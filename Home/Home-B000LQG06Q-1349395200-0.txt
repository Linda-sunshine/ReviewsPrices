review/summary: Sleep Studioreview/text: Im not sure how others would feel, but for me and at the price I bought it for, its actually very nice. It makes a WORLD of difference and I sleep very well. Had I known it would have been this good, I probably would have spent the extra 20 dollars and went for 3 inches or more because that would have probably felt like heaven literally. But the 2 inches works really good as well, so Im pretty happy. Its defiently worth it if you have a crappy bed. My bed feels brand new. No regrets. Good buy.
