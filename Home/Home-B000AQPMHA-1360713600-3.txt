review/summary: Poor quality and customer servicereview/text: Product received December 7, 2012. We took good care of it and on February 13, 2013 it quit working. What ever pumps the water from the brewer up to the opening on top has stopped working. I thought I could open the bottom to see what is the problem. I think I found it however, no where on there web site does it have where you can buy parts! That is right no where on [...] where I can buy internal parts. The only reason a owner can not work on the internal parts of this is so they have to purchase a new one thus company fraud!
