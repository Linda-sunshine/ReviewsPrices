review/summary: Hard to clean for a spice grinderreview/text: As people have mentioned before, this product does a good job grinding spices, but is very difficult to clean. The particles become stuck to or embedded in the plastic lid. Whatever spice you ground ends up "contaminating" the next spice you grind. I've read that grinding a half cup of rice will help... but why would I want to waste a half cup of rice every time I want to grind some spices???All-in-all it works ok and I'll make due until I come across something better enough to compel me to replace it.
