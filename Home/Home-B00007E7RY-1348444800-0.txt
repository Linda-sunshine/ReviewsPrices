review/summary: Great air filter/background noise machinereview/text: I had experience with this model before, and although at first it appeared noisy, the white noise grew on me. It blocked out the outside noise of NYC streets. Over the course of 3 years I used the last one (It was on loan), it worked without any problems. The main complaint is the bright light. It is hellish and was a major pain in my sleepy eyes.Now in a new apartment closer to the street, I wanted a machine to do three things: 1. Circulate the air in my room. 2. Filter the air. 3. Create ample background noise to block of the traffic and train noise. I was able to purchase one machine that does all three. So far I'm very happy. As to the light? I've taped a piece of foil over the control panel that I flip back to turn on the purifier and flip back to cover the light. It works well enough and doesn't flap in the wind.
