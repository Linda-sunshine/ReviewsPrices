review/summary: HOME figurine: Captures Precious Moment, Versatile in Any Decorreview/text: If you already have one child waiting for a little brother or sister, add the Joyful Child for a nice grouping with the Home figurine! Willow Tree figurines look like very nice wood carvings, but actually, they are made of resin in China, but still show the knife marks from the original clay mold. I love that the faces are left blank because it enables one to project yourself as the figures depicted. The subtle coloring makes it versatile enough that it works with any decor, and in any room.This gift was very well received by the expectant couple I sent it to. They say it arrived in top quality and is so sweet, with the father placing the hand on the mother... reminds you of what a precious miracle it is when you feel the baby kick.The way the artist captures a moment in time--those moments that are the special ones--conveys just the right emotions. I've never met her, but I'm awed by her. What a God-given talent she is blessed with!
