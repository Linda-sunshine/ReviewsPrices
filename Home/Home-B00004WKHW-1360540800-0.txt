review/summary: Great for what it is, but could be betterreview/text: Don't get me wrong. This product works like it should but there are features you can get with a higher end product. These include a different blade design to gives you more time to go from start to pulverized. Just takes some getting used to. Also remember this is a mini-prep so it is on the small side. Still a great product!
