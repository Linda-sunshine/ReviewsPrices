review/summary: Good for making individual smoothiesreview/text: This is my first hand-blender and it does its job pretty well. I've used it mostly for soups or making individual smoothies. I have a regular blender too but this is much more easier, cleaner and fun. It purees to a smooth consistency. I also use the measuring cup it comes up. Clean-up is fairly easy (just fill the measuring cup with soapy water and stick in the blender to clean). It is a bit top-heavy so it does not stand up right without tipping over at times (especially if the cord gets pulled on something), but that is easily fixed by storing it lying down. It would be nice if it was rechargable / cordless. Overall, a good purchase.
