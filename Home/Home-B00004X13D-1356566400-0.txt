review/summary: great for at home waffles for tworeview/text: You need to tweak your recipe a bit to work best with this machine, but this baker works well! Not a high output, but great for couple waffles on a sunday morning. I like mine a bit bit crisp on the outside so I leave em in a little longer than suggested in the instructions.
