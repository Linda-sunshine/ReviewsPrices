review/summary: Good chair, doing the work...review/text: The chair is very convenient and is exactly what I expected.The assembly process is straight forward and it took me about 30 minutes to assemble it.The only reason I gave it four stars is that one of the handle is not strait, however this is not a big deal and I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it back.
