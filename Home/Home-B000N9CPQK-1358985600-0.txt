review/summary: LOUD!!!review/text: I am going to return this, the description said it was very quiet and it isn't. It also seems to make the room very cool. If you're not planning on running it overnight while you are sleeping, I suppose it's a good deal, but for now we are running it with our bedroom door closed and have to turn it off before we try to go to sleep.
