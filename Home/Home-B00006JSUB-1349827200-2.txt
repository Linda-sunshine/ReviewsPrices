review/summary: Well worth the pricereview/text: I love this iron skillet. I had purchased one before at some cheap store and it got rusty in a matter of days, everything burnt in it also.This iron skillet makes the best grilled veggies, seared meats. I use enough olive oil so the food doesn't stick. The only set back is that the handle gets very hot, so i have to remember not to touch it. It is very heavy too, but it's made out of iron after all! Over all, great price, great product. I purchased a 8 inch skillet also, i'm thinking to get the 10 inch as well.
