review/summary: Its okreview/text: If you have a nice set of chef knives, this is not for you. It works but doesn't leave a clean look to the metal. I'm just concerned as to how long the blades will last if I keep using it the way that it is after its been sharpened. Not only the durability concerns me but the metal it self and if bacteria will grow in between the grinded lines (something like this). Anyways I know that Costco has something just like this for $40 (Chef Pro)I think.
