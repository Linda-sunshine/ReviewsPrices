review/summary: Would be fantasticreview/text: Husband and I got this for our wedding. I was thrilled to make about eight smoothies, slushies and even ice cream.Husband went to crush some ice, as it is one of the features. With the ice, he happened to add drink mix. While blending, sticky ice slosh spewed out of the bottom.Every time I've used it since the leak escalated. I see a lot of similar complaints.This wasn't from mal-use; it was only on it's ninth cycle. If part of the design was to crush ice, then in no part should my husband be at fault for using like it was designed.Meh. I really wanted a smoothie today too.
