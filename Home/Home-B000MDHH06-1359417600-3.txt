review/summary: Great product for a great pricereview/text: This juicer has turned out to be my new favorite appliance. I did some research before I bought a juicer as to what kind of power and features to look for, and this one fit the bill perfectly, for a very reasonable amount of money too! It's super fast, extremely efficient (the pulp is incredibly dry and finely shredded), and VERY EASY TO CLEAN! This makes it so easy to get all your fruits and vegetables for the day, in a delicious beverage. Love this thing, would recommend it to anyone.
