review/summary: Kitchen Aid WINS Vs Ninja Proreview/text: I wish I had gotten this first instead of the Ninja Pro. I was sucked in by the aggressive Ninja marketing, what can I say?I primarily use it for frozen fruit smoothies and it gets daily use, so I wanted something powerful, sturdy, and easy to to use/clean.Compared to the Ninja, this is a dream to use. Its so simple and user friendly. The cover seals great and yet is easy to remove (the Ninja cover is ridiculously and unnecessarily complex), the pitcher is easily rinsed out after use. I was worried that it wouldn't have the power I wanted compared to the Ninja, but its great. This is even with a big hunk of solid frozen fruit/ice that I couldn't break up by hand so I just threw the whole thing in there to see how it would handle it. It is technically not as powerful, yet it works actually quicker I think because of the simpler blade design. I used to have to run the Ninja longer because the blades would throw everything around so much.The other design element that I love is that it has drain holes in the pitcher so when its upside down in the dishwasher, the water doesn't stay in the base. So smart! This was something I hated in my old blender and in the Ninja.Its also fits nicely on the counter under my cabinets which the Ninja didn't.
