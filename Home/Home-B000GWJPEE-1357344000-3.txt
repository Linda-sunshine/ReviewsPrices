review/summary: Product failed on first usereview/text: Despite the wide range of reviews, I took a chance on the Penguin model for my son's room. The humidifier repeatedly failed on the first day. It ran for 5-10 minutes and shut off. The 'tank empty' red light came on. After checking the valve and resetting the water tank, the unit worked ran for another 5-10 minutes and then shut off. After four or five additional attempts to get the humidifier working, I came to the conclusion that I'd received a faulty unit. Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy for defective products.
