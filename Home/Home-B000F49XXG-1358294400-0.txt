review/summary: Makes expresso's well but size is an issue.review/text: This machine is great with all of its capabilities in making coffee and frothing. However, the size of the machine doesn't allow you to really fit any larger size cups, but the very small espresso cups. If you are a daily coffee drinker and you expect to drink plenty of coffee from the machine, you might want to look into something else.
