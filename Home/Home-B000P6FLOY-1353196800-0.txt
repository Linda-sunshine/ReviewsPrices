review/summary: Went Haywire 3 Months Laterreview/text: We have had two of these thermometers. The first lasted two years then began sending meaningless data. The second lasted only three months - then went haywire. Kept displaying "Hi" immediately after inserting probe into the base. Would not recommend product.WSC
