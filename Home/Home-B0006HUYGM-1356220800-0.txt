review/summary: VERY IMPRESSED !review/text: For the price, you really can't beat this thing. I have an upright and a canister vac, but wanted a handheld for quick pick ups and for furniture and hard to reach places. First of all, this thing is built like a tank. I am very impressed with the quality, seems almost industrial quality versus for home use. It's like a power tool. Suction is amazing, to the point where you will find yourself getting "stuck" to some furniture when vacuuming. Just get it, you will be happy. :)
