review/summary: Easy Cookingreview/text: We have only had this unit for a couple of weeks but most of our meals for that time came from the Cuisinart pressure cooker and they have been excellent. It is easy to use and easy to clean up. Food cooks fast and that is why we wanted to try out a pressure cooker. Excellent buy
