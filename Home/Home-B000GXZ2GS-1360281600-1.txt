review/summary: defective! not the Aeropress I had beforereview/text: I am so disappointed. I switched to an Aeropress more than 5 years ago, and used the one we bought on Amazon almost every day without a problem. Eventually the rubber on the plunger didn't make as good a seal, and would leak coffee back up around it into the tube. So I ordered a new one here on Amazon. The new Aeropress is a smoky plastic with cup increments marked on it. Right out of the box we had problems. The hot brew water squirts back up around the rubber plunger, runs out the sides, makes a huge mess. It's a disaster. Really disappointed in the quality. And yes, we follow the directions as to grind and amounts and technique, we've been using one for years without any issues.
