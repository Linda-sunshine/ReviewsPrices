review/summary: Best Thermo MUG EVER....hands downreview/text: I have had mine for a couple years now. The only thing I would change is that I would make it hold 4-8 ounces more. Other than that, the lid works great, the pop top is awesome, I could go on and on. If anyone has issues with this product I would lean towards user error more than anything. I have compared this to many other Thermo style mugs... this one is the best. Easy to clean, easy to open and close, extra saftey latch.... BUY IT
