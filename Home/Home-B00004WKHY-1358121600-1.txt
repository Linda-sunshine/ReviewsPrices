review/summary: It was a gift for my daughter!review/text: When I got in touch with my daughter about the food processor she said they had not used but one time but it did what they wanted it for, they figure they'll get a lot more use out of it after the harvest this summer, but they seem to like it so far and are looking forward to getting a lot of usage from it. They won't have to cut up so many vegetables, let the machine do it.
