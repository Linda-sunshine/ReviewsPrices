review/summary: Quite the Nice Little Machinereview/text: Our purchase of this machine happened because of an accident I made in the grocery store. I picked up a bag of coffee beans instead of ground coffee. My wife and I are coffee lovers. Morning is terrible without coffee. They used to say coffee is bad for your health. Some information I read on it almost went to the point of saying; &#34;Drink one cup and you'll flop over dead!&#34; I told my wife &#34; I don't care, I'll die with a smile on my face.&#34; We decided to try grinding our own coffee. We have now turned our backs on the ground coffee you find in the grocery store. Fresh ground coffee is wonderful.I apologize for my rant there. Organizations that try to scare you through sensationalism irritate me.This is a nice little machine that does it's job well. My wife really likes how easy it is to clean. It has helped us develop a great appreciation for ground coffee. We have used this for several months now. It has performed flawlessly. If there were any problems with it I'd say so because we both become highly agitated when something happens that interferes with our enjoyment of coffee.
