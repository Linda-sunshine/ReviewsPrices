review/summary: No More Trips To The Microwave!review/text: I bought this warmer for my husband and he liked it so much I decided to try it out myself. I like to have one to two cups of coffee at work. I was finding myself either having to drink cold coffee (getting distracted with work I'd neglect my cup) or make trips to the microwave to re-warm. Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer has eliminated that problem!First thing upon arrival at work I turn the warmer on. I then go make my first cup. I also have ceramic mugs, which is key to this warmer working its best. I don't think plastic or rubber based mugs would work as well, if at all. My husband reports that since switching to a ceramic mug he too has found this warmer way more effective and been much happier with it. My coffee is placed on the warmer piping hot and the warmer is usually getting pretty toasty by the time I've made my first cup and settled in. The warmer doesn't keep the coffee steaming hot, but it really shines at keeping my half drunk cup nice and warm for an extended amount of time. It also doesn't ruin the coffee by being too hot.The warmer itself gets pretty hot, which is to be expected. You need to be careful not to touch the warmer when it's on. I'm not sure it would cause a bad burn, but it certainly would sting and not feel so good. I wouldn't recommend having or using one of these where you might accidentally knock your hand into it easily, or with kids around.For the price, this warmer is totally worth it. I can now sip my coffee at my leisure without it being stone cold by the end.
