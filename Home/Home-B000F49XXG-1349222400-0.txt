review/summary: ESPRESSO MAKER STOPPED WORKING AFTER LESS THAN A YEAR (TWICE!!!)review/text: I purchased this product from Amazon in December 2010. In October 2011 (less than a year later), the product started shooting out steam everywhere as soon as I turned it on. I called the company and they said that since it had been less than a year, they would replace it. I had to pay a $15 shipping charge but they did send me a new machine. In September 2012, less than a year after the second one was replaced, the espresso maker broke again. I turned it on and steam came shooting out from the entire machine and it looked like it was going to explode. I called the company and they said that there was nothing they could do since they had already sent me a replacement for the original. There is obviously a huge defect in the machine since I have now had two of them and they both broke in less than a year.
