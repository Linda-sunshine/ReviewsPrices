review/summary: Good but NOT Memory foam!!review/text: I bought a cheap mattress and could not sleep at all in that thing. It gave me terrrible back pain so I bought this topper. It really changed mi bed completely. It made a huge difference and I can sleep now. But it is really important to mention that is is NOT a Memory foam. Even though I like it, i was really disappointed that this was not what I bought. It is really bad that they fool people saying in it memory foam.
