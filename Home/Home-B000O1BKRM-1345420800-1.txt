review/summary: Chemical odorreview/text: The trays were fine for a few weeks or so. Then I noticed terrible taste in my beverage. It was from the ice. I thought our water supply was contaminated but later found the empty tray has a terrible chemical smell. It has to be some harmful plastic or vinyl. Trays are going out in the trash tonight! DON'T BUY!
