review/summary: Healthier Option For Popcorn Loversreview/text: Length:: 0:08 MinsAs you can tell from the short video this thing is kind of loud. Similar noise to a sweeper when it's on. This is a cheaper/healthier option for popcorn lovers since there isn't any oils and you can buy kernels in bulk for cheap. I bought a 2.8 lb container of Nice! Popping Corn for $3.49 at Walgreens. You only use a little less than half a cup each time you use it. Which equals out to about 29 servings. Normally I eat popcorn every night and I end up going through 3 boxes or more a week at about $4+ for a box of 3 individual packs. So there is an obvious savings right away. After you plug it in it will start up right away, so it's best to put the cover on and fill it before hand. There is a fill line inside to mark how many kernels you should pour in. It says not to exceed this and I have no plans of doing so. It only takes about 2 minutes to pop all the kernels, which is about the same time it takes for a regular bag. The unit gets very hot, which ir normal considering it's heated air in the unit. So be sure to leave it set out for a while to cool off. Now when you use this the popcorn is incredibly bland, so it's best to use the cup at the top to melt some butter to pour on after. If butter isn't your thing then it's best to get some popcorn seasoning. I'm still trying different seasoning to find one I really like so I'm not going to recommend any brand for that yet, however I'll update it later. This popper is very easy to use, cheap, effective and a healthy alternative for popcorn lovers. What's not to like?
