review/summary: Power usage!review/text: I am thinking of getting one of these, but was interested to know how many WATTS these bad-boys use. Well I called Presto and they told me that the Presto 02811 12-Cup Stainless Steel Coffee Maker uses 800 watts of power and the Presto 02822 6-Cup Stainless Steel Coffee Maker uses 500 watts. So if any of you are curious there ya go. Frankly I am surprised Amazon didn't have the brains to include such a useful piece of information in an age where we are all looking for products that do not use more energy then they need.
