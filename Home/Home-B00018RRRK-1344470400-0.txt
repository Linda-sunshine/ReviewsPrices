review/summary: 8 Years Old and Still Working Great!review/text: I bought my first Cuisinart DBM-8 Burr Grinder 8 years ago and have used it most everyday (except when on vacation) at least 2 times a day. Just bought my second one to have as a spare. After 8 years anything can wear out. I highly recommend this grinder. You can't go wrong with this purchase.
