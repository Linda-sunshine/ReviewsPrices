review/summary: Keeps our house smelling clean!review/text: We have 2 dogs and 2 cats. Even though the square footage of our house ( about 1900) exceeds the max capacity of this filter, it still does a great job of keeping smells and especially cat hair out of the air! Just have to remember to keep the filter clean!
