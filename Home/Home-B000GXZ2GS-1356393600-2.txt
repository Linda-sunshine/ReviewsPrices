review/summary: Super fast, super easy, really decent espressoreview/text: Takes less than 60 seconds to setup, fill with coffee & hot water (I have a water cooler that also dispenses hot water, so no time to heat), brew/stir 10 seconds, & press out a really decent cup of espresso (even with regular store-bought coffee). Probably another 60 seconds to empty the grounds and rinse clean. Can't beat this device for cost, ease of use/cleaning, quality of results.
