review/summary: Nice but not perfectreview/text: I really like it and have used it 15 or so times. The down side is a small one (well two) the top where you put the bread in will let heat out, but I knew that when I got it and a cutting board on top works just fine. Something that I didn't see in the review was the switch where you go from toaster to toaster oven won't stay on oven, it will move just a fraction and it makes the oven part go off so while I'm using the oven part I have to keep an eye on it to make sure it's toasting. But it really is a great product and the two small problems I found can be easily fixed and I don't know why Hamilton Beach hasn't fixed it yet, seeing how it is a crazy huge company.
