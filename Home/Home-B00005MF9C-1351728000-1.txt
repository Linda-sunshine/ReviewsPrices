review/summary: Handy little coffee maker.review/text: This is a great little coffee maker. I just deduct one star cause it feels a little flimsy/cheap but it works great. I have this in my office and it makes a super hot cup. The mug is very nice that comes with it too and keeps your coffee really hot. For the money, it's a great deal. I also like the reusable filter vs buying paper ones.
