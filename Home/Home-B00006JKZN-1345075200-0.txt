review/summary: Don't buy it!review/text: Unless you like spending tons of time scrapping cooked waffle batter off the "non-stick" grills, I would advise avoiding this product. It took me probably half an hour to clean the grills after the very first attempted waffle out of the box - so much for "non-stick"! To make matters worse, Cuisinart won't stand behind their products - they wanted me to spend more of my time and my money to ship this garbage back and also pay them $10 more to ship me a new one - not worth it for a $40 waffle maker - which is I'm sure what they had in mind. I for one will never buy Cuisinart anything again.
