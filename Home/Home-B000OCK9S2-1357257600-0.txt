review/summary: First one defective and returned, replacement also defectivereview/text: The radio came on when I pushed the POWER button, and played for a few seconds. Sound quality was nothing special, but it's a cheap radio and I didn't expect much. The &#34;sound therapy&#34; effects were disappointing, not very realistic and several are almost identical.The real problem, though, is that the first unit wouldn't switch back to RADIO, which is primarily what I ordered it for. Amazon was very good about replacing it--the new radio actually arrived before we shipped the old one--but the replacement has the same defect. I'm giving up on this one.
