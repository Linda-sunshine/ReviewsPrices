review/summary: "Old school" rules!review/text: As the proud and happy owner of a 5qt dutch oven, 3qt combo cooker, 10 1/4 skillet, a wonder skillet and two 6 1/2 inch skillets, I can say I'm happily addicted to Lodge cookware. The price is right, it cooks like a dream and clean up/maintenance is a cinch. I just wash with hot water, put it on the stove to heat it back up, wipe it down with olive oil, wait until it cools completely and I wipe it out again. Easy peasy non-stick goodness. Last night I made one of my favorite comfort foods, a chicken pot pie, in the 10 1/4 inch pan. I started it on the stove top and dropped it down into the oven once I put the crust on top and it was out of this world good. I love the versatility of the pieces, the combo cooker top doubles as a shallow skillet, the ability to use both on top of the stove and in the oven and the benefit of NO TEFLON to poison my food. Oh, and it is MADE IN THE USA!!! That all by itself makes me happy. :)Update: 2/21/13 I have since purchased the 8" skillet and the 2 qt Dutch oven. I am seriously in love &lt;3
