review/summary: very convenient for one person home or dorm roomreview/text: I updated from 4 to 5 stars as I really love this little coffee maker!Obviously, this is not top of the line--but your not paying for that. It's a simple little coffee pot that dispenses coffee right into a medium sized travel mug. It turns itself off as soon as it's done --which I LOVE. There is no heater where the cup sits--which I don't need since I only need the one cup of coffee and I need it right away.It comes with it's own permanent filter and you just put about 2 tablespoons of ground coffee it it, then fill the mug up with cold water, pour in resevoir, put the top down, put the cup under the dripper--without the lid--and turn it on. It takes about 3-4 minutes and your cup of coffee is ready. Your just pick it up, put your sugar and cream in, put the cups lid on it and get to drinking. The coffee comes out very hot, so you have to be careful with that first sip.You can also use different cups as long as they are not bigger than the travel mug and you match the water you are putting in to the size of the cup you are using. i just use whatever cup I am going to brew into to fill it with water. Of course, you'll also have to adjust the amount of coffee you put in as well.Like I said the travel mug you get is not large and you won't be able to fit a large one in this machine but you get about 12oz which is plenty for me.I'm interested to see how long this lasts. I love it so much that I just purchased another one for when this one dies. I think if you take care of it there should be no problems. I'm thinking it should last at least a year.
