review/summary: If you got kids, you need thisreview/text: I shopped around & found this one had good reviews at an affordable price. It cleans like a champ, both carpet & furniture. I also used on our vehicles. the rotating brushes really scrub out stains like magic. We have a pretty big home with 3 kids & a dog & renting one every 4 to 5 monthes adds up. this machine is not too heavy & is very easy to clean. I am satisfied with this purchase. This product shipped on time & in good condition.
