review/summary: Best sheets everreview/text: If you love slipping into bed between two soft, luxurious sheets, than you will love these! Yes, they are a bit spendy, but we think they are worth the extra price. We use these flannel sheets year 'round, and find a big difference in the quality between the 190 gram and the 160 gram. 160 is good, 190 is sublime. Wash after wash, ours never seem to pill, and even our hard well water doesn't stiffen them at all. They are always super soft and welcoming. Luxurious is the best word to describe them...the perfect sheet for us. Would highly recommend Pinzon's 190 gram sheets to everyone.
