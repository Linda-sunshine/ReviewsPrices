review/summary: Powerful suction, but not so easy to cleanreview/text: This hand held vacuum has powerful suction but cleaning it is not the easiest. The big dust particles gets pooled into the plastic container, the way it should. But the fine dust and lint gets stuck on the filter, eventually adding up and making it very difficult to scrape it off. If it was easier to clean the fine dust and lint, it would be a super hand held vac.Pros:The brush is motorized, long chord and powerful suction. Sucks and traps big pieces of stuff really well. Has two settings: just the suction with motorized brush off, and motorized brush on.Caution:Even the exhaust fan at the back is powerful enough to blow out the dust to the other room... so be sure to aim the exhaust away from what you are dusting.Cons:Difficult to clean the lint off the filter.
