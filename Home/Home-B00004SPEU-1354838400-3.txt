review/summary: A good replacement for my old Braunreview/text: My old grinder died after many, many years of service. This Krups works well. The top is not as well designed as it could be. The top and push lever component for the grinder don't work smoothly. Perhaps the plastic needs to wear down a bit. It grinds coffee and spices well so I like it but don't love it.
