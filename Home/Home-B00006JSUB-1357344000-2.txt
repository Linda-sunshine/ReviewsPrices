review/summary: Quality skilletreview/text: This skillet is well made with a fine finish. There are no rough surfaces on this skillet. I purchased it as a Christmas gift for my son, but I was very impressed at it's quality and workmanship. My son is looking forward to his first large cornbread in this pan.
