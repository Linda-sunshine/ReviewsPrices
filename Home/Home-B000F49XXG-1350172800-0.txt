review/summary: great machinereview/text: Ive had this machine for about a month now, and have been using it every day. LOVE IT! Makes coffee shop quality expresso and frothed milk drinks for a fraction of the price. Do purchase a tamper as others have suggested, as the one on the machine is difficult to use with an upward motion. If you wait a few minutes to remove the grounds, the puck will be dry, however I can never get it out in one clean piece. I can not imagine that spending several hundred dollars more on a "better" machine would yeild anything better than what comes out of this little power house.
