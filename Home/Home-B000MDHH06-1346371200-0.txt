review/summary: Works great, very good value for the moneyreview/text: I guess it is just the nature of the beast but even a 'compact' juicer is on the large size. I have a very small kitchen so I was hoping for something smaller but I am making this work. If you keep the pitcher on the counter, you need 10" by 12" of counter space and it is about 16" tall but ou need more room than that height wise to get the food in.The machine works VERY well so there is nothing frustrating about the process. It takes me 20 minutes from start to finish to get my food ready, juice, and clean up and put the machine back together.The fiber bits go into the compost tumbler. Also for the record, the juice keeps you very regular even without the fiber bits. Trust me on this one.I have compared this model to a much more expensive breville juicer and I now have more respect for this very affordable juicer.
