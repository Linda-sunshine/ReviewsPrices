review/summary: Great product with no problemsreview/text: I've had the Elite for just about a year and it's still working great. I mainly use this with my own coffee using the Perfect Pod and filters (available at Amazon or Bed Bath Beyond). This saves me a lot of money and they make a great cup of coffee without having to remove the part with the needle like their filters. Just pop in like a k-cup!For the strength I like I need to use the 8oz cup size. The 10 oz makes week coffee IMO.I do buy special flavored K-cups such as cafe mocha, hot cocoa and apple cider.Would highly recommend this product.
