review/summary: Not very impressedreview/text: After 2 1/2 years, the humidifier stopped working. From the time it came out of the box, I noticed that it produced less steam than other models I have owned. The fan would start to make a loud humming noise which would require it to be turned off and back on. The penguin head cracked as well.
