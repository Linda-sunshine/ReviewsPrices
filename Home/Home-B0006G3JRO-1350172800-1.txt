review/summary: Needs safety switch!review/text: This product should have a safety switch on it. Please be careful with this. I only used it a few times before I had an accident that amputated 80 percent of my finger. I stopped the blender by not squeezing it , pulled it out of what I was blending and something was stuck in it. As my left index finger attempted to dislodge it my right hand squeezed the wand and the blade turned on. It all happened so fast. It has been a horrible injury that has disabled me. The pain was beyond what i could have imagined. It has been 6 months and i am still struggling to get mobility back. If there had been a safety switch on this i would have had to turn it off and could not have activated it by just squeezing. I am only writing this as maybe it can prevent someone else from going through an accident like this.
