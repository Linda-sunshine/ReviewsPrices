review/summary: Carpet cleaner works greatreview/text: We are pleased with this carpet cleaner. We didn't realize that our carpets were even dirty but the water was dirty making us realize that we should clean the carpets a couple of times per year and using this is so much better than renting a carpet cleaner. Also we used this to clean the carpets in our RV and the results were amazing. The carpet is a deep blue and now looks like new. I feel we got a good price on this and will use it for many years.
