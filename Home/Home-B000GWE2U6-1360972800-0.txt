review/summary: Cute and quietreview/text: Purchased for my daughters room. This is cute, quiet and does the job. She loves &#34;kitty&#34; and knows turning this on is part of her night time routine now. The light on it is nice. Not too bright but bright enough that it acts as another small source of light for her. At first I was leery about spending this much when I could get a cheap humidifier that would do the same thing, but when I saw her get excited when we first put it up I realized it was worth the extra cash.
