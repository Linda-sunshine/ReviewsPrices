review/summary: Excellent addition to my kitchenreview/text: I am not a stranger to cooking with cast iron so I knew what to expect with Lodge logics product and this pan did not disappoint me. They are excellent pans and the preseasoning works great. I cooked sausage first to help the seasoning along. Broccoli the next day, no sticking! And now fluffy delicious pancakes today, NO STICKING! I am one happy customer!
