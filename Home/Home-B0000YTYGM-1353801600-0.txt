review/summary: Love-Hate Pot.review/text: I've had this marchine for more than a year now, so I feel like I can provide some good context for the review. The good first: the coffee comes out hotter than my prior Braun model and it stays hotter thanks to the huge thermal carafe. At first I was bummed about the lack of gold filter, but have since concluded that the good quality paper filters actually make a better cup of coffee. There's a kind of clean flavor from not having a filter that lives in the pot forever I prefer.Anyway, on to the bad -- the spillage. It's not just that the lid is "fussy." It is kind of a pain to screw on (frequently takes multiple tries to get the threads to line up just so in order to assure that the "pour" side is in the correct position. ) I have mastered that, only to find coffee all over the counter if a) the handle of the pot is not flush with the right hand side of the pot; b) if the filter basket isn't pressed completely flush to the coffee maker, and, c) sometimes, if the fancy valves on the carafe lid are blocked. There seem to be other causes I can't identify also. This mean that you can't just make coffee, you have to go through a checklist every time you make it to assure everything is in the correct position. Because it's so persnickety, I literally never use the pot's best feature, the ability to set it ahead of time to make coffee in the morning.There's been some good help reading these reviews along the lines of -- don't fill up the pot to the full extent, etc. which I may find helpful. All in all it's a love-hate relationship I have with this machine. The coffee is great, the stress is not. If I ever find an eaier to use 12 cup thermal carafe unit, I'll probably buy it and chuck this one.
