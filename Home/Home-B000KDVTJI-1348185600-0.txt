review/summary: A great UK style kettle in the USreview/text: When we moved to the US from the UK several years ago we were amazed at the difficulty we faced in getting what we considered a basic kitchen utensil - the electric kettle. After struggling for a few months with the regular (dare I say, primitive) stove top kettles we managed to find one pathetic example with an incredibly lack luster performance.Disappointed, we spotted theAroma AWK-115S Hot H20 X-Press 1-1/2-Liter Cordless Water Kettleand we were back in the quick boiling water game again!This kettle has served us faithfully several times a day for nearly 4 years with no issues whatsoever. The heating element is hidden beneath a plate so there is no significant descaling to perform. The auto shut-off works well as long as you remember to push the lid tight. The cordless docking system is similar to the UK norm too, allowing the kettle to be swiveled and positioned conveniently - no unplugging needed, just lift it from the base to fill/empty.Highly recommended for all you quick hot water needs, including making tea using "just boiled" water :-)
