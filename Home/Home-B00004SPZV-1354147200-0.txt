review/summary: Be sure to release the pressure after usereview/text: This is your basic oil sprayer. These things tend to die an early death. This one has lasted a couple of months so far, and is still working well. My wife has been doing two things to keep it alive. Most important is that after every use, she twists it open just enough to release the built-up pressure. The other thing she does is clean the nozzle with hot water every so often to prevent it from clogging with oil. Whether the Misto brand sprayer is better than any other oil sprayer I can't say, but so far so good.
