review/summary: Absolutely gorgeous but definitely not induction-compatiblereview/text: I took the advice of another reviewer who said this stainless steel coffee percolator works on her induction stove and bought it specifically for that purpose. Maybe it's a difference in the way the cookware sensors work on my Max Burton and her burner, but mine gives me a decided "no" and won't turn on. I was mightily disappointed, but I can't fault the product for it. Farberware does not claim this pot to be induction-ready.It's really too bad. It's a gorgeous coffee pot, high-quality stainless steel, easy to clean, and very well designed. It perfectly fits the smaller eye of an electric stove. The only thing I don't like about it, and I knocked off one star because it's a serious design issue, is that the spring that the percolator basket sits on is not attached to the brew spindle. This makes it very easy to drop it or lose it. Farberware should take direction from Presto in this regard.So I'm back to the plug-in Presto for perking coffee and will use this pot just for heating water on the stove. I really really really wanted this to be induction-ready! :(
