review/summary: Perfect Fitreview/text: These are a perfect fit and seem to work just fine, although I certainly didn't have any way of checking the water afterward. The small black flecks are common in this type of filter and aren't harmful. They are just small particles of burnt coconut shell, which is what these filters use as their &#34;charcoal&#34; filtering material.
