review/summary: Hot now & much laterreview/text: This coffee maker really keeps the coffee hot!However, it is a heavy carafe to pour from.It brews excellent coffee at about one minute per cup brewing time.Only question is why the clock is: 1. Not back-lit; 2. Shuts off after the brewing is complete?
