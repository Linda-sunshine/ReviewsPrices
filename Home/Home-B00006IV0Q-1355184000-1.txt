review/summary: Very hot coffeereview/text: I had to replace the Senseo coffee maker since Phillips stopped making the pods for that machine. This coffee is much hotter and I have to let it cool before I can drink it. I like that it's all steel and has been very easy to clean and maintain for the last month. Good little unit!
