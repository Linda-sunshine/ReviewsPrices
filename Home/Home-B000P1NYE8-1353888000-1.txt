review/summary: Great little scale.review/text: This is a very good scale for such a low price. I got it to weigh random things about the house. The first thing I did when I got it was to weigh just about anything that would fit on it. It is pretty neat to see what things actually weigh. It is a little small if you want to weigh things like envelopes you might have to rig something up so you could see the display. It is great for weighing coins, and seems to be relatively accurate when checked against a more expensive scale.
