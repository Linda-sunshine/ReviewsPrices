review/summary: Just what I needed!review/text: My Keurig Coffee Maker has sat idle ever since my AeroPress arrived. I love it. It is so easy and efficient and I have such control over the coffee strength. I get a smooth cup of coffee without bitterness and without sacrificing the strong flavor that I love. All this for such a reasonable price! Sometimes, I feel like having espresso and sometimes I just feel like regular coffee. I can have it anyway I want it. My AeroPress has quickly become one of my favorite kitchen things.
