review/summary: It Tamps My Coffee. Great!review/text: Very simple product for tamping down espresso after I lost the original plastic scoop/tamper combo. Two sizes is appreciated. After a few months of use and only cleaning with paper towels, it's finish is the same as the day I bought it. It's cheap and it works perfectly. Five stars.
