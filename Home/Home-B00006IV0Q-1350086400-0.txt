review/summary: Love it so far.review/text: Percolator coffee is absolutely the best tasting coffee EVER! We previously had the Westbend 12 cup percolator, which was a piece of crap. This coffee maker is light-weight but made sturdy. It's also very quiet which is a treat for us since the Westbend could be heard throughout our entire 1000sq ft. apartment! The thing could wake you from a dead sleep! Anywho, my husband and I are very impressed with the Presto. We have yet to try it without the filters that came with it. The filters kept all of the grinds out and made clean up really easy. The coffee comes out nice and hot. If I could give 10 stars I would.
