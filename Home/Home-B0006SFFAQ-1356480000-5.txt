review/summary: Three years and going strongreview/text: Bought this machine after doing some research online.I use it every day and it has never let me down. Very easy to handle and clean. Love the automatic brewing in the morning.I have the brushed steel machine, and the steel is a little hard to clean/keep shiny (That's probably because I am too lazy to do it often....)Would definitely recommend.
