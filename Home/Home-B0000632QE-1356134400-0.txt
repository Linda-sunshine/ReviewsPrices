review/summary: Decent Mandoline For The Price, But Overall Not Greatreview/text: Don't let the reviews fool you, this isn't a 4.5 star mandoline for a few reasons. The safety holder that holds the food and protects your hand is awkward and painful to touch on the bottom. It has a manual plunger, rather than a spring loaded one like a good Mandoline, and it doesn't have a guide so it's easy to slip off the side. It does stop your fingers from getting lopped off, so it works, but it does so rather awkwardly.There are really only a few inserts, so you have very few options. I think you're pretty much limited to 1/4" (its thick insert) and 1/8" (the thin). Those are probably the two most common sizes you'd want to slice at, so that's good, but they're not the only two. A good mandoline is infinitely adjustable within a range, usually paper thin to about 1/2".It doesn't have extendable feet on the back like a good mandoline, meaning you have to hold it over a bowl or something. You can't just use it on your cutting board, unless you want to constantly be picking it up and clearing the cut stuff from under it.The housing it comes in is sort of a pain too. It's a little bit annoying to remove the unit from the base, or to put inserts in or take them out. On the plus side, it does take up less room than a good mandoline.All that said, this is a value. It's pretty good for the cost. A good dicing mandoline might cost more than 5x as much as this cheap little unit, so you won't be upset about having purchased this little guy. It does seem to stay sharp too, though I wish it had removable blades just in case. It makes a decent first mandoline, or one for someone who won't use it a ton. But if you're a serious home cook, look at the De Buyer units or something that's more adjustable and addresses the other concerns I mentioned.
