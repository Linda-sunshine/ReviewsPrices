review/summary: Good coffee, nice looking coffee makerreview/text: I purchased this coffee maker in July of 2012.I had a Mr. Coffee before getting this Cuisinart coffee maker. My biggest complaint was that the coffee wasn't hot enough when it came out. I turned it up to the hottest available setting and it still came out less-than-hot.That is not an issue with the Cuisinart. The coffee is hot and smooth, and now I can start my day off right!The carafe is shaped nicely and pours without spilling. Some carafes spill if poured too quickly, but I have found this to be very good quality and it does not spill.I can't really speak to the quality of the filter, as I use a reverse osmosis filter for my coffee. So there's nothing to filter out.Overall, this is a great coffee maker and I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
