review/summary: Totally worth itreview/text: I previously had the Jack-Lalanne juicer, but it now lives at my mothers house. After going on a juice cleanse, I wanted to buy one of my own. This cleans up easier than the jack and the juice tastes just as wonderful.A few other reviewers mentioned the pulp is marginally wetter, but I really don't care. $100 on a pretty stainless Breville juicer? Awesome. There are a lot of other models at higher price points, but I dont think you really need them. This totally does the job. I have only used it 3 times ( in 3 days!), so currently, I cant say anything about the longevity of the motor.
