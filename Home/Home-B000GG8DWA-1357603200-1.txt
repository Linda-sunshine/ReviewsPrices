review/summary: works great in my son's roomreview/text: My son's room is the coldest in the winter and hottest in the summer. It has 2 outter walls and another on the garge side. We wanted a quite heater that he can use at night. The lowest setting work perfectly. I hear the higher setting can make your electric bill higher so we don't use that setting often.
