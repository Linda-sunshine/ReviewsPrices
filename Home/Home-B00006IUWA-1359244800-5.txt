review/summary: Not so great...review/text: I bought this as an alternative to popping corn on the stove. However, you have to use exactly a 1/2 cup of kernels (if you use less, it hardly pops any at all.) and then there are tons of leftover kernels that spew out of the popper constantly. I returned this and ended up just getting a microwave popper.
