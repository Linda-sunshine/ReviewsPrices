review/summary: Nice productreview/text: Solid feel and fit. Good insulation. Water stays fresh-tasting and cold. Easy to clean/sanitize. I purchased the 18oz, but a 24oz size would have been ideal, if they had it. Just wish it had a 100% stainless lining versus having the plastic top. 4 1/2 stars.
