review/summary: Borner V-1001 Love it!review/text: I have to say I wasn't sure I would use this very much but have found it is so easy to clean and change blades I use it all the time. I watched the videos on u-tube which really helped me understand how to dice onions, so fast and easy I can hardly believe it. I think I have used it every day since it arrived. Love thin sliced onions on my turkey burgers and it 2 seconds it's done, perfect. Thicker slices for liver and onions. I've been on a diet so slicing and dicing for salads if super fast. Wish I had ordered this long ago. Do be careful the blades are like razors but the guard works perfect. I really love this slicer.
