review/summary: Great coffee makerreview/text: Makes great coffee and is easy to use. There have been complaints about the water reservoir being difficult to pour water into, but I have not had a problem using a container designed for pouring liquid. The lid is a poor design as water that condensates on the lid drips down the back of the unit onto my counter. A small ledge int he back is obviously supposed to catch this water but is far too small to do the job. I simply open the lid at about 45 degrees and shake it slightly so most of the water drips inside the coffee maker.The timer is easy to set and works great. I really like the adjustable temperature. I don't like coffee that is too hot to drink.
