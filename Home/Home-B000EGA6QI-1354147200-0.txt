review/summary: Not durablereview/text: Already broken, in less than 6 months. We use it daily for smoothies, and occasionally for soups, sauces. This is the 2nd version of this model we have had. the first one we had about 2 yrs and the blade rusted out of the shaft. This time a piece inside has come loose so the motor cannot spin the blade. I am moving on.
