review/summary: More than we expected!review/text: We love, love, love this grill!! We have used other Presto products and thought this would be similar. It was more than we expected. This grill is a lot bigger than any other we've used. We are able to cook more at one time (which is great for a family of 6) than ever before. This grill is Easy to use, easy to clean, heats evenly consistently, and while pretty darn big, it's not cumbersome to take with you on trips, etc. There are really no negatives to mention for us other than we wish the tilt feature tilted just a little more for draining. That's a very small thing to us, and certainly not a deterrent from purchasing another, based on how this grill has performed so far. Like I said, we LOVE it!
