review/summary: Excellent for power outage and campingreview/text: Since we purchased this, we have used it during a power outage (we have a propane stove in our kitchen) and we used it on our camping type Coleman stove. It percolates a tasty cup of joe as long as you use a decent brand of coffee; yes that is the secret behind any cup of coffee folks. What we did buy that was cheap, were the cheapest generic paper filters for the ground holding cup. We did NOT purchase the filters specific to fit this percolator. We experimented by percolating coffee without the paper filter and YES, a few grounds did fall down into the coffee. Not many, only a few. It would be best to use a paper filter for zero grounds falling through. We are very happy with this inexpensive purchase. So far we feel it is a well made Stainless Steel pitcher.
