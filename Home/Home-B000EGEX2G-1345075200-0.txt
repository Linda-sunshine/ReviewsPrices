review/summary: A comfy seat for pregnancyreview/text: I ordered this for nursing my baby, but he hasn't arrived quite yet! I am sure it will be perfect! It has dually been a great place for me to rest and put my feet up during pregnancy. I am petite (5' 2") so it is a perfect fit for me. It was super easy to assemble and fits nicely in our small city apt.
