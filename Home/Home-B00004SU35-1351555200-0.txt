review/summary: Best popcorn ever!!review/text: I grew up with my mom making this for me as a snack after school. Not that I'm all "grown up" and moved out on my own, I still make all of my popcorn using this! It much healthier than the bagged microwave popcorns, all you need is a little veggie oil on the bottom and add the popcorn kernels and you're good to go! Makes the perfect popcorn in my opinion. This will save you a lot of money in the long run as well only having to buy the kernels, microwave popcorn bags can add up. I won't use anything else to make my popcorn snack, when friends come over they ask for me to make this because they love it so much! It makes a lot in one batch, so it's sure to be a crowd pleaser!
