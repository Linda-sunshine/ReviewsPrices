review/summary: perfect for the grillreview/text: Love my new percolator. We were without electricity for 4 days 2 weeks ago, and NO coffee. Okay, to some not such a tragedy, to me a necessity! So immediately ordered this for our grill in case we lose power again, and it is great. Very nicely constructed, heavy duty and a good solid handle.I would recommend to anyone who camps or wants one &#34;just in case&#34;.
