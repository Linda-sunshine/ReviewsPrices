review/summary: A Great Product Gets a Huge Ding for no Lids.review/text: I went through three non-stick cuisinart skillets over a period of six years. I bought them because they matched my Cusinart Multi-Clad Pro cookware set and accepted their lids, but the non-stick portion just didn't hold up. During the same six year span I had a single WearEver non-stick skillet with lid that did quite well, and I had planned on buying a new WearEver non-stick set to compliment my Cuisinart set because of how long they last.Before I could though, I received two of these skillets as gifts, based on the reviews here. It should be noted that WearEver and T-Fal are two brands made by the same company, with T-Fal being the higher end line. The truth is, I think that these two skillets are very nice, perhaps the best non-stick skillets I have ever used. That said, they do not have lids, and that is an issue. Being an odd shape, I can't even use generic lids to fit them. There are things that I simply cannot cook on these skillets without lids, so I'm back to having to cook on SS and soak to clean. While I think that these are very nice, I would not buy them again if they did not have lids available.
