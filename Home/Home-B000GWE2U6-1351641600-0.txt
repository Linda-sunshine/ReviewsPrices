review/summary: Crane penguin humidifierreview/text: Love the design and my son loves it! Works great and my son can turn it on and off and adjust the mist on his own. Easy to clean and I like how you can add a de-mineralization cartridge to the water tank. Doesn't grow mold as fast as other ones we've had in the past. My only dislike is how small the tank is. It just means refilling it more often since we live in CO where it's really dry.
