review/summary: What a disappointment!review/text: Today I finally received my Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill. What a disappointment and waste of money! This small, nice looking and "GREAT DEAL" thing has not been able to grind coffee finely enough that I was using for my DeLonghi espresso machine. Even when I set up a mill on the finest grind, coffee was still too large, so that the water leaked through the coffee in just a few seconds. This mill is definitely not for lovers of espresso coffee.
