review/summary: love love this cannerreview/text: I do alot of canning every year, and my old old presto was a real work horse, but got to where I couldn't replace the seals. While searching thru amazon for a new canner - came across this one. Was hesitant because of price - but after reading the comments, I bit the bullet and boy was I glad. I like the heaviness that the canner has, heats up and cools down quickly - and really like the self-regulating. well worth the extra money!! and won't have to worry about replacing seals :)
