review/summary: Good Deal, but no Coverreview/text: The pad arrived rolled up and wrapped in plastic. It unrolled and expanded easily in only an hour or so and exhibited no odor. My only surprise was that it is just pure foam and does not come in any kind of cover. That's really not a problem, just a surprise. I just put it between the mattress and a cloth mattress cover. The foam itself is not very dense compared to other memory foam pads I have seen but it does add a layer of softness to the bed. If you have an overly hard mattress and need a topper this product will do the job.
