review/summary: Best espresso machine under $100review/text: I will try to be concise, but let me begin with telling you, THIS IS THE BEST MACHINE UNDER $100.I first bought the Mr Coffee espresso makerMrC Steam Espresso Makerand this thing was very complicated to use. It produced loud noises, the steam would leak from the cap, and every time I made coffee I feared for my life. After 2 weeks of dealing with it, I returned and went on to a search for something better. I decided to try this one, and the first espresso came out just amazing. It had a rich crema on top, and the milk frother was acceptable,The best part of this machine is how intuitive and easy to use is. It gets a little hot but you can still handle everything. The design is superb, and I love that the water tank hold so much water, and you can actually see the water level (something you cant do in the Mr Coffee)I make cappuccinos every day, and it never fails me. To get it to heat up faster, I let water run through it twice with the portafilter on but no coffee, and then I pack my coffee in the portafilter and let it run.BUY IT. Dont waste your money on Mr. Coffee.
