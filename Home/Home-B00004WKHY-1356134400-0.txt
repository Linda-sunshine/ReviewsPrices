review/summary: No Doughreview/text: This is not your mother's (or your first) Cuisinart. It does very well grating cheese and probably with general mixing. However, I tried three different dough recipies, all with similar results. Twice, the mixture was forced up into the blade shaft, eventually causing the blade to lift. The third dough was somewhat firm, and the processor quickly bogged down and overloaded. I'll stick to my Kitchenade mixer for future doughs.Oh well, my first one was Made in France. Guess where this one's made? Chopsticks not included.
