review/summary: Fantastic filter systemreview/text: I try to drink 8 glasses of water a day. The water at my office was leaving a cloudy brown film on the inside of my large Tervis water tumbler. Even the dishwasher couldn't get it off, I had to use baking soda and a scrubbing sponge to clean it. If it was hard to get off the cup, didn't think I should be drinking it either. Figured I needed to filter the water so I bought the large PUR tank after reading that it filtered more items than the Brita products. Very happy with the tank and these refill filters - water tastes much better, and after 5 months of use, there is no brown film on my water cup any more. Keeping extras on hand makes it easy to change the filter every two or three months.
