review/summary: Kinda odd but....review/text: I absolutley love my ancient Etruscan space heater with remote...it's quiet, and the timer and temperature controls are great. Warms room fast. I only warn that if you prance around barefoot and are somewhat clumsy, it is easy to get your toe caught on the lovely iron base. Seriously, though...it's a great heater and much nicer to look at than the usual tower units.
