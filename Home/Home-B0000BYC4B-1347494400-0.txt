review/summary: leaky...review/text: I use a Ball mason jar for a water bottle, and the metal lids start rusting immediately. I was thrilled to find these plastic lids, but concerned as so many reviews said they leaked. I finally gave in and just ordered them, as they are fairly inexpensive.At first, I was having a leaking issue too. Some reviews recommended screwing the tops on as tight as possible (makes sense), and that still wasn't solving the issue. Finally, I discovered that due to the softer nature of the plastic, I was not seating them properly before screwing them on, so they were still leaking. I have since started making sure that the lid is flat on the jar, and then giving it an extra bit of a twist at the end. This worked great for a few days. Unfortunately, as of last night, it has started leaking again; this time with a vengeance.The metal lids did not leak at all, so it is really too bad that they cannot make these leakproof. Granted, I could get a regular water bottle, but I like the glass since it is BPA free (which many plastic water bottles are now, of course) and also it will not pick up tastes or smells. It is easy to clean and very inexpensive to replace if it gets broken.Please Ball/Jardin... make a leak proof plastic lid!
