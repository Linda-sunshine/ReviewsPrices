review/summary: Good, but changes the feel of your bed.review/text: It's soft, well made, and it does the job. However, this item distributes weight potentially making your mattress feel harder. If you have a foam mattress you will not want this product. If you are looking for an extra layer of protection from liquid spills, search for mattress protectors.
