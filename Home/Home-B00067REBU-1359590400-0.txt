review/summary: Second machinereview/text: I love this machine! My family eats only homemade bread and I use this bread machine at least twice a week. I do not like the bread to be baked in the machine. Instead I use the dough cycle (1 1/2 hrs.) and then form rolls. My family of 7 devours them! I bought this machine about 4 years ago and it just now quit working. Considering how often I use it, I think it did pretty well! So now I am buying another one~
