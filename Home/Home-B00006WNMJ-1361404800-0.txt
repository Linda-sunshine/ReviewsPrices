review/summary: Culligan FM-15RA Level 3 Faucet Filterreview/text: I bought this filter as a replacement for a GE GXFM03C Faucet Mount Filter System. GE no longer makes replacement cartridges for this system and I had read that the Culligan filter was a suitable replacement. I have installed the Culligan filter and it seems to be working correctly. The filter was easy to install, there are no leaks, and it removes the unpleasant taste of chlorine from my tap water.
