review/summary: Awesome!!review/text: This alarm clock is so amazing, especially considering its price. Our power went out for about 12 hours during a recent storm, and my alarm still went off the next morning. It automatically sets itself when power is restored and automatically adjusts for daylight savings time. I recommend this alarm clock for anyone! It's AWESOME!!
