review/summary: Decent product, but comes coated in unwashable powderreview/text: I've liked these ice trays in the past, so when after years of use my old one started to tear at the corner I ordered more. These came in some sort of creepy anti-mold powder. Not super thick, but after many, many washes it's still there. Product looks clean, but the powder gets into the ice cubes and into drinks. Insidious stuff. Unless they can send it without this, I'd avoid.
