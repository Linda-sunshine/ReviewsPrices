review/summary: Best Iron I have ever usedreview/text: This iron is remarkable, it is kind of heavy which makes for better ironing, it has a lot of automatic functions, the steam it blows out is perfect, it doesn't drop or leak any water, and the surface is so smooth that it really makes the ironing go by so smooth it's ridiculous. It irons fast as well since it does the job the first time over the clothing so you don't have to keep on ironing over the same spot.This is the best iron I have ever used.
