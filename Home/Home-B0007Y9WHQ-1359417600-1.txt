review/summary: Very cool! (and very sharp!)review/text: Right out of the box I sliced my finger on it, so be careful! It was so sharp that I didn't even feel it until I saw the blood running down my hand.I used it to make &#34;noodles&#34; out of zucchini. I was thrilled to see how easy it was. You attach the vegetable to the prongs on either end, then start spinning the crank while applying very little force with your other hand on the handle. It comes with different blades for different types of cuts. I can't wait to try them all! Also, cleanup is super easy. Love this thing.
