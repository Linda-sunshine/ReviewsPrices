review/summary: No pilling, whole in top sheetreview/text: Love these sheets. They are thick, velvety soft, and warm. The best feature is that they do not pill. Unfortunately, I had to give the item 4 stars instead of 5 because the top sheet came with a quarter size hole in it. I could have returned the item, but it wasn't worth the hassle. Check your sheets closely for holes and immediately upon receipt; returns are accepted within 30 days if there is a problem. They tend to shed a lot in the dryer so I hope they maintain their softness over time.
