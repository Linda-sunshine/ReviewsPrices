review/summary: Love My Aeroreview/text: Well, I have tried virtually every known method of coffee preparation and this product makes the best brew I have tasted. It also requires the least effort on cleanup and is the least expensive preparation device. I buy green beans, roast them at home and grind immediately before brewing. Low acidity can be tasted as a "smoothness" which almost anyone can perceive. I use two filters, extra coffee, and fill to within a half inch of the top for best results. After 2.5 minutes of microwaving, a preset amount of water reaches the correct temperature. Only drawback is the 30s of extra microwaving to bring the coffee up to a higher temperature before tasting. That can't effect my five star rating on such an exceptional product.
