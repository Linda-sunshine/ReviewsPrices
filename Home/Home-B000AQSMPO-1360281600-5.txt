review/summary: In lovereview/text: I had an older Keurig from 2006 that finally went. I decided i needed to replace it and wanted to keep with the K-Cup since you can use the refillable pod. I am so happy I went with this unit! It is like night and day difference from my old one. It brews the coffee better actually. It also brews it to the perfect temperature that you like (which you can change at anytime) I love how hot the water comes out. I am so glad to stick with Keurig and hopefully i get to use this one as much as my previous. 7 years of service from the other one was great if i get 7 years out of this one i will be very happy. Great design and nice big reservoir for water!
