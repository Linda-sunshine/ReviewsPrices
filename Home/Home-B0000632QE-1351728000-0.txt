review/summary: Flimsy and very poor instructionsreview/text: The storage area for the two blades is so tight that the tip of the blades are scratching the plastic every time you put it in the holder, how long can that last before it destroys the blades? The insructions are only about 30 per cent in English, the parts you really need are in German. It slices 95 percent of the piece, then. You have to dig out the rest between razor sharp blades. I cannot believe this thing got so many good reviews. I am sending it back
