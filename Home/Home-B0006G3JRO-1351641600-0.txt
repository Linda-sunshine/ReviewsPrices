review/summary: Super Shakesreview/text: This Cuisinart Smart Stick Hand Blender is simply fantastic! I purchased this at BJ's for $34, and used it occasionally when making soup, and it blended beautifully. Every morning I make a deluxe shake for breakfast with spices,yogurt, protein, fruit, etc., and it blend it to a smooth puree. However, when my $400 blender stopped working one day (had a burning smell), I was faced with replacing it. What to do. Then I remembered my Cuisinart Smart Stick, and discovered it worked perfectly, although I do not put the fruit in whole as I did with the blender. The best part is I can make it in the mug from which I will drink it, and cleanup is SO easy--rinse and then blend in hot, soapy water. Best purchase I ever made! The reason for only 4 stars is that I have not had a lot of success with the chopper attachment and would never use the whisk. I use this every morning. Just think: I could purchase 11 Cuisinart Smart Sticks for the price of my one blender! Can't go wrong!
