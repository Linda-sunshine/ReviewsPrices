review/summary: Crane Adorable Critter humidifierreview/text: Please do not waste your money on this adorable humidifier. I would not even give this product one star. The reviewer who stated that the company does not stand by its product is absolutely correct!!! I too was drawn into the "Adorable" marketing of this product. I loved the ultrasonic mist produced, but then when it came to cleaning, like all humidifiers, it is a challenge. Okay, I thought that isn't too bad, but no it didn't stop there. After only ONE YEAR AND TWO MONTHS of moderately gentle use it no longer functioned. I used filtered water and I also bought the filter recommended for the humidifier. By the way I purchased three of these worthless things - you would have thought I would have learned from the first breakdown, slow learner Grandma. I called the company, silly me, thinking that they would stand by their products integrity or lack of it. "One year warranty and sales receipt" was the conversation. I ended up just taking the most recent of the three back to the store for a refund. The company wants you to mail it back to them, yes you pay the shipping. Grandma isn't that dumb. The other two broken Crane humidifiers are out in the trash because Crane won't back their inferior product. I will not buy another Crane ever, nor will my family members or friends. DO NOT BUY IT!!! Lesson learned.
