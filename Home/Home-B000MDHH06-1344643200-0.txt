review/summary: An easy to use juicing powerhouse!review/text: My Breville juicer arrived in perfect condition. It's very good looking. It is fast and has only two internal parts to clean. It doesn't take any effort to juice beets and other solid veggies and fruits. This juicer is super fast. I gave up on juicing because I previously had two different machines that had numerous parts that required me to use the manuel to figure out how to assemble each time. They were also a nightmare to clean. Not the case with this great Breville juicer. The Breville cleans up in less than a minute. The solids can be used in breads and cakes as the solids aren't all soppy wet like other juicers produce. I have several parrots as pets and I roll the collected solids into little fruit and veggie balls and feed it to them. This is a great machine and worth the very reasonable price.
