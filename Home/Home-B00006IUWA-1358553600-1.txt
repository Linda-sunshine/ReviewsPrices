review/summary: Stopped working after 2 usesreview/text: I bought this item due to the reviews here. We had considered the Cuisinart popper, but it had horrible reviews. Well, the first time we used the Presto, it was fine although VERY loud! Because of the reviews, I was prepared for the popcorn flying out, so we used only 1/3 cup of kernels and the resulting popcorn was great. Second time, perhaps more unpopped kernels, but still the popcorn was good. Last night my husband plugged it in and no bueno. The thing is dead. Good thing it's only $20 or so, but what a piece o' crap! Save your money.
