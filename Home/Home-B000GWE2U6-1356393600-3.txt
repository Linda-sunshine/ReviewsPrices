review/summary: Works great-until it quits!review/text: I bought this Crane Adorable Leopard Cool Mist Humidifier. It worked great. Loved it. So did my cats. After using it for 1 winter approximately 4 months it stopped working. I had cleaned it and put it away in it's original box after it was dry. The following winter I set it up and it worked for a few weeks and quit. I origingally would give it a 5 star but I expected it to last more than a few months. I was past the warrenty so Throw it away! I also have a second Crane teardrop humidifier. It also stopped working. Crane must make these to last 1 year. Oh well....
