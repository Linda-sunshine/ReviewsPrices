review/summary: THIS COFFEE POT IS GREAT!!review/text: I really like this coffee pot. I love being able to program it for the morning and have hot coffee waiting for me. The coffee definitely stays hot. One evening I brewed all 12 cups for guests. No one had any coffee. I decided to see how the coffee would be in the morning. It was still warm, even hot to the touch. It's nice to be able to have the coffee sit without burning on a hot plate. I believe that some of the older reviews about the coffee brewing all over the counter have been rectified. I haven't had a problem at all. I make sure the filter basket &#34;snaps&#34; into place and check that the carafe is positioned correctly on its platform. You do want to make sure that you turn off the &#34;AUTO&#34; button once you are done with your pre-programmed pot. Otherwise it will brew automatically at that time again, with or without water and coffee. My husband is faithful about checking this for me &#34;just in case&#34;.I used to own a Bunn coffeemaker because of having the water hot and the brew cycle quick. However, I really love this thermal carafe and HIGHLY recommend its purchase. The brew cycle is about 9 minutes for 8 cups. I can wait...or I just program it.
