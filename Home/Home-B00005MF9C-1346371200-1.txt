review/summary: Perfect for mereview/text: I don't use the travel mug. I use a 16 ounce pyrex measuring cup. After catching the coffee in the thick glass pyrex cup, and then pouring it into a mug, the coffee is cool enough for me to drink it without scalding my tongue. I also don't use the mesh filter. I use a number 2 conical paper filter. It slows the flow through the grounds and brews better coffee IMHO. I used to have problems with grounds overflowing the filter and making a mess. I solved that problem by trimming about a quarter of an inch off the top of the filter using scissors. I then fold the filter across the bottom and side so that the filter fits nicely in the basket. I make sure that when I close the top of the coffee maker it does not push the paper filter over sideways. That was what was causing the over flow problem. I use exactly 16 ounces of water and a little over 2 tablespoons of blue mountain blend coffee from Marshalls. It makes two mugs of delicious coffee which is perfect for me. If you like very strong and very hot coffee, it may not be right for you.
