review/summary: Love This Pan!review/text: My expensive Calphalon teflon pans went bad in a couple of years after babying them every time I used them. I wanted a replacement so, after reading the reviews, I bought this one. Completely happy with this pan. Cleans easier than any other pans I have. Just the right thickness and the pan heats perfectly evenly. Cooks a great egg. I will never buy any other kind of pan. Great value. Great pan!
