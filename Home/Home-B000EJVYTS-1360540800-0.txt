review/summary: Excellent value, great conceptreview/text: I love this trash can! With two dogs in the house, I needed a trash can with a lid. When cooking I want nothing to do with touching a trash can, and I was meh on the ones with the foot step, so I searched around and came across this one. I purchased the power plug, which for the last 3 years has worked beautifully. Through my own fault, I would scoot the trash can out of the way with the oven door, and damaged the plug (it took a year+ of abuse). So I'm switching to batteries (no big deal). As some people mentioned, the motion censor can get out of whack, but it was pretty easy to fix (turn off, try the close button, etc). All in all, I'd buy this again. One star deducted for the placement of the deodorizer thing, it can get pretty gross so I removed it and haven't used it again.
