review/summary: Handles most stains perfectlyreview/text: I've got three kids that just went through a huge case of a nasty stomach bug. Puke everywhere. Smell was horrible. Got this carpet cleaner, cleaned their rooms, and Voila! My carpets are clean, the smell is gone, and I have a good carpet cleaner for the NEXT time they get sick like this. And the Hoover Platinum Collection Professional Strength Carpet and Upholstery Detergent worked very well. Good shipping and great price from Amazon. I highly recommend this carpet cleaner over renting one.
