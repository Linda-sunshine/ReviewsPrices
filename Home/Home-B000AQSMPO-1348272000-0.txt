review/summary: Just returned my 3rd potreview/text: My first pot was returned to the manufacturer after several calls and trouble shooting with customer service. The second pot only lasted a little over 2 years with many issues with having to descale the pot more frequently than recommended, constantly not getting the volume that the cup choice was supposed to give. I just returned the third pot today to Kohls due to leaking. I resorted to using only distilled water in this last pot and did seem to help with the descaling issue. I absolutely love the concept of the Pot but the performance leaves a lot to be desired. I may have to resort to doing what another person has resorted to and buy aPot and return it just before the expiration of the warranty.
