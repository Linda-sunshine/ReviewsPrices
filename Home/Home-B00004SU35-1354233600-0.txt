review/summary: Best popcorn I've hadreview/text: This is the best popcorn maker I have had. You can use any type of popcorn, but I get the best results with the premium brand - you know the one with the old guy's name from Indiana. It leaves fewer unpopped kernals.I've only had a few issues with it. 1. The turning wires at the bottom got bent with use so I had to straighten them so they would stir properly. 2. The little nails came out of the wooden handle on the top where it joins the lid. I fixed it with a couple screws. 3. The batches aren't quite big enough. When my bff is over for movie night I have to make two batches. Of couorse, since the popcorn is so awesome, you naturally eat more than a serving.As one of the other reveiwers said - make sure you keep the heat at medium. Use a little oil - I've used vegetable oil, coconut oil, butter flavored popcorn oil and olive oil. Straight butter burns a little too easily, but I've had good results using half butter & half some other oil. I tried to use popcorn salt, but it got too salty and the popcorn got a little tough. It takes a little bit for the kernals to heat up, but once they start popping they are done in no time. Make sure you have your bowl ready to pour it in. Sometimes I only have one or two unpopped kernals in the whole batch where as I get a small handful with most microwave varieties.There are some interesting recipies in the booklet that comes with it. My favorite recipe is a variation of a Rachel Ray recipe. I use a little oil and a little butter, 3 TBS sugar, 1/8 tsp chili powder, dash of salt & cayenne pepper and about 1/3 cup of popcorn. It makes it sweet, salty & spicy. I tried putting peanuts in it once, but they burnt so I won't do that again.
