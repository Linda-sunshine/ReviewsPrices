review/summary: what a dealreview/text: I don't understand how anyone could rate this pot poorly. Come on folks it's only $10, and for $10 it's the deal of the day. It boils the water very quickly and holds plenty for both dried foods and beverages. Some complained about the plastic smell, but I placed a cut up lemon in the pot and let it boil for several minutes and have no smell on it at all.
