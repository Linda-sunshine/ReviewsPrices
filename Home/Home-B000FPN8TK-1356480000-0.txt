review/summary: NIfty Tea Makerreview/text: I can't say enough about this little dynamic item. Coming from the South, iced tea is a necessity of life!! I have seen friends stunned by the convenience of this little treasure!! I have gifted several friend who then asked for my recipe for perfect tea every time!! I tell them: 2 cups of water heated 3 minutes in a microwave; add 1 family size tea bag in tea maker; add hot water; close lid; steep 15 minutes; pressure rim &#34;shoots&#34; steeped tea directly into pitcher with 2 quarts of cold water. DONE!! It is perfect every time. Quick to make. Easy to do.
