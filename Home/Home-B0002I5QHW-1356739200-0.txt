review/summary: Why would a vegetarian need a meat grinder?review/text: This vegetarian needed a meat grinder for a few reasons - mainly, I'm experimenting in making (non-soy) vegetarian sausage. And I am loving it. This grinder grinds through various vegetables and other ingredients and has been helping me make new recipes. I haven't even tried the pasta maker pieces yet, but I will.Oh, and by the way, easy to clean. The whole thing comes apart off the base and literally cleans up with soap and water. (I'm not sure if it's dishwasher safe or not because I don't have a dishwasher so I don't pay attention to that stuff.)
