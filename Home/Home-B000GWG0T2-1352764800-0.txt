review/summary: Where have you been all my life?review/text: I have used nonstick pans that cost many times what this one sells for, and none of them (not ONE!) performed like this one! I have just used it for a week, but I am tempted to buy more and keep them as backups, since at this price, one could simply replace this pan every year or two if it doesn't age well.I rely heavily on reviews, but rarely write them. This pan inspired me to speak up - it's that great. If you are in the market for a nonstick fry pan, forget about those other brands. Splurge on things like Le Creuset dutch ovens and Mauviel copper sauciers, but go with T-fal for your nonstick fry pan. You won't be disappointed!
