review/summary: Burn everything / No shut offreview/text: When I see a product with a ton of great reviews and one horrible one..I think that person probably doesn't like anything or is just an idiot that uses it wrong. ...well..I must be that idiot. I see great reviews but I hate this thing. I liked it because it was small. It's so small in fact..the heating element is right on the food and it burns everything. I saw a review where the person said if you put potholders over the top slot the heat wont leak out and the heating elements wont stay on constantly to burn the food....I'm gonna have to try that. Also...I can't imagine how I made it out of the store without noticing there isn't a timer/auto shut off. That is an accident waiting to happen in my house. This oven is one of those things that looks good and paper but doesn't work out in reality.
