review/summary: Great to keep on the grillreview/text: I got this guy mid summer and wish I had purchased it sooner. Just keep it on the grill and season it. Leave it there, but clean it regularly. It is great for searing burgers and steaks. It maintains high heat for a long time once up to temperature. The it camping and throw it right on the fire/ coals for a quick way to grill.
