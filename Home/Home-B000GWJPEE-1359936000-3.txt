review/summary: Penguin Humidifierreview/text: We highly recommend the Penguin humidifier. It works great! We have had ours for 2 yrs and never had a problem. It's very quiet and you can adjust the setting for how much moisture you want coming out. We have wood floors in the room we use it in and it has not harmed them in any way. Never had any problems with it leaking. There are no filters to replace so that is a big plus too. We LOVE our little penguin and so do our cats. You won't be disappointed with this little guy in your house. Good price too.
