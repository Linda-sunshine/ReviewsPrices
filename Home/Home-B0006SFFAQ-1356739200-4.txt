review/summary: Update: it works, and seems to be the best available currently with all the features I wanted.review/text: I have updated my initial review (below) since following Amazon's advice to use the carafe for measuring water. i say it does everything I need it to do in an affordable coffeemaker, and I am a picky shopper. overall, i am now very happy with this.First, I am a Starbucks lover (medium flavors). I like a good, flavorful, hot cup of coffee. So, I researched the heck out of available coffeemakers when my Braun's life ended, and this one seems to be the best of the lot currently available. After reading the instruction booklet from cover to cover, I was frustrated not to find an explanation of how to read the water markings ("steps") inside the unit. I even out my reading glasses on. Then, I used a flashlight. Now, after 4 days' use, I came to Amazon seeking answers. Their excellent review includes the answer that the instruction booklet lacks: USE THE markings ON the CARAFE, and add a little extra water to allow for volume lost from steam! Thank you, Amazon! Also, the price here is decent. You can save a little more at Bed, bAth, & Beyond if you use their 20% off coupon (even old ones as they never expire). I appreciate the adjustable temperature dial. Bottom line: use the DCC 1200 carafe to measure water. Read the instruction bookle and Amazon's extensive feature review as it includes tips that the user manual lacks). Use a heaping, not a level, scoop of coffee per cup. I, like some others, initially struggled to remove the carafe lid (again, no instruction in the user manual): it SNAPS on and off, unlike others that lift with your thumb. I still miss my Braun Coffeemaker from Germany; I contacted them, and they no longer currently market it in the US.
