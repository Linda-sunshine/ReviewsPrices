review/summary: Love it!!review/text: Works very well and the batteries last a long time. It's kind of funny to see my puppy run away from it when the top is on the floor when I'm changing the bag, and it just seems to open by itself. I have received so many compliments on it, I had to buy two more as gifts. Won't go back to regular trashcans!
