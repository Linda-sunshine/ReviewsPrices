review/summary: Could not have my head on this pillow for more than a minute or soreview/text: I couldn't wait for my head to sink into the microbeads on this pillow when I took it out of the box. Firstly, it sat in the spare room for a couple of days as it smelled horrible (I'm guessing it's the smell of the new microbeads) but when I did put it on the bed I could not have my head on it for more than a minute or so. For me, it was akin to sleeping on a brick! My head didn't 'sink' into it at all.The most galling thing about the whole process (and internet shopping in general)... having to pay to send it back and be left with nothing.
