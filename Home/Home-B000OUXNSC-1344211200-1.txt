review/summary: All I could hope forreview/text: We recently purchased a high-end adjustable bed with a split king configuration. The manufacturer insists that you use one of their extremely costly mattress pads to keep the warranty in effect for the mattresses. Unfortunately, I hate their mattess pad - it is flimsy and slick, and wrinkles under the sheets no matter what I do. So I decided to try an additional fairly thin mattress pad, in spite of the matress manufacturer's recommendation to not use anything but their inferior one. The reviews I read for this product were either great or a 1 because of the large number of them that seemed to melt together in the dryer. I was a little concerned, but apparently I was one of the lucky ones - I dried it on a low setting and it came out perfect. It solves my problem with the manufacturer's required one and is comfortable to sleep on. I am now going to order one of my husband's side. This is a heck of a good pad for the price.
