review/summary: Very goodreview/text: Friends made fun of my ancient Rervere ware -- however it's still going strong. But, I decided to get some updated pots and pans. First I picked up some from Marshall's. One of the celebrity chef brands. Ohhh - pretty with glass lids! They were awful. Everything stuck and hard to clean and not impressive at all. So after reading reviews I got these instead. I find that they do cook much better and stick much less. I think they cook faster too. The only thing I'd like is the glass lids - it's nice to be able to peek through and see the food cooking rather than lifting the lid and letting the steam out - but luckily I saved a few of the lids from my other pots and they fit - so when I want to - I substitute the glass for the metal lids. I like them enough that I will be purchasing the same brand smaller pot to round out my set.
