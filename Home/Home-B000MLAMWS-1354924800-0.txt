review/summary: Great deal! Great Mixer!review/text: I had the use of a similar model several years ago so I knew I wanted the style where the bowl could be raised instead of the other kind where the head tilts. I'm so pleased with this mixer. Bread dough is no problem and it makes creamy mashed potatoes. It was my Christmas present to myself last year and I don't regret it one bit!
