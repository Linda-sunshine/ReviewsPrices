review/summary: works pretty wellreview/text: From reading about mandolines, it seems like you need a few different models to cover every slicing situation you may face. However, I was not going to buy more than one, and I wasn't sure how often I would use this. I wanted it to get even slices for the dehydrator, and figured I could use it to make my salads pretty, etc. So far I haven't figured out how to make the dicing work. You have to cut the veg once it's in the holder one way, and the julienne slicer cuts it the other way, ending up with dices. I have some mental block in figuring that out, but that's not the mandoline's fault. Just taking a star off because i have a hard time passing veg over the blade sometimes, it gets kind of stuck on the V point. But I expect to get better with it hopefully as time goes on.
