review/summary: Great little heater!review/text: I've owned this and used it for about 3 months now, and it works very well indeed. Description states exactly what it is - a 1 room heater that will heat up your room if you shut the door and leave it on for a few hours. We use this every day and it's a great buy. We also have a different heater (Lasko) which is very good but trips my fuses, being twice the rated wattage of this Optimus.
