review/summary: Truely Pure waterreview/text: I like this filter over the others and the more popular Brita. I tried Brita, but it was not all it was cracked up to be, the water was not as refreshing as it should be, and it actually tested poorly, meaning there were still many contaminants in the water, like chlorine. Pur One is a much better filter, the water tastes really clean and refreshing.
