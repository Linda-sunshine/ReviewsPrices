review/summary: Love it, love ice cream!!!!!!!!!!!!!review/text: The Good:Make 2 quarts of great ice cream in 30 mins.Fully automatic motor means you don't have to hand crank it. Put in the ingredients, turn it on, and walk away.Brushed stainless steel look makes it visually appealing on the counter top.The power chord hides inside the case when not in use for a neater look.Can add large chunks of mix ins with out any trouble.Cleans ups easily.The Bad:A little loud. Not loud like a blender, but you know it is running.The power chord is pretty short, so it needs to be right next to the power outlet.Not self cooled. You have to freeze the bowl in the freezer before use.No auto shutoff, so you have to watch and time it yourself.Over All Impression:Great product if you are looking for a simple but effective way to make ice cream. If you want a high quality ice cream maker from a top end name brand at a very reasonable price - then the Cuisinart ICE 30BC is for you . One down side is the need to freeze the bowl before using it. If you do as suggested, and keep the bowl in the freezer then you will never have to wait for it to freeze. Problem solved.
