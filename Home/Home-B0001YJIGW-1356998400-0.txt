review/summary: If you have a metal tub, it will take some fussingreview/text: I have an old-fashioned metal claw-footed tub, and its not very deep. I ordered this hoping to make the water a bit deeper. It did pretty good. It took some fussing, and I had to cut a bit off the top of the product (which was easy since it's made of very soft rubber) to get it to fit, as my hot/cold faucets sit JUST above the top drain. I then had to get both the suction cups and the tub wall wet before it would stick, and even then it took a lot of adjusting.But it works! It's been sticking there for over 24 hours now.Good product, but very big. I would recommend!
