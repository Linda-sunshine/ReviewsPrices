review/summary: It was great while it lasted...but didn't last long.review/text: I bought this juicer about a year ago based on the mostly positive reviews. I was in love with it from the very first great-tasting, pulp-free juice and super impressed with how dry the solid bits were. Clean up is a breeze as you can rinse the 3 removable components using the scrub brush to clean the basket. I used it about twice daily for a month and then about 1-2 times a week for a year. Following the 2012 thanksgiving holiday, I decided to kick up my juice intake back to twice a day and after a week of using my juicer, the motor burned out the plastic on the base of the basket! I had only juiced 1 apple (cut in quarters) and half a pear so it's not like i was running it for a long while. I am so sad now that I have to go out and get another juicer which will not be a Hamilton Beach.Basically it seems this juicer is not built for the long haul. So I say if you have one, enjoy it while it lasts. If you are looking for a juicer with long life and durability, shop elsewhere!
