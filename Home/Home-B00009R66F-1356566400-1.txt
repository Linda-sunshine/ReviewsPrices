review/summary: The Winnerreview/text: If you're looking for a steam cleaner for your carpets, your search has now ended. This is my third unit, my second Hoover, because the previous two were broken when I lent them out. But this model cleans like the others never did and is so easy to operate, empty and fill. I could see the cleaning difference immediately after completing the wet and dry strokes and my 14 year old carpet looks brand new! So here is what I'm going to do; I'm going to make sure I clean this machine after each rare use (like a previous reviewer suggested) and if anyone asks to borrow this cleaner, it will not leave my home unless I'm with it.
