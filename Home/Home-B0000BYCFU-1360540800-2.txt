review/summary: My New Favorite Kitchen Toolreview/text: Yep, it's huge! Make sure you have the space for it. If you do, just buy it. I've had mine for about two weeks and I've already made and canned beef stew in it and canned marmalade, achar, sweet pickles, and coleslaw, I live at about 7500 ft., so a pressure cooker is essential for beans, etc. The beef in the stew I made was the tenderest I've ever gotten at this altitude. Very, very happy with this purchase.
