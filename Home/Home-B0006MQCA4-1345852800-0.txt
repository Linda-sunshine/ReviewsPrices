review/summary: Great water filterreview/text: Bought this because I was tired of buying gallons and water every week and lugging them up to my apartment only to run out at inopportune times. The Pur has a large capacity so you don't have to worry about frequently refilling. And the slender profile takes up much less refrigerator space than one or more gallon's of water did. Water goes through filter quickly and there's no loss in taste quality what so ever. As a matter of fact I believe the water taste better but that might be because I'm a fan of the filter itself.
