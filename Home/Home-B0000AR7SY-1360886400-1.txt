review/summary: One fine grinderreview/text: There is little to say, really. The grinder does a great job of grinding coffee beans to whatever granularity I desire. It's a well-designed and constructed device and I would recommend it to anyone. I bought it because of Capresso's reputation and my prior experiences with their products. They have yet to disappoint me.
