review/summary: Warm Sheets But Still Throws Off Lintreview/text: We bought these sheets about a year ago (December 2011) because we needed something other than the cotton sateen sheets and thin blankets we used over winter. The directions recommended washing before use and I had to enter the lint trap on the dryer a few times I dried them.We've had them over a year and they hold up wonderfully. No pilling, still very soft and warm. They fit the bed perfectly. We have a very thick mattress and the fitted sheet has no problem completely covering it.Just be certain to empty your lint trap sometimes during and *definitely* after you dry them.
