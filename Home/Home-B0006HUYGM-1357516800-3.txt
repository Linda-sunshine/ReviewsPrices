review/summary: works great but....review/text: I love the power behind this little machine, but I am frustrated both by the weight (it's supposed to have alleviated the stress of lugging my full sized vacume up the stairs) and also by the small filter that gets plugged up immediately. My hope is that these bagless vacumes are going to be redesigned in the near future to allow for more extended use before filters have to be taken out, cleaned, replaced etc. Id give this vacume a 5 star rating for the power and suction, if it wasnt for the inconvenience of cleaning the filter so frequently and its heavy weight.
