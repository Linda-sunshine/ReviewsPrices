review/summary: Great for a Queen Sleeper Sofareview/text: Bought this for a new queen sleeper sofa that had a very springy, thin mattress. Difference is night and day. Only downside is the measurements... the length is a bit long for the sleeper sofa mattress and hangs off the edge. Other than that, my guests are very happy with it.
