review/summary: Bought as a Giftreview/text: Got this as a gift for my wife who was not too happy to discover that the Juiceman that had been collecting dust down the cellar got tossed.Boy have juicers come a long way. This thing is powerful and fairly quiet compared to what I remember the Juiceman to be like. The big feed tube is awesome!My only complaint is that the pulp collection is not separate so some dissasembly required to dump it if making large amounts of juice. Cleans up in a snap too.
