review/summary: LOVE THIS JUICER!!!review/text: I give this juicer 5 stars because its very practical and easy to use. Clean up takes 5 minutes! It's perfect for first time juicers like myself. Not only have I purchased this juicer, my mother and sister in law own a Breville as well. Total weight loss for my mother and sister in law is a combined 22lbs in a month and a half! My weightloss has been steady but successful.
