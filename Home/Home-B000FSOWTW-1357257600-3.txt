review/summary: Very Cool!review/text: I bought this as a gift for someone. We used it the other day and I have to say, it was very cool! You place the opener over the cork and press the button. It punctures the cork and automatically retracts it and pulls it out. Then you press the button and it removes the cork from the screw...it just &#34;spits it out&#34; to you. Very easy to use.
