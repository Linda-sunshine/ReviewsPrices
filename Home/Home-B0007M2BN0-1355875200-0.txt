review/summary: Works great!review/text: This thing is great. It's very inexpensive, pretty much foolproof, and I get perfectly hard boiled eggs every time.Unlike boiling eggs in a pan of water, eggs cooked in this are very easy to peel.It takes about 5 minutes cooking time in my microwave, but I don't take them out until I'm through fixing bacon, toast, etc., and have fed the dog. The eggs come out fully hard boiled, and still hot.
