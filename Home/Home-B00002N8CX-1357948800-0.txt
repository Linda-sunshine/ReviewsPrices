review/summary: one year life!review/text: It was good for the time when it was working, after one year it retired! I expected it to work for at least two years for the price I paid. come on! now I don't trust vacuums any more but I still need one for easier cleaning because I'm pretty busy and don't like the flying dust caused by a broom; so now I decided to get a cheap vacuum to work around a year or so, then I'll be satisfied.
