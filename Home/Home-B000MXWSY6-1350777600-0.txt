review/summary: Exactly what I neededreview/text: Our clock radio finally died and needed to be replaced. I was looking for a SIMPLE, small, dual alarm, with am/fm radio. As always, with electronics I am a bit hesitent to buy without trying it out. I was really impressed with this item. I had to look at the instuctions to set it up, but they were fairly easy to follow and setting the alarms was really easy. What is very impressive is the quality of the radio, nice and clear. I hope others try this item out too.
