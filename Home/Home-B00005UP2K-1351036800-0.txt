review/summary: Love itreview/text: I love this product so much. First because it looks so nice on my counter, love this color. It literally cuts my time in half. No matter if I'm only doing mashed potatoes, whips them up fast and makes them so smooth and delish. I can't believe I held onto my old fashion hand held mixer for so long. Can't wait to make homemade bread this winter and all my desserts for the holidays.
