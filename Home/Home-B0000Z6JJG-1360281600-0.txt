review/summary: Minimally useful.review/text: If I hadn't already been using a full food processor to prepare salads, I might have liked this. It DOES make nice &#34;wavy cut&#34; cucumbers (as my grand kids call them). And it DOES a great job of grating raw cauliflower (the output looks just like white cheese gratings.)BUT, it also mangles salad onions, and takes way longer to do things than does the food processor. The big problem with the Shooter is that it rotates too slow for anything like lettuce. The output clogs up. Just not what I hoped for.
