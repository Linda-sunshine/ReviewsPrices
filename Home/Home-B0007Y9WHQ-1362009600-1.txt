review/summary: Spiralizer! SO. AWESOME.review/text: I was skeptical that &#34;spaghetti&#34; made with zucchini would be acceptable to the palate. I figured it would be squashy-tasting or have a strange texture. I was totally surprised! It really does work as spaghetti. Whatever zucchini flavor it might have is completely overwhelmed by spaghetti sauce, and we just ladled the hot pasta sauce on top of the raw zucchini noodles and it cooked it to an &#34;al dente&#34; texture that was really good. My kids even ate it. We also made sweet potato curly fries in the oven and the medium-cut blade on the spiralizer worked really easily for that. I highly recommend this thing! Really easy cleanup, too....rinse and go. My kind of cleanup.
