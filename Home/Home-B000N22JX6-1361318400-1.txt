review/summary: Great purchase.review/text: This is a great little space heater. I use it in a small office and it keeps it nice and toasty. It's very pretty, doesn't look like a heater at all, easy to operate, and has several settings, oscillates, etc. I'm extrememly pleased, meets my needs to a tee!!
