review/summary: Good, Not Perfectreview/text: I owned the standard, double sided, non-stick griddle you see everywhere. Crate and Barrel sells them, for example. The deterioration of the non-stick surface sent me looking for a better option. The big knock on the Lodge griddle was uneven heating. Some reviewers, however, thought it worked just fine. So I called Lodge and asked who was right. Did the griddle heat evenly or not? I could not get a straight answer, but I was told to preheat the griddle in the oven for best use.Well, I do what Lodge recommended, but I can give you an unequivocal answer to the big question - IT DOES NOT HEAT EVENLY! Your only option then is the non-stick coated aluminum griddle. I also got rid of all non-stick sauce pans recently due to surface deterioration and went back to stainless. I am going to live with the uneven heat because I do not wish to live with any possible health concerns from the non-stick coatings.
