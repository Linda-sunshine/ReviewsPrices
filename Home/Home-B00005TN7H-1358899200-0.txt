review/summary: Exactly what it says it isreview/text: I bought this because I wanted to experiment with the whole 'salad in a jar' trend. I already have a Foodsaver vacuum sealer and I already use Mason jars for a lot of things in the kitchen anyway (including regular canning).First let me say that the jar sealer works exactly as it's supposed to. You pop it over the flat lid on the jar, run the Foodsaver, and it vacuum seals the jar. Voila! There's not much else to be said on the functionality front.From a practical point of view: I wound up using it less for the salad-in-a-jar concept (which i found disappointing) but I've found i use it all the time for storage in the pantry. I put rice, dry beans, cornmeal, and other dry goods that i don't use every day in large Mason jars and vacuum seal them. It takes less than a minute to reseal the jars each time I open one and it keeps them fresh and bug-free in the pantry.I also use this store soup, chili, or casserole leftovers for lunches during the week. I've found that I can make a large batch of veggie or butternut soup or chili, or take leftovers from a casserole type dish, divide it into quart jars and seal it, and it stays fresh for 7-10 days in the fridge. That means in the mornings I can grab a jar to take to work with me - pop the lid off, nuke the jar in the microwave, and I have a healthy, fresh, homemade lunch. Plus the jars don't stain like Tupperware or other plastic/rubber containers do when you store tomato base.This is a long rambling review to say that I ordered this item purely as an experiment, figuring it wasn't a lot of money to lose if I wound up not liking the salad-in-a-jar thing. But I found myself using it for many many other things and now it's become something that I keep in the top drawer in the cabinet because I use it multiple times a week.
