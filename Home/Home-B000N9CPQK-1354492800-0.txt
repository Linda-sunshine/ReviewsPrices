review/summary: Noisey and smellsreview/text: I have chosen to return it since it is very noisey and has a bad plastic smell to it. It did appear to work somewhat since there was already some dust trapped in the Hepa filter but the noise was unbearable even on the lowest fan setting as was the funky plastic smell. My old Holmes 2400 are much quieter than this machine.
