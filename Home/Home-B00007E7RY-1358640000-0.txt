review/summary: Good purifierreview/text: Short and sweet, yes it works very well and pushes a lot of air. Removed cat allergens from GF's apartment in a few days. Yes, it will raise your energy bill by $15-$25 if you run it on high all day all long. Yes, on high it sounds like a hurricane but low is just fine.
