review/summary: Infinitely superior to office flavia machinesreview/text: My office gave up on its old Keurig machines, which reliably produced okay coffee. They bought Flavia machines. My tummy didn't like that coffee very much---bitter, acidic, sharp.This aeropress produces infinitely better coffee, even out of crud beans. What a delight. My officemates are clamoring to use it, and I think I'll have an easy set of Christmas presents this year.
