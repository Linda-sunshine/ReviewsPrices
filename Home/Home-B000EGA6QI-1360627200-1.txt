review/summary: SURPRISED!review/text: I have wanted one of these for a while. Before Christmas, they had them on sale so my hubby got me one. I have been ill so hadn't had a chance to use it. Today I made baked potato soup. One was suppose to let it cool, run through blender, heat back up. UGH! First, I don't have a blender as mine always break. I have had zero success with finding a blender that does what I want. second, who wants to go through all that, third, I DIDN&#34;T HAVE TO!! :) I just put my blender into my crockpot. THe potatoes still had the skins on them, I was thoroughly surprised and shocked that one could not even tell... it blended everything together SO smoothly. I am TOTALLY in live with mine.. and can't wait to make smoothies. My sister also got one of these. She has used hers tons for making baby food. She makes it up ahead of time and freezes it. She said this is the best tool to do so. The plug is a bit of a nuisance... but with the results-it doesn't seem to matter! Totally recommend this product.
