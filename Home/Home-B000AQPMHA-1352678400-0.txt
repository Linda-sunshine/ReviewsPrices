review/summary: Good machine - while it lastsreview/text: This is the second Keurig I bought in 4 years. Very convenient - while it works. Despite using filtered water, regular descaling, etc., they seem to simply stop working after 2 years. Warranty is only for a year, so this ends up making them pretty expensive. Wish the company would do more to ensure longer lasting product.
