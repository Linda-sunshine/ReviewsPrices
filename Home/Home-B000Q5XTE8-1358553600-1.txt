review/summary: great chair if you are not too short!review/text: Chair is very comfortable, easy to put together and attractive enough. Being 5'1&#34;, however, I find the lumbar support doesn't line up properly and I need a cushion on the seat for it to feel like a proper fit. If you are taller, would highly recommend!
