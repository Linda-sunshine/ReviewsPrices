review/summary: This sucker is BIG!review/text: Works great for creaming soup right in the pot. I also use it to puree apples I've cooked down for applesauce and it's great for when my baby grandson comes and I have to puree his food.To compare it to a size is difficult, but understand this is NOT an immersion wand that you might use to froth milk for coffee. I'd estimate the size to be from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow of an average size woman.This baby will cream stuff in a big stock pot. The shaft is metal, the top a good solid hard plastic. The rocker on/off is in a good place and intuitive to use.I'm very happy with this.
