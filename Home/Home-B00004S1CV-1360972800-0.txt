review/summary: Pretty Ruggedreview/text: I've had this coffee cup for about two years now, and I've put it through a lot. I'v dropped it on concrete, on stone, on pavement, into the ocean, I've kicked it, I've buried it in snow for a week, forgotten it outdoors for another, and generally abused it as much as is possible.With all that, it's stood up fairly well. Not perfectly, mind, but well. The weak part of this cup is all that plastic on the top. A year and a half ago, after the third drop on concrete, the plastic lid cracked. Inside is a thick styrofoam disc, which popped out after the whole assembly cracked open. There was just no saving it. Fortunately, the cup still managed to keep my coffee and tea decently warm (the exception being when I shove it in my backpack and go for a half hour walk in sub freezing temperatures).In all, I've broken the lid and the sippy top, so now I use the tea strainer attachment and a much less functional lid. It leaks a bit now and the strainer lid is starting to break too. It's a great cup though!Really, perfect size for me, fits in a pocket, and if you aren't quite as abusive to your possessions as I am, I bet it'll last you a long time. I'm shopping for a new one, and I'll probably buy a similar one from the same company with a bit less plastic.
