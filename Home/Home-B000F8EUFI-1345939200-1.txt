review/summary: A lot for a littlereview/text: Unpacking the vacuum makes you think this is going to be a toy. It is not. It is a workhorse. I bought this for the few carpeted areas in my home, mainly the bedroom. I own two dogs that drop hair everywhere and the vacuum does a very good job of pulling up the hair with its suction and beater brush. The on-board tools are convenient and the suction readily removes pet hair from the furniture. The canister is small in capacity (and the pet hair is great in volume), so I do have to empty it two or three times in the master bedroom and once each for the office and guest bedroom. Emptying *can* be a chore, but my suggestion is to carry a paper grocery bag to empty into the bag. Because of the pet hair, I use an old bottle brush to swirl inside the canister to remove the pet hair/dirt as a mass. Then I vacuum where I emptied. Lather, rinse, repeat. I would not suggest this for a fully carpeted home or one that has more traffic than two humans and two dogs. This would be a good second vacuum to have for upstairs / downstairs / guest house. It fits nicely in a coat closet and the handle retracts if needed for more clearance. I expect to have this item for many years to come.
