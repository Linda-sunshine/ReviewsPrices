review/summary: Good enough to buy again!review/text: I used my Mr Coffee 4-cup Programmable coffee maker every day for many years. No problem. Until I moved somewhere with harder water than I thought and I suspect my negligence is what ultimately caused this pot to fail. Now that I know better I will do the regular maintenance of running vinegar through it after I get my new one in. I can't think of a better pot for me (outside of a Keurig but who has that kind of cash to blow on a coffee pot??). Definitely buying another $20 trusty little Mr Coffee. I had zero complaints.
