review/summary: Eureka Hand-Held Vacuumreview/text: I got this hand held vacuum primarily for use in my kitchen, where my little ones are always leaving a crumby mess and the utility room where I keep our cat litter box. I have to say this is one awesome vacuum! The suction on it is really incredible for such a small unit. I love the attached hose so you can get into all those nooks and crannies. It also comes with a very long cord so you can really use it over a wide area (like dragging it around the table and sweeping up all the chairs). I have also used it around the cat litter box which anyone who owns a cat knows, they can make quite a mess. This machine sucked it all right up. I was really impressed. Now I use this all over my house, especially the stairs. It just sucks up all the cat hair and the dust that gets caught on the stairs and the corners.As for the cleaning and maintance... it is pretty straight forward. The filter pops out and you can dump everything right into the garbage. The filter can also be washed, just make sure it is dry before putting it back. This IS a smaller unit so it doesn't hold a whole lot. If you are cleaning a pretty large area, expect to have to dump out the filter a couple of times (althoug this doesn't bother me in the least, it might bother some of you).Overall, I would highly recommend this vacuum. So far it is doing exactly what I hoped it would do.
