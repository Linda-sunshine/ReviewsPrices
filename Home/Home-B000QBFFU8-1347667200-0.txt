review/summary: BEST JUICER FOR YOUR BUCK !!!review/text: Love Breville because of their high quality products. I've been comparing this over Jack LaLanne's Power Juicer. If you're on a budget then go for Jack lalanne, but just add a few more to your budget and you get a lot better quality juicer for your buck. The key here is the blade and filter. You get a better juiced and no grains compare to Jack lalanne's. The only negative thing I experience is they don't provide you a nice colorful recipe to make different juice recipes. It is printed on a small black and white printed cheap paper. While Jack Lalane provides a colorful glossy paper. You can always go to Breville's site to see more of their videos and other recipes online. Or you can google search juice recipes on your own as well.
