review/summary: Good Valuereview/text: Pros:Good ValueComfortableCome in small packageCons:You sink in far too deepConclusions:Good product but it does seem to make you sink in far too deep. Some customers spoke of it smelling but after taking it out of the box for a whole day the smell dissipated and it was fine to use. (It does advise you to in the box)
