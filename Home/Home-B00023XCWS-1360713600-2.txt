review/summary: Great "Hot Pot"review/text: I bought this product to replace a similar product. I would say it is a FIRST RATE product as far as hot pots go.Pros:Nice feel, good quality(even though it's plastic).Thumb on/off switch.Tilt attached lid.Attached micro filter screen.See-thru graduated water level.Heavy duty, grounded cord.Huge coil heats up and boils VERY FAST.Cons:Lacks thermo shut off. The unit heats up and boils without shutting off.The one I replaced cycled on/off automatically so it never got too hot.You have to watch this unit closely.The cord is good quality, but could be a tad longer(typical of most electric appliances).
