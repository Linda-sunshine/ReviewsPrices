review/summary: Exactly what I wanted.review/text: I shopped a number of years before I decided on the KitchenAid Artisan. It was not the cheapest but it is the best. It is heavy enough that you are not afraid that it will fall off the counter. Does everything I wanted and makes cookie making very easy.
