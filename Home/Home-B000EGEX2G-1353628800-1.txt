review/summary: Comfortable, but squeaks and makes noises.review/text: I love how comfortable this chair is. Unfortunately after a few weeks of using it, it started making awful squeaking/rubbing noise when the chair rocks. We've tried resolving the problem but it is no use. So now it is useless when trying to put the baby to sleep.
