review/summary: Great feature set, tough to get accurate readingreview/text: I love the timer feature and the alarm when it hits a certain temperature, which allows me to go do something else rather than babysitting the pot. My only complaint is that it's a little tough to get an accurate reading; the stem seems like it has to be pretty deep in the liquid to get a good reading, which can be difficult if it's not that deep. This can render the pot clip useless.
