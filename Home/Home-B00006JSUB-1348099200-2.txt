review/summary: Excellent Valuereview/text: Let me first say that the 15" pan is HUGE...I don't think I was prepared for its size. This is a great pan. Solid, well constructed and low in price. Truly a quality product. The size is good for cooking larger roasts, stir fries etc but I also plan to buy a smaller one. I know I will use this skillet often.
