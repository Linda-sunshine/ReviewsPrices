review/summary: Best pizza pan ever!!!review/text: I have had this pan for a couple of years and it is great!!! I seasoned mine with coconut oil and do so after every use... I use a little of the coconut oil and a stainless steel scrubber to clean it. It never rusts, it heats evenly and the pizza is always perfect. This pan will probably be around long after I am gone. Lovely piece of kitchen equipment!!! Highly recommended!!!
