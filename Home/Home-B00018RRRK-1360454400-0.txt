review/summary: Workhorse of the Officereview/text: I purchased this grinder a long time ago for the coffee mess. Its been well over a year of 5 day a week usage, and this little guy is still going strong.The good part is that the hopper holds nearly 1 lb of beans, and you twist the container to select from coarse to fine grind. The removable plastic container will holder upwards of &#34;18&#34; cups worth of coffee in it. Its easy to remove, and it is easy to clean. If the machine needs to be cleaned you can screw off the hopper and clean it really easily.The bad thing is the measurement for the cups. It is NOT your typical 8oz cup of coffee, I believe it to be for a 6oz cup of coffee. So when you select 12 cups from the sliding bar, its not really 12 cups. You need more coffee than that. Its a minor irk, but just know that going in. Another bad part is where the grinds come out of the hopper and into the plastic container it tends to get stuck on the edge of the plastic. This will almost be a fine espresso type grind, regardless of coarse or fine. The only reason that this is a problem is that if you use heavily oily beans it will get stopped up over time.Overall this is a great grinder with a few minor flaws. I dont think you will regret the purchase.
