review/summary: Great knife, bargain pricereview/text: I've been using this knife for about 3 years and am just now getting around to reviewing it. There are many good reasons why this knife continues to be the winner of Cook's Illustrated's chef's knife quality comparisons. A knife's comfort and utility are, of course, subjective. This one is subjectively the best chef-style knife I've used in more than 40 year of cooking. It sharpens easily with a few swipes on the sharpener, it's a comfortable weight, nicely balanced, and the Fibrox handle is easy to keep clean and sanitary. Couldn't be happier with its performance.
