review/summary: Used mine everyday since 1986review/text: I bought my V-slicer back in 1986 from a TV demonstration by a guy who looked like Pee Wee Herman in a chef outfit. These things are great, but as others have cautioned, you need to be careful using them because the blades are scary sharp - even after 25 years! I have never cut myself using it, but I always use the holder. One of these days I might need to buy a new one. If you want to see how they are used there are videos on Youtube.
