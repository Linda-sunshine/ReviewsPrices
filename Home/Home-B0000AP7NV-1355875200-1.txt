review/summary: Great tasting waterreview/text: The water is excellent. The only problem I have (which is totally my fault) is that the pitcher is a little too small for a family and for someone who drinks alot of water. I should of purchase Brita Grande. The water taste is very refreshing and light (I like to refer to it). I would definitely recommend this to everyone who pays close attention to their health as I do.
