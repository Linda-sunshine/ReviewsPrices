review/summary: Cute humidifier for kids, worked great... when it worked.review/text: This is a nice cool mist humidifier at a reasonable price for the kids. Of course my daughters love a Hello Kitty humidifier in their rooms. It puts out a good amount of mist and holds a large enough amount of water to make it through maybe 2 or 3 nights without refill depending on the setting you have it on.We had this humidifier for maybe 4 months before it stopped working though. We have well water with a small amount of iron in it. It would build up a film in the humidifier that we would have to clean out maybe once a week. I can't fault Crane though, we called them up and they had us cut the cord and sent us a new humidifier. Good customer service.
