review/summary: Great portable moka maker!review/text: I purchased this 3 cup moka espresso maker almost 2 years ago, due to the great reviews, from Amazon. Luckily, I received an authentic one, as it appears Amazon is having a quality control issue as of late. If you look at the customer pictures above you can tell from the recent pics that a reviewer posted, that there is a clear difference. However, if you get an authentic one, these are amazing little machines.I absolutely love espresso, but I'm not much of a coffee fan. Too acidy tasting for me, and not enough kick. The taste of espresso from the moka is not quite the same as espresso from a coffee shop. To me, it has the light drinkability of coffee, but with the sweet flavor of espresso, if that makes any sense. Like other reviewers have pointed out, you might have to play around to find what coffee works well with the moka pot. I have found success with Illy's medium roast espresso (red tin). I grind it myself at the grocery store, because I find the pre-ground versions aren't fine enough and don't produce as nice of a brew from the moka pot. Another tip- it takes around 4 minutes, give or take, for the espresso to brew. I put my gas stove on a medium-high flame, and wait till I hear the very beginnings of boiling rumbling sounds and then I turn the stove off. You can also peek inside to see if the espresso has started to fill the cup. Once it's done that, you only have a few seconds before the heat needs to be turned off, to avoid getting a burnt/smokey taste. Be careful to only touch the handle at this point because the tin part gets very hot!I also love how small and portable this little espresso maker is. If you are traveling, you can bring it with you in a bag very easily.
