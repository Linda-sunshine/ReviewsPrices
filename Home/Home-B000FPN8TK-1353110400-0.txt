review/summary: Love this little teapot.review/text: Some places show some sort of base that you set it on, but this one doesn't have that... Also, the lid is just closed by gravity, there is no latch or snugness to the fit, so you might set something on top of your teapot while it's brewing if you want to make sure it's closed.I don't seem to see a way to remove filter, but it hasn't been a problem.
