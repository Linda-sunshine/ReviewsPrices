review/summary: Great kitchen machinereview/text: this is the best kitchen tool! it is easy to use, and handy. We keep it on the counter, because it is small, and use it all the time. Great for chopping onions, garlic, cheese. Small jobs - recently used it to make soup liquid for someone on a liquid diet.went out this year and bought them for my family for Christmas.
