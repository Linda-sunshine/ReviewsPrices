review/summary: I would buy two!!!review/text: This chair is awesome for new and expecting mothers. It is easy to assemble, it is sturdy and it is comfy. It is worth every penny.I must admit that it is not as soft as the more expensive chairs but it does the trick. Besides the cushion is easy on and off so you can always replace it with some thing with more cushion.I would not recommend white if you have babies (especially one that spits up a lot) but the chair cleans easily with a little spot remover.I love it and my twin girls love it. We use it all day everyday! Puts us all right to sleep.
