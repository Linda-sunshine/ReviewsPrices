review/summary: Pretty Awesome Little Machinereview/text: I bought this steamer for the huge task of steaming creases out of a large 10x20' green screen, which is stored folded up until we need it. I had a hand-held steamer which took about 2 hours to steam the entire thing. I decided to sink the $50 into this steamer to save me time, and BOY did it ever! I was done with the entire screen in less than 45 minutes. It chugs out that steam like a pro. Sure, sometimes the steam would build up at the top when you stuck it directly on the fabric from behind, but once you get the hang of keeping it at a 1/2" distance from the fabric, man does it work great! Definitely on par with a professional $200 model, which I've used in the past at clothing stores.
