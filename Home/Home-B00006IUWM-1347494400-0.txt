review/summary: Love Love Love this Machinereview/text: The day I got this I went right to work sharpening every knife in my house. Some of them were so dull that they had to run through stage 1 quite a few times to get them sharp again, but since then, I have not had a dull knife in my house. When one starts to dull a little I just run it through the stage 2 side for honing and it's ready to go again.I keep it out on my counter and ready for use at all times. If my knife does not easily slice into a tomato, it's time to use it. Quick and easy.Spending the 30 something bucks on this saved me hundreds of dollars that might have been spent buying multiple sets of knives.
