review/summary: Works great - very happyreview/text: This cookie scoop works very well. I was skeptical that it would really be better than spooning them by hand. But it's fantastic. Makes uniform size, perfectly shaped balls of dough. The grip is comfortable. And the scoop kept working through nearly 4 dozen cookies -- it didn't get sticky and stop ejecting the dough.Medium is the perfect size for a typical cookie.
