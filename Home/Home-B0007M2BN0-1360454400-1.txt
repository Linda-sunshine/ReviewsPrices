review/summary: Boiled My Eggs Then Fried My Microwavereview/text: I used it every weekday for about six months and was very happy with it. Once I got the right amount of time figured out it was great. I have a 1000 watt microwave and I'd just put in two eggs for 6 minutes, 20 seconds then go take my morning shower. By the time I got back to the kitchen, the Egg Cooker was cool enough to handle and the eggs inside were still hot. I put them in a bowl of cold water and they were perfect every time.After about four months I noticed that sometimes the inner part of the cooker would come apart from the outer shell. I also noticed that the top of the cooker did not fit on the bottom as well as it used to. But I didn't pay much attention to it. I just reassembled everything and just tried to fit the top on the bottom as well as I could.That worked fine until about 6 weeks ago. That's when I came downstairs and found my eggs were warm and my microwave was no longer working. Upon further inspection I noticed that the inner top was not aligned perfectly with the outer top. It appears that either the inner top or the egg tray was exposed and damaged the microwave.The microwave was a manufacturer discontinued model that mounts over the stove and includes a suction fan. Some quick research told me that a comparable replacement would cost between $500-$800. So I chose to repair it myself. I determined that the magnetron was bad and ordered a replacement. That fixed the problem. The cost was about $140 for a new magnetron and a microwave leakage detection meter. After about a month of being the least popular person in my household, we were back in business.My bottom line is for the cost and inconvenience this caused, I would not risk using one of these egg cookers in my microwave again.
