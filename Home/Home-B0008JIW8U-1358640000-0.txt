review/summary: Beware!review/text: I purchased this pot 2 weeks ago to replace my Cuisinart. This pot continually overflows, no matter how careful I am lining it up, and I end up with coffee grinds in the pot and all over the coffee maker. My Cuisinart only did this occassionally and I found it annoying but this pot is really the PITTS. Perhaps I just got a lemon but for now I would definitely not recommend it. You are probably better off buying a larger coffee maker and making only 4 cups in it.
