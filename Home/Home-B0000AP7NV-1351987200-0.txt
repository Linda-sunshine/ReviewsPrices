review/summary: It does its job, but...review/text: I was excited to get a brita filter. I had recently moved out of state, but the city water here has a lot of iron in it, so I knew I would need something to get rid of the smell and taste of the water. I ordered this hoping that it would do its job, and it did, but the plastic container cracked within the first three hours of usage. The filter has popped out of place multiple times, and the filter leaves the water a bit discolored.Otherwise, though, it does its job, and I don't have to deal with the smelly and nasty tasting city water anymore.
