review/summary: Eco Pad's not as good as pre-made podsreview/text: It can't be the coffee (tried Folger's French Roast, Starbuck's House Blend AND Lavazza)so it must be the device. It produces an inferior cup of coffee - bland and weak. I tried filling it as the directions indicate as well as a little more and a little less, but always there is dry coffee left in the device as if the hot water could not get to it. I wanted to like it!!!
