review/summary: Great product, great pricereview/text: This is the second one of these I've owned, having received the first as a gift. I paid $20 for it and it's well worth the money. The first one lasted for years and opened many, many bottles of wine. It's easy to use, although you may have to figure it out or have someone explain it to you the first time or two, but then it's a piece of cake. No more putting the corkscrew in crooked or breaking the cork. As I write this, I've had mine for over a year and it's still like brand new.
