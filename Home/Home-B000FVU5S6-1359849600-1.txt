These sheets fit vreview/text: It's almost impossible to find sheets that really fit a California King size bed. These sheets fit very well even after washing. However, they had a horrible smell right out of the package. I had to wash them twice to get rid of the odor. They seem like a fairly good quality. The true test will be to see how long they last.
