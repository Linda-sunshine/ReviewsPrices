review/summary: looks great, BUT WAS DEFECTIVE!review/text: This product looked great and appeared sturdy with a wide base. I liked the clear glass in that it didn't make my small bathroom look even smaller. However, upon opening the package and following the instructions I was sad to realize that it didn't work. I knew the battery wasn't the problem. It just didn't give any weight readings. Screen was blank! Beware. When I contacted the manufacturer through their website, I got no reply.
