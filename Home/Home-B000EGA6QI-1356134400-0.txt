review/summary: Jamming Away!review/text: I had been eyeing this little beauty for awhile and had considered asking for it for a holiday when it came up as a Lightening Deal. Bought it and then decided to make a jam for friends and family for the holiday instead. It smoothed out the apple chunks and whole cranberries with very little effort and right into the pot I was simmering away in. Was a bonus that the head detaches and can be thrown into the dishwasher! Have also used it for mashing steamed cauliflower with great success.
