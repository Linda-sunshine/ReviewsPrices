review/summary: Great little machine!review/text: This is my first juicer and I am very happy with it. Simple to set-up, use and clean and does not take up a lot of space. I can easily make enough for two people and possibly a third at once. Got this because my toddler decided one day that she was not eating any more veggies and so I am hoping she will like the veggie juices. I sure do!! All I need now are various recipes to mix it up :) Great product!
