review/summary: Durabilityreview/text: I received a Cuisinart as a wedding present in 1976. I use it fairly frequently; Everything still works wonderfully ( incl for cranberry sauce 4 days ago on Thanksgiving, 2012). I would purchase another one in a second...but don't need to. My original 36-yr old one has never had a problem.
