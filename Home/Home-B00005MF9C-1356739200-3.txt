review/summary: This beats a Keurig any dayreview/text: This coffee maker was bought for me as a gift almost 6 yrs ago. It's still going strong. I take it camping and everywhere cause I can travel with it. I recently bought a Keurig and noticed the coffee isn't that good. Now I'm back with my Black & Decker Brew 'n Go and my coffee taste 100% better. LOVE THIS COFFEE MAKER.
