review/summary: Absolutely love this grinder...review/text: I have had one of these for about 8 years now and there isn't a thing wrong with it BUT wanted a second one to grind flavored coffee without leaving that taste in the regular French beans I grind. Little bit loud but only takes about a minute or two to grind enough for 12 cups. Would happily buy another one if one of mine gave out.
