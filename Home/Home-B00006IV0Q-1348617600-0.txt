review/summary: Good Coffee Potreview/text: We're in the process of doing away with plastic anything, given the recent studies of plastics leaching chemicals into food and beverages. Which included our old drip coffee maker. So, we made the switch to a stainless steel coffee pot. This is your basic, old fashioned, electric percolator coffee pot. Although they don't brew coffee as fast as the drip makers do, the coffee it brews is awesome. Can't beat it!The downside to this pot is the ease of cleaning. It isn't immersible, and you have to use a pipe cleaner to clean out the spout. We clean ours by adding some vinegar to a pot full of water, and allowing it to go through a brew cycle. Afterwards, a rinse of the inside of it, being careful so as to not get the outside or bottom of it wet. It's a space saver and very nice looking coffee pot. It works well for us.
