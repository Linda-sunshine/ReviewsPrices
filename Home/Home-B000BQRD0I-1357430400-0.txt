review/summary: Works wellreview/text: This was a replacement for our old steamer which died after 6 years. This one lasts a long time with the same tank of water and doesn't take long to heat up. I like that you can use it with or without the lint brush attachment (which does help to straighten clothes as you go but can also cause some pilling on some fabrics). Some reviews for steamers seem to have unrealistic expectations. Some clothes will always need to be ironed but this is good for clothes that are wrinkled from sitting to long in the dryer or getting some extra wears out of your dry clean only clothes. I can get away with using it for some of my husbands button ups but mostly the non-iron ones. I wash and line dry them and then spray some wrinkle releaser on them and pop them in the dryer for 5 minutes. I then promptly hang them up and steam them. Any of the more formal dress shirts really do need to be ironed after washing. (so those go to the dry cleaners.. I hate ironing!)
