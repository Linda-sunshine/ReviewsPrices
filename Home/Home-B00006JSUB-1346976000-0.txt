review/summary: Classic Iron Panreview/text: This pan is a cast iron pan which means that it heats up very gently and evenly throughout the surface of the pan. This means that any food that you place on it in any location on the surface area is bound to be evenly cooked on all sides as much as possible. It is so easy to just place some beef patties or an omelet or some baked beans onto this pain, spread it all evenly out and not be concerned that a portion of your meal would be uncooked. Kudos to the makers of this pan and god bless them ever so dearly for creating such a fantastic cooking instrument!
