review/summary: Be careful caring for the lidreview/text: I love this dutch oven but I got a little lax in caring for it, especially the lid. Since you don't cook on the lid you must care for it accordingly. If you use the lid at all during braising, stewing, etc..it will collect water on the lid and you have to make sure you dry it off ( I even heat it a little on my stove top) and coat it with oil before putting it away. I stopped doing that and the lid very quickly got a lot of rust, but I cleaned and seasoned it and it looks great once again.
