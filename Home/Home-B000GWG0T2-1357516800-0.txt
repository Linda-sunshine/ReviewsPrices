review/summary: buckles/bows in center on induction cookerreview/text: The good reviews are mostly right - but the one I got - bought specifically because it is supposed to work on induction cookers - it does - but bows/buckles/raises in the center when cooking so that oil or sauce runs to the edges.Very disappointing - because of the very good reviews, but did not work for me on induction.
