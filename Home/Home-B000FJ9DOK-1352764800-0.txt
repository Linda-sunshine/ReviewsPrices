review/summary: The perfect Thermos? Damn close.review/text: Thermos has really done a great job with this Thermos:-It's the right size for a "large" coffee/drink. 18oz. of hot or cold liquid will stay that way for at least a day.-It's got a fantastic design. Easy open pop-top, that you can one-hand, but also locks if you are putting it in your beg. A nice grip in the center keeps things "grippy". It all comes apart for easy cleaning. Everything is hard palstic, metal, or rubber for a long-life. The metal doesn't leave any aftertaste ... but then again I haven't tried any orange juice in it. (See that one episode of the Office.)-It's the right price.
