review/summary: Not Bad, But I Expected Morereview/text: I have the regular Thermos Nissan and love it. It is unbreakable, attractive, easy to carry, and works GREAT so I had high hopes when I ordered this Nissan Coffee Press. As far as french presses go it works okay. They are always a pain to clean and this is no exception, but I knew that going in. Where my gripe comes in is with the Thermos' heat-retaining abilities. I made a pot this morning and it kept the coffee piping hot...for an hour; very warm in hour two; and tepid, at best, by hour three and four. The problem stems from, in my opinion, the lid; which is just a thin piece of plastic and not even insulated! The bottom and walls of the carafe are, but if the top isn't (and heat rises) then it defeats the purpose.I drink coffee throughout the morning and was hoping this Thermos Nissan would eliminate the need to keep microwaving the coffee. No such luck. Now, if you are getting this because everyone of the coffee drinkers in your home straggles to the kitchen in intervals during breakfast then you will probably like this carafe. If, however, like me, you were hoping to have hot coffee throughout an extended period of time your are S.O.L. (s___ out of luck).So your fondness for this Thermos all depends on your uses/needs for it. For some it may be the answer you were looking for; for me, not so much.
