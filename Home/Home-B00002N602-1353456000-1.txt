review/summary: Use this cooker every couple of daysreview/text: I cook my dog's chicken in a pressure cooker so I am using it every couple of days. I was using an aluminum cooker. Now that i have switched to this cooker I find it works well, (I cook the chicken for 2.5 hrs), and is very easy to clean. I was not getting very much stock from the old one, which is also part of his diet, but now get a whole pot full. I use the pressure cooker hard and often and find it to be effective, easy to use and clean, sturdy and well worth the cost.
