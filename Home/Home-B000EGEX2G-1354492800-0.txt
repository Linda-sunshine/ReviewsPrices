review/summary: Beautiful Glider!review/text: We recieved this glider as a baby shower gift from our family & its beautiful! It came almost completly assembled, which pleased my husband! It is made very well, comfy padding, glides nice & matches the cherry furniture in our baby's room perfect! I love the pockets on either side to hold bottles, bibs, burp cloths.A must for any new parent! Great buy, well worth it!
