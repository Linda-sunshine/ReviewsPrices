review/summary: Not as good as our Aeroreview/text: We had an Aero but it popped during my parent's extended stay. They were kind enough to give us the money we needed to replace it, but based on reviews I decided to go with Wenzel the second time around.I don't find this as comfortable as the Aero. If you've ever slept on a trampoline, you can envision what this feels like. It has more support than a tramp, but you sink toward the middle. Which is no fun if there is more than one person sleeping on it.Our Aero only lasted 4 years (I know that is a long time, but it was only used a week or two per year) so I suppose if this lasts longer it will prove to be the better product. But as far as comfort goes, it's definitely a blow up bed.
