review/summary: Loved it for a yearreview/text: We bought this coffee maker a year ago and really liked it. I loved the setting for making 1-4 cups, which it was only set at. We don't drink coffee every day, so I am very disappointed that it broke after such minimal use. I've had coffee pots from the dollar store last longer. I won't pay this much again!
