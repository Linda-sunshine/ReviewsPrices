review/summary: I like my Keurig much better now that I threw it outreview/text: sounding like a Mack truck in my kitchen, pumping constantly and giving only 4 oz of coffee. Descaling monthly. I had 2. Both of them did the same. I'm apparently a little thick to have tried 2 times. It looked really good sitting on top of the electronic garbage at our last electronic pick up date. Best looking piece of garbage on the pile. Really. According to mfg when I complained you need to buy bottled water for it. Who knew????
