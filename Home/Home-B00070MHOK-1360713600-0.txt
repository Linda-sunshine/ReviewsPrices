review/summary: Perfect Steamerreview/text: I received this last week and I just had to try it out. I did not use it on silk or linen, but I used it on everything else. I do laundry for three disabled individuals and sometimes clothes get wrinkled in transit. Now I bring this with and steam the clothes if needed. I am very pleased!
