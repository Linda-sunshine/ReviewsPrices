review/summary: Perfect kitchen tool with very easy clean-up!review/text: My wife is a great cook and we are always cooking up new recipes and spend lots of time in the kitchen. I act as the sous-chef in our home and therefore do some of the prep and lots of clean-up. I bought this blender hoping it would eliminate the need for using our large food processor and/or blender when making soups, and doing other small food processor type jobs. This thing works great! We use it all the time and clean up is very fast and easy! We rarely use the big food processor or blender any longer. Wish we had bought one sooner! Thanks!
