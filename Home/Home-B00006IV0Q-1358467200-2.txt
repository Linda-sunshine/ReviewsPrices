review/summary: Excellent Productreview/text: I got this because there are no plastic parts, which means it's longer lasting, well made, and healthier. The bonus is that it makes flavorful coffee, and the pot keeps it hot for as long as you need. It's surprisingly light weight as well, and very affordable. I have had no problems whatsoever with coffee grounds in the coffee--anyone who does is probably not using the right filter. This pot requires wrap-around filters, which aren't easy to find. I searched online and just ordered a case. Each filter can also be rinsed and reused at least once. I have not seen a 12-cup reusable basket, so I continue to use the paper filters. I am so glad I bought this product!
