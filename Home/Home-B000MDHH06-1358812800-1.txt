review/summary: Effective with minor flawsreview/text: Purchased the breville juicer and am very pleased with its power and performance. It pulverizes fruits and vegetables within seconds. My only complaint would be that in between putting bundles of parsley and kale, little pieces would fly out of the main shaft and get all over my kitchen counter. The juice came out smooth and no chunky pieces lodged in. I do wish the waste basket that holds the pulp was a little bigger to juice some more leafy greens. Although I did find that the pulp was dry so you know you are getting ample amount of juice. Great device to stay healthy for the new year!
