review/summary: Not what I expected.review/text: This vacuum was highly recommended to me by a cleaning lady that I decided not to hire. I have one cat and I use recycled newspaper litter. When I vacuum the litter that ends up on the floor and turn the vacuum off, pieces of litter fall out of the hose. I cannot use the attachments since the vacuum seems to have less suction power. When I do use the attachments, even more litter falls out of the hose when I turn the vacuum off. I replaced my older Dyson with this more compact vacuum. I guess I should've kept the big and bulky Dyson that I gave away.
