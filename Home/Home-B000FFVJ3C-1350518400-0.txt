review/summary: For the price, this thing can't be beat! So versatile, and is good for so many household uses!review/text: For anyone wishing to make their own beef jerky or looking to dry their own fruit, I would highly recommend this Nesco dehydrator. The price is fantastic, and, although the unit is VERY basic, that is exactly what I was looking for. There is no timer, but as another reviewer stated, this can be solved for about 5 bucks by using a standard household lighting timer. I have dehydrated lots of beef for jerky (the Nesco seasoning that comes with this unit is fantastic as well) and lots of fruit, including strawberries, banannas, and pineapple, and all have turned out wonderful!
