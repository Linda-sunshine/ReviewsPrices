review/summary: nice look and reliable readingsreview/text: I ordered this because I was looking for a reliable and attractive scale. This clear look is perfect for my small bathroom because it gives the illusion of not taking up much space. I use it daily, and I haven't noticed any inaccurate readings--they don't fluctuate more than I would expect, and they correlate well with other scales I've used at the gym. Love the look, love the accuracy.
