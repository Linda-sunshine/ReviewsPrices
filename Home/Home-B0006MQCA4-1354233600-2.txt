review/summary: I love this dispenserreview/text: Water tastes great and it filters out the bad stuff while leaving the good things like flouride. I agree with other reviewers that say you don't need to replace the filter as frequently as suggested. I use mine a lot and get at least 3-4 months out of the filter before I notice a difference. If you have a large family and it gets constant use, maybe you need to replace it sooner but that would be the exception and not the rule.
