review/summary: great tea potreview/text: I have been using mine for about a month for loose tea. I am quite happy with it. It is easier to clean than the previous tea strainer i used, and it also does a better job of keeping ALL tea leaves from leaking into cup. I have not been putting in the dishwasher - it's so easy to clean that it has not seemed necessary. i also have not been microwaving it, because i prefer boiling my tea water in a kettle. (in my opinion it does taste better to pour BOILING water over tea leaves vs. heating water to boiling in the microwave with the tea leaves already in it.) i'm pretty fussy about my tea. i received this as a gift and did not really think i would use it but it won me over quickly.
