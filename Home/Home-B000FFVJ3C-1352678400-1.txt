review/summary: Nesco FD-75A Food Dehydratorreview/text: I love my new dehydrator! I burned up two other brands dehydrating juicy tomatoes. They had bottom-mount motors and apparantly too much juice was released in the process and the motors quit. Also the others were harder to clean with the little holes in the bottom tray where alot of product would fall when shrunk. My new Nesco is very efficient, has many temperature choices, can handle extra trays for larger quantities, and is simple to clean! Great design...it's the only brand I would ever consider buying now that I've had the pleasure of using one.
