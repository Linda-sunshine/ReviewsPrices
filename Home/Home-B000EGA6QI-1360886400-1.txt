review/summary: Excellent... until it's brokenreview/text: The first few times using this, it was excellent. It made some quick whipped cream, soup, and sauces without any issues. But the 7th or 8th time I went to use it, maybe 2 months after purchase, part of the inside was almost completely stripped, so the blade would not turn. There is a warranty on it, and I'm sure it will be taken care of without too much trouble, but I'm still a little disappointed that the number of uses didn't even break double digits before having to resort to repairs.
