review/summary: Hoover SteamVacreview/text: I love this machine. It's does a great job, and it's really easy to clean. Make sure you read the directions and follow them. When it's put together correctly, it works... Not sure if this is a plus or minus... but the machine has some weight to it, and it's harder for me to move it, so my husband has to do it... It cleans the rugs and cleans up fast. My rugs look great and it's fun to run....
