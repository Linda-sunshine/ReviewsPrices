review/summary: Love this Mirrorreview/text: It's nice to be able to put your makeup on, on a dark winterery morning and once it's clear it looks as perfect as if it was applied in good daylight, no need to pull out a tissue to tone down the blusher. I'm from Northern Ireland and I purchased a Stepdown Converter for 6 something from ebay and mirror lights up perfectly. Although the mirror looks abit like something from sixties or seventies, but thats not important- when you invest in good makeup its nice to apply it well, especially when there's a lack of light.
