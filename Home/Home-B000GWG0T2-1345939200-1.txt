review/summary: The best non-stick I've ever ownedreview/text: This is far and away the best non-stick pan I have ever owned, including a doubly expensive Scanpan. Everything about it is a pleasure: it's extremely easy to clean every surface - interior, exterior, base and rim - and I especially love that the handle rivets are also coated with non-stick, unlike most other pans where food burns onto the bare metal and is impossible to clean without damaging the surrounding non-stick coating. It's a good heavy weight and heats evenly, and the handle is at the right angle for easy lifting. I love the special feature of the center disk that changes color when the pan is sufficiently heated to start cooking.I have used this daily for five months for eggs, omelets, fish, chicken and meat, vegetables, stir-frys, etc. and it still looks and acts like new. The handle is supposed to be oven-safe to 350 degrees, but that is only thing I haven't tried.
