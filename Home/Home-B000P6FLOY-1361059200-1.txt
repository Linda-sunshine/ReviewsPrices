review/summary: Temperature is way offreview/text: I tried using this thermometer a couple of times but the temperature reading is way off. Today, I used it with chicken breast and it said the breast was at 180F after 10 minutes of cooking. I checked the temperature with 2 other thermometers and the actual temperature was 120-125F.I have the probe fully inserted up until the bend but it is still way off!
