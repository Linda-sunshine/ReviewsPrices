review/summary: Just what I needed!review/text: My oversized mug has a standard-size bottom, and it fits on the heating element with tons of room to spare. I start with a mug of scalding-hot tea and place it on this warmer, and the scalding temperature does come down to the perfect drinkable temperature and there it stays. When the tea level gets really low, though, the tea temperature does rise considerably. I have no complaints. The cord is plenty long enough to put on my cubicle desk, snake across and down through the allotted cord hole a foot or so away, then down to the outlet. The on/off switch isn't smooth, but that's hardly a problem.
