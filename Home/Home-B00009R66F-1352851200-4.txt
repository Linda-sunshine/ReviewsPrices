review/summary: Don't waste your time or money on this machine!review/text: I bought this machine about a month ago and actually liked it a lot at the time. Then this past week I took it out to clean a spot up and the machine was leaking all over the place while using it and the hose attachment wouldn't work at all and just poured water out of the bottom of the machine all over the floor, so I returned it back to Amazon. So then just figuring it was a fluke defect with that machine I ordered another one of the same machine and got it yesterday and it is broken out of the box and have to send it back again. I am extremely disappointed and will not be ordering another one!
