review/summary: I like my nearly 40-year-old Osterizer better...review/text: I figured didn't have very long to go in this world, so I purchased this model kitchenaid blender, thinking it would be a stalwart appliance much like my stand mixer. In my opinion, the jar is flimsily designed and does not lock onto the stand. With such a powerful motor, I have to stand there and hold the jar onto the base the whole time while blending. The "slow-start" feature is a joke. It does blend well and cleans fairly easily (and we don't have a dishwasher), which is why I gave it two stars. It is also VERY loud. It's going back to the store and until I find another blender, the old 12-speed Osterizer is coming back out of the cabinet.
