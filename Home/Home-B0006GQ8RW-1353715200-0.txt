review/summary: Excellent filters for an excellent pricereview/text: These are the regular Brita pitcher replacement filters. I use my Brita pitcher to filter for taste before putting the filtered water into a hot water boiler/dispenser that I use for brewing coffee and tea. These filters make the water taste good, and they also reduce lime/calc build up on my dispenser. I have yet to find a better proce for them than what I get here on Amazon.If you are filtering for micro-organisms, there are pitchers and filters out there that do a better job. I use a Pur 2 stage for drinking water.
