review/summary: nice looking, brews pretty good coffee but has one big flawreview/text: sometimes the coffee doesn't flow into the cup but drips toward the back rim and then onto the counter. This has happened even though I now always make certain that the filter is placed correctly. If it drips onto the counter then you know that my day has started badly.
