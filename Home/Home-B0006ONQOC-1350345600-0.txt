review/summary: My Ice Cream Makerreview/text: First time we fired it up we made some vanilla ice cream, and learned the hard way that you should only add the vanilla extract THE LAST TWO MINUTES of the cycle otherwise your ice cream will be more like soup, albeit tasty ice cream soup. After figuring that detail out we have been more than happy with our automatic ice cream maker, I'd recommend this ice cream maker to anyone who is looking for one, it is simple, works great, and looks sharp.My only complaint is that they didn't make it more clear in the recipe booklet about adding the vanilla extract during the last two minutes of mixing. But there are a lot of delicious recipes in it!
