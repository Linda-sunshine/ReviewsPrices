review/summary: Love itreview/text: I started juicing with the Breville model that's one lower than this - loved it, but when I realized I was going to continue juicing all the time, I wanted the convenience of having the external pulp catcher and bigger volume container for juice. This machine is amazing, works great and is super easy to clean (the actual filter takes a little elbow grease, but that's true for any of this type).If you are a serious juicer, I think its worth spending a little more - the ability to do large batches is more convenient with this model than the slightly cheaper model. For some reason, the plastic in this model stays cleaner (kale or beet root, with strong coloration, don't &#34;stick&#34; to this as much as the other model). Either way, they wash off and are strong and reliable!
