review/summary: Works greatreview/text: I've had this for well over a year now and it has worked great. Maybe not the very best coffee you've ever had, but I'm pretty picky and it meets my needs. I keep it on my desk at work and make a cup every morning. I've never have the problems with water overflowing that other reviewers have complained of - I fill the water to the fill line, use the re-usable filter that comes with it and use a 1-ounce coffee scoop to add the grounds. Very pleased with this purchase - definitely got my money's worth. I would recommend it if something like a Kuerig is not in your budget.
