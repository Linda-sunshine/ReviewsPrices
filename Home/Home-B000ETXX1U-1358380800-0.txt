review/summary: Guest Bed that holds upreview/text: Picked this item for a guest bed. Wanted something that would hold up to a few nights of sleeping and then could be easily stowed. This bed has met the need. The folks that slept on it said it slept OK and the bed was durable enough that it can be stowed and used again when we have guests. So for the price of a hotel room in a budget hotel, you have a guest bed that will last for several years. Have not experienced any problems with this product yet. It has a limited warranty and that was one of the reasons we went with this item. I'd recommend it to others.
