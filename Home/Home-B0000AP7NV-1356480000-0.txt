review/summary: So far, so good.review/text: The only reason I shaved off 2 stars is because the lid keeps falling off when I use it with a single hand. I mostly use is my other hand to hold it. But when I'm cooking and need that half cup of water to keep the dish from burning or whatever, the lid falling off into the pot just doesn't help.Wish it was constructed a little better and had a better way to lock/hold the lid in place.
