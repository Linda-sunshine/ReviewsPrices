review/summary: Sunday Nights Are Poppin' Again!review/text: We've had several popcorn poppers through the years, and one like this once before. I think the air pop ones are the best for light and tasty popcorn results. Popcorn pops when the water in the kernel heats enough to cause steam and bursts the kernel. Even though this popper has a small tray to measure the corn and melt butter, we just forgo the latter and melt the butter in the microwave. Easy to clean up the popper too.
