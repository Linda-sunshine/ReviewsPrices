review/summary: Great spare bed.review/text: No problem with leaks. Blows up to a firm fully queen size bed. Decent height off the ground. Compact. Perfect for one person - two would roll to the middle a bit just because of the nature of an air bed. Sheets are tough to make stay on unless you have really deep-pocket sheets. This bed is still better than a sleeper sofa for comfort.
