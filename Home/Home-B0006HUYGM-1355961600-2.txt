review/summary: This vacuum sucks (in a good way)review/text: I got this primarily for cleaning up the dog hair from our 100 pound german shepherd/chow from our cars. It works great for that. The suction is strong and it has a hose that gives a more concentrated pick up. Several competing highly rated vacuums do not have a hose that can be used apart from the main unit. This is a huge advantage when trying to extract dog hair from all the nooks and crannies of a car interior.Highly recommended.
