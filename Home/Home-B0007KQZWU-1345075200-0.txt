review/summary: Cusinart Multiclad setreview/text: It is an awsome set of cookware. After researching quality cookware the Cusinart received great reviews and it is also cost effective. No where else could I find this quality at this price. Also I have a ceramic cooktop they work great for that. I have disliked the cooktop because it is hard to clean but with these pots I do not have the bubbling over of food which bakes onto the surface. My guess is this is because of the even heat distribution and lower temperature cooking.These pans are so great they changed by view of my stove. Clean up of the pans is also easy. I have had no troble with clean up except the fry pan. This problem was solved easily by following the directions. I boiled water and a little soap in the pan and they came out clean.
