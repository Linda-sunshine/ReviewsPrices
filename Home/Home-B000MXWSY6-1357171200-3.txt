review/summary: Works great...super easy to set.review/text: Let's talk bout setting the alarm. There are two alarms...one you set on the left, one you set on the right. To set the time you want, you turn the knob. One direction counts &#34;clockwise,&#34; the other direction &#34;counter clockwise.&#34; You hold that knob until it reaches the time you want. Go too far? That's ok, just turn it back a little. No more pressing a button over and over until you reach your desired time, and if you go to far, you have to go all the way back around again.To turn the alarm on, there is another knob on each side. You turn the knob on, it flashes that alarm time, and then goes back to clock, leaving a small light on the side of the time saying the alarm is on.The snooze button is long, on the top, and easy to hit.Has worked great for a couple months as my cell phone back up. Would absolutely recommend.
