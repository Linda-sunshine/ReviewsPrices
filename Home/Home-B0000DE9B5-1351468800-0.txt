review/summary: Don't put in dishwasher.review/text: I like my 2-liter jug. I bought it to put milk in as I hate how milk dries on package lid and neck and makes a mess. However, don't put the lid in the dishwasher as I did. I put it on the top rack as the instructions said. The rubber seal came out of the dishwasher brown. It's very ugly and gross looking now. It doesn't seal very well now either. So if you plan on buying one of these, plan on washing the lid by hand.
