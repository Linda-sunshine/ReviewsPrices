review/summary: Doesn't workreview/text: Buyers beware! I do not recommend buying this product online. The motor was dead right out of the box. Thanks alot! I went out and bought a ton of organic veggies and fruits and now they will rot while I wait for a replacement. I wouldn't even give this crappy item one star. Do some quality control before sending out your product. Oh and by the way, Breville's phone number for customer service is out of order. Breville SUCKS!
