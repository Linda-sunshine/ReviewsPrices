review/summary: Very disappointing.review/text: I followed the directions for long grain brown rice and it ended up entirely too moist and sticky. I really regret this purchase, given the price I paid. I will try again later in the week and cut the water by 25% and see what I get. It plays a happy tune when the rice is done, but I would rather skip the music and have the clock show me the total time left for cooking once I start the whole process - not just for the last 8 minutes! I have had FAR better results with Uncle Ben's boil-in bags!
