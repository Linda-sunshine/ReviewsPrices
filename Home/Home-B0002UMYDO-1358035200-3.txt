review/summary: Fantastic!review/text: Our Oster that we had about 5 years died and I searched Amazon to see what options there were for can openers. I read through reviews of this one and decided to give it a try. Right out of the box it is so much easier to use. The problem with the Oster was that it was hard to get the blade to hit the top of the can whereas with this one I have yet to not hit the top of the can on the first try. I also like that the assembly detaches from the base for easy washing and drying. I am real pleased with this can opener.
