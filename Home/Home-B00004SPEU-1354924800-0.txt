review/summary: great for hand-drip coffee! will probably work on machines tooreview/text: I use this to grind beans for hand-drop coffee- fineness is about 1/4 to 1/2 the size of rice grains, which gets finer the longer you hold it down. It should work for machines if you grind in shorter pulses. From the picture I thought the grind container was the entire height of the machine, but it's actually only the top 4-5 inches which is great for cleaning. It'll hold up to 5 tablespoons of coffee beans. I recommend wiping after each use, because coffee grinds release oils which can become stale over time
