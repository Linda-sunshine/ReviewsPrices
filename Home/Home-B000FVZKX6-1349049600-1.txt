review/summary: Sheds like crazyreview/text: The velvet is extremely warm (perhaps a little bit too warm) and soft. However, within a few days, it started shedding like crazy. Now, my entire floor is filled with little pieces of the material and my clothes, hair, etc. are all covered when I get up in the morning. I kind of look like I just was under a snow machine. Hopefully a wash or two will take care of it, but I don't know.
