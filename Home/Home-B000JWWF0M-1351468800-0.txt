review/summary: ULTRA DELUXE QUALITY SHEETSreview/text: Luxuriously thick, smooth, tightly woven,cotton sateen. Very few wrinkles out of the dryer & the top flat sheet decoratve band stayed flat with no puckers or bunching. I absolutely agree with the review by E. Schechter, April 2007. They are not 'soft & cuddly' out of the package, but they will get soft with washing.I put them through a hot wash cycle twice in a row, they are now very soft, but not in a way that wraps you up like a mummy when you turn over in bed. I have been so disappointed with most of the sateen weave sheets because they are too thin. It is annoying to sleep in thin, gauze-like sheets that turn the bed into a mess if you move slightly under them.My clue to the possible quality was that these had a shipping weight of 10LBS, while all of the others were 3-5lbs. I have only seen this quality in "to the trade" desigen centers with sheet sets that coast $1100 to $1200. Really, they're out there!I will be buying another set soon.
