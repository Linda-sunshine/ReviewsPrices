review/summary: Works Very Wellreview/text: So far so good, although it is early days. Have used it four times and have no complaints whatever. It is a good piece of industrial design, quite clever the way the need for some components has been obviated by utilzation of the injection-molded components.The four discharge points for hot water into the basket is much better than a single one, which my (deceased) far more expensive Krups had. I never make more than 2 or 3 cups at once, and the usability size is good. Also the programming of the clock/timer is very intuitive, or at least it was so for me. And the water level is very easy to see.Update: It has been a couple of weeks now, and I've used it for about twenty five more brew cycles, and I find nothing wrong. It makes good coffee and I really like the compact size.
