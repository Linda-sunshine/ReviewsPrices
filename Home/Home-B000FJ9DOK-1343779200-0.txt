review/summary: Controls Temperature, But Dislike Drinking Spoutreview/text: This is a great bottle for controlling the temperature. I usually take it with me on a hike or a bike ride, and it's awesome to have cold water several hours after pouring it. The thing I don't like about it is the drinking spout. Something about it makes it difficult to take big drinks out of, which you want when you're trying to cool off!I recommend this if your primary need is keeping beverages cold or warm.
