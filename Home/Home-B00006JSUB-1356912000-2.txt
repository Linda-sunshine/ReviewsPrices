review/summary: Essential home equipment. Good old fashioned cast iron skillet.review/text: Pros:It heats very evenly and cooks better than any cookware I have owned. The temperature control is fantastic, as it rises and cools slowly. The seasoning and patina it develops provides a natural non-stick coating. It's also great as it adds a touch of healthy iron to your diet as you cook, instead of unhealthy Aluminum, Chromium, or Teflon that is in most modern cookware.This has some great benefits from a cooking and health standpoint.Cons:Quite heavy. About Eight Pounds empty. Those with weak wrists and arms need not apply. Two hand hold required.Tips:You must have goot pot holders, as the uninsulated handles will get hot when cooking.Don't scrub hard as it removes the seasoning.Don't let it air dry, it will rust.Don't put it in the dishwasher, as it will remove the seasoning.Leave it a little oily after you cook
