review/summary: Small, but doable.review/text: It's a Brita water filter pitcher, follow directions and put filter in. It work and doesn't leak. Just make sure to put the filter in correctly or it will let water leak though.Pros:-Makes any tap water bearable to drinkCons:-Doesn't filter fluoride-A little small for a pitcherOn a good note, I did like how Brita included a sticker to make sure you change the filter when it says. Although, I can sensitive taste buds so I know when it is going bad. I recommend spending a little more and getting a larger one. Then again, I just drink a lot of water.
