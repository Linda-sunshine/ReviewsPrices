review/summary: worst waterbed everreview/text: Greetings fellow amazonians I purchased this because my old waterbed sprung a leak, don't ask for more details other than it involved a pair of scissors and the dog-faced girl. Anyhoo when this mattress arrived I was suprised not to find an easy female connector to hook my hose to, so I went to home depot with the mattress to find a connector. After twohours of searching I finally found to connectors that when daisy chained together had the fit I needed. Fill up was ok but when I was done this mattress didn't feel right. It was lumpy and didn't have the nice sway that most other waterbeds have. I may return I will keep you posted.
