review/summary: Terrific Coffeereview/text: I&#8217;ve had my unit for one month. It brews a deliciously fresh cup of coffee that&#8217;s much tastier than my old Mr. Coffee. Though I prefer a strong cup of coffee, even the light K-cups taste good to me. The bolder coffees are rich, bold and very satisfying. Never weak.It takes but a few seconds to fire up the machine in the morning. Yes, it makes noise and it rattles a bit, but why wouldn&#8217;t it? The Keurig is forcing pressurized water through the system. That&#8217;s what brews a super-fast cup of coffee.I found it a bit frustrating to remove, fill and replace the water containment bucket. It slides in and it takes a certain amount of finesse to lock it in properly. I solved that problem by removing the top lid only. I pour the water into the chamber without removing it from its base.I don&#8217;t like the feature that requires me to remove the pre-installed filter basket every time I want to brew my own non-Kcup coffee using the optional and expensive Keurig filter basket.The control panel is easy to read and operate. The print and the buttons are large enough to see without squinting. There are no LED displays on this Keurig model.
