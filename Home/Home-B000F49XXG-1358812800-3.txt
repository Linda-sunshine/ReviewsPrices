review/summary: Perfect for the low pricereview/text: I worked as a barista in various coffee shops for years and really missed making espresso beverages, so my boyfriend gave this to me for Christmas. While it is by no means a perfect substitute for industrial size/strength machines that professional baristas will be used to, it definitely gets the job done.PROS:-Inexpensive-Steams milk very reliably-Only takes about 20 minutes to heat up-Pours steady shots every time-Very easy to clean up-Easy to use IF you already know how to use an espresso machine-Lightweight machine (easily transportable)CONS:-Lightweight machine (You cannot rely on the weight of the machine to "push back" when you put in the portafilter, as you can on an industrial size machine. This necessitates some awkward maneuvering.)-Instructions are vague (I would not have been entirely clear what to do had I not been a professional barista)-Machine is very short (This means that to use the steam wand you need to position the machine on a counter corner to even have room for a milk pitcher)-Shots are not self-timed (You have to eyeball how much of a shot you want, how diluted you want it to be, etc, as the shot will just keep running until you shut it off)-Portafilter feels flimsy compared to a professional grade one, and the latch that is meant to hold the filter in barely worksI realize that it seems like there are a lot of "cons" for this to be getting a 5-star review, but I truly feel that, given the price and portability of this compact machine, it really does deserve 5 stars. I would expect all of those cons to go away if I were to spend thousands on an espresso machine. But since we only make lattes on the occasional lazy Sunday morning, this machine fits the bill perfectly.It may not be able to withstand the rigors of a real coffee shop, but if you want good, solid lattes on an easy to use, inexpensive machine, this is for you.PS -- This does NOT come with a milk pitcher or milk thermometer. So whether you are buying this for yourself or as a gift, I highly recommend purchasing these items along with this machine (they are pretty inexpensive but are absolutely necessary if you want to use this machine right out of the box).
