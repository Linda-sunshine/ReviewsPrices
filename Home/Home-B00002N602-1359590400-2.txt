review/summary: Not happy with qualityreview/text: I liked the looks of this cooker but when I assembled the handle,the screws were not tight enough and now after two months of use,the screws are getting more loose and have rusted as well. I am scared to hold the cooker from its handle now as it is loose and rusty.Did not expect this quality from Presto.
