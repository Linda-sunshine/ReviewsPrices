review/summary: Crane Penguin Humidifierreview/text: I have three of these same Crane humidifiers. One die after 2 months of careful use, one is still working but with loud noises, the other one got over heated while the water tank was full during my sleep at night. We don't have hard water, and i often clean the units.Becasue of the over heating problem, i dicided to not to buy any more Crane for safty reasons.
