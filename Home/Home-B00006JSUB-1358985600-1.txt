review/summary: Great all around skillet!review/text: I bought this skillet after owning a smaller Lodge skillet for many years and realizing how much I love cooking in it. This thing is massive! It is almost too large to use on my stovetop if I intend to use a burner anywhere but adjacent to this thing. Having said that I am still very happy with my purchase. It is the original non-stick skillet that will last for generations as long as you keep it well oiled.
