review/summary: So convenient!review/text: Our tap water tastes terrible! As soon as we moved, I knew that we would need some kind of water filter. I'm so glad I listened to the good reviews of this one and bought it! It's slim and fits well in our fridge without taking up an enormous amount of space, and I love the capacity of it. I actually drink more water now that we have this. The water comes out clean, tasting crisp and cold. I also like how easily this picture fits into the sink when I refill it. Great!
