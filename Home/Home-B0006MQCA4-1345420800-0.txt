review/summary: Tastes like mineral water!review/text: We've been using Brita pitchers, but we got fed up of filling them, as we drink a lot of water! Researching the Brita large capacity, we found mixed reviews so we decided to try Pur. Glad we did! We love it. The water tastes great, and it fits nicely in the fridge. I use the old Brita pitcher to fill it with water so I don't have to carry it to the sink. I love the tap, nice smooth action, and shuts of well.
