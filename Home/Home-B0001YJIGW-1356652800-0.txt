review/summary: Works Greatreview/text: Small tub, the water drains out the top of the tub overflow drain. This looks too small to cover the drain and I figured the suction wouldn't work very well but I was wrong, this thing works great. 3 more inches of tub water makes a difference.Pros: Cheaper than installing a larger tub, works great.Cons: None of those
