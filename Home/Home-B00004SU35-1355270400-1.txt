review/summary: You Can Always Depend on Wabash Whirley Pop-From a Popcorn-A-Holicreview/text: Wabash has the best features of any popper. It's flexible, ambidextrous, strong enough for the application, cheap enough to replace, and has a decent warranty for its price. One doesn't have loading or pouring problems, it doesn't fall apart when one picks it up to wash or load or dump popcorn, it's easy to clean (I use water unless something stronger is required). This is my second one only because I ruined the aluminum finish by putting it in the dishwasher 100s of times and I wanted a clean one for $25. I had the first one for 9+ years and it still worked but I'm giving it away to charity. I learned that if I load too much popcorn because I'm a popcorn pig, I can separate the gears on the crank shaft. I've not only managed to persuade the gears back in place, but also to use less popcorn in one popping as well as smaller baby kernels. Absolutely no problems with my new popper with these changes. We make popcorn 4-7 nights/week.
