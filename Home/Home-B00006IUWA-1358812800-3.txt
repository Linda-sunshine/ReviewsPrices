review/summary: Reminds me of the early 80's.review/text: My mom had a popper just like this, she's been suffering through microwave popcorn since the 90's introduced it. These appear to have made a resurgence and so I got her one for Christmas. We both love it, tastes better, less uncooked kernels and never a burn or bad smell.
