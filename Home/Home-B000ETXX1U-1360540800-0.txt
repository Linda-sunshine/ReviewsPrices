review/summary: Ccmfortable, fast, convenientreview/text: Got this bed for guests. Its very comfortable, the feltlike top helps sheets stay in place. And because its quite tall, it feels more like a real bed.The built in motor does a good job and fully inflates in under 10 minutes. It also helps fully deflate just as quickly.It comes with a carrier bag with handles so the folded up bed is relatively easy to move around. But it does weigh a good 20 lb so beware.I'm very happy with it, and hopefully so are my house guests.
