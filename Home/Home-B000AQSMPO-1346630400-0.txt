review/summary: Keurig coffee machine - bad newsreview/text: Sad but it appears that Keurig practices the, all to relevant in today's products, "planned obselesence" method. Basically 3 of us bought similar Keurig machines about a year ago. All of our machines work about 50% of the time...generally only creating half a cup of coffee at a time. Sad state of affairs that a company purposely creates a device that is planned to not work within 12 months. I will never buy a Keurig, or anything else created by this company.
