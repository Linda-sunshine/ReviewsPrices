review/summary: Did not live up to all the positive reviewsreview/text: I purchased this set while Amazon was having a lightening deal and was super excited since I've always wanted a fancy stainless steel pot set. However the set had plenty of problems right off the bat. The first time I used one of the pots to heat up some oil it left nasty brown grease stains. I tried boiling with detergent and Bar keepers friend and it wouldn't come off. I finally resorted to using oven cleaner which they tell you not to use. That did the job with some additional elbow grease. Then I used one of the fry pans to cook some meat and veggies and that too started having white pitting (presumably from salt) and once again the same oil stains. I called the company to ask for cleaning suggestions and they surprised to hear that I was having this type of reaction with my pans. They told me I could ship the pan back to them for $7 for evaluation and if the pan was defective they would send me a new one (but I would pay the shipping charges). After a few more uses and seeing that all the pans had the same issue I decided to return the entire set. Amazon was great about returning it used, stained and without the original packaging. When I later came back to read the reviews I noticed that the majority of the positive ones were written in 2009-2010. Many of the negative ones were more recent. I really wanted to love this set but alas they were just poor quality. I gave the set 2 stars because it was beautiful in the box and a nice weight. I bought the Emeril pro-clad set instead and am really enjoying them. They are almost as nice to look at and they are easy to wash and care for. They do have a weird metallic rainbow type staining on the inside but this is a vast improvement from the brown grease stains I experienced here.
