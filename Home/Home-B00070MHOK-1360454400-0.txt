review/summary: Steam my way to happinessreview/text: Well, maybe not the way to happiness, but this little steamer sure takes the wrinkles out of our clothes. We have a very tiny place with little room for an ironing board, and some clothes need a little straightening. It's easy to use, light weight, and stores conveniently with the laundry supplies.
