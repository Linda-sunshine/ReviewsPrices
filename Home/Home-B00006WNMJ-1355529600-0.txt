review/summary: Just Goodreview/text: Filtering appears to be very good. The flow is considerably constricted, however - less than half the pressure into the faucet. Does not seem to last as long as claimed. The filter housing into which it screws does wear out; after 2 yrs it no longer holds the pressure causing the cartridge to shoot off from the housing. From the reviews I've read, this filter/cartridge probably works as well as the rest and better than most. Which is to say, not terrific, but gets the job done.
