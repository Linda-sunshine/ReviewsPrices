review/summary: Water Tasted Great!review/text: My husband primarily uses the Brita pitcher at work instead of drinking out of the drinking fountains or tap water from the sink. We recently went on a road trip and decided to take it with us. It was a little slow to filter the water, but the water always tasted great and it saved us from having to buy and carry a supply of plastic water bottles or constantly be filling up our water bottles at the rest stop fountains. We even used it to filter the water at the place we stayed. There is one caveat to these filters though, we had to constantly keep water in it so that it would not dry out. That wasn't really a problem though as we were constantly using it. Great, refreshing taste at a fraction of the cost it would have cost us for bottled water!
