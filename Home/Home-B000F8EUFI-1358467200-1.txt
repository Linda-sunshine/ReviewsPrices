review/summary: Nice Vacreview/text: Worked better than higher priced vacuums I have owned. Strong suction that picked up more dirt and dog hair ( i have 3 dogs) better than any vacuum I have ever owned. Little hard to push but super light and if you have pets and need a cheap vacuum that can pick up pet hair in the carpet....This is the Vacuum for you!!!!!
