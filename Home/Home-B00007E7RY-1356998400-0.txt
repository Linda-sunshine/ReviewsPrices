review/summary: Still deciding whether to paint it to look like R2D2 or not..review/text: Like all the other reviews, it cleans the air, and does so very well. Yes, it is loud, even on low, but unless you're a physics professor from MIT you're not going to sell me on &#34;rock salt&#34; air cleaners or devices that simply sit in the corner and do not move air through an actual filter.If you're in an apartment with no central air, no overhead fan's or neighbors who smoke this is going to truly make your space feel overall cleaner. Would recommend to anyone in an apt.
