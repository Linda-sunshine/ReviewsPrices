review/summary: Honeywell HHT-011 Compact Air Purifier with Permanent HEPA Filterreview/text: Seems to work well. Works best if left on for a long time. It is loud for a small bedroom on settings 2 and 3, 1 is quiet enough. Good for the price. The filter light came on 3 hours after taking it out of the box, but I just reset it.
