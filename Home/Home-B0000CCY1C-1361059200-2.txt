review/summary: cookie scooperreview/text: good product. i lost mine when we moved and was looking to replace it. scoured a lot of stores and of course i found what i neded on amazon. makes all the cookie baking i do much easier. cookies are all of equal size and helps bake to the same doneness. very simple to use. when using cookie scoops, i usually spray a small amout of cooking spray on it to make i easier to release the cookie dough. if you're a fequent cookie baker i would recomment the product.
