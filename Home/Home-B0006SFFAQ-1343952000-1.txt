review/summary: Cuisinart Best Buy for Your Moneyreview/text: The Cuisinart Classic 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker is the one to buy! The price is right. Delivery is timely and uneventful. It's high quality parts, programmable functions, scratch resistant hot plate, spill free coffee pot and ease of use makes it a 10 out of 10. The replaceable charcoal water filters are very easy to install and it looks nice on the counter. I am about to enjoy my first cup. Cuisinart may soon replace all of my appliances. Thank you Amazon!
