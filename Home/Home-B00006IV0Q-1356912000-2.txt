review/summary: The greatest pot ever.review/text: I tried the stove top kind, but ended up with this. I have used it over a year with no problems. People who have had the coffee from it rave about how great it tastes. Just get one. You will not regret it. I do use standard basket filters and punch them over the hole because I am too lazy to clean out grains at 5:30 in the morning. It does not have an effect on the taste at all as I have tried it both ways, but makes clean up a breeze. Tastes and smells just like my grandmother used to make in the seventies.
