review/summary: good value, but NOT the vacuum that most of the great reviews are aboutreview/text: All the recent reviews are correct. This is NOT the vacuum that most of the reviews are about. We had the original vacuum and it was awesome. After 7 years it burned out and we purchased this one to replace it. It is clearly inferior to the previous version (the plastic is a lower grade and the suction is not quite as good and the hose keeps pooping off), but it is still a good vacuum at a great price.
