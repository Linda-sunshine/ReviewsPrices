review/summary: Best simple stick vacuum on the market recently.review/text: We wanted a simple, small, plug-in stick vacuum that could be used on both carpet and hard floors. After searching around and finding that most were either rechargeable (which meant that the battery would wear out) or huge, we finally found this one. We have been using them for years and are on our 3rd one. We wore the first one out after a massive amount of use. The second one was broken by mishandling (our fault). And we quickly bought another. Actually we even have another one at our vacation house. My sister bought one also after seeing ours. They are quite durable, easy to empty out, and light. We consider them the perfect solution and hope Hoover continues to make them for years to come.....
