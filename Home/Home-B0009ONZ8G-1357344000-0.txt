review/summary: Has been working fine for over two years nowreview/text: Good quality build, not junk. Have not had any problems with this item. Fast delivery as always with Amazon Prime. Very good suction even when the bag is near full. Great price. Would be more convenient if the flex hose was two feet longer for using a hard floor attachment.
