review/summary: I like the large griddle, and it works great, but wish the plastic sides were a little more durablereview/text: I have been using this for a few years now, and it work great. My only complaint is that very quickly the plastic around the power supply broke. I fixed it with super glue, but that only lasted for a little while before it broke again. I have been using it with the piece broken for some time, which is fine, but wish the plastic sides were a little more durable.
