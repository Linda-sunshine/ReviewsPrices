review/summary: Great vacuum, couple hitchesreview/text: I have a small, one bedroom apartment so keep that in mind. I don't need to vacuum a large area. I have two cats that shed like CRAZY, as well as kick up a lot of kitty litter. I have laminate tile in my foyer, wooden floors, and large rugs in the living room and this vacuum has a rug option which really is this small brush that spins like crazy, picking up hair, fur and what not from my rugs. Love that function. It's light weight and pivots really easily so that you can make these sharp turns in tight spots. It's kind of loud though (which scares my cats) and the motor gets really hot if you use it for too long. But that's okay since it's in the middle of the machine and not where you would normally touch it.It's great also because you don't need to replace bags, but when you clean out the filter and the trap, it gets dusty and messy so that's a little bit of a downer. The only other downer is that it's lost some suction power. Now I expected that, which is why I'm not bashing this product in my review, but it still sucks that it lost suction power.Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase and if I had to do it over again, I'd buy the same one, for how I use it. Great for small apartments, pet hair and litter!
