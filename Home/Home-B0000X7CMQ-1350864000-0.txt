review/summary: My favorite coffee maker of all time!review/text: Love this coffee maker! It arrived on time and was everything I expected and read in reviews. It takes #4 filters which are easy to find. The coffee is still hot hours later and it takes up less space on the counter than other coffee makers I've had. Make sure the basket fits properly although I've had no leaking like other coffee makes.
