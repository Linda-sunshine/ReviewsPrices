review/summary: Tested itreview/text: Did a Google search to see which was the best bag less type vacuum stick and this was one of the recommendations, it is so amazing what all the dirt and dust comes from that this thing picks up, it does get pretty warm but you are only supposed to use it for a short amount of time it is not for vacuuming large areas and in my little tiny house that I rent I do not have better track to vacuum and it is great for linoleum because it picks up all the dust bunnies.
