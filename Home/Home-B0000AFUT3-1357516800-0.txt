review/summary: Nice for the pricereview/text: I'd recommend this product to anyone that has limited mirror space. This is a nice for the price solution to having a mirror in a small space. The three sides are very helpful for more than one view and for light reflection. The magnification is pretty good, not too much but enough to help especially with older eyes. ( all you older people know what I mean) This is not a high end mirror like in some of the cosmetic stores, but for someone looking for an inexpensive solution for home, I'd say try it.
