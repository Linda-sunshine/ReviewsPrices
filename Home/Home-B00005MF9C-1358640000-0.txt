review/summary: 5 Stars!!! No problems!!!review/text: I read the mixed reviews and decided to purchase to give it a try. It has turned out to be one of the best personal household appliance investments I have ever made!Fast, convenient, easy and delicious!There were comments in other reviews stating that the unit overflows. I have to wonder... how is that possible if you are pouring one measure of water into the unit from the same mug you plan to drink out of? The machine doesn't make it's own water. It brews what you put into it. Period.Several other reviews stated that the coffee grounds got everywhere. That could happen if you forget to turn the kitchen light on before you added the coffee to the basket! Just make sure the coffee grounds go into the filter basket and not into the water reservoir before you Brew & Go!About some customer's problem with water dripping after brewing? Duh! Gravity works! Put a catch cup or a paper towel on the cup area if your not patient enough to wait for the natural dripping to stop. There is no cup heating element because it's Brew & Go not brew and sit on a hot plate for hours!I have had no problems whatsoever with my purchase. I love it, use it daily and recommend it to all my friends.
