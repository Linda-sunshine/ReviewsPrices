review/summary: Presto 16" electric skilletreview/text: This electric skillet is easy to use, easy to clean up (it can go in the dishwasher, but it's rather large) - I usually wash it out easily after each use. The lid comes out of the dishwasher beautifully. The temperature gauge is accurate and the size is perfect for doing eggs & sausage all at once (our primary use!).
