review/summary: Makes grinding coffee very easyreview/text: I put off grinding too long because my previous use of chopper type units was so much of a hassle. Not so with this unit. You can store a reasonable amount of beans in it. Once you've set it up, just push the button, let it grind, and pour the coffee into the coffee maker's filter basket.The unit is compact, fits easily under the cabinets in the kitchen. It's noisy, but not terrible.Previous reviews scared me about the mess it can make with coffee powder. The facts are that the output container is covered. You can remove it with no mess. When you take off the top, you get a little scatter. So do it over the sink! Then pour the contents into the coffee maker, replace the cover (over the sink) and put it back the grinder. Done! It's easier than measuring grinds out of a container.Of course, I can't speak to reliability. And as best I can tell, you can't replace the grinding parts, so if they wear out you have to replace the unit. Time will tell.
