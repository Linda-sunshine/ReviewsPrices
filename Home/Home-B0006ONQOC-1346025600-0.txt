review/summary: No Longer Screaming for Ice Cream!review/text: We love this machine! I could hardly wait for the bowl to freeze up and had a hard time choosing what flavor to make. It is really easy to operate and the noise others talk about was not an issue for me. Clean up was a snap too! I used Ben and Jerry's recipe book and found that making the 1 quart recipes where you want to add ingredients is just the right size for this machine. The ingredients add to the volume and you get about 1 1/2 to 2 quarts of a finished product. I also run the machine for about 35 minutes. We like firmer ice cream so we always freeze about 2 to 4 hours before indulging. If you like soft serve then enjoy right away! Make the ice cream base and let your imagination flow......be creative. I also purchased an extra bowl so I always have one completely frozen.
