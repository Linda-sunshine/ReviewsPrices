review/summary: LOVE my Brevillereview/text: I decided to go with this juicer after reading the comments and I am very glad that I did. The juicer works very well and I don't feel like it leaves a lot of waste compared to my old cheap juicer.. It is tough and has no problem juicing anything I have put in it. Clean up is much easier than my old juicer as well. Although it is a bit time consuming, I figure I spend less time cleaning it than I do cleaning up and doing the dishes after making a meal. I LOVE this and would recommend it to anyone. Great product for the price.
