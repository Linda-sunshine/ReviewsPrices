review/summary: Not Memory Foam, but a lot better then a painful mattress!review/text: I bought this mattress topper about a month and a half ago (twin xl) because my dorm room mattress was giving me back pains. I looked over some of the other reviews, and do agree about some of the negative aspects of this mattress topper. First, the mattress topper IS NOT memory foam; it's soft and it is a certain kind of foam, but it definitely doesn't keep the imprint if you press your hand down and release. If I sleep too long, the foam isn't enough to keep me from getting back pains, but the topper definitely does a lot of good. Some people complain about a "chemical smell" upon opening the topper. There definitely was a smell, but it wasn't awfully chemical. It actually smelled kind of minty, and I didn't really mind it. This smell went away after about a week of sleeping on it (I couldn't sleep on my awful mattress for another night so I didn't bother with airing it out.)So basically, don't buy this if you are looking for a true memory foam topper. But this isn't a bad mattress topper otherwise.
