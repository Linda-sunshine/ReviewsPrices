review/summary: Easy coffeereview/text: So easy and so tasty. Fill it with water, fill it with coffee, screw on the top, put over a low heat, go watch TV, then drink very tasty coffee. 6-cup maker makes one nice mugful of coffee -- great after dinner with a few Oreos. Never used a pot like this before and was a little scared...after one use it's easy peasy...and it's easy to clean too.
