review/summary: It looks very thin but holds a lot of waterreview/text: I bought a 2 gallon water pitcher that I fill with water and pour into this unit. The filtering is very slow, the switch for the water is very durable and looks well built. It holds a total of about 2 gallons or a tiny bit less, judging from my 2 gallon water pitcher. The convenience of this thing is amazing and I wish I had purchased this a long time ago. Deserves all the praise.
