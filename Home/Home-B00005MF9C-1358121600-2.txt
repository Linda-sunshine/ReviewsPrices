review/summary: Its good for the price but..review/text: I bought this in September 2012 because it was small and I was the only one in the family who drank a cup a day. Today January 14th 2013 I brewed my cup and I opened the lid to throw out the coffee grounds and smoke was coming out and it smelled like something was burning. I let it cold off and tried to just brew some water and the machine wont turn on. It was a good product if you just need a cup a day and don't want to buy the coffee filters.
