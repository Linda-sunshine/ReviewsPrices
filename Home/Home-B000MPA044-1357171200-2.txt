review/summary: Take pressure off yourself and put it on your food!review/text: This purchase was a gift to one of my colleagues. One year ago I received one just like this as a gift. I love how easy it is to use. This is unlike older pressure cookers with the scary rocking device that spewed steam and hot water. This one just quietly sits there and does its job. I can make a luscious soup in practically no time and it will stay perfectly hot until I'm ready to eat. Dried beans and lentils are a snap to make. I simply rinse the beans or lentils, add broth, chopped onion, celery, and carrots, toss in bay leaves, set the minutes recommended by the recipe (or the booklet), and walk away. I especially like having the different temperatures (in addition to high and low pressure, there's brown, simmer, and keep warm) so all the browning and caramelizing can take place in one appliance. I recommend this to anyone who wants to prepare delicious, nutritious, fast meals. Finally, when it's all over, clean up is a breeze.
