review/summary: Cuisinart comes dangerously close to bait n switchreview/text: It's not exactly a bait n switch but Cuisinart comes close to the practice. That's what happens when a manufacturer gets rave reviews from independent test groups and bloggers and the information is littered across the Internet for a lifetime. After a successful product run, Cuisinart decided to switch their manufacturing so that the alloy is NOT 18/10 stainless steel cookware AND decides NOT to change the model number. It's a practice that's a problem, because all the positive reviews are for the 18/10 stainless steel model and consumers are NOT getting what they think they are paying for. Sure, Cuisinart's website doesn't explicitly state that the line is 18/10 anymore, but they chose to keep the same model number which drastically performs differently from the original model; the newly manufactured line shows significant wear and traits of an inferior alloy in months instead of years. This is a problem when the manufacturer claims a lifetime warranty, but makes the customer pay for the replacement through hidden shipping and inspection fees that probably covers cost of the replacement at no lost for the manufacturer.It's a saddening trend of the American manufacturing industry as they ship to overseas manufacturing and make decisions in the name of being more competitive and profitable in the marketplace. Unfortunately, they haven't realized that you can make money as long as your product is designed better than the competition in functionality, durability and safety (2 areas which can easily be capitalized on from the MADE IN CHINA lines). Design innovation and quality controls have culturally declined in american business in all but software development.I received this set for our wedding registry, but will soon return it in exchange for the only comparable BEST BUY cookware set to the original Cuisinart 18/10 model reviewed by Cooks Illustrated. Unfortunately, I can't name the product since it would be considered a promotion that goes againt Amazon's review policy, but I'm sure you can find it since it's one of the few American company's who produce in Brazil.
