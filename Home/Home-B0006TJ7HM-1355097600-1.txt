review/summary: Good for the pricereview/text: These are really good for the price. They aren't top of the line but the do get the job done. I have not had any issues with rust like some reviewers say. I have washed them with soap and water then set them inside a utensil cup to dry. They dry perfectly fine. The scissors do seems a little flimsy but they still cut really good. Just not very sturdy plastic. The wood block is nice and heavy and it sits nicely on my counter top.
