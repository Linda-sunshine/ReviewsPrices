review/summary: Probably Healthier Than The Alternativesreview/text: These air poppers have been kicking around for decades. Since I really love popcorn, I decided to revisit this type of popper hoping to cut back some calories.If you simply follow the instructions, the reality is that your popcorn isn't going to be all that great. It is pretty bland unadorned. However, the good news is that the popcorn is perfectly popped and there are things you can do to make it taste better. While my suggestions aren't exactly without calories, judicious use can yield an improvement or two.Use good quality popcorn that will produce big puffy kernels. I suggest Orville Redenbacher's. Seasoned salt added to the final finished product will give some flavor. I've also used black pepper, onion salt, garlic salt, red pepper, grated Parmesan. This unit has a butter warmer which melts butter to be poured on the popcorn. Try warming olive oil and infusing it with rosemary or Herb de Provence and then toss it into the popped corn. If you still crave butter, use butter or the buttery flavored oil that is sold at the store. Calories? Use a smaller amount if you are concerned about calories.Overall, this is a good appliance that works well and seems fairly well made. Amazingly, it hasn't changed much over the years.
