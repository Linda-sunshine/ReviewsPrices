review/summary: I think it's all plastic.. no stainless to be foundreview/text: Many years ago I bought a Misto when they first were introduced to the market (maybe 30 years ago?). It was sturdy and made from mostly stainless steel. Extremely well made, it lasted many years. Finally it just stopped working.So, today I bought a Misto double package at Costco for only $15 for 2 pumps. The packaging looked great and it says, printed right on the package... Set of 2 Stainless Steel Sprayers. One is a metal color, the other is all black.Well, I'm sorry, but NO WAY are these things stainless steel! The black one is COMPLETELY plastic (all parts) and the metal one may have a light coating of brushed stainless steel on the outside to look like stainless, but it's on top of mostly plastic substrate. They're very light and no where near the quality of the original.I'm really mad about this and am returning them to Costco. I was going to give one as a gift and keep the other one, but I'd be embarrassed to give my friend this thing.Now I have to look for a better quality somewhere and pay a lot more money. Why is it that once a product becomes successful, they have to start producing an inferior product? Happens all the time. Junk made in China of course.
