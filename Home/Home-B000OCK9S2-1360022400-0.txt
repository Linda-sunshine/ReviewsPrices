review/summary: It's quite annoyingreview/text: I was hoping to purchase this and be relaxed by it. On the contrary, the sounds are quite annoying. The only sound that I was able to get use to and even use is the Thunderstorm one. The tracks repeat about every 45 seconds to a minute. If you can easily pick up on patters or are into music and art, this will annoy you because you will easily be able to pick up on the lack of a full sound therapy track. The blue light even on the &#34;dim&#34; setting is very bright and when you pick it up to plug it in it feels like a fisher price toy.
