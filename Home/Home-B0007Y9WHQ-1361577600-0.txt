review/summary: Salute To Zucchini Noodles Everywherereview/text: I love this spiral slicer. When it arrived, at first the instructions kind of were vague. But check the box, the instructions are clear.Well, it's really fun to use.First day, I tried a carrot. Big mistake, I got carrot shavings. Then, I spiraled a potato. There's 2 sizes of spirals, thin like a noodle, or thicker like a thick curly fry. There is also a slicing blade. The potato instructions are clear on the box. I spiraled the potato near perfect. The trick with this thing, is the handle seems to move opposite of the direction you try to move it. If that's confusing, trust me, it even confused me a couple of times, until I figured it out.The next day, I tried zucchini noodles for cashew Alfredo sauce. My zucchini noodles were flawless. In the end, all you have is the top of the zucchini, and the center. Some times I needed to make sure the handle was tight. After you're finished, clean up is easy. Be careful of the blade, it is very sharp. It has a place for one blade, and the other 2 blades store in the bottom, which I love.It's cool and it works. It totally answers the question, "How do you make zucchini noodles?"
