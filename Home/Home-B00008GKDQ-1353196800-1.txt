review/summary: Pancake central!review/text: Man does this sucker get a workout. I love my Lodge cast iron and this griddle is no exception. I use this numerous times weekly. Unless I'm cooking a batch of soup or stew in my Lodge dutch oven this griddle is on my stove. Our household loves pancakes for breakfast, lunch or dinner. This is an outstanding investment! I love it and I haven't even tried the grill side yet.
