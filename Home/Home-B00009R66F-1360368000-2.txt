review/summary: Easy to use, great resultsreview/text: I bought this model on the basis of the good reviews here, and I'm glad I did. (I was impressed with an earlier Hoover model I'd borrowed from a friend, so I wanted to get something similar.) My carpets came up great after just one cleaning.Three tips:1. Use hot (not lukewarm, not boiling) water.2. Give the carpets a good vacuum before and immediately after cleaning.3. Use a good quality detergent. I've used Hoover CLEANPLUS 2X with great results.
