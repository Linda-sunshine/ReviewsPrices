review/summary: Perfect for ice or freezing baby foodreview/text: I purchased these ice trays to use for freezing baby food primarily but have also used them for ice.I love that ice or baby food comes out in a perfect 1 oz square cube. This makes baby food storage simple and compact. Both ice and frozen baby food come out of the trays very easily. I have not noticed any weird taste from the silicone. I do recommend washing them beforehand. I soaked the trays in water and vinegar and then put them through the dishwasher before use.Great product!
