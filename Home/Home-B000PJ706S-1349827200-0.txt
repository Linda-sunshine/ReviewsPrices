review/summary: I tried, but couldn't get rid of the odorreview/text: I really wanted to love this tea kettle, it is so gorgeous! Unfortunately, like many other reviews stated, it has a bad chemical odor that just wouldn't go away. I washed it, boiled 6 full pots of water, boiled a water/vinegar mix a few times, and even let lemons soak in it.The smell just wouldn't go away. I made some tea and tried to ignore it but I just couldn't get the chemical smell AND taste to dissipate.
