review/summary: This is my loyal servant, especially just recently ...review/text: .. recently being, due to the fact that I'm opening at least 2 or 3 cans a day while I'm doing the Four Hour Body (Tim Ferris) way of eating, and you're eating a lot of lentils and beans, and I've already been eating canned salmon and some canned vegetables.I've had this BMW of can openers since Nov 2006 and for the last near 6 years, I'm amazed how just how pleasurable it could be when you pay more for something, for its quality craftsmanship and quality, and you use it, and experience it's quality, on a daily basis.I've opened a large variety of cans, and it never lets me down.It's easy to clean.. the top comes off with a push of a button (even the button itself is of such polish and design, don't laugh at that).Note: Also, the knife sharpener really does work. I have a Martha Stewart butcher knife that I sharpen on it, and sometimes I accidentally slice some of my own skin off right after sharpening it, because I forget how quickly the knife will now make it through the chicken breast, and not move my finger away quickly enough.. so be careful on that front.
