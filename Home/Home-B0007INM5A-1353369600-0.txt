review/summary: Not what I had in mindreview/text: I was looking for something to work with my Hamilton Beach single cup mini brewer - I swear I looked all over the product information, and didn't see anything that said it wouldn't work with it. By the size and shape, it looked like it would fit the unit. It didn't. I even tried to modify the top so that the tabs would fit into my machine, and even with that working, it made terrible coffee. It's a shame, because I like the concept, and I hope that it works well with the Senseo brewer, for which it was developed. Don't get it for your Hamilton Beach brewer.
