review/summary: Only lasted 18 monthsreview/text: Purchased this Keurig brewer in May 11 and for the first 17 months was great, no problems at all, would have rated it 4/5 stars but now in the last week it has completely stopped working.The descale message showed up for the first time and I followed through the instructions but it seems like the entire system is blocked up as no water/vinegar is even making its way through to allow it to be cleaned...So thats the end of the coffee maker.I think it is close to being a great coffee maker but there are some serious flaws like this that frustrate you and mean the price you pay for it isn't really worth it...
