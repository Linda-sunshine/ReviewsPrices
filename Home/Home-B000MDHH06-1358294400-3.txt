review/summary: This juicer fails IMOreview/text: This juicer acts like a volcano and shoots veggies (particularly leafy) all over the place, due to the air blowing out the chute. Additionally the pulp ring really didn't work for me, I was extremely limited by the amount of items I could juice. The next model up my mother purchased and I used, with the pulp side-car, works great. Spend the extra $50 and go one model up.
