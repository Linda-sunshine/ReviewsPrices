review/summary: Messyreview/text: Worst coffee pot ever. Same experience of grounds/ coffee all over counter and floor. Had my husband double check behind me (in case of operator error)-- cover on tight, pot on straight, basket in straight, no blockage in cover, correct filter size -- somehow still overflowed.
