review/summary: scary sharpreview/text: My wife is a little reluctant to wash the knives now because she doesnt want to lose a finger. This makes crappy walmart knives into limb removing samurai swords. Achtung! Very impressed with product. This beats the pants off old-school soap stones where you have to work it yourself and likely end up with uneven working edge. This sharpener is easy to use and gives pro results in seconds. Four stars cause its made in China and will likely break in a few years (being optimistic) - soap stones are good for a life time.
