review/summary: Perfect for Single Peoplereview/text: I bought this because I live alone and have 1 cup of coffee in the morning getting ready for work during the week. I tried a Keurig and hated it! I saw this one and said why not. Its inexpensive, comes with a travel mug and comes with a reuasable filter so you get to use your own coffee. I have only used it 4 times so far, but I like it. It will take a few cups of coffee to figure out just how much coffee to use, but it brews quick and it brews a hot cup of coffee. I'm glad I bought it.
