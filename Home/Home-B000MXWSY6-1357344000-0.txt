review/summary: Old Vintage GE Clock Radio is better than this onereview/text: I thought the features of this clock radio justified the $24 price tag, that is however until I found a behemoth 80's vintage silver & brown(wood laminate) GE digital clock radio that is about 2.5X the size of this Sony but only half has tall. Scored this gem while browsing through the electronics junk at the local DAV. The difference in the sound between the GE & the Sony is like night & day. The GE's speaker sounds 10X better than the tinny speaker on the Sony, which sounds more like a transistor radio and absolutely *no* static/noise with the volume plus the classic red LED numbers are big enough and not so bright that I can't fall asleep. They can be clearly seen from my bathroom across room to the dresser it sits on(about 15ft). The GE's radio band face is much longer, larger, and easier to see than the Sony's and much better at fine tuning on a channel. Since this Sony is so tall and the snooze button right on the front edge you better not keep it too close to the edge of your night stand because it will eventually tumblesault to the floor when you reach over half asleep to whack the snooze button. This one ended up in my guest bedroom. The price of my vintage GE clock? $3.00, and it went to support our disabled veterans.
