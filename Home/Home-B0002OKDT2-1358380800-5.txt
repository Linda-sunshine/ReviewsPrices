review/summary: Very happy juicerreview/text: I had an old juicer that a friend had given to me when I decided to start juicing. When I realized I was serious about it and it wasn't going to be just a &#34;temporary&#34; commitment, I started looking and researching different kinds of juicers. When Amazon offered the Omega at such an amazing price, it was a no-brainer for me, so I ordered it and threw out my old one. It juices kale so much better than the other one which was a centrifical (or whatever you call it) and does extract much more juice too.Definitely would recommend this juicer!
