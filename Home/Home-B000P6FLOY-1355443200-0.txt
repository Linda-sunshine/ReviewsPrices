review/summary: How did I cook before this thing??review/text: I used my sister's thermometer last year to cook the turkey and I knew I would be buying one for this year. The cable is a great length and it's so awesome how it beeps when it gets to the right temperature. Alton Brown says everyone should be cooking with a meat thermometer instead of a time. What I know is my turkey was the perfect moisture and temperature because of the accuracy of this device.
