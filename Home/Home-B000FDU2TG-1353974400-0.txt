review/summary: Disappointed!review/text: For my bridal shower I received two of the Kitchen Aid Blenders. Both of them in the same year stop working I barley used them. I tried exchanging them for new ones and they only change one for a refurbish model they said because I called after the year so they don't have a warranty. I am really disappointed with the products and the services.I would not recommend this blender!
