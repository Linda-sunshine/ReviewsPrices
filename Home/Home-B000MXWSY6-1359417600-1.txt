review/summary: Incorrect timereview/text: The alarm has great features and everything. But if you use it long enough you will know that it does not show the time properly. The one thing that a clock is supposed to do! I'm sorry I ignored other reviews about inaccuracy of it's time and bought this piece of crap! (It is off by 8-10 mins every few months)
