review/summary: Solid productreview/text: Very simple product, a replacement water filter for the kitchen faucet. Cheaper than the other brands and well reviewed in CR.Putting it on a 90 day schedule means I will never forget to change the filter and since this is not a product that is easy to find that makes this service that much more important.
