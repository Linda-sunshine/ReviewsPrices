review/summary: A good nights sleep FINALLYreview/text: I was a little scared when I opened the package because this was so packed tight that it was hard to unroll and I was worried about tearing it. But it withstood me prying it apart and tugging it into place. Slept on it for the first time last night, and slept all through the night. It's cold right now, so I don't know if the ventilation will make a difference or not yet. But this looks and feels great. Cradles you without squishing flat, and comes back to shape within just a few minutes.
