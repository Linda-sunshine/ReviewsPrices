review/summary: A lot of bang for the buck!review/text: I've used this gem almost every day for about four months. I worked as a barrista, so I know two things make a great cappucino: foam and crema (the creamy brown that tops the espresso). Very tricky to get them both, and I'm amazed by the quality of both with this maker! I've owned a low end Black and Decker model that sucked. With this one, I foam in a coffee cup, make the espresso, and voila! Perfect! Only one thing to be careful for: the water level. If it gets too low, the pump or tubing or whatever will take a long time to start sucking in water again. It will seem like it's clogged or just not working, and the next few cups will have crappy crema and consistency. I learned this the hard way after taking apart the whole thing! Now I just constantly keep the water level high and it's been great. Enjoy!
