review/summary: Panasonic makes an excellent bread maker!review/text: This was a replacement for my old Panasonic which I used regularly for 22 years. The old one still made great bread, but but it required using Pam since the non-stick surfaces on the pan and paddle had long since gone. Also, the center post was loose and I had been using a cone washer to hold it in place. My bread consistency is even better with the new one, in that I have followed Panasonic&#34;s suggestion to use weighing of ingredients instead of a measuring cup volume. The separate yeast dispenser which allows the time delay baking feature continues to be something which I find most useful - it's great to be able to plan when in the next eleven hours you want to have the aroma of fresh bread. Loading up the machine is usually about a five (but never more than ten) minute task. I gave one of these as a wedding gift to my grand daughter two years ago, and she loves it.
