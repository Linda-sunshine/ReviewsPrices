review/summary: Broken after using it twice...review/text: When it worked, it worked beautifully! I measured the temperature of water (water has to be a certain temp. when combining with yeast) and I roasted a chicken. The chicken was cooked perfectly and I was SO excited that I finally had a way to measure the temp. Unfortunately, the oven use must have caused it to malfunction and now it's constantly reading a temperature that is much higher than normal temperature (~130 deg. F). This was very disappointing. :(
