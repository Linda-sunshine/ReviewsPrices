review/summary: Coffee and Tea and the Nissan and Mereview/text: This is the first French press I've owned, and I love it. I nearly bought one of the glass models before I read about how prone they seem to be to cracking and breaking--none of that here! Based on the reviews, I didn't try to use it as a thermos: but then, I brew coffee to drink it down, not to let it sit as a centerpiece on my table. I find that it works very well for both coffee and loose-leaf tea: I like it more than any coffee maker I've ever owned.
