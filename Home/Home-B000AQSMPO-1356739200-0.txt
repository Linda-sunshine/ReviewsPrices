review/summary: Best Coffee Maker I Have Ever Seenreview/text: What to say. There is nothing about this machine I don't like. It is easy to operate. You get your coffee in 60 seconds. The water tank is large enough to brew about 10 cups of coffee before refilling. And the coffee consistently tastes great. My wife also likes using it for tea. Some complain that the coffee does not taste strong enough. To them I say, pick a different brand/flavor of k-cup. Not all k-cups are created equal. Some I have tried and really liked some are just so so. I would recommend getting a sampler (unlesss you already know what you like) and trying several kinds before you buy a box of one. Yes you will spend $20 or so on a box with some you like and some you don't but at least if there is one you don't like you don't have another 24 cups (at $.6 per cup) of them. I have found a regular and decaf flavor I really like through this method and then bought a box each of those flavors. I am drinking more coffee now than I ever have and enjoying it more than I ever have. If you are on the fence stop reading this review and go buy this.
