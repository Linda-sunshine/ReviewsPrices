review/summary: Not exactly classic, but it gets the job done.review/text: The job, of course, is boiling water quickly and efficiently, and it does that perfectly well. I'm of two minds about the styling, since it's not exactly the sort of kettle that enhances your kitchen's decor -- and, like everyone else, I wish the cord were considerably longer -- but it's dramatically sped up the whole tea-making process. I worry that the exposed heating element will eventually develop scale, since it's a little trickier to clean than some of its competitors, but so far it's held up well. For the price, I'm glad of the purchase.
