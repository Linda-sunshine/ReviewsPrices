review/summary: Time saverreview/text: Used Black and Decker for years and then went without a food processor for several years. I was impressed with Cuisinart products after purchasing a Cuisinart waffle maker for my daughter. After purchasing this item through Amazon, I was surprised how heavy this machine was when it arrived. I sent a message to Cuisinart's customer service after not being able to remove the large feed tube(later figured it out on my own.) They were completely unhelpful and somewhat rude in the reply, so I hope I never have any problems with this equipment. So far though, I am completely enjoying using it every day for slicing, shredding, mincing, and preparing dough, etc. and it is working very well. It is somewhat hard to clean though as the small tube does not disconnect, so I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.
