review/summary: If this only lasted me a year, it would be worth buying yearly.review/text: I did not buy mine on Amazon, but picked one up at Sam's Club. I love this small food processor so much, that I could easily sell them. I will never be without one of these. Yes, it's small but if you need a small one, this is it.So small and lightweight, that I keep it under a counter near where I cook. No need to lug out your large food processor if you don't need a large amount. Chop veggies, make bread crumbs, great for baby food. And I could go on and on. I'm a stay at home Mom of 34 yrs who cooks all the time. This small machine is a needed item in any kitchen where someone cooks.
