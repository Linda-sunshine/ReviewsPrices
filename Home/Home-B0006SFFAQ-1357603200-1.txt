review/summary: We like this one, but we like the Cuisinart DTC-975BKN Thermal 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker betterreview/text: Our old Cuisinart coffeemaker finally died, so we bought this one--very much the same--because we liked the old one. We also like this one.But my wife decided to try something new. She pulled out our insulated carafe and started pouring the fresh coffee into the carafe. We were surprised to learn that the coffee in the carafe--not being constantly in contact with the coffeemaker's heating plate--kept the coffee fresh and drinkable for hours. That was a huge plus for us, because we space our coffee-drinking over several hour, never drinking a large quantity at one time.Then I remember that Cuisinart has another coffeemaker--the Cuisinart DTC-975BKN Thermal 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker--that makes the coffee directly into a double-wall steel insulated carafe. I decided to buy a DTC-975BKN with the idea that we would put the DCC-1200 in storage as a backup coffeemaker if we liked the DTC-975BKN.We love the new coffeemaker with the insulated carafe. It keeps coffee warm and drinkable for hours. That assessment will probably appall coffee snobs, who think that the only good coffee was made ten minutes ago--but it works for us. But real coffee snobs probably don't use coffeemakers anyway.So we like both Cuisinart coffeemakers, but we like the one with the insulated carafe best.However, you should be aware that the insulated steel carafe is heavy. If you have weak hands or wrists, you might be better off with the lighter glass carafe.
