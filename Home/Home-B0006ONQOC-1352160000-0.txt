review/summary: Works exactly as it shouldreview/text: This machine works exactly as it should. I purchased it 7 or 8 months ago as a birthday gift for my husband along with the bookThe Perfect Scoop: Ice Creams, Sorbets, Granitas, and Sweet Accompanimentsby David Lebovitz. We have used it endlessly all Spring, Summer and Fall (at least once a week). Like other reviewers we keep the bowl in the freezer at all times and it has made making ice cream very convenient. Another tip we got from David Lebovitz: turn the machine on right before pouring the mixture in.The instruction manual recommends letting the bowl freeze for 24 hours before making ice cream. I would suggest shaking the bowl to make sure the liquid inside is completely frozen as well. The first time we used it we were freezing the bowl in a fairly old freezer and the ice cream did not machine well due to the bowl not being completely frozen. We have not had this problem since (with a newer fridge/freezer).The machine is very simple to use and a great activity to do with kids. Ice cream is not healthy but making it yourself gives you the ability to choose the ingredients and see exactly what is going into it. If you read the ingredients on ice cream packages in stores you likely will not recognize most of them. When we eat ice cream that we've made at home we generally will only eat one small scoop rather than the large bowl we would tend towards in store bought ice cream.If you decide to buy this machine I would highly recommend getting a very good accompanying recipe book such as the Perfect Scoop. We have made several of the recipes in this book and having really good instruction, tips and recipes has made all of the difference. If we had of stuck only with the recipes provided in the manual I doubt we would have kept up our ice cream making habit/tradition all year. Don't forget - this machine works perfectly but your ice cream will only be as good as the ingredients you put into it!
