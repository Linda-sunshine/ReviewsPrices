review/summary: Presto!review/text: A nice product, my only complaint is that it spews unpopped kernels into the bowl (along with the fully popped kernels), which explode a few seconds later. The result? Some popcorn gets out of the bowl and onto the floor. However, overall this is a good product at a reasonable price.
