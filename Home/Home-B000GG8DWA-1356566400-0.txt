review/summary: wow! The sliced bread of personal heaters!review/text: We have been facing a constant battle with cold, and till now, it has been a sad losing battle. We have been using a Lasko 754200 Ceramic Heater, and a DeLonghi DCH1030 Safeheat heater, which both are excellent small space heaters, but the big issue with both of them are, they are very noisy, dry the air, and produce very mild heat.Here comes the Optimus H-5210 to the rescue. This heater is extremely quiet, as there is no fan blowing over a heating element. We were amazed how much direct heat it produces on it's high setting (800w). How fast a heater can heat a place up is directly proportional to the wattage, so we do not expect this heater to generate more heat than the high setting (1500W) of the Lakso, or the Delonghi space heaters, however, the radiant heat that this heater produces feels much warmer. My wife puts one of these heaters under the desk, and on low setting 400w, it keeps her comfortably warm.So overall, this heater is a great personal heater, as it is extremely quiet, and produces nice radiant heat. We were so surprised how wonderful it is, that we bought a 2nd one.Another plus point of this heater is it also has a safety tip sensor, so if it tips over, it will automatically turn off.The one criticism we have against this heater is, the control knob does not have any markings on the outsides of the knob, so you have to turn the heater to the side to see which is the off setting. Minor issue, which we have fixed with a black marker.
