review/summary: favoirite water kettlereview/text: I have had my capresso water kettle for over a year now and couldnt be happier. I love the looks of it and its really nice to be able to see the water boil. Auto shut off is a must for this type of appliance and capresso has it. I have seen many reviews that reference a bad smell when first opened. I did not experience that problem at all. Boils quickly. Glass is tough and operation is simple as it should be on a product of this type. I previously had an aroma kettle from target which i liked but it stopped working after 6 months. I find i prefer the glass a lot more as you can just look at it and see where the water is in terms of its boiling or not. I have also seen some reviews that knocked this product because " the outside got hot" and there were worries that it could burn a child. I guess my response to that is dont let your toddler play on the counter near the stove or in the microwave. The on/off switch slides easily and the blue light lets you know its on although it is dim. I also had a problem with the switch sliding too far down the handle but it still works. Capresso: please fix that small flaw. Also it would be helpful for some people if you would include a 4ft sign that says "hey! this gets hot! Dont let your toddler play with it when full of boiling water!". We're in America after all....
