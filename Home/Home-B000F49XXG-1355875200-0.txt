review/summary: This machine broke within 5 monthsreview/text: After a few months of normal use the machine simply stopped working. It had been cleaned and descaled and well taken care of, so I don't believe we were to blame for it breaking down. We called the company and they told us to send it in, and that we would receive a new one. After a couple weeks with no machine and no word from DeLonghi we called again and they said they didn't have any more of our type of machine but that they would send us a slightly different one. That slightly different one costs about $20 less than the one we had bought, but who's counting. I imagine that means it will break 20% sooner than my last one -- meaning it might even last 4 months.Bottom line: this machine makes decent coffee for a couple months, but is a piece of garbage just waiting to break. It will break. I saw other reviews like this one before I bought it and I thought it couldn't be that bad. It is that bad. As angry as I am at DeLonghi for selling me junk in a box, I'm also angry at myself because everyone said it was garbage and I bought it anyway. If you are thinking about buying this or any other product from DeLonghi, I would suggest just throwing your money out the window -- it will save you a lot of time and aggravation, and you will still end up with the same result: no coffee.
