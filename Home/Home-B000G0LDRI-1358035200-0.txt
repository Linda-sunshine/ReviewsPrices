review/summary: Nice humidifier but some minor problemsreview/text: I have had Honeywells before and prefer the evaporative humidifiers such as this one because they are more dependable and I think cleaner - although you have to clean the filters or buy replacements. Humidifiers with no removable filters get crudded up easily and need cleaning regularly - they have also broken down for me more often. This humidifier does a great job on a large room and could very well do our upstairs if I put it to the task. The only problem I have with it is filling the tanks. They are not stable to place in the tub for filling. My last Honeywell, which is still working - has more stable tanks for filling. But once when a tank was full and picked up by the handle - the handle came off! The tank fell and broke. So I still run that machine with its one remaining tank. The tanks on this one also have handles but I do not carry them full by the handle - fearful that it too may break off. I would recommend this humidifier. It does a great job.
