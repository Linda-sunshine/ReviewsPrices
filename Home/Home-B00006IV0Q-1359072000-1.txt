review/summary: Retro Style with Modern Quality and Finishreview/text: We recently purchased a Keurig which is delightful when you want to have a quick cup but not so great when you are serving many people or drinking a great deal. (Think time and cost.) My wife and I decided that we still needed a regular brewer for our larger consumption needs but she didn't want to take up too much space on an already crowded counter with a brew station coffee maker.We have been using this pot for about a week and we absolutely love it. The construction is durable and reminds you of the coffee pot from your grandmother's kitchen. It makes 12 cups in roughly 10 minutes without your having to fuss over changing the K cups in and out. We do not experience problems with grounds as we properly position the filter when filling the basket with coffee. Ok..... this is not really quality observation but it makes a nifty bubbly percolating noise when it brews your coffee...... just another part of your traditional coffee experience. The built in heater will continue to keep your coffee hot as long as it remains plugged in.Cleaning is very, very easy and you can quickly and easily store this in one of your kitchen cabinets when you are not using it. The price point was spectacular.... especially when compared to a brew station of similar quality where you could pay twice as much if not more. All in all, a great purchase for your home or as a gift. I would recommend this to a friend.
