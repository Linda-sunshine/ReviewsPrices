review/summary: Return to Nostalgia and Restore Quality!review/text: I had been deliberating for months about coffee maker options; had been disappointed in traditional brew models because they were difficult to keep clean and broke frequently. After investigating the Presto model...and reliving memories of the percolator from my childhood...I decided to invest in this approach to coffee. I'm so pleased!! The coffee is excellent and I enjoy the 'percolating' sounds, which surprisingly take very little time to work the magic! I can keep the percolator really clean quite efficiently and it currently behaves like a veritable workhorse...steadily making excellent hot coffee and looking downright elegant at the same time! I am truly grateful for another reviewer's recommendation to purchase Melitta 627402 Wrap Coffee Filters, which work quite effectively to keep coffee grounds out of the coffee. I would highly recommend this product for anyone tired of purchasing typical coffee brew models...repeatedly...who would also enjoy an EXCELLENT cup of coffee consistently!!!
