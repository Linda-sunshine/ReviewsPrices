review/summary: Works well for beer and cookingreview/text: I bought this primarily for brewing beer, and it has done its job admirably. The probe has a nice plastic coating that so far has done a good job of standing up to sitting in a pot of liquid for long periods of time.As a cooking thermometer it has worked well sitting in the oven, each time my meat has come out perfectly.The one thing I wish it had was an alert for a low temperature and a high temperature, which would be very useful for monitoring the brewing process.
