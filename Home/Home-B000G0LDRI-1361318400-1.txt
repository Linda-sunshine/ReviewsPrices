review/summary: I have one, that's why I ordered anotherreview/text: It is well made and has a reasonable capacity and is easy to move about (see comment later). I received free shipping if signing up with Amazon.com account. This was not stocked by Amazon. It was shipped with no wheels, so I had to buy wheels, which cost actually more than the shipping would have. The vendor did not respond to my request that if wheels were around, to please send them. The wheels I bought don't snap in, so it can't be moved easily. It was described as "like new" which is accurate. I think it was a display model or the box had been opened for some reason and the wheels lost. I am very pleased with the product, just not pleased with the omission of the wheels or the vendor's excuse that he had "no e-mail address for me" which I suppose he didn't but could have traced it.P.S. I have since talked with Amazon customer service (about something else) but brought up this problem and they are giving me a credit. They had on file theattempt to contact the vendor. Thank you!
