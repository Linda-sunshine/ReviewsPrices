review/summary: Great productreview/text: I purchased this Vegetable Spiraler after we went gluten free so we could have &#34;pasta&#34; noodles in lieu of the spaghetti noodles we used to eat. The first vegetable we tried with this was a potato, and we were very pleased with how it worked. If you turn the handle one way, you get tiny strands, turn it the other way, and you get slightly larger strands (about curly-fry sized). The second vegetable we used was a huge turnip. I was pleased that it handled the entire turnip with no issue at all - it had to have been about 7 or 8 inches in diameter! Once the spiraling was done, I was left with a long slightly thicker than a pencil sized &#34;core&#34;. I could see that this would be wasteful for things like small carrots, but for large vegetables like turnips, zucchini, potatoes, etc., it produces very little waste. I actually just diced the core up, and stuck it in a bag in the freezer to toss into soups. I can't wait to try this on apples next year to help with peeling and making my apple sauce! My only issue with it is it doesn't always stay suctioned down to the counter. You have to push it REALLY hard to get it to stay put. My husband has no problem with it, but I'm just barely strong enough to get it on there good enough that it doesn't move around. This is why I only gave it 4 stars.
