review/summary: Great product!review/text: We received the equivalent Rabbit product for our wedding. It literally broke on the second bottle of wine. Lo and behold, when I came to Amazon, it had 2 stars. While you'd expect the name brand product that costs 3 times as much to perform better, that certainly isn't the case here. My parents have this bottle opener, too, and they go through several bottles a week. It's lasted years.
