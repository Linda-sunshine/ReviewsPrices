review/summary: Every kitchen should have one of these!review/text: A great pre-cursor to a full fledged food processor for chopping/slicing/shredding functionality. I often use this gadget to shred carrots and such for my salads even though I have a food processor sitting right on my counter. It is easy to clean and quite handy too.
