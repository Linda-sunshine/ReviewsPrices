review/summary: Great value!review/text: Fantastic product. We wanted a slim jug to be able to put it on the table while we eat. The other Brita jugs we saw were too big and bulky, this one is just perfect! Also, the water in our apartment has a strange taste, and The filter gets rid of it completely. We could not be happier to have bought this pitcher!
