review/summary: 565 Infinity Grinder is great...but be careful!review/text: Capresso 565 Infinity Conical Burr Grinder is incredibly quiet and works very well...as long as you put it together correctly and don't break the plastic parts. Luckily, Capresso has replacements if needed. I haven't needed them yet but can see how one might accidentally break the bean bin trying to get things lined up. I didn't force the issue when I couldn't get parts together but did call their service line and received prompt, courteous, and very helpful information. The service rep completely resolved my issue and I do not foresee problems with the product in the future that cannot be resolved with patience on my part! I am looking forward to experimenting with the various grind settings and enjoying the smell of freshly ground coffee in the mornings.
