review/summary: Great starter juicerreview/text: As a terrible cook but voracious absorber of food/nutrients, I found the Breville juicer to be an easy and fun way to infuse healthy eating into my life. Although there are definitely types of produce that the juicer is better at extracting than others (ex. apples, carrots, cucumbers, not as much leafy greens), I have yet to encounter a type of produce it does not extract at all.
