review/summary: Not as soft as expectedreview/text: I was looking for a new pair of sheets that were very soft. After reading the reviews these sounded like a good buy. After receiving them I through them in the wash. I was surprised when they actually felt rougher after washing them. These sheets are ok but definitely nothing I would highly recommend.
