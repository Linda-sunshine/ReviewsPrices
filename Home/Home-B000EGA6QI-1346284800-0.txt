review/summary: very good powerful easy to washreview/text: It's convenient, powerful, easy to wash, which is the most IMPORTANT thing for me. It's very easy to use. Compared to a big blender, it is also powerful. From some other comments on blender, which has too much watt?? may damage your electricity. Highly recommend.
