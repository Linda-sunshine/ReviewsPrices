review/summary: Works great!review/text: We've been on the search to replace our 23-year-old Westbend 'The Poppery' - a most loved and used appliance. After trying several other poppers the last couple of years while the Poppery was on it's last legs nothing has lasted more than a month - some much less. This Presto popper seems to be doing the trick so far. Our only complaint is that it does not come with an on/off switch but my husband fixed that one up right away and it works great.
