review/summary: I LOVE IT!review/text: Lodge Logic LPGI3 Pro 20-by-10-7/16-Inch Cast-Iron Grill/Griddle is a great boon to my cooking. I also have a Lodge frying pan and a dutch oven.Do NOT assume that because the manufacturer says it's "pre-seasoned", that it's OK to use it right out of the box. I knew better but I got impatient, tried that and things stuck. Take the time to properly season it and you've got a great grill/griddle. I'm very picky about getting perfect bacon and eggs over-easy every time. My secret is to put the bacon on a cold griddle, light the burners, turn the fire down as low as it will go, and let it cook slowly.The fried eggs are started after the bacon has created a little grease for them.
