review/summary: money saverreview/text: we had one of these for a few years and are just now ordering a replacement. It has saved us from buying aerosol spray oil which we use daily. It has held up to wear and tear very well (even dropped it a few times) It is easy to clean and you can fill it with your choice of oil. I will not be without one again.
