review/summary: Good brewreview/text: Had this for a couple of years now and it is still working well. Makes a very good cup of coffee and the carafe keeps it warm for some time. Much better than the glass carafes that burn the brew if left for an hour or so. I wish it was such a slow pourer. I read that from other reviews but though that wasn't a big deal. I need to practice patience in the AM to fill my cup. OM.
