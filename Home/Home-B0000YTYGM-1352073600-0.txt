review/summary: Almost perfect!review/text: I was worried I'd make a huge mess from the other reviews but as long as the top is screwed on correctly, it works flawlessly. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the beeping when it's finished brewing is a little loud and the coffee doesn't stay quite as hot for as long as I want it to. I am spoiled - I have a travel mug that keeps my coffee hot for 4 hours. Still, I'm glad to have gotten away from hot burner machines and the smell of burnt coffee!
