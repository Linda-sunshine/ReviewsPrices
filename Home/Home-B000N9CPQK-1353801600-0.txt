review/summary: Pretty goodreview/text: This little thing is pretty powerful. I use it around the cats litterboxes to reduce the dust that goes into the air and it probably traps a good majority of it. I'd like to get more for other rooms around the house, too. Be careful about the ionizer, though. While I personally love them, it can trigger bad allergy-like symptoms in some people. But thats another reason I like it, because you can turn that function on and off.
