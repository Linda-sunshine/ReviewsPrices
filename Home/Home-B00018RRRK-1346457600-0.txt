review/summary: Nice grinder for the ave coffee drinkerreview/text: I have had this grinder since last Xmas. We use it everyday and it has worked perfectly. It is obviously not top of the line. However if you enjoy fresh ground coffee without a whopping price tag this grinder is great. Really my only complaint is that a small amount of coffee grounds stick to the hopper because of static cling. It can make a titch of a mess but only a titch. Not that big of a deal. I would recommend this grinder to a friend.
