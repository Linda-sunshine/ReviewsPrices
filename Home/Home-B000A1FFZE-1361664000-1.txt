review/summary: good but has issuesreview/text: I bought this to save counter space. It has a very cool retro look to it which i enjoy. you switch between toaster/toaster oven by a little switch. both have separate temperature controls. comes with a little inner tray also. It works great HOWEVER it is very HARD to clean so crumbs get into every crevices and its hard to take out. The toast/bagel sometimes gets caught but that isnt a big issue.Overall worth it but be aware of the negatives.
