review/summary: My favorite thermos my far!review/text: It does not leak, the quality is amazing and it keeps drinks hot literally all day. Be careful drinking tea even HOURS later because you will likely burn your tongue. I love the design and how easy it is to drink from and clean. I never drip on myself. I also like how it locks. I often put my coffee and cream in and then close the lid, lock it and shake, instead of stirring it with a spoon. I bought one for my mom and she loves it just as much. Highly recommended!
