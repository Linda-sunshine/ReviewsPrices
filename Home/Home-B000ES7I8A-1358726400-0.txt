review/summary: does not pour well & clumsy to refillreview/text: I don't know what the product engineers were thinking when they designed the lid and spout. The lid is hinged halfway from the handle to the spout on either side, in other words, &#34;in the middle&#34;. So when it is opened, it obstructs the very opening through which one must get the water inside. Then, there are two pins that lock the lid shut, and in order to get it past those pins you have to press the release button on top of the handle. Press the release button to open the lid makes sense, but &#34;press the release button to close the lid&#34; is counterintuitive. The pins could have been designed like a doorknob bolt with a curved side and a flat side, so that the lid could simply be pressed back into locked position.And I hate to sound like a grumpy old lady, but I have to wonder if the engineering team even tried pouring the water out of this, even once. Unless you pour very very slowly, the stream of water exiting the spout breaks up into two or three smaller, unpredictably targeted streams. Since one is generally pouring into a wide-mouthed tea cup or tea pot, it's not really a functional impediment, but this defect does take away from any sense that one is using a high quality product.Just the same, I give this electric kettle 3 stars because it gets extra points for having no plastic at all in contact with the water while boiling (though it does briefly move past plastic while pouring, another defect IMO). I am happy to have a slightly less convenient &#34;MAX&#34; mark on the inside of the kettle, compared to the plastic external water-level indicator on other electric kettles I found on Amazon.But I wish I had forked over a bit more money, considering this will be (i hope) a durable purchase, for a truly all-steel kettle with a well designed lid and spout.
