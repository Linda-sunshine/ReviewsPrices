review/summary: super handyreview/text: i bought this over a year ago and finally decided to write a review after having used it. I didn't think it was gonna be a very smart purchase as it seemed to be limited in the uses. well let me be the first to say i was wrong. Making soups and stews are a no brainer, making a modest batch of soup stock in short notice is such a time saver. take the bones and a few root veggies add water, let the cooker come to a pressure and leave for 45 minutes and you have some decent soup base. The same lines as stews, get some cheaper cuts of meats and cube it up, add your standard seasoning and a can of beer let it run for 15 odd minutes turn off the heat and let it come down in pressure by itself and you have one awesome tender meal. yeah, you could make the same thing in a regular pot but when you get the same results in a short time it's a simple answer. why slave in the kitchen when you can be almost a one pot meal. plus these meals are awesome in the fall.
