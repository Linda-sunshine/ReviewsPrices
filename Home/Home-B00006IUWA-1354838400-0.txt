review/summary: Good value, tasty popcornreview/text: This popcorn popper has a heavier motor than our previous one (Redenbacher), a sign of good quality. Also, the top is better, the base more stable, and overall it's well made. This product deserves your consideration.Some people complained about unpopped kernels blowing out. Tilting the base back 15-20 degrees (so the opening points closer to level) before popping begins eliminates this problem. Once the chute fills with popped kernels, I level out the popper and let it fill my bowl. This is a bit of a bother perhaps, but I also believe it's best to continually watch any appliance combining a heating element and fan. This issue is something that is relevant to any hot air popper, so it has no bearing on my rating.I've never considered the plastic measuring cup a good place to melt butter. A small pan over low heat is preferable.
