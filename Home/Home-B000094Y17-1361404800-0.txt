review/summary: Filter is good but design is horrible!review/text: The water that comes out of this is great, very well filtered, etc. No problems there. But the design is so horrible! Water spills out the back if you've just put water in to filter and you tip it slightly backwards, it pours out the front and/or the top comes off and spills water out if you try to pout while there's water filtering. And the handle is nowhere near strong enough to support the weight of all the water you can fit in the pitcher. I'll keep using this while I still have filters for it, but after that I'm going back to Pur.
