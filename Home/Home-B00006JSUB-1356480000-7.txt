review/summary: Not too bad. Not really preseasonedreview/text: You must cook a lot of fatty food in it to start out. Did my first skittle steaks the other night - utterly fantastic. Took less than 8 minutes to cook, set off all the smoke alrams in the house, but it was the juiciest steak I have ever eaten in my life (medium cooked). I still wipe it down with oil after each cooking and if I ever have the oven on, I put in there for the ride to keep somewhat seasoned. Still not non-stick yet (unless a lot of greese in the pan) so I hope it will work soon!
