review/summary: T-FAL SKILLETreview/text: I bought the 12", 10" and 6" skillet. Very happy with them. It is so easy for me to make omelets and they are very easy to clean. The warning emblem at the bottom let me know when I have reach a hot enough temperature. You can not go wrong for the price....I have spent a lot more money on famous brands and they they don't hold up. Great buy.
