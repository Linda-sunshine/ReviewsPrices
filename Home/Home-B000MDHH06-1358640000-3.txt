review/summary: LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!review/text: This is my first time submitting a review and my first time juicing. I love this Breville juicer. It is very easy to use and clean. I use it three times a day for the past month. My Sweetie has a Omega J008 or J004 and it is great for wheatgrass juicing but not convenient for vegetable/fruit juicing because it takes way too long to juice. I love the one year warranty, just in case I need it. IF YOU BUY THIS BREVILLE, YOU WON'T BE SORRY : )
