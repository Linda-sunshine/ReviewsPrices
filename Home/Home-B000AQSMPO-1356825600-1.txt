review/summary: Junkreview/text: Bull**** Alert from Keurig. This is our 2nd unit in 3 days. We sent the first one back because it was only brewing to 155 degrees and the marketing materials and box and directions and touchscreen all say it will brew to 192.This one only got to 175 (same as our 2-year old one) and after we called customer service -- get this -- the 192 is the "internal temperature" (I am not making this up). So, by some miracle of physics the water temperature somehow drops 17 degrees in a fraction of a second after traveling all of 3 inches in a tube from the heating element.Just junk.This one will go back and we will figure out some other way not to waste $140.Don't buy it.
