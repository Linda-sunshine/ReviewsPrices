review/summary: Sheds tons of fiberreview/text: This sheet set had very good reviews on Amazon. I shop from Amazon all the time, and my decisions are mostly based on user reviews. But I have to say, this time I was extremely disappointed.First of all, the fabric does not feel soft. It does not feel comfortable on skin. But more importantly, it constantly sheds fibers. This gives me allergies and irritation. Even though I washed the set many times, it just keeps shedding fibers and eventually I stopped using them. Is it only me, or did you have a similar issue?
