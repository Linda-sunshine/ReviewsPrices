review/summary: A great product replaced by a super one!review/text: Met all of my expectations...and more. Like the 3 loaf size option. My previous maker was a Universal (Panasonic) Had it many years and was afraid I would not be able to replace it when the paddle mechanism literally fell apart. Was very happy when I found it online..ordered it and received it 6 days later. All in all, I am a happy bread maker once again!
