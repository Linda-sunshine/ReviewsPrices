review/summary: Love it!review/text: We ordered this mattress pad because we have an Ikea mattress that is starting to smoosh down and is not very comfortable. It is extremely soft and my boyfriend and I sleep amazingly well every night now. The first night we got it and slept on it we weren't sure if we liked it. I think we just weren't used to how soft it is yet. Now we love it and cant believe we slept without it before. I have no more pain in my shoulders and hips from the hard mattress and i don't wake up through out the night anymore. I definitely recommend this mattress pad.
