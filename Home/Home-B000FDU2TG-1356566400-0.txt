review/summary: SHAME ON YOU, KITCHENAIDreview/text: Shame on you, Kitchenaid! All this money for PLASTIC???? If I could return this item without hurting the feelings of "Santa," I would in a heartbeat! The $29 Black and Decker I got at wal_mart 2 years ago has a glass container and metal parts!!!! If you want quality, this is NOT the one to go for.
