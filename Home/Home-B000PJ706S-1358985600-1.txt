review/summary: Love tea, hate this kettlereview/text: Ok, so maybe &#34;hate&#34; is a strong word. But, after two months of use, frequent cleanings with vinegar water, lemon, etc., the kettle still smells. There is a chemical odor to the kettle itself...but even worse is the chemical odor I can detect even after I steep my tea and add a little milk! I cannot imagine whatever is causing this smell is not harmful. My kettle is going back to the store. After reading many reviews about customer service nightmares, I'm not going to bother trying to return the product through the company. I certainly won't be purchasing another Capresso product. This is the FIRST time I have ever reviewed ANY product on Amazon...I wanted to warn any other future purchasers of this product.
