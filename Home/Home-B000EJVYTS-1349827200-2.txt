review/summary: terrible purchasereview/text: I was so excited about getting this garbage can, I thought the idea of it was just awesome. It was delivered yesterday and I couldn't get it out of the box fast enough. I put brand new batteries in it and gave it a whirl. It opened maybe an inch each time I put my hand in front of the motion sensor. If I took the top off and tilted it back it would open fine. It's like the motor mechanism isn't even strong enough to lift the top. I went ahead and called the manufacturer just to make sure I wasn't missing something. They told me that I should turn it off and open and close the top a lot over the course of a few days and maybe it would start working. I asked the lady why in the world would I buy I new item, that should work when received and try to "get it to work" over the course of a few days. Thankfully, I made my purchase through amazon and can return hassle free. I now have read many of the negative reviews and will be purchasing a different garbage can. Too bad this company didn't make this item better because it could have been an awesome product. Sorry, I cannot recommend this one to anyone. In fact, I would strongly suggest that you purchase something different and don't waste your time on this one.
