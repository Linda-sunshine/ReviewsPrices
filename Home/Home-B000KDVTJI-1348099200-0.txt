review/summary: Love this hot pot!review/text: I had a less expensive hot pot. It had a heating element inside and the bottom was constantly covered with mineral build up. It was tethered with the electric cord, making it difficult to pour anyplace other than right in front of it. The Aroma pot solves this problem. It lifts off the base to pour hot water anywhere. The heating element is in the base, so the pot stays clean. The pot heats water very quickly and shuts itself off when the water is ready! Not that I'm forgetful, but I have burned up a few stovetop tea kettles. This is a great pot and very affordable. I used one at a friend's house and rushed out to get one of my own.
