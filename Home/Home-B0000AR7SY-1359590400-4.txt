review/summary: Glad I bought it!review/text: We bought this to replace the burr grinder that came with our Viking coffeemaker. I researched several brands and models before settling on the Capresso. It's much quieter and more efficient than the Viking burr grinder and once you tweak the settings, it does a great job. Highly recommend.
