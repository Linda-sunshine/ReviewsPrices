review/summary: Cute little jugreview/text: Maybe it's just me but this is such a cute little jug. It's square so it fits perfectly into my refrigerator. There's enough room to make all my frozen juice drinks. The lid fits very tight after I tightened it. It seems a bit heavy to handle when it's full but that's because it's glass, but I don't mind because glass is better and cleaner in my opinion.
