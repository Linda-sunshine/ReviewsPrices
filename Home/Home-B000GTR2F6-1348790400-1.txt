review/summary: Overpriced and poorly designed.review/text: After having used this for almost 2 years and being on my 3rd replacment from Keurig, i will never buy another one of these peices of junk. I would much rather have my old 12 cup coffee pot back especially in the mornings, nothing like having to mess around with coffee for myself and my wives 2 cups before we go out the door and then our 2 travel mugs... If you only drink a little bit of coffee or want this for the other beverages on an occasional bsis, im sure it would be great...but to use this as a coffee machine,,, it doesnt last long enough or function quick enough. There is a design fault with this model, somehow the water corrodes a solenoid and the unit ceases to funciton..> Keurig knows about this and they replace the unit with not much hassle... i gave them 3 stars for customer service alone... the unit istelf would get a 1 or 2 IMHO
