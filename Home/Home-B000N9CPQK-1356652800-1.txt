review/summary: It helped my nose a lot.review/text: I got this because I was sick of waking up with my nose full of junk --Not only did it do that, but for the first time in a while, my nose dried up during the day!The ionizer was a bit of a surprise, but I definitely like it -- it makes the air feel more fresh. :o)-----Pros:++ Cleans up the crap that clogs your nose. :oD++ The ionizer definitely makes the air feel more fresh.++ On low, it's pretty quiet. Medium isn't bad at all, either.++ No filters to buy -- but yet having HEPA's benefits -- is definitely a selling point of the unit.++ Can't beat the price!Cons:-- It's a bit loud on high.-- The ionizer LED can be a pain if you're in a bedroom; be prepared with some black electrical tape to cover it.-- Not good at removing odors. I don't dock it stars for this, though, as it was never designed for it.
