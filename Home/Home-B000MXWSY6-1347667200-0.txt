review/summary: Your Last Clock Radioreview/text: We have all had experience with alarms and clock radios that have cheesy buttons and switches and work only if you hold your mouth right and cycle the switch twice. I purchased this clock radio hopeful that it looked more solid than most. It is. Sony has used spring loaded knobs for setting the alarms and all of the other buttons and knobs are nice and tight and work just like they are supposed to. I didn't think I needed two alarms, but my work callout times have varied enough to where I use one alarm for early morning and the other when the callout is late at night. they are quick and easy to set and work perfectly. This unit stands far and above most clock radios in this price range and I recommend it highly. The radio is clear and strong.
