review/summary: I love this juicer!review/text: This is my first juicer and I've only owned it for a few weeks, but, boy, do I every love it! It is extremely well built. Very solid with thick plastic pieces that are easy to wash off after using. The juice is EXCELLENT! There really is no strain on the motor and food projecting out of the shoot (as described by some reviewers) if don't cram tons of things in at once and be patient and reasonable with the appliance. I really can't recommend this product enough based on my experience.
