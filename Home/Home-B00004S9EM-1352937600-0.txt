review/summary: Excellent unitreview/text: This is a fabulous food processor. My old one I rarely used but this one I use several times a week. I didn't even know how useful it would be until I got it! It's a great moderate size (I can shred a whole head of lettuce into it). The only complaint I have is that the part that pushes down the food (not the white insert for it but the whole plastic half-moon shaped piece) doesn't detach from the chute. I can get it off the lid but not apart from the chute. This makes that particular part difficult to clean. Otherwise, I'm very happy with my purchase.
