review/summary: Excellent Pressure Cookerreview/text: I previously bought a different pressure cooker from Amazon but the pressure adjuster broke. I then saw Costco had this product and I bought it, quite skeptical about the pressure valve. However, after much use this pressure cooker is the best I ever bought with no problems at all. Now you can only get this pressure cooker online with Costco. I just ordered the gasket from amazon since they don't sell that here in Hawaii.
