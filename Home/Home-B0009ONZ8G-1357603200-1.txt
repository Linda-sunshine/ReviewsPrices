review/summary: Great Product For The Pricereview/text: I researched vacuums on a popular product testing and &#34;consumer reporting&#34; website, where this product was recommended, based on superior performance and lower price. By and large, I have been very satisfied with the machine, but I do have a couple of quibbles.First, I have noticed that the vacuum does not pick up dirt on bare floors as well as I would expect. In fact, I have felt it kick out dust particles as I have used it. Second, there is a gauge on the front of the vacuum, which is supposed to show how full the bag is. I have never seen the gauge change, regardless of whether there is a new bag or a full bag.I would be far more disturbed by those issues if the vacuum were more expensive, but I could have paid a lot more and gotten a lot less. For the price and overall performance, this is a great product.
