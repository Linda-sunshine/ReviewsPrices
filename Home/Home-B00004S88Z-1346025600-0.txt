review/summary: Fantastic!!review/text: Update: We have now been using this canner for several months. We like it even better than when we first got it. We have had no problems with the unit, it works perfectly every time. We have canned beef, chicken, meat loaf, chili, spaghetti sauce, bean soup, turkey stock with meat (for soup), split pea soup and various other things. I would buy this again in a minute. The only negative we have found is that it is large to store. We decided to store it on a shelf in our basement just because of it's size. It is also nice that replacement parts can be ordered if needed in the future.We looked at several different brands and types of pressure canners, this is by far the best! It is heavy duty and will last for years. I had been reluctant to can some vegetables and had never even tried canning meat, but now we have done all of these with great success.In response to some other reviews, this is not a water bath canner (although you can use it for that too). This canner allows you to pressure can meats, vegetables, fruit, anything. As with any canning you must check your seal after canning. It is not the fault of the canner if you had a small bit of food on the rim of the jar that prevented it from sealing properly.Follow the directions and this canner will server you better than any other that we we checked out!
