review/summary: Very Disappointingreview/text: The product was delivered quickly and was well packaged, to be fair. I plugged it in for charging and, after a full day, it still couldn't completely remove a cork from a wine bottle (it made about three revolutions before dying). I plugged it in again for another day and still had no luck with trying to open the wine bottle. I contacted Amazon and they immediately issued a refund and sent me a label for returning the item. I purchased the opener, in part, based on the brand name. Based on the disappointing experience with this particular opener, I wasn't inclined to get a replacement and opted for the refund.
