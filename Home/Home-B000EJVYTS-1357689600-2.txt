review/summary: So Far Soooo Goodreview/text: It's only a day old BUT...It comes packaged, very well. And I mean the manufacturer's packaging not the amazon packaging.It was a cinch to put together (I bought the AC Adapter - not included - so i didn't need to put in batteries). It has an open and close button as well as a sensor. So, if you need to leave it open for a while push open and it will stay open until you push close. If you want to just open it for a second just put your hand near the trash and boom it opens right up. Take your hand away and about two seconds later it closes.I do a lot of cooking at home and when your cutting chicken or making eggs you don't want to get that stuff all over the trash cover and you don't want to get whatever's on the trash cover all over your food! This is a great solution. I'm not really sure if the deodorizer works, but I have no reason to believe it's not. The trash lid is rarely open and I use the odor protection trash bags, so toss the deodorizer in there and I should have a really nice smelling trash, which is weird to put into writing.Overall, no buyers remorse; I would recommend this. I'll keep you updated if anything changes.
