review/summary: Panasonic bread machinereview/text: Te price is comparable to other brands on the market. The bread loaf come out exactly as promised. The only thing I would have really liked to see on this machine is the beeper in between cycles. There are times you want to add special ingredients and there is nothing to remind you when to do that. This is one feature that I think is important to have especially for busy people. It has meet my expectation on performance. I recommend to those of you buying a bread machine, make sure you get the one the beeps in between cycles and at the end of baking.
