review/summary: strong rubber smell, warranty/support is uselessreview/text: Motor start producing strong rubber smell from the fist day of using the vacuum. After disconnecting belt I found that smell coming directly form the motor. Called Dirtdevil support, they extended warranty to 2y (many thanks !) and redirected me to the repair shop, but shop refused to replace motor even under warranty. Warranty and support is useless. I cannot use vacuum in side the house.
