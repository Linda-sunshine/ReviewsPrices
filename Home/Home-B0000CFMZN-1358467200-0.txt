review/summary: Great measuring cupreview/text: I only used a one cup Pyrex for years and years and finally decided I need a bigger size. Pyrex was the only brand I trust, so when I saw this, I grabbed it. It is HUGE compared of course to my little one cup. I use it all the time though and love it. I still have my one cup which if I had to guess I've had for almost 30 years....still has the red lettering in perfect shape!
