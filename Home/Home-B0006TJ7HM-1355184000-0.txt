review/summary: Truly a shockingly terrible knife setreview/text: These weren't even sharp out of the box &#8211; much less after two years of very occasional use (once a month or so - they're at a vacation home). I feel terribly throwing them in the trash - what a waste of resources - but I'm not sure what else to do with them.
