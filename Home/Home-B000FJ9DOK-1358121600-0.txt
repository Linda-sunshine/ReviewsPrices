review/summary: Very nice bottle! But, there is a better one (filtered)review/text: This is a very nice bottle. It keeps the liquid insulated for I would say 8 hours.I had been using it for like 1-2 years before I passed it on to someone else, when I bought a fancier insulated filtered water bottle on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Vessel-Insulated-Filter-Bottle-Filtration/dp/B007M8WKR4
