review/summary: WORTH EVERY PENNYreview/text: If you are looking for a very durable well made "raised" air mattress, you can not go wrong with this bed. This is my third purchase of this mattress because I have tried others and the first two have surpassed my expectations. You ask why is it my third mattress??? Well, I don't use it for temporary purposes.At first use..you can expect the mattress to become soggy..but that is because the vinyl is stretching out to accommodate the air plus the weight that has been put on it. You might find yourself filling it up a few times until you notice there is constant firmness to your liking. I weigh at 250lbs. and this is a very easy mattress to get into and especially easy to get up from. My first mattress eventually gave out after 3 or 4 months of continuous use. My second one was going beyond the 4 month mark until there was a sudden bulge that developed that created a huge bump in the middle of the mattress where the air decided it was going to hang out at. Customer service was excellent in handling my problem and didn't hesitate to send me a replacement which lasted me another good 4 or 5 months. I've had another bulge up...but just decided to order a brand new one without hesitation..but I will inform them of this recent event. In a nutshell..what I am trying to say is...is that if you are getting this as a temporary mattress for guests to sleep on for over a week or two..you won't be sorry. They will find it to be extremely comfortable and be very grateful for a wonderful night's sleep!!!
