review/summary: Hard-boiled eggs any season? Yes please!review/text: I used to think it was a pain to cook hard boiled eggs, especially when it was just for a couple at a time so I really didn't eat them often, just Easter, really! Well, this little device has changed all that. I can cook from one to four at a time and in about 8 minutes I have a hard boiled egg with little cleanup. I've owned this for almost a year now and use it a couple times a month and have had no issues. I was hesitant to buy it because I wondered if it really worked but I'm here to say that it does and I am very happy with it. It takes some getting used to for opening it and moving it (especially once it's done getting cooked because the base with the water in it is very hot!!) but for now I'm happy with it.
