review/summary: Nice!review/text: Have been dealing with a variety of insulated bottle for hot and cold liquids. This is definitely the best for cold items. Here in sunny South Carolina it manages to keep ice cold water cold if not frigid all day. Does not spill and easy to close and open for drinking or filling.
