review/summary: Love this spiralizer!review/text: This tool's great! It made great zucchini pasta in a flash that was delicious with our homemade pesto (basil and garlic from the backyard). Our boys loved making apple spirals and sprinkling cinnamon on them. The way the extra blades store within the spiralizer is excellent design.
