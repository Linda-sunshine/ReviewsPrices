review/summary: Can't beat Lodge cast ironreview/text: I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. She said nothing sticks from the first time she used it because it is pre-seasoned. I love cooking with cast iron skillets and have several. I'm considering buying myself one of these because I don't have one this big.
