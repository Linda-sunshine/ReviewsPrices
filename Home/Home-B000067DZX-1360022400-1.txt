review/summary: The water tastes great!review/text: I have been very happy with my pur pitcher and filters. Makes the water taste great and the filters seem to last a long time. It can take a little while for the tap water to filter through, but this doesn't seem like a big deal to me. I figure its just doing a thorough job of filtering the junk out, and I can wait. Would recommend this system, for sure.
