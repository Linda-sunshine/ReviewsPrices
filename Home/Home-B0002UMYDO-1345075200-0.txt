review/summary: As good as it gets, but still not greatreview/text: I bought this can opener about 3 years ago. I used it a few times a week at the most - certainly not to excess. About a month ago, the lever stopped catching the cans and the opener was useless. We called West Bend and were told that this is a common problem. So why won't they just change the design, or offer free replacement parts to those of us who bother to make the phone call? Who knows. The replacement part was going to cost over $20 plus shipping. That's ridiculous. So I did a bunch of research and am now purchasing the same exact can opener again, because even with its flaws, this still seems to be the best one out there. When it's working, I like it except it tends to shred the paper wrapping on cans. Perhaps that's unavoidable, but it means we either took the time to tear the paper off before opening cans, or we took the time to fish little paper bits out of our food. Otherwise - the height is nice, it grips cans well (doesn't drop them halfway through), and it looks cool on the counter. I only wish it would last a bit longer.
