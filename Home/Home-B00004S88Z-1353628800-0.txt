review/summary: Not for glass top stovesreview/text: I just spoke with a representative regarding this product. I've used a friends and its a great canner. You can not, however, use this on a glass top stove, hence the four stars. The woman I just spoke with said the bottom isn't flat. Combining the high heat and heavy weight on a glass top stove can weaken or break the stove top. She recommended either using this canner in a tri pod gas burner outside or going with the Presto 23 quart. She said it is just as safe, the main difference being the Presto uses gaskets while the All American does not. Hope this helps. (I posted this under another reviews comments)
