review/summary: Very easy to usereview/text: We purchased this mattress for a child to use for guests. We slept on it 2 nights and determined after the first night that it was not inflated enough on the outer portion. The next night we inflated that part more than before and the lighter of the two of use slept much better, without sliding into the heavier one. Inflating and deflating are super easy to do. The mattress feels very much like a water bed when you are getting on or off of it, or turning over. Lying still, you do not get that sensation. The height off the floor is good; you don't have trouble getting up from being so low on the floor.Hopefully this mattress will last a long time so that many guests can get a good nights sleep.
