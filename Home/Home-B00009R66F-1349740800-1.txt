review/summary: Terrific Price! Easy to use!review/text: Previously owned a Bissel Heated unit that lasted me 10 years, but still left alot of soap and water in the carpet. The Hoover replaced the Bissel after the first finally died.Negatives...some assembly required; the cord is a bit short; and the supply/collection tanks are a little small.Positives...terrific suction really pulls a great deal of water out of the carpet; hand tool amazing for the cars (my 6 year old mom-mobile looks pristine now); no separate container for soap, so you don't end up clogging the tubes with old soap after leaving it sitting in the closet for a month; separate supply and collection tanks means much easier cleaning after you are finished with the job.
