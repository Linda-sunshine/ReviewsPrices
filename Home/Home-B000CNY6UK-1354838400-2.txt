review/summary: Good conversionreview/text: I bought this item about a month ago and have already bought two more sense to give as gifts! I am really happy with the conversion (i get about 90-95% in the top)I like the imported feel of the packaging and knowing its an authentic Italian mocha makerMake sure to not use soap or abrasive on it (just rinse and dry), it gets a little getting used to especially if you are hosting and someone wants to dive in and help with the cleaning. Make sure you yell and hide your mocha maker!Fast shipping as usual from amazon, thanks guys
