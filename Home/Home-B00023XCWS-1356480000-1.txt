review/summary: Boils Water Fastreview/text: This is an excellent electric kettle. It does what an electric kettle is suppose to do. It heats water fast. It heats a full liter of water in around 5 minutes. The cord is short but can be easily detached from the kettle. When using this kettle for the first time you need to boil water twice. This is a great buy.
