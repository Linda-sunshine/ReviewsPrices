review/summary: First real kitchen knifereview/text: Having just made due for most of my life w/ just regular large knives from steak knife packages I finally asked for my first real kitchen knife. While I'm no expert of course, this is a great first add for getting started on having good equipment in the kitchen. Well balanced, good heft, just all around a strong purchase.
