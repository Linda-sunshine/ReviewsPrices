review/summary: Good product for the price!review/text: Good and solid product. I just moved in to a house with carpets, and I have to clean them before I let my family live in this place. This item has strong brushes and good suction. So far, I have had it for one month, and I have not encounter any problems. It is just a little bulky and heavy, especially for small people.
