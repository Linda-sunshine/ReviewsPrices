review/summary: Wish I had gone for a larger sizereview/text: The product works very well for what it is. I can't fault it, but I can harbor some regrets that I didn't jump for a larger size processor. At the time, I figured that this would be the best size processor for someone living alone, having little counter space, and not entertaining often. However, a new program of preparing food ahead of time and attempting to freeze some batches for consumption at a later time (in other words, economizing) has suggested that a bigger processing capacity would have been a wiser choice. And the recent decision to make at least some of the pet food for my &#34;crew&#34; proved that observation, unfortunately, to be right.Not difficult to clean. This is a nice extra hand for making smaller batches of salsa, herb seasoning, dips and spreads, but if you plan to prepare big pots of soup or crocks of salad, you will probably appreciate a higher-capacity machine.P.S. It's cute!
