review/summary: Great scale even for precious metalsreview/text: The reviews for this $6 scale were enough to convince me to purchase it. The shipping was free and it arrived before the eta! I tested a 1 troy ounce maple leaf and the scale was spot on! If this deal wasn't any better, it came with batteries too. I am Very satisfied with the seller and the scale. The price is unbelievable and the scale is pocket-sized. I will be buying more of these in the future and I suggest you get one too.
