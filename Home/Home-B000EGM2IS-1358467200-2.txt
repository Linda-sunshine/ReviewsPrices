review/summary: Cheaply made.review/text: This does seem to heat the water very well and, for me, it does heat it very quickly, however, the button that depresses the water seems like it will break after a few uses. You have to press very hard and it seems like it will damage the button very quickly. Also, the water seems to drip out very slowly and doesnt empty the chamber. I didnt have an older one to compare it too but dont think I will keep this one. I would love if them made a quality unit. Why does everyone resort to cheaper materials and quality. Truely disappointing.
