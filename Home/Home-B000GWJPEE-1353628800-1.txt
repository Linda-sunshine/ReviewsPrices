review/summary: Great for bedroomreview/text: I love this humidifier. I use mine on a daily basis in my bedroom throughout the winter months. (I live in the north which gets very dry.) It's very quiet. Does not disturb my sleep. I do have a piece of electrical tape over the green power light. I found it to be very bright in the bedroom but that is a personal preference. I don't like any extra light in my room. Very easy to fill. Very easy to clean. I would definitely recommend this product!
