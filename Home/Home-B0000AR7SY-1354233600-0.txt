review/summary: Bean container critical to operation easily damagedreview/text: The Capresso 565 Infinity Conical Burr Grinder is an excellent product in all ways but one: The bean container on top critical to the machine's operation is easily damaged.Along the bottom of the container is a ridge that inserts into the base of the grinder. The rotation of that basket sets the coarseness of the grind. When putting the machine away after one of its first uses, the bean container took about a three-foot tumble onto the counter-top and chipped a little more than an inch off of the ridge. Because of this, the grinder will operate only on the Fine and Coarse settings. (It seems likely that more of that ridge will break off eventually, perhaps in the grinder itself, rendering it useless.)Worst of all, even though Capresso includes an insert warning against breaking the ridge -- which is an admission that the product is poorly-designed -- they refuse to replace the container.
