review/summary: Ok Heaterreview/text: I got this heater to sit under my desk as it is often cold where I work. The heat zone is very short but intense. The result is that the side of my body where the heater sits is very warm while the other side of my body is cool. I literally get goosebumps on one side while the other bakes. The heater is under my enclosed desk area but the whole area doesn't seem to get heated, just the spot right in front of it. One of the main features that attracted me to this heater was noise. It is very quiet but gives off a nice burning smell the first time you turn it on for the day. There is no thermostat so I turn it on and off manually. I will probably be returning this heater. I like the heating functionality of the blower heaters just not the noise but they work more effectively than this one does for my purposes.
