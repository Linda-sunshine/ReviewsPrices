review/summary: World Cuisine A4982799 Tri-Blade Plastic Spiral Vegetable Slicerreview/text: The World Cuisine Tri-Blade Plastic Spiral Vegetable Slicer is totally FUN! It does exactly what is advertised - by slicing your vegetable (or fruit!) into pasta, ribons, or twisty fry shapes. It is very easy to use and simple to clean up! Be VERY CAREFUL when cleaning the blade cartridges -- they are extremely SHARP and without thinking too much about it, you will cut yourself if you aren't careful! It says vegetable slicer, but I used it to slice an apple into the pasta shape and drizzled caramel sauce over the top -- YUM!!
