review/summary: Hoover beat Bisselreview/text: Love this machine.... I've had Bissel's for years but the pricing and design of the new Bissel's were disapointing. This Hoover is a throw back to the earlier Bissel designs with some improvements. I love the seperate container for the dirty water. The new Bissle's have a bladder inside the clean tank and it's akward, messy and hard to clean it out fully. This seperate container for the dirty water is easier to empty and clean. I also love that you add the soap directly to the water because you have more control over how much soap is laid down. The hand attachments are a little tricky to hook up but easy enough once you understand how to hook it up. The rotating brushes are a nice plus. The hoover says "steam vac" which is a bit misleading as the machine doesn't heat the water up to a steam.....you have to use hot tap water but truthfully I didn't think the Bissel heated up the water well anyway so no loss there. I generally put water in and vacuum/wash immediately so I don't think the hot water is really an issue for me. The cost is amazing... I bought my new Hoover for under $140 compared to Bissels $300 plus price tag it's totally worth the savings. Amazon filled the order and was wonderful. There is some assembly of the machine but also not a biggie. Definately a machine that works well and worth buying for all kinds of clean ups especially given the price tag! Enjoy
