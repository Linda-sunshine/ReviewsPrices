review/summary: Really love this little vacuumreview/text: I have a dog that sheds a lot and loves to sleep on our couch. Needless to say, there is dog hair on it every day and every day I get this awesome little guy out and clean it all up. I always hated having to vacuum the couch with my normal vacuum because it seemed to take forever. Since this fella has a nice wide suction area, I can get the couch hair free in no time. It also works great in the car and on stairs. My husband used it on the floor mat of our car and he said that it was his new favorite thing :) The only problem that I have with it is that the cord doesn't stay on the handle too well. I have to very carefully wrap it around to get it to stay put. Other than that, its great, especially for the price.
