review/summary: really great, and cheap!review/text: I love this comal. I wanted something I could use for tortillas, pancakes, crab cakes, etc. It heats up really nice, has the perfect height rim. I already have a Lodge cast iron dutch oven that I love so naturally I went with lodge the second time around as well.
