review/summary: easy to use and clean no worries about breaking like glass coffee pressreview/text: Got this coffee press after 2 months of reading customer review of all kinds of coffee press. Love this Thermos Nissan coffee press for these reasons:1. easy to use2. easy to clean ( I always hand wash)3. no worry about it breaking (by hitting the sink during wash or granite counter, as what happened to so many of my wine glasses and dink ware)4. no worry about explosion due to hot water (one of my glass pitcher broke this way and I cut my finger while cleaning up the mess. Boiling hot water is a must for making good coffee by using a french press like this kind.)5. makes great coffee no coffee grounds going through the mesh press6. large size7. long-lasting durability8. all-stainless parts (where the coffee touches)I doesn't keep coffee hot for hours. Thast's why I also bought the Thermos Nissan Vacuum insulated stainless Briefcase bottle and am very happy for its performance too.
