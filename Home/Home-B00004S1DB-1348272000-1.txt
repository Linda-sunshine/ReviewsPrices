review/summary: Works for me. Hot coffee for 2+ hours. Just the right amount.review/text: There is some leakage of grounds around the screen. If you grind your own coffee make it a courser grind and steep it a little longer before pushing down the plunger. I have notice that it is best to always have the lid in place when moving the screen up and down, otherwise the screen can wedge and cause the screen to get the dreaded bends as mentioned in the other reviews. This is especially important when pulling it up to clean it.The few grounds I get sink almost immediately so it's not a problem for me.Very convenient product, with good heat retention and it's just the right amount for my morning coffee - hence 5 stars.
