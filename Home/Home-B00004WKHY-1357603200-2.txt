review/summary: WOW!review/text: Much bigger than I expected & very well made. I expect to use this for many years to come. Great features, comes with a DVD, instruction manual, recipes, and a spatula (as well as the extra slicing & dough accessories). Very pleased with my purchase. It is pretty heavy duty & will take up a bit of space on your counter though.
