review/summary: Good Coffee. Fragile Basketreview/text: This is generally a good pot with the caveat that the basket must be handled carefully: don't drop it in the sink, don't hit the top rim when knocking the used coffee out of it, etc. Also, the threads in the handle on the top have stripped out.I disagree with what a lot of people are saying about how to use it:1) DO wash and rinse it thoroughly w/ detergent. If you don't the old coffee oil leaves a stale flavor. I've tried it both ways and I've found that the cleaner it is the better the coffee tastes.2) Tamp the coffee in the basket firmly.3) Heat on HIGH. If the relief valve starts whistling, reduce heat.4) Be your own judge of what makes the coffee taste best. Don't let the coffee fascists (including me) tell you how you have to make it.5) Use good fresh ground (preferably in a burr grinder) coffee like peets or coffeeshack, not starbucks or other such popular overpriced dreck. If you want to go cheaper, cafe bustelo (available in many grocery stores and walmart) is pretty good.
