review/summary: Excellent! Would recommend to anyone.review/text: Received the first Carpet Cleaner and unfortunately the dispenser did not work well. Reported problem and had a new one in 2 days, before I had even returned the broken cleaner. That's what I consider excellent customer service. Carpet had pet stains (2 little ones that refuse to go outside...) and they are completely gone! Carpet is light color and it truly looks clean. I will be using this cleaner a lot :)
