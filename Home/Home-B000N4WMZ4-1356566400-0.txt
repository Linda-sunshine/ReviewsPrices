review/summary: what a wonderful Christmas gift!review/text: I received this as a Christmas gift and was pleasantly surpised at the quality of the Dutch Oven! I think it is better made than Le Crueset and definitely heavier. I like Lodge cast iron because it is made in the USA. However, I think the pot is made in the U.S. but the porcelain coating is done in China; so it says made in China. Still, the quality is there all the way around. I have not used it yet but I can't wait to try it out!
