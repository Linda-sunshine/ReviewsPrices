review/summary: Works as intendedreview/text: For more about this product see reviews of the FM-15A faucet filter. This is the original equipment replacement filter for that unit. I have found that I do not have to replace the filter as often as the manufacturer suggests. More like every 6 to 9 months for my particular use.
