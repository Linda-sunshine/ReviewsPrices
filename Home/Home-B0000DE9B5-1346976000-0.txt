review/summary: Love this productreview/text: My husband likes to drink cool herbal tea. He used to make the tea in a big glass jar (no lid), then fill large coke bottles and store them in the fridge. The problem is that we don't like plastic bottles, and sometimes we find ourselves buying 2-liter cokes from the store just to use the bottle. I found this product and so far we love, love it. It definitely holds 2 liters, slightly more than a 2-l coke bottle. It fits well in a standard-size fridge door and my husband has no problem with the small handle.
