review/summary: Great knife, the reviews are right!review/text: I got this as a gift for someone who had really bad knives after trying to use theirs. I've got some Wusthof classics at home and take good care of them, and was wary of the stamped steel of these. I shouldn't have been. They're solid, smooth and strong. The handle is large, very easy to grip and the back edge of the knife is smoothed and not sharp.
