review/summary: Does not fit GE coffeemakerreview/text: It did not fit my GE 12-cup coffeemaker. It was much too shallow for the basket cavity in the coffeemaker. I don't see how this item has sufficient volume to handle 12 cups of coffee. As others have remarked, the bottom is solid plastic, which would tend to impede the outflow rate of the brewed liquid.
