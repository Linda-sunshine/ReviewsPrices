review/summary: Simple and worksreview/text: I mostly use it for cold water with ice. It maintains the coldness of the drink for hours. Sometimes it even still has some ice left in it after a full day of work.It also keeps your hot drink hour for quite a while.It's easy to carry and easy to open with one hand.The only problem is that the little metal loop that locks the lid button is a bit loose so if you're carrying it in your bag, it could flip off and then there is the danger of the button getting pressed and opening it. Don't know if they're all like that or just mine though. Luckily it's never opened and it's been tossed around in my bag, sometimes almost lying completely upside down.I would recommend it.
