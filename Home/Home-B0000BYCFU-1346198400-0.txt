review/summary: Works Perfectlyreview/text: It works just like it's supposed to, and I've definitely given it a workout this season! I'm using it on a glass-top stove - on the largest burner, and have experienced no problems. The size is roomy enough to accomodate most average recipes. Very happy with the purchase!
