review/summary: REFURBISHED (SECOND HAND GOODS) AND LACKING FULL WARRANTY - Amazon is a HUGE disappointment!review/text: My review is not in reference to the quality of the product; but rather a warning to potential buyers via Amazon. I purchased this food processor on Black Friday 2012 as a lightning deal. Upon it's arrival, I found that the serial number was not engraved on the bottom. Instead of the engraving, I found a sticker. After contacting Cuisinart customer service, they confirmed that the machine was a refurbished unit and not a new item. I contacted Amazon customer service, and they promised to investigate and send me a new item. The next day I received a SECOND refurbished unit. Again, I contacted customer service. They only offered the option of my returning the machine for a refund.I'm so disappointed with Amazon. They are fraudulently selling refurbished Cuisinart food processors as though they are new items and feel no obligation to stop doing so or to make it right with the customers they continue to mislead.Please know that instead of the 3 year warranty you are entitled on a new machine, you'll only have 90 days from purchase with these 2nd hand units. Amazon could care less about being honest with us as customers. There are many ways they could have tried to make it right (starting with disclosing their error on the product page!), but instead they continue to mislead folks into thinking they're buying new machines.
