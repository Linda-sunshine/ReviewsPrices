review/summary: OK productreview/text: This is my 3rd dehydrator and is the best I've owned. I've used it a lot over the past two years for almost everything.Does decent job in decent amount of time and is easy to use and store. If you use all trays you need to move trays around to dry everything evenly plus items on outside do dry a bit faster. Small grid pattern holds even small pieces nicely. Easy to clean by setting trays in sink with water for a few minutes than rinse.
