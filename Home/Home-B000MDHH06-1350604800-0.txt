review/summary: Love itreview/text: This turned out to be a great juicer. Easy to use, easy to clean, and is simply a quality product. The only reason that I didn't give this product 5 stars is that the pulp left in the filter can be pretty damp, but I usually run it through again to get the most out of it. It is not really much of an inconvienience, but and inconvienience none the less.
