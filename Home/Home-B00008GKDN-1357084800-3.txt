review/summary: Excellent griddlereview/text: The cast iron griddle, heavy and nice is very good. Tried making pancakes, and Indian crepes. (dosa, adai). It comes out crisp and tasty. I am using on glass stovetops and no issues. The handle becomes very hot and you have to be extremely careful not to lift after cooking. Should leave for 30 min or use kitchen towels to lift and keep it aside. I have loaded couple of pictures with dosa making on them in the picture section of the product.
