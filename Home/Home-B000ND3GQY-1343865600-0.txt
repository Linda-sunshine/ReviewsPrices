review/summary: The Perfect Wokreview/text: This wok is the best one I've ever owned (and I've owned many). I love how big it is (yet it still fits into my cabinets), the handles (riveted handle on one end and helper handle on other) that never get hot, the clear lid so I can always check the status of what I'm cooking, and even at high heats nothing sticks to it! I can't believe how much less oil I have to use as well. This wok has far surpassed my expectations, if you're on the fence about it-PURCHASE, you won't be sorry!
