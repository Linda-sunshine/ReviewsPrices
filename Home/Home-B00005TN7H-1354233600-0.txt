review/summary: Works like a charmreview/text: So there is not much you can say about this product other than it does what it is supposed to do - it seals jars. But I did want to clear a few things up that I don't know is clear when it comes to using this device.For one thing, if you go to the Foodsaver web site they mention you need some special lid to seal mason jars. I did a lot of searching but could not confirm this. Yet in the description for this device it states you can use it with the wide mouth mason jars. Well I used it with the 1/2 gallon Ball wide mouth mason jars with no problem. So hopefully that will clear things up for some folks.Also, I use this with the FoodSaver V2244 Advanced Design Vacuum Sealer which I also purchased on Amazon. The two work well together. One thing that was not clear in either description, was if you got the required hose. Couldn't confirm this on the FoodSaver site either. It does not come with this device, but it does come with the vacuum sealer. You would think the description would say "hose sold separately" or something to that effect. Even on the FoodSaver site there is no mention of the hose being provided or not. So I purchased one just to be safe and did not need it. I guess I have a spare!!Anyway, this works well as it should.
