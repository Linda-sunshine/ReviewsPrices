review/summary: Awesomereview/text: This was a christmas gift and i wasn't too sure which one to buy because there are so many different manufacturer's that make the same type of hot popper, but after reading several reviews i went with this one, and i have to say we have used it almost everyday since christmas, and it works fantastically. No greasy mess to clean up, and is very quick to pop the popcorn. Great gift idea, and the manufacturer is the best. I would suggest buying this specific one if you are in the need of a good gift idea.
