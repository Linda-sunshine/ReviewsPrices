review/summary: 1983W is FLIMSY, CHEAPLY MADE, JUNK!!!review/text: First, there is no way the product pictured is the same one sent. The picture shows the rack neatly level with the shelf. The product I received SAGs to an alarming degree. So much so that you would have to put something under the back to prop it up, or you would have to tack it to the underside of your shelf.Second, the positive reviews have to be either shill reviews, or for similar products. The garbage I purchased is "Under Shelf Wrap Rack in WHITE model 1983W from Organize It All." It isn't sturdy, and as mentioned above, without support, you aren't getting anything under the rack, so it isn't saving any space.I bought a competing 'Rubbermaid' branded product at my local WalMart that is just fine, so it's not the concept, it's the second rate material used here.Save your money!
