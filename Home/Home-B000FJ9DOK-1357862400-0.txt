review/summary: Good quality bottlereview/text: Great bottle. It's of high quality. Its easy to wash. The other bottle that I have has a lid that has many parts in it and I can't clean up with a brush some of the hidden parts. This one doesn't have any such thing. I mainly use it for keeping warm water for drinking. It stays warm for many hours but not long enough for me (I expected it to keep the water warm for 12 hours), May be I'm asking too much!
