review/summary: Very very satisfiedreview/text: I am very happy with this purchase. I initially used it to heat water quickly for thawing frozen breastmilk. Now I use it regularly for preparing tea. The kettle boils water perfectly and does it really fast. I have had it for almost 2 years and used it almost every single day. I have never been disappointed.Also it is one of the most good-looking appliances sitting on my kitchen counter :)
