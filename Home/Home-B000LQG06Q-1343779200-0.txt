review/summary: Memory Foam Mattress Topperreview/text: I have had back surgery a few years ago, and currently have rheumatoid arthritis. I have a full size memory foam mattress I purchased about 8 years ago. Recently I began waking up with aching in my lower back, and just a general feeling of achiness. I chalked it up to my health problems, but decided it couln't hurt to try this mattress topper. I am so glad I did! My back no longer aches when I get up in the morning. Don't know how much the mattress you put this on top of matters, but it did the trick for me. I am pleased with my purchase. Oh, and it does smell like mint chocolate chip ice cream! lol! The smell does fade...I have had the mattress a few weeks and only faintly smell the minty smell now.
