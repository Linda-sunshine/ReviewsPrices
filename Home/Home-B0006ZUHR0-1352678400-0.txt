review/summary: It works well...but leaks water!review/text: Its one of the best iron machine we have owned. Missus was very happy for the one month it lasted...then it started leaking water.I was out of the Amazon return policy...so had to call the B&D; warranty. They offered to replace this with D1500 - they said its the same just looks different. But the catch is they will send it 14 business days after receipt of proof of purchase, an essay on whats wrong with the item (though i told it to them on the phone) and a piece of D2030.So i wont have an iron machine for 1 month!
