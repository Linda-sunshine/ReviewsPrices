review/summary: Wife loves it!review/text: Bought it for wife, she loves it. She uses a hand mixer previously but with this stand mixer, her cake texture is noticeably better and fluffier. As an example, her Japanese cheese cake hardly &#34;sink&#34; after after coming out of the oven.Saves her quite a bit of time too.Good solid build quality.
