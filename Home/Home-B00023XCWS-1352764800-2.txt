review/summary: Workhorsereview/text: I travel about 110 days a year in the continental US with a band, and I like to brew my own coffee in the room every day. I have an indestructable coffee press, my coffee of choice, and this little item. I've had it for about 3 years, and it lives in my suitcase. That might not seem like a big deal, but with the idiots that I travel with, they are NOT gentle on bags or belongings. Not exactly like airline monkeys, but... I initially lost the cable quickly, but you can use a standard IEC cable (computer power cable), which fits easily (I use a very heavy duty, thick one which I roll up a bit) inside the kettle. This thing boils water extremely quick, and I don't a weird plastic taste (don't think I ever did). I pack my suitcase REALLY tight (since I have to be gone for a month at a time, and I don't use a monster suitcase), and this rides right next to the unbreakable coffee press. I was a bit (and still am) worried that at one point the switch to turn it on and off would snap, but it's holding strong. It takes longer to press coffee and rinse out the press that it takes for this to boil by far. I usually do .5 liters (for myself), and it is extremely low maintenance. It has paid for itself hundreds of times over (by me avoiding high end mud). I would DEFINITELY buy another if mine took a dive, no question.
