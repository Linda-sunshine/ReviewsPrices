review/summary: good value good product and new lid handle is now oven safe!review/text: Bought this an affordable alternative to the le creuset. I made jamie oliver's roasted milk chicken and it came out great. Used it on the stove top and oven and it performed well. It comes with a metal lid knob now so it's safe in the oven. Just remember to use good oven mits because it is heavy and gets super hot.
