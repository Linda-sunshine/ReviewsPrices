review/summary: Great for birdsreview/text: We bought this to help deal with the cockatiel dust. It sits near their cage and sucks in all their fine dust and downy feathers. I was worried that the sound would bother them but it seems to be ok. There is a soft whirring but I expected the noise so it's acceptable. Will check back in a few months after a few filter cleanings. But I have good expectations.
