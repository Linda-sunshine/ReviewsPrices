review/summary: Bad quality and poor customer service at Nescoreview/text: I was given this dehydrator as a gift, within a year of receiving it the dehydrator broke. Fortunately it was just barely under warranty and Nesco sent me another head. Unfortunately the new one only lasted 2.5 uses. Now Nesco tells me that one is not covered by warranty and I should just buy another head for $40. But why would I put more money into a product that has proven to be of poor quality?I have called Nesco twice, to no avail. The first time I called they suggested I write them a letter, a physical USPS letter in complaint, as if that will help. I wrote it and then promptly called back. Again the CSR was not helpful, I asked to talk to a manager and, big surprise, got a voicemail.I am very frustrated as I bought all the accessories, have 11 trays, and fruit leather sheets, etc. I will not buy another unit from them but do not want to start from scratch.I have never had such poor customer service, usually a company that cares about their reputation and product quality will work with you when there is an obvious problem with their product.
