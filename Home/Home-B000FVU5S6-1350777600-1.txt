review/summary: So Longreview/text: I just received these sheets and I am so impressed. They have a wide hem at the top and when I fold the top hem all the way back I still had about 2 feet of sheet left to tuck under the mattress; and I have a pillow top mattress. They feel nice and do have a slight sheen to them. I am buying another set.
