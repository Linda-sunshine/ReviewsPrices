review/summary: great deal!review/text: i have chronic neck issues, so i needed a vacuum that would not hurt my neck. it is heavier than i expected...but this is due to a powerful motor. it works great on carpet and tile. i'm not able to use it on rugs for some reason. other than that, it is powerful, cleans well, and relatively easy to maneuver.
