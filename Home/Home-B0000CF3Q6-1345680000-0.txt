review/summary: One snazzy coffee potreview/text: I'm pretty happy with my Moka pot. I am having trouble believing that it is 3 cups though! Maybe more like 1.5 cups... While it's not genuine espresso, it brews a pretty mean cup of coffee. Very smooth and quite strong. And I feel really cool and Euro-chic whenever I use it.
