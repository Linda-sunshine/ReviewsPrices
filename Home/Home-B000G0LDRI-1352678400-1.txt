review/summary: Effective - but can be noisyreview/text: First, the good - this is a very effective humidifier. Keeps humidity at 48 to 52% in our 2000 square foot house - something our furnace mount units have been unable to do in freezing weather.All evaporative type humidifier with fans have fan noise. There can be a humming noise in addition to the expected sound of the fan from this unit. The hum seems to be due to vibration of the parts particularly the water tanks against each other. We found the same thing with the original unit we received and returned, and with the replacement unit. We also found that we can minimize and almost eliminate the hum by adjusting the position of the water tanks in the base - or simply letting the unit run on high for a while (notable fan sound on high) which seems to allow the tanks to "settle" into a position where there is minimal hum.Does a good job - yes, we need to fill the tanks twice a day in cold weather but that's expected as the unit is effectively adding moisture to the air.
