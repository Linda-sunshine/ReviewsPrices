review/summary: almost worksreview/text: so i was trying really hard to be optimistic about this even though my husband hated it the second he touched it, but it really does not work that well. first, going by another users pictures i think i got the slightly cheaper one even thought i paid for the nice one, the spikes shredded the zucchini so i kept having to slice the back off and try again. it did not really spiral. it seams like it sits up to high because as things went through the blade they would spiral up to the top and break so they were then just weird rounded slices. i bought the progressive international hgt-11 folding mandoline and even though it does not spiral it makes really thin jullian slices so you can still use them as noodles they are just straight not spirals, not as fun but much easier and i only have to keep one thing in my kitchen.
