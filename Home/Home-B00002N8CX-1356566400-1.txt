review/summary: Eureka 3670G Mighty Mite Canister Vacuumreview/text: Great light vac for quick clean up around the house. I use it as my only vac. It serves the purpose of a larger upright or cannister. Very strong suction, easy to navigate, light to lift and does as good a job on getting up my three dog's hair from the couch or rug as a larger more expensive vacuum. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the connecction between extension parts connected to tool sometimes comes apart and has to be reconnected while working. One also had to manually adjust the opening for suction strength to adjust to surface being cleaned, but this is easy as the adjustment is right next to your hand and can be done without interrupting cleaning. This adjustment is easy and comes naturally after a bit of practice.This vac is perfect for an apt or for a larger house. It works great on my wood floors, Persian rugs, and brocade curtains. The bags are also easy to change and to find and are cheap (I order mine in bulk from Amazon).
