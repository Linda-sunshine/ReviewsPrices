review/summary: Excellent Coffee Makerreview/text: My family Enjoys coffee, with a capital "E." While we use a French press on a daily basis, it's small. So, when company comes or when we have an early morning planned (thank you timer!), we pull out our Zijirushi EC-BD15BA. It brews rick, dark coffee and keeps it warm for hours in the insulated carafe. When we have to be at an early swim meet, we set the timer to have the coffee ready, and then we just take the whole pot with us for refills throughout the morning.I would highly recommend the Zijirushi EC-BD15BA for anyone who wants a drip maker but expects good results.
