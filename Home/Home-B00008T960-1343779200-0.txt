review/summary: Silpatreview/text: Nice silicon pad fits perfectly inside my half size cookie sheet. Now I don't have to use oil or grease to keep things from sticking. This also helps prevent burnt bottoms since it absorbs some of the heat and disperses it evenly. It's pretty and it's made in France as it proudly states on the bottom edge so what more could you want? This is the best known of the silicon pads out there. It's sort of a status item for the kitchen. It's thick and substantial and goes in the dishwasher if you want it to. I'm very pleased with this and will be ordering a second one.
