review/summary: One Pitfall-review/text: Nice can opener- couple of features- knife sharpener, bottle opener,and certainly tall enough for almost any can. I really really wish the tops of the cans didn't get overtaken with can contents. Even with magnet the cut lid becomes drenched in contents, before one is able to remove the cut metal top. Making it a must to wash the can top BEFORE use.I believe, manufacturing this can opener with the ability to keep the integrity of the can's contents free from the metal top falling in, would be a better and safer design. I would have preferred and paid a bit more for the machine with that single feature rather, than with multiple options. I don't need a bottle opener or a knife sharpener.Weight of this unit significant enough as to not make the weight of a heavy can an issue. I purchased the Metallic finish which is very nice, and looks sharp
