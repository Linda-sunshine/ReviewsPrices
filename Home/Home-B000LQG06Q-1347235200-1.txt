review/summary: Just as expected:)review/text: The memory foam mattress has definitely helped me sleep better at night. I decided to buy one after looking at new mattresses and refusing to pay $400-600 for a (cheap) mattress set. Instead I bought a mattress encasement, a memory foam topper, and a used $100 bed set from craiglist. Saved $100s of dollars and have nice comfortable nights. I do agree that it did smell like chocolate mint, but I aired it out a bit before placing it on the bed. But I absolutely love this bed topper!!
