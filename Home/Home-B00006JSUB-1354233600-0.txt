review/summary: Love, love, love!review/text: I use this skillet way more than anything else in my well-supplied kitchen arsenal. It's extremely versatile and cooks very nicely and evenly. For me, the benefit of cast iron is that it holds and distributed heat evenly. People have different approaches to cleaning cast iron - I personally use a brush and soap and water and just re-season the pan every so often. I personally put my pan back on the burner to dry it after washing to avoid rust. The price of Lodge cast iron can't be beat, but the low price doesn't mean compromised quality. I personally find the 12 inch size to be perfect for regular use as well, although I wouldn't mind a few in other sizes as well.
