review/summary: 2nd onereview/text: This steamvac is our second one. The first had a part that mysteriously went missing when we loaned it out. So. we bought a 2nd one and this one is just as good as the first. Cleans up great. We have 3 dogs and two kids and sometimes the carpets get messy. This cleaner does a great job cleaning up all types of stains. I recommend this cleaner to anyone that is looking for a resaonably priced carpet cleaner.
