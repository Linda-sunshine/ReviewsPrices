review/summary: questionable QCreview/text: I bought 3 jugs. Two jugs are normal. The 3rd one's handle is bent. The space between its handle and the jug body is much tighter. My fingers can barely slip through the openning to hold the handle. The product should not pass the manufacturer's QC check.
