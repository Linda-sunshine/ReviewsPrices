review/summary: Just what i wantedreview/text: I shopped for quite a while for a pressure canner to take to the beach this fall to can fresh-from-the-boat albacore. The friend that usually comes and brings one wasn't coming this year. I bought a Presto brand one from a local store but the directions said it could not be used on an open flame (!)and it was made in China, so it went back to the store. This was the best price I could find for this product. It arrived quickly and we took it to the beach and canned 90 jars of tuna. It performed perfectly, kept a steady pressure for the full 90 minutes that each batch required. I also like that it was made in the USA and has no rubber seal that would need to be replaced probably each year. It is just kinda expensive (over 3 times more than the Presto)for something that is only used a few times a year. I am happy that I bought it.
