review/summary: Buyer Beware: Amazon Bait & Switchreview/text: This order went wrong on so many levels I kind of can't believe it.I ordered the Honeywell air purifier (model HHT-011) specifically because it has the cleanable filters; a friend got one from Amazon & loves it. I ordered a new one, obviously, and the Amazon order page indicated the model is Prime eligible and fulfilled by Amazon via FedEx.So here's what I received (2 weeks after promised, sent not by Amazon but an Amazon seller, "Todays Concept"):A new USPS-delivered box (NOT FedEx) with an extremely damaged, banged up, punctured and repeatedly re-taped cardboard box inside it. Inside that old, beat-up box was a clearly USED Honeywell air purifier model HHT-016-MP (NOT what I ordered), wrapped in ripped plastic bags, including empty filter bags. The instruction manual says none of the filters are washable, one (the pre-filter) must be replaced every 3 months, the HEPA one every 6 months. No washable or permanent filters in this model that I didn't order! There is no original packaging apart from two ripped open, empty plastic bags that are supposed to contain pristine filters (though the size of the bags makes it look like they don't actually go with this model, too small).This is so far from what Amazon promised on the Honeywell HHT-011 description page that I don't even know what to say, except, hey, Todays (sic) Concept, I WILL NOT be paying return postage for this used piece o' drekk, nor will I be paying your "restocking fee."I do look forward to Amazon getting their act together and sending me what I actually ordered and paid for.
