review/summary: Better Than Expectedreview/text: After the first washing, these sheets were soft and very comfy. They fit our pillow-top mattress perfectly with no riding up. My husband is 6' 6&#34; and this big guy plays hell with the sheets at night, but these stand up to his movements very well. I'm not sure what the one reviewer was talking about saying these sheets are heavily starched because they are not starched at all. Yes, they have the normal sort of stiff feel of all brand new fabrics that haven't been washed yet, but that was all. I can't imagine a manufacturer putting newly woven fabric through a starching process anyway. I will order another set of these sheets...
