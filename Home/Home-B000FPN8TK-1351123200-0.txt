review/summary: Easy to use and cleanreview/text: This is very easy to use and clean. I bought the 32oz version. Based on the video review I saw featured, I thought the filter would be removable, but it isn't. I was also expecting a little tray to set it on, but I didn't get one of those either. That aside, it kept the tea really warm, and it was easy to rinse out afterwards. The only issue I have with it is if you are putting it in a cup smaller than the amount of water you have, you can't see how full the cup is without having to keep lifting it up to see if it's full yet :)
