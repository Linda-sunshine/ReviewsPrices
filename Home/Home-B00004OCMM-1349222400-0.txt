review/summary: oxo can openerreview/text: I have had to buy 2 new can openers in the last 6 months---mainly because of absolutely inferior design, construction and workmanship. The OXO is the second of them. I open just regular cans---this piece of junk was stiff and difficult from day one ---it would leave a razor-sharp burr in the rim of the can at the end of the cut that would draw blood when you touch it ---without exception, on EVERY can. After 2 months the twist-handle stripped and the unit became worthless. My OXO does not look like the OXO in the pic---I probably got some Chinese garbage knock-off--who knows? Disgusted and a waste of money. Give me a !@#$%^& American made can opener from the 70's ANY day!
