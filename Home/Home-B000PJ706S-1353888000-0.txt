review/summary: Average Life Span Equals Nine Monthsreview/text: I've had two of these now, and both failed between six and nine months with light use. I'm not a tea drinker, so I use this to boil water for various cooking tasks and nothing else. I'd say I use it 2-3 times per month, on average. (More when on a baking binge, like around the holidays.)My first unit lasted almost exactly a year, before dying. Working one day and the next, nothing. No light, no nothing. Everything looked fine, and it worked perfectly in its last use (probably 2-3 weeks prior), but it suddenly wouldn't turn on at all. I tried various plugs and seating/re-seating the kettle on the base, all to no avail. It was simply and completely dead.The unit is supposed to have a one-year warranty, per Capresso, but I contacted them via both phone and email repeatedly and heard nothing back.I hoped it was a fluke and bought another, despite my reluctance, since after further research it still seemed the best, most cost effective option for my needs. The second made it only six months before quitting. This time the light still worked on the handle, but water never boiled. (An experience I see repeated in several reviews here.) In both cases Capresso customer service was completely unresponsive through multiple contact attempts/methods.This time I decided to go for aBreville BKE820XL Variable-Temperature 1.8-Liter Kettleand am crossing my fingers that the extra cost will equal greater reliability.UPDATE: After I posted this review I finally heard back from Capresso. They acknowledged my unit was in warranty--after having me send several receipts and documentation--and offered me a "warranty replacement" for $35 plus shipping and handling. Huh? How is that a "warranty" when the end result is roughly a $10 coupon off a new unit. Just terrible quality and service!
