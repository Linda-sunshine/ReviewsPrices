review/summary: good but not fabulousreview/text: It cleans fine, and leaves carpets relatively dry afterwards which speeds up drying time. On the negative side, it didn't do as great a job on high traffic areas or "fluff" up imprints left by sofa legs and other heavy items as well as I would have liked. Overall I like the steam cleaner but it is not the answer to all rug stains. Also, unlike other machines, it mixes the soap directly in the chamber with the water so that you can never "wash" then "rinse" an area without first dumping out the soapy water and going over the rug with clean water in the chamber for a second time.
