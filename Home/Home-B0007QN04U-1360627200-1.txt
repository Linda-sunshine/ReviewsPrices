review/summary: Missing almost everything!review/text: I ordered this because it was a bit bigger than the standard 4.5qt and 5qt. and I do a lot of baking, so I thought the bigger one would be better.I got it pretty fast, but when I opened the box everything was missing or damaged. I think this might have been a return that was then sold to me as new!There was no paddle, no dough hook, and no pour shield! All it had was the whip. Then on further inspection the tabs on both the bowl and the mixer were bent out of shape so the bowl would not attach at all. It was not even close to lining up.I contacted Amazon to return it and then tried to re-order the same color. Now the color I wanted is a lot more than it was a few days ago and no longer Prime, so I was forced to either order another color and pay more or order the smaller version. I decided on the smaller version (which still does not come in the color I wanted). Not very happy at all.
