review/summary: not what it used to be! A different product.review/text: I bought my first mattress topper with the same exact product number on Amazon a couple of years ago. Then I bought another one just recently. These are 2 different products!!! The older one is the same thickness but made of a much denser material, i.e. substantially better. The new one is still not terrible and it became about $20 cheaper.
