review/summary: Still going!review/text: I still use it all the time. Aside from a few war wounds that I inflicted, it might as well be right out of the box. I run it through the dishwasher (not the top part) and have had no warping at all. We just ran out of jerky a couple days ago, so it is time to get this guy back out and make more.
