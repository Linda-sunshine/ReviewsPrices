review/summary: GREAT Product. Super powerfulreview/text: I chose the SmartStick instead of a blender because counter space is at a minimum in my kitchen and because I have the cuisinart hand mixer in the same color. I wasn't the first to use it BUT when my boyfriend used it to make a milkshake, he immediately fell in love with it's ability to get through ice cubes. It didn't even make the loud noises that regular blenders use when it hits the ice! We LOVE this stick! It's REALLY easy to clean, the cord is the perfect length (not too short that I need to stand next to a wall, not too long that I trip over the cord). It feels nice and study in my hands (I have small hands and I was worried that it wouldn't be comfortable to hold). Lastly, this little mixer makes this neat suction to the cup that it's in, which was neat. I can't think of a thing that this product is missing!
