review/summary: Best Bread Everreview/text: One of the best purchases I have made in a long time, the bread cooks perfectly and tastes delicious. I like the many options the machine has and the fact that it is progammable for up to 13 hours ahead. Nothing better than waking up to the smell of fresh baked bread. I made the spicy cheese loaf recipe that came with the machine and took some slices in to work for co-workers to sample. So far 2 of them have gone ahead and ordered the machine just on that taste alone. I also made the french bread which was perfectly cooked in the center and had a lovely golden brown cripsy crust, my husband loved it. I don't often write reviews but am just so pleased with this product.
