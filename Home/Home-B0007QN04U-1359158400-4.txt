review/summary: I should have bought one of these years ago...review/text: This was my thirty birthday present to myself and I should have gotten it sooner. I've not made bread with it or used any of the accessory attachments, so I can't rate it for that. In the past year it works well for all my cookies and cakes and egg whites. I don't have any problems with it dancing across the counter or flinging flour into the air. Mine was aligned properly from the factory and the only time I had the beater hit the side of the bowl was because I didn't have the bowl proper seated on the mixer. And I prefer that the Professional Series raises and lowers the bowl instead of using a tilting head.
