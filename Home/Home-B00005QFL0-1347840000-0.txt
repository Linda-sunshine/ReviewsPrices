review/summary: Very good with a flawreview/text: I replaced a Sunbeam breadmaker with a new Panasonic based on reviews and customer recommendations. The Panasonic made a great loaf of bread. It took longer than the Sunbeam and to me that was not a major concern. The feature I don't like is the yeast dispenser set in the lid of the machine. When I poured the yeast in, the opening was small and yeast went all over the place. With all oher machines I have owned, you pour the yeast directly into the machine on top of the other ingredients. I spent a lot of time getting the yeast out of nooks and crannies to be sure I had it all so the bread would rise. Maybe with practice, I will get the hang of it, but if I don't, I would not recommend this machine even though it made a great loaf of bread.
