review/summary: Awesomereview/text: Bought this for my wife for Christmas. She loves taking baths and usually uses small washcloths to plug up the hole. When she opened her present she was confused to what it was. When she found out what it was she was so happy. When she used it she was so impressed with it that she screamed for me to come and see how it worked. She also forced me to take a bath that night and to use it. When I used it I realized what she meant. This item is awesome. It does exactly what It's supposed to!
