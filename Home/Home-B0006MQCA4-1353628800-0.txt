review/summary: Exactly what I wantedreview/text: When I went looking for something to refill bottles and get filtered drinking water from, this was exactly what I was looking for. It got here, and after a couple of months of use, I'm still very happy with it.I was worried that I would get spillage from filling small-mouthed water bottles, but there's actually a ring-thing under the tap that fits normal sized water bottles perfectly so that there's no problems at all.The other thing that's nice is that the reservoir and the tap are large enough that the pressure is good. There's no waiting around on the bottle to fill with a trickle.I would definitely buy this dispenser again.
