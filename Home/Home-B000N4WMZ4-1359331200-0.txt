review/summary: Almost as good as the a foreign competitorreview/text: I do love my Lodge Dutch Oven. It's great for going from fridge to stove to oven. The only thing that kept it from getting a perfect score was the enamel on the rims of the lid and top of the pot. I have been very careful with mine, no metal utensils, no banging, but still, in these areas, the enamel has already chipped off in places. The cooking surface is great, and does a great job keeping an even heating surface. It is too heavy for the dishwasher, but is easy to clean in the sink, and the heft of it is what makes it so great at conveying heat. If Lodge ever refines it's enamel process, then they would really give their foreign competition a run for the money.
