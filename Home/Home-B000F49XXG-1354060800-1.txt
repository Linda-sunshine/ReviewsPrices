review/summary: Too complicatedreview/text: This espresso and cappuccino maker may make excellent coffee etc. but I never got beyond the instructions. They made preparation sound like a project which would not work in the am when I'm short of time getting ready for work. What led me to return the item was the cleaning instructions which involved unscrewing parts with a screw driver.
