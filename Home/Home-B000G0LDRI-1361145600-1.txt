review/summary: Excellent for the pricereview/text: It's a humidifier. It's easy to assemble, it's easy to use. Does its job with no muss, no fuss. I couldn't believe how quickly it put moisture into the air bringing it back to breathable. I am seriously considering buying another for a different part of the house.
