review/summary: Simple, Functionalreview/text: Pros- Highly functional- Great value- Automatically adjusts for daylight savings time and keeps the time when power is out. (has battery in it)- Radio gets good reception and volume. Important to note however that the frequency adjustment is manual (in case you couldn't tell from the picture)- Simple and intuitive- Seems very well made - no flimsy buttons or knobs- Long power cord- Not too brightCons- Numbers are a little small - I wear corrective lenses and I can't read it from the foot of my bed without my glasses on.- Unable to adjust the snooze-button time. Comes automatically set to 10, then 20, then 30 minutes, and so on for each consecutive hit. If you like to snooze, this is not the alarm clock for you.- Battery is a type I have not seen before. Not sure how difficult or expensive it will be to replace when (or if) it goes out.
