review/summary: Sleep studio memory foam 3 inchreview/text: The mattress came wrapped up in a tight roll, king size was very heavy carrying upstairs. I unwrap the padded nd immediately it started to take its shape. I left it along for a few hours. The was a very mild hint of mint which wasn't so bad at first because I like the mint however 4 nights in the mint smell was over powering, my whole bed set including pillows stuck of mint and so did we. We torn everything off again and I pretty much soaked it with gain frefreeze. I hope it helps.As far as the comforter, my husband likes a 2 in but I like the 4 in so we went in the middle and went a 3 In. It is very comfortable butthead pad isnt as cool as it is described. The last few nights has been very hot but maybe as it wears in and winter coming it will all workout!
