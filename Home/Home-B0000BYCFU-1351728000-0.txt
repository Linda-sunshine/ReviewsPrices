review/summary: Presto 23-Quart Pressure Cannerreview/text: After reading tons of reviews on pressure canners, this is the canner I chose. Presto did a great job at packaging, nothing moved around during shipping. Pressure gauge seems good quality, canner seems built very well. As soon as I took it out of the box I canned 4 quarts of leftover beef stew, Worked Great! Love it!
