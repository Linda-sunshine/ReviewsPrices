review/summary: GRRRRRRRREAT Coffee!!review/text: I've been using a French press for several years since my Spidem super-auto espresso machine bit the dust. Although I missed the taste of strong, sweet, black espresso that came from the Spidem, I didn't want to spend $600+ dollars for a new machine. So i finally decided to try the Moka Express and, after a few experimental brews, it is now giving me that great espresso flavor I've been missing, and for less than $30. My mornings just got better.
