review/summary: Good at first....review/text: The machine was finnicky from day one where if the cap wasn't screwed on just right the coffee wouldn't go into the pot but would run over top of the filter tray. Well after a few pots we figured out that was the issue and were fine for a while.When you go to pour your coffee it comes out slow with the cap on and drips out of the top as you get down to the bottom. Course you can just pull the cap off, but then you've broken to seal that keeps it warm (IE the point of the thermal pot).We purchased this from Amazon 3/26/12, and for the last two months it intermittently leaks during the brew with no obvious sign of where it's coming from. We've taken to putting a tray under it (Actually, my 9 x 13 cake pan fits nicely.) just in case it leaks. And when I say leaks I mean half the pot or more is on my counter. On the bright side, it dripped under my stainless steel sink and alerted me that I needed to redo the caulking there (If you can call that a bright side!)Would not recommend. It had some issues from day one, but if less than a year in it's this bad I doubt we'll be using it by 3/26/13!
