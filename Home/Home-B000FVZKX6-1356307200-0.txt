review/summary: Fantastic Sheetsreview/text: If you buy these I am warning you now you will need to set your alarm clock an hour earlier then usual because you will not want to get out of bed! These sheets are the most comfortable things I've ever wrapped myself in and I never need to turn the baseboard heater on in my bedroom! I've had them for about a month and only washed them a few times so I can't speak for durability but they feel very well made and still appear new!
