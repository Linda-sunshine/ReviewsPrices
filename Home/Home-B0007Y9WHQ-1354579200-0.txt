review/summary: Need three hands to operatereview/text: I just got this product and used it once (on a sweet potato) so I may amend my review later.... but I can't figure out how to use it without at least one more hand: one to turn the slicing handle, one to push the pushing handle, and at least one more to keep the whole contraption from sliding across the counter on the totally ineffective suction cup feet. I finally braced it against the back-splash/wall to keep it from moving. Actually, I put down a square casserole dish to catch the curls, then shoved this up against it. That put the two handles in awkward positions, but at least it worked and I did get nice spiral curls.
