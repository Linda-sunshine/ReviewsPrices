review/summary: first-time bread maker, already a pro!review/text: I just bought this Panasonic bread machine for my husband's birthday. This is our first bread machine and already love it! The machine is so easy to use, I had it set up and cooking within an hour of opening the box, and our first (perfect) loaf came out a few hours later. I started with a basic white bread recipe, easy to make, and we are already talking about what we'll try next. I highly recommend this product to any bread lovers, it is fool proof and easy to use. It doesn't take too much space (we have a small 'kitchenette' and it fits on the counter between the sink and stove). Just be sure you place it on a good stable surface, they aren't kidding when they say it will move and vibrate during the kneading process. Came with an easy to understand instruction manual with some good recipe ideas too!
