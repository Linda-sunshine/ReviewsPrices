review/summary: Best stair vacuum!review/text: I have had this vacuum for almost a year now and I'm still as satisfied today as I was the day I received it. It works GREAT at picking up dog and cat hair from stairs and furniture. I also have a Dyson animal AND a Kirby and this little, inexpensive vacuum works better than either one of them! I highly recommend this vacuum to anyone with stairs or an animal that hangs out on the furniture. You wont be disappointed!
