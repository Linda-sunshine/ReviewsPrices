review/summary: Leaks at bottom. A lot.review/text: I like the sleek look of this kettle, unfortunately it leaks quite a bit. I've only had it for a few months and it's already covered in rust at the bottom from the leaking water. Looks a lot less sleek with rust. I can't imagine it's too safe either. I don't have the original packing slip so I can't return it, and I would have to pay for shipping. Seems like it should be replaced, with no charge to me, for a dangerous defective leaking kettle.
