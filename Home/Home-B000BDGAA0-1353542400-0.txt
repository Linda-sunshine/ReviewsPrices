review/summary: Hard Stuffreview/text: i have been using a memory foam pillow for a few years but tried these for a change of pace. My husband likes his... it stays firm so he can prop his head up to watch tv better. It is extremely stiff and I can not get comfy enough with this pillow to sleep. Looks fluffy by photo but this is not a fluffy, cuddly type of pillow. I toss it to the ground every night... and use my old memory foam pillow. Right after getting the pillows my daughter quickly jumped on the bed to swoosh her head on the pillow and actually said... ouch.. lol
