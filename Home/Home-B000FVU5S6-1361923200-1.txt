review/summary: Very satisfied with these sheetsreview/text: These sheets exceeded my expectations. They are thick with beautiful stitching. I took them out of the dryer and they are hardly wrinkled at all. I will be buying more for other beds. I bought two sets this time. They are so much better than some I bought ecently that come out of the dryer looking like scrunched up tissue paper. In addition, these are remarkably soft due to the sateen finish. I personally like 400 tread count Eqyptian cotton sheets the best. Someone told me to buy sateen for added softness, and they were right.
