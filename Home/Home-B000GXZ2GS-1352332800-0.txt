review/summary: best pressreview/text: I buy whole beans within a couple days of being roasted and grind my beans right before I make coffee each morning. I had been using a french press that I thought was great coffee. The problem with the french press is they are so fragile and crack at the slightest contact with the faucet when rinsing them out. After researching for unbreakable presses I found and ordered the aeroPress. It is everything and more than I had hoped for. It is unbreakable, much less clean up than the french press, also no fine grounds in the bottom of the cup. I was suprised how much better the coffee tasted with the same beans. It is also the fastest at making fresh coffee. The water is only heated to 170, The beans are ground very fine and the water is only in contact with the grind for 30 seconds at the most so there is no bitterness. This press is also very compact and will be part of all future motorcycling camping trips.
