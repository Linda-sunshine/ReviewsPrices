review/summary: Great baking toolreview/text: The Silpat non-stick baking mat is wonderful. It cleans off with just a quick soapy wipe down in warm water, dries quickly, and makes it so you don't have to line or spray your baking sheets. Cookies come off it really nicely, no fighting between the stuck cookie and the spatula. The only downside is that if it rips you need to replace it as silicone fibers could get into the food. But, it lasts a really long time. We've bought multiple, the oldest being almost 5 years old. We buy them as gifts for our baking friends, too, and they love them.
