review/summary: Bad product!review/text: Used to love it! But recently, their filters start blocking already in weeks (even 2-3!). I changed them, and they still do not filter water, except extremely slow, or not at all.Had to change to Britta! Their containers are not that well designed, but the filters do work! Moreover, Pur is not everywhere, Britta is!Sorry!
