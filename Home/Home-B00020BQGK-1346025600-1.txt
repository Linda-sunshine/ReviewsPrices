review/summary: The neat freak in me is delighted with this purchase!review/text: I am so happy I trusted the reviews and ordered this vacuum- it has exceeded my expectations and actually makes me excited to clean, even behind my couches! As soon as I adopted my cat I knew I needed a powerful, upright vacuum with more oomph than a handheld one to clean my entire floors and carpets.Pros: The best thing about this vacuum is that it's small enough that you can store it easily/it's lightweight/ready instantly, yet powerful enough to tackle all the rooms in my apartment. I put it together by myself in less than 10 minutes, and it was instantly ready to go: just plug it in! The cord is nice and long and has a hook so it can attach to itself when wound up. The first thing I noticed is how it turns/swivels almost by itself so its easier to get into corners, along the baseboards, and cover larger areas. I was amazed how well it picked up dust, sand, and gravel from the corners and baseboards. Switching from floor to carpet couldn't be easier, which is great because in my 1BR apartment there's not a ton of separation between where the floor ends and carpet begins (just flip the power switch one click for "Bare Floor" setting, and one more click for "Carpet." It's that easy). Emptying it was a breeze, just unsnap it, dump/shake it out, and pop it back in.Cons: Because of the awesome swivel action, it falls over if you lean it against the wall. I've figured out how to lean it just right so it doesn't come crashing down, but I wish it had a lock feature (or maybe it does and I just haven't figured it out?)
