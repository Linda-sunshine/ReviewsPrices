review/summary: Still pleased with this after 4 yearsreview/text: I bought this in 2008 and have used it continuously since then and have no complaints about its performance. The water tastes just fine, certainly an improvement on our tap water taste. We have very hard water here, but I notice little difference in the filter performance even towards the end of the recommended usage period. I confess I do not change it as often as recommended, probably because I don't notice much reduction in its performance.Easy to clean and I've never seen any mineral deposits in the main reservoir (occasionally some faint, easily washed-away deposit in the top), so I guess the filter is doing its job. I'm looking at buying a small 1-gal. humidifier that recommends using filtered water for hard water areas and I'm going to try using my PUR-filtered water.
