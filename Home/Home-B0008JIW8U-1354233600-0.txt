review/summary: Worked well for a few months, now it burns the coffeereview/text: This thing worked well when it was new. About 3 months in, despite keeping it clean, the coffee started tasting burnt and overly bitter even using quality beans. Tried using the Mr. Coffee cleaner and it made it a little better, but it's still no where near new. The issue appears to be that the water simply overheats and burns the coffee. All in all, this thing is good for 2-3 months, after that it's a piece of junk and ruins good coffee.
