review/summary: humidifierreview/text: Good unit! The only thing was I thought it would be larger in size. It has a 9 gallon output but thats for a whole day. The unit holds only 3.5 gallons so one has to fill more often. That could be a good thing if you have a hard time lifting larger containers of water.
