review/summary: just so soreview/text: I didn't buy these for the Senseo machine. They worked OK they just didn't hold enough coffee to make a strong cup, in my opinion. They were easy to use and easy to clean. I found that by using junior size coffee filters I could make my own "pods" and make coffee to my preferred strength.
