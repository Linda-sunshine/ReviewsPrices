review/summary: One for every bedroomreview/text: We have 3 of these - one for each of our kids' bedrooms. I started using it when I had an infant and older kids in the house to help drown out noise during naps. Now all my kids love having background noise to sleep. It helps minimize waking from thunderstorms and windstorms too. Lots of choices for sounds. Crickets (summer night) and waterfall are favorites.
