review/summary: Too heavy and hard to use on stairsreview/text: I bought this vacuum after readiing reviews on amazon and it had a pretty good rating. Honestly, I am disappointed and can not recommend it to anyone. My purpose for this was to use on our carpetted stairs. I had just bought a Bissel powerforce compact vacuum from the store without first checking the reviews online and it was too heavy for me to use on the stairs. Guess what? This Hand-Held vacuum is just as impossible. The suction is great which earned one star from me. That's all I am impressed with. I tried vacuuming the stairs and it was too heavy to hold and maneouver. It didn't reach the little nooks. I thought it was just me. I didn't mention anything to my husband about it but he had used it on the stairs and had the same complaint. If I can return it I will.
