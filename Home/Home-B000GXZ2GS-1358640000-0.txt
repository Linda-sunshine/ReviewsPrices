review/summary: Makes great coffeereview/text: This device makes beautiful coffee, I now much prefer it over my moka pot or French press. I use it with the inverted brew method and the stainless s-filter. No grounds ever make it through the filter and the coffee has a sweetness that I haven't tasted in any other coffee. It's also very quick and easy, including clean up. I have time for one every morning no matter what.
