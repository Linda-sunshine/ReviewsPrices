review/summary: Great Juicerreview/text: I just finished a 10 day juice cleanse, where I was juicing 4-5 times a day. It's still working perfectly and I've had no problems. It's easy to clean, I love that it comes with a scrubber brush for the strainer, and putting a plastic bag in the pulp catcher was a great suggestion that actually was in the manual and made clean up much easier. No need to spend a ton of money on an expensive one, this one is great and I highly recommend it!
