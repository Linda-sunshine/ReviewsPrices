review/summary: The best!review/text: I purchased these in September in preparation for flannel sheet weather arriving in Wyoming. I've purchased a number of brands of flannel sheets over the years, and these are the best. They wash and dry quite nicely and haven't shown any pilling. I'll be purchasing more of these sheets!
