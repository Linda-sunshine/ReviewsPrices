review/summary: Quality Can Openerreview/text: After reading numerous reviews on electric can openers I decided to go with this one. It's a quality machine that has 10 more watts of power than most can openers on the market. This was a give for my mom who has severe arthritus and she likes it very much. She's only used it a few times and has yet to try it on a very large can, but no complaints so far.
