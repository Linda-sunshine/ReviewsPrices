review/summary: Patience is a virtue....but who has time for that?review/text: My wife like tea so I bought this inexpensive hot pot to help eliminate all those hours of a gas burner at full power just to boil water. The first hot pot arrived with a broken hinge. With a few clicks of my mouse the replacement was on its way and the return slip was printed out (this is one of the reasons I LOVE AMAZON!) The replacement hot pot arrived and was quickly put to work. It will boil a full pot of water (1 liter) in about 6 1/2 minutes. The construction is all plastic other then the heating element. I don't expect this to last forever but for the price you can't beat it.
