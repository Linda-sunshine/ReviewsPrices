review/summary: It works, but ...review/text: It works, but be prepared to see some pretty frightening results if you think your carpet (or rug) is basically clean. Easy to assemble and use. It is a little bit of a workout if you use it for three straight hours, but otherwise I have no complaints. It did extract a frightening amount of dirt from what I thought were basically clean rigs. After a little practice, I found that if you move relatively slowly (compared to a vacuum cleaner), it does a better job in getting the dirt out in a single pass over the rug. With a few passes of the suction only, it leaves rugs almost completely dry.
