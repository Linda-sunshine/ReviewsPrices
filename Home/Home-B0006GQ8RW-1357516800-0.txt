review/summary: Replacement Water Filterreview/text: You have to read the instructions and soak the product for 15 minutes before placing in Brita pitcher. At first, it didn't go in correctly no matter how many different times I tried. I got my old filter out of the trash and compared them to make sure I didn't purchase the wrong size or something. They looked identical, so I kept trying and eventually it clicked in. So, it's a bit of a pain, but be persistent.
