review/summary: Excellent Filterreview/text: I've had my water filtration system for 4 years and I go through about 2 filters per year. We use around 46oz per day and find that these filters last about 6 months each. The longer you have the filter the slower the water drains into the resevoir, but the taste remains the same. When I lived in Hawaii the tap water tasted like pure garbage and these helped me stay healthy without breaking the bank. I continue to be a repeat customer and have been satisfied with every purchase.
