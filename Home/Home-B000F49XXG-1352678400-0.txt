review/summary: Great machine, hard to use.review/text: Well, this little espresso machine works very well but the one piece of criticism unfortunately contradicts my reason for purchasing it. My lady friend sure loves coffee and espresso, figured I'd buy her it as a birthday gift, only problem is the attaching piece that holds the espresso ground that you "push up and turn counter-clockwise" to lock into the machine is INCREDIBLY HARD to turn. Not sure if this is supposed to be this way, but so difficult that I have to hold the machine down firmly and pull with a considerable effort to properly seat the handle.She can't do this on her on, and therefore she doesn't use the device. Bummer. Every other morning I make us both an espresso.
