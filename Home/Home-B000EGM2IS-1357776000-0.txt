review/summary: This thing is seriously amazing!review/text: This water dispenser is absolutely amazing! I bought this product so I can make tea, hot chocolate, and oatmeal QUICKLY in my dorm room. This is so much easier than using the microwave because the water gets so much hotter in way less time using the Sunbeam product. My only concern is the durability of the gray dispense button because it feels kind of flimsy when I push on it. However, it has yet to break or anything like that so I assume that the button is more durable than I originally thought. When I filled the water basin almost completely full, it only took the machine 1:45 seconds to boil and automatically shut off, which is much faster than my 700 watt microwave would have been.The automatic shut off is great! It turns itself off when ready to dispense which is good for people who may forget to turn it off. My only complaint was that the water basin was a little bit dusty so I had to run water through it a few times to clean it out before using the first time. This isn't a big deal at all though since I would have cleaned it anyway.
