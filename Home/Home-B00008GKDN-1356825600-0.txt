review/summary: Sturdy, as described, and greatreview/text: I bought this to make tortillas instead of a normal aluminum comal. This works like a charm. It heats evenly and stays warm longer and more easily than cheaper options. I also use this when camping for random concoctions and it works great. I recommend it.
