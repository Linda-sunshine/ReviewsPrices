review/summary: Weight fluctuated by 5 lbs variancereview/text: Given the high reviews on this scale, I was really looking forward to my purchase. The price was great and the scale itself looked nice enough.The first scale came to me with an pre-opened box. The seal tape on both side of the box were cut and the scale had fingerprint on it... feeling peeved by that I proceeded to test out the scale... it went down like this: without anything on it, the scale read 4.6 pounds. Also, it gave me the Error reading repeatedly. I'm thinking... ok considering the condition that this scale came to me as, it must be a refurbished unit or someone returned it because they had the same issues and Amazon resold it to me.So I requested a replacement unit.Second unit also came to me defective. Although this time I had high hopes because the box packaging looked fine. The seal were not cut and it did not appear that the unit had been previously opened. However, as I test out the unit same type of crap happened. My weight would vary by several pounds each time I step on, even with minutes apart.Dont know what happened with the 2 units I received but this scale was not accurate. After the replacement unit also failed to perform correctly, I asked for a refund.
