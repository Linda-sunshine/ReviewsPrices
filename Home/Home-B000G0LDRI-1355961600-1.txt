review/summary: Works but not easy to usereview/text: Not too long after getting this humidifier, I found it was awful to fill.The water compartment is rounded and does not sit well when filling.The plastic used is very this so because this, I've cracked it twice.The last time rendering it impossible to hold water.I would not reccomend this machine and will now goback to the Hunter Douglas models.
