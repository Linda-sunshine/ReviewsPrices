review/summary: Great short term coffee makerreview/text: My experience with this coffee maker is the same as many of the other reviews. We enjoyed great coffee for about a year, then the coffee maker would randomly turn off before the programed turn off time of 2 hours. Sometimes it would go off before it completed brewing, sometimes right after it finished brewing, and other times 10 minutes after brewing finished. I called customer service to be told I should decalcify and leave unplugged for 1 hour. I did this even though I always use the filtered water from our fridge to make coffee and the light to signal required cleaning never came on. It did not solve the problem, so when I called back the offer to replace the unit (I paid for shipping both ways) was made. I took it. Now, about 1 year later, same thing! Argh!!! Nothing worse than going for your coffee only to find it's cold!!! I called customer service again, informed them this was was my second unit. I was asked again to decalcify and leave unplugged for an hour, then to call back if this did not clear up the problem. I complied with high hopes that were dashed! Today we are searching for a new coffee maker - it WILL NOT BE A CUISINART!!!!!
