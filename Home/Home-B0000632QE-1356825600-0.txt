review/summary: Wobbly, dangerousreview/text: I tried to slice carrots and it was difficult to mount the carrots to the slider handle, the knife insert is very loose inside the V slot. The carrots kept falling off all the time.Then I tried slaw and it became a big mess, the cut pieces are inconsistent, the slider handle is too small to properly mount a good size piece. The knife insert is loose again and that makes it difficult to maintain a consistent sliding motion.I am disappointed.
