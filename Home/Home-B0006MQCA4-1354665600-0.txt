review/summary: This Water Dispenser is pretty effecient & carries a lot!review/text: I love this water dispenser bc it carries so much water. I don't want to refill a handheld water dispenser constantly bc that gets tiresome after the 10th time. It doesn't feel like a chore like a smaller dispenser would. I drink a lot of water in general, so I don't want to refill every day or so. This dispenser makes sure that I'm not doing that constantly since it holds 18 cups.I dropped it a couple times getting it out of the fridge. It chipped a little bit at the top of the blue part in the back, so I can't fill up as much water in that part at a time now (otherwise it'll just leak to the bottom without being filtered). That's my clumsiness for you. But, this dispenser is great and totally worth the buy. Highly recommend!
