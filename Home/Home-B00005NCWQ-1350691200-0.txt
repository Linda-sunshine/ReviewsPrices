review/summary: Nice looking, great capacityreview/text: If you appreciate a cup of perked coffee, this is a very handsome percolator that makes a nice amount of coffee. It's a nice, shiny stainless steel with a tight fitting lid. The perking assembly is separate from the top so you need to make sure it's centered well to fit the lid on properly. When the lid is fitted, it closes with an audible snap.The basket and assembly is well made and easy to clean.I use a gas stove, and this works beautiful on it. My only issue with it is the plastic dome. If you're a purist, you'll want to replace it with a glass dome. But that's easily enough done, and for the price, this is a gorgeous coffee maker!Nothing smells like coffee perking, and I love manual methods of coffee making. I still my electric drip pot most of the time because it's convenient, but when I want to just enjoy a cup of coffee, this makes a good cup.
