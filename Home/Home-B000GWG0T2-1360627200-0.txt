review/summary: Look. This is the best non-stick pan ever. I am not kidding.review/text: I'm just an ordinary person. I try to fry stuff and a lot of the time stuff sticks to the pan. Nothing. Ever. Sticks. To. This. Pan. I am doing it right now. I tried to fry sticky rice cakes -- the stickiest substance known to man -- in a very nice calphalon pan, and was saddened by the result. That pan is in the sink and this one is now on the stove and NOTHING STICKS TO IT. This is the second one I've owned (had to leave my first one behind when I moved.) I am buying a backup copy of this pan just in case they stop making it. Stop browsing for better options, just buy this one. You are done. This is the one.
