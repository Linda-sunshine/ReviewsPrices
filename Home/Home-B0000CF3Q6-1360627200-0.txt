review/summary: great design, functionreview/text: When growing up, my French mother made us a bit of espresso added to a lot of milk and this was her espresso maker. In college I got one that has finally gotten to the point of being loved to pieces. We got the 3 cup one and it's really neat. Very fast, about 5 minutes on about medium heat. Remember that you can essentially make any coffee bean or grind into 'espresso' by pulverizing the heck out of it in your bean grinder.
