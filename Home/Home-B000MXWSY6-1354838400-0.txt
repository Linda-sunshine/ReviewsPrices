review/summary: Average clock radioreview/text: It works fine, the radio is pretty weak and the old school radio dial makes finding stations difficult though fine tuning is better than digital tuners. the alarm is loud and the clock numbers easy to read. Dual alarms are very handy and entirely independent of each other. It does it's just but is merely an average clock radio.
