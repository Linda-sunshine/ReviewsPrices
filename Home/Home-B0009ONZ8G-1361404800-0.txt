review/summary: Best vacuum I've ever owned. Hands down.review/text: And the reason I say it's the best is because the suction is very powerful for a vacuum in this price range. With 3 dogs, we need this kind of suction. I owned a bagless vacuum before this one, and quite frankly I hated it. It never did a good job of vacuuming, heck it barely did an adequate job!All of that being said, I will admit I bought my Hoover Tempo several years ago from Amazon, so I do have the older version with the bag indicator and the headlight. Quite honestly, those features don't amount to a hill of beans for me. I never rely on the bag indicator. And how much does a vacuum cleaner headlight assist you while you are vacuuming? I mean, really??I still think this vacuum's top selling feature is the amazing suction power.As a side note, if you find you need replacement parts other than bags or belts for your Hoover Tempo, the best place I have found online is Vac Parts Warehouse. They are a com website - go to their About Us page and read all the customer testimonials about their service. I just ordered a new dust brush and hose for our Tempo -- the hose has a crack/kink and I don't think the suction is as good as it used to be. My dust brush bristles are smushed flat. The Vac Parts Warehouse has good prices, and really good break-out diagrams of the vacuums to help you order your parts.All in all, I would still recommend this vacuum, even if the newer version doesn't have a headlight or a bag indicator. If it still sucks debris as good as my older version does, then it's still a good vacuum. If the day comes that my vacuum totally dies, I would still reorder another one before I would spend hundreds on a Dyson or any other top name brand.
