review/summary: Perfect for the arizona weather.review/text: We love this item. It is a quick easy way to get the feel of a real fireplace with out all the hassel and all the mess, and all the heat that we dont need here in Arizona! There is no smell, no fumes, and it lasts about 3 hours perfect! Only draw back, the price went up!
