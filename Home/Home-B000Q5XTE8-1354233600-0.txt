review/summary: comfortablereview/text: This chair has held up well to daily use. We have had it for about 3 years. The only reason it gets four stars is that the armrest material is pretty soft and a small divot was sliced off the front edge of one of them. We glued it back on, but I was surprised it was damaged by the edge of the wooden desk. It is very comfortable.
