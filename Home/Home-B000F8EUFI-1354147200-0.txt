review/summary: Great Vacuum!review/text: I purchased this vacuum as a second vacuum for use in my downstairs family area. It has been a great vacuum with strong suction power, easy to use and lightweight too! Cleaning the dirt canister is very easy and cleaning the filter is also a simple task. I purchased two other filters to keep on hand when the current one needs to be replaced. I highly recommend this &#34;Dirt Devil&#34;. It lives up to its name......a devil on dirt......removal.
