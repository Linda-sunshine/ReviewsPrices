review/summary: Little Radio with a Big Mouth from Amazonreview/text: It took me about 20 minutes to set this radio up. I have not been disappointed. My family was, "very loudly" warned about the last storm we had in Jemison, Alabama, and we are "visually" notified every time a weekly test is performed; just as I programmed the radio to respond. I highly recommend the MIDLAND WR300 WEATHER RADIO which I purchased through www.amazon.com.
