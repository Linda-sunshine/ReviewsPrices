review/summary: Nice heavy flannel!review/text: These are the nicest flannel sheets I have ever bought. While I was a little apprehensive about other reviewers' claims about color fade, I have not had that problem. No shrinking, no pilling. The flannel is nice and heavy but also very soft. The first time I washed and dried them before use I did have a fair amount of lint in the lint trap, and cleaned the trap twice during that first dry time, but I noticed the second time I washed and dried them there wasn't near as much. I also have had no issue with flannel lint collecting under the blankets. Great sheets I would gladly buy again.
