review/summary: Cheap coffee maker that gets the job donereview/text: Cheaply made and feels cheap, but the cost is very cheap. You get what you pay for. That said, this does what it is supposed to do and does it well. The reusable filter is very handy. It's easy to clean and makes coffee pretty quick. I have no complaints. It is what I expected and works well for the price. Highly recommended for a single cup coffee maker.
