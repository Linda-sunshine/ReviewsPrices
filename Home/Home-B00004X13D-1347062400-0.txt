review/summary: Had this waffle maker for 12 years!review/text: I'm sure it would still be going strong had I not accidentally dropped it and cracked the outer shell- oops! Although it's nothing fancy, it's a work horse of a waffle maker and very reasonably priced. Would absolutely recommend! The only con is that it can be a pain to clean if you have any overflow, but so can most other waffle irons.
