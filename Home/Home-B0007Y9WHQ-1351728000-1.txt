review/summary: Low Qualityreview/text: First no instructions at all. So that must be why all the videos? No manual, booklet nothing save what was pictured on the outside of the box. Second, it was made of a very cheap grade of plastic. Next, the turning handle was very wiggly and just waiting to break. Yes, I had my engineer hubby look at it and he agreed cheap... There was a picture in another review of a broken handle during first use. I thought it was a fluke, there must have been two because had I used it very much more the same thing would have occurred. Next, you see those tiny teeth in the picture, well they don't hold anything well. Nothing I put through it was tougher than a potato but they are only a 1/4" long. Since the turning mechanism wobbles a bit they quickly eat up the end of the produce, potato or other. I didn't try carrots all mine were #1 carrots, long and thin and sweet and they would not have worked. It would need to be the short fat kind. Now the suction grips did work well and the blades seemed sharp, they would have to be. It took no assembly and was not hard to figure out how to use so not all was horrid but still the final opinion is that the idea while interesting and could be carried out fairly easily, you need a better built product to do it. This gadget is cheap trash. This is my first every return to amazon.com.
