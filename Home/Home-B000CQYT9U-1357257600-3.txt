review/summary: Beautiful figurinereview/text: I purchased this for my wife as she had a miscarriage shortly before Christmas. It brought tears to both of our eyes and was to be a wonderful remembrance. The figurine has nice detail and is exactly what was needed to have as our memory. Sadly, the *only* piece of fragile decorations broken during Christmas clean up, was this. Will need to purchase another one now.
