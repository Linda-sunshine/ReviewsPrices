review/summary: In-laws love itreview/text: I have slept with a memory foam mattress pad for years and think they're great. We bought this pad last year for my wife's parents and they love it ! They said they didn't need one because they said their mattress was already comfortable. I ordered it anyways and now they say they will never go back.Some memory foam pads have a weird chemical smell ton them, but this one has a pleasant minty smell when its new.
