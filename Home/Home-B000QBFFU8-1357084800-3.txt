review/summary: Amazing Juicerreview/text: I've been juicing for about 5 years, using a Jack Lalanne Juicer the entire time. I decided it was time to upgrade and I'm glad I bought this machine. The time to clean is about the same as my old juicer, it takes about ten minutes to clean either one. I got more juice from my fruit and the juice was extremely good with no pulp. I highly recommend this juicer for anyone, spend the extra money - you wont be disappointed.
