review/summary: Finally, an easy-to-use affordable coffee grinderreview/text: I tried the Hamilton Beach, but it did not handle small quantities without leaving chunks unground, took a long time to make a fine grind, had a cap that was difficult to get on and off, and stopped working after two months. Before that, my Cuisanart lasted a long time, until a little bit of plastic on the lid broke off, making the thing inoperable.Krups is sturdily made, and grinds very efficiently. I use short pulses, and in a very short time I have a fine ground that is not overheated. I highly recommend this grinder for its simplicity and its affordability.
