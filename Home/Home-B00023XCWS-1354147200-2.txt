review/summary: Boils quickly, does what it is supposed toreview/text: I bought this for my girlfriend, who drinks a ton of hot water. She uses this in a dorm for Ramen or soup and drinking(seems like so long ago). It boils quite quickly without tarnishing. It also looks great, however the cord is very very short.
