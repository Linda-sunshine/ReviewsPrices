review/summary: A Powerful Little Vacreview/text: We used Mighty Mites in our maid service business for years. They were always the most powerful little canister vacs we could find, and they were used heavily every day. When one of them needed repair, parts were easy to get and easy to replace. I would recommend this little sucker to anyone! The new one I just bought is just as powerful as the older models.
