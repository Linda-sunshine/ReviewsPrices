review/summary: Works well but rim of base oxidizedreview/text: Kettle has worked well as described for more than a year now. Metallic finish looks good, however if you spill water down the outside when filling it up then the water causes oxidation on the outside metal rim which separates the metal from the plastic. This spoils the esthetic effect and, I suspect, might corrode through eventually. If you are a more careful kettle-filler than I, this might be a non-issue.
