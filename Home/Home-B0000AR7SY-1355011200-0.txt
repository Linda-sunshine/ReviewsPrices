review/summary: Works great, but creates a mess.review/text: I've had this grinder for two years. Works great, but it is impossible not to end up with coffee grounds all over my kitchen countertop. I have resorted to placing it on a kitchen towel to catch all the coffee grounds. Instructions say to clean it after each use - really????
