review/summary: Filtered Dreamsreview/text: This gadget is wonderful. My area has deep well water, which used to be delicious...but a few years ago they had to start adding chlorine to it...changing the taste. This pitcher returns the water to its former delicious flavor, and also filters out other un-wanted ingredients. The slim-line design makes it easy to place in the door of the Fridge, or it takes up much less space on the shelf, if your door is occupied. The filters last for 2 months. Wish I had gotten one long ago--Cold, Delicious Water!
