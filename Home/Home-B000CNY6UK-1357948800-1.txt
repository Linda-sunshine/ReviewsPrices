review/summary: Awesomereview/text: It is really hard to believe that this espresso maker works as simple as it is; But it works great and it makes awesome espresso. There is nothing to it......unscrew the top, add some water, add espresso, screw the top pot back on, add some heat, and bingo, you have some good espresso.
