review/summary: Nice blender with added features!review/text: I bought this set, including the blender, chopper, and whisk, at Costco for $29.00 (way cheaper than here), and it works very well. It sounds from some of the reviews like the chopper is only made for light use, and I haven't had any trouble with it for light use.I think as long as you don't use it for heavy chopping, it is great!
