review/summary: Simple , cheap and worksreview/text: I picked this up at black Friday for thirty five bucks. For that price it's a good deal, as a simple vacuum. I like how light weight it is. I love the hide away handle for storing in the closet. It picks up most dirt and dust, I love it's soft bendy hose, that doesn't kink like my other vacuum which is why I am vacuum cleaner shopping again. I like the easy dump canister even though I hate touching the filter, which brings me to a few things I don't like so much. I wish it had bumpers, and you have to pick it up to move it from hardwood to carpet or rugs and it's a bit loud.I have a dog so I dump it out after each use so there is no chance of odor build up inside the canister. I still want a new vacuum but this one will get me by till I find what I want and even then I will keep it for the second floor and as a back up. I like it enough that I would like this same setup from this company with more features, including adjustable carpet height, bumper, less noise, and longer hose would make it ideal.
