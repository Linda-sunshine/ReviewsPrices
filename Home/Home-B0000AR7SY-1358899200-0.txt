review/summary: So far so good. Good value for the moneyreview/text: It's been close to a week that I have used this on a daily basis and I have no complaints. I haven't noticed any static with the plastic catcher but I do give the catcher a tap with the measuring spoon before removing it just to be sure grinds don't come flying out. As I'm using a 1980s circa percolator I can't comment on what fine grinds are like, but the coarse grind works well and is consistent. It's also a remarkably quiet grinder. My previous grinder was so darn loud I didn't like using it too early in the morning for fear of waking everyone up. I don't have that concern with this one. For the money I highly recommend the Capresso Infinity. I did hours of research and wanted to buy the Bodum grinder with the glass catcher but I found the price unreasonable. Let's face it, I'm not a professional barista but I do want to have the best coffee taste I can on a reasonable budget. This product satisfies that need perfectly well.
