review/summary: The time display is the worstreview/text: I only have two good things to say about this clock, it keeps time and it has two different alarm time settings. The two alarm times are a great idea. The first bad feature of this clock is that the display is unreadable, as others have stated unless you are up close, directly in front of the clock it is unreadable. I purchased this clock for the sound therapy alarm clock feature. Sad to say as an alarm you only have use of one default therapy sound. Make no mistake the alarm does offer other NOISE as a wake up alarm, but only one therapy sound as an alarm. In my opinion most of the therapy sounds are of poor quality. This is the first clock of this kind that I have ever used. I returned this clock and replaced it a with better clock by Oregon Scientific which cost twice as much, but works ten fold better.
