review/summary: ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS KETTLE!review/text: This is so much better than a microwave or using the stovetop. It's super fast and as long as you don't fill it over the recommended level, it works great! It makes about 3 cups without runing at the risk of overflowing once it starts boiling. It turns off automatically when water has boiled which is a nice perk. I'd recommend this for anyone who wants to make a very quick cup of tea or oatmeal. Very happy with this product.
