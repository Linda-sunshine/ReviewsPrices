review/summary: Best Coffee Maker I've Ever Had....Bar Nonereview/text: First I'd like to say I've had this for &#34;7 years&#34;. I haven't used it the whole 7 years because I broke the carafe and had to order another one. While waiting I used my spare coffee maker which was a good one too. Well, I kept using it until it crapped out and I finally started using the Cuisinart again. I had forgot how good it was. I love everything about it. Depending on your water source, using the filter is a good idea. The settings are easy and variable temp on the plate is great. I would buy again. Actually, it's only $8 cheaper than it was 7 years ago. You won't be disappointed.
