review/summary: Absolutely love it! Makes cooking fun/easyreview/text: Great product and well worth the price. I was concerned with how loud the processor would be, but it's extremely quiet and makes preparing food a breeze. I have used this processor to make purees for soups and chopping vegetables. I'm going to try for the bread next. I'm well satisfied with my purchase
