review/summary: Great but difficult to remove cubesreview/text: The product works as advertised, creating perfect little cubes of ice. The only flaw: it's very difficult to remove the frozen cubes. Even going one at a time, I about gave myself frostbite. If there's a trick to it, they should note it on the package.
