review/summary: Good for lattes and americanos.review/text: I got this during the holidays as a gift to the household. While a lot of people are satisfied with the little machine, my guess is they're making lattes and americanos. Not sure if it was my grinder or the beans, but for a 2 week period I could not pull a decent shot. I decided to step up to a Gaggia Classic (took the plunge after doing much research) and I must say, I'm glad I shelled out the extra $300. VERY WELL WORTH IT.I should add that I drink espresso, cappuccino, and machiatos. So the shots and its taste is very pronounced. I'm using a Breville Smart Grinder BTW
