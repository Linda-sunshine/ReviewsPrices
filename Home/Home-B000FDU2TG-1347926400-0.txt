review/summary: Defective design, Rotating gear wears out fastreview/text: Wife bought this through her amazon account - so I'm not a "confirmed" buyer. But we bought to make smoothies. First one, the plastic gear that the carafe has at the bottome which connects to the plastic insert at the base wore out within a month and it started shredding the plastic. A couple of times, the carafe was stuck on the base and had to be pried off.KitchenAid replaced with new and paid shipping both ways. Nice.2nd one, we used differently and followed their advice. Don't hold down the top while running and put ice cubes at the top. The second one lasted about 4 months. I'm on hold with KitchenAid as i write this. Hoping to get a replacement and we won't be using this much (bought a vitamix instead).I have a feeling most of the people who are happy with this device don't use it much. Bad bad bad design.
