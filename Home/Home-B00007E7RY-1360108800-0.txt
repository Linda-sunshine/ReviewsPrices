review/summary: It's way too loud even on low!review/text: I purchased this after have 3 failed Holmes units, hoping that the 5 star ratings saying that the noise was worth it were true. But I have a medium-sized apartment, and even if I put this unit on low on the other side of the room it is still way too loud. Its too loud to even try to get used to the noise, even on low. It sounds like a leaf blower on high.I do not think it's worth the noise. If you're looking for something to put in your bedroom or living room where you spend a lot of time, this is not the one for you, at all!
