review/summary: Flimsy, unusablereview/text: I excitedly ordered this after seeing a mention of it on an organizing website. When I got it and put it up, I was extremely disappointed because the top part (with the hooks) was so flimsy. I bent it to fit the shelf we have, and then put one--yes, one--roll of foil in the basket. The back part of the basket leaned down and the roll fell out. I was going to put about five or six rolls in that basket...obviously not.Definitely not worth the purchase for even $.01.
