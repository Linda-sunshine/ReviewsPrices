review/summary: Seems to work very well...but...review/text: I have owned this set of cookware for a couple of months now. It is very attractive and is a great price, and at this juncture believe is a good value. When I purchased it a couple of months ago, it was described as 18/10 stainless, and this does not appear to be the case. I am not an expert on cookware and maybe most cookware is no longer 18/10 stainless, however I do think at the time it was not reported properly.First of all, I have had NO problem with sticking at all if the pan is prepped properly just before using. For example the problem egg...no sticking if the pan is heated up first then oil is added..works as well as non-stick cookware from my experience. I was very pleased with this.I have been a bit concerned or at least have a question for others who have purchased or may know the answer? I bought Bar Keeper's Friend to keep the stainless shiny and clean. I have noticed however that after using I do see many scratches/or movement abrasions on the inside of the pans. Anyone have similar experience or comment? Also after using the cleaning product the residue on the paper towel is gray. This makes me concerned that the material of the pan may be releasing something that is not safe over time?These are made in China, and while that does not necessarily mean they are not good, we have heard numerous stories about products from China containing chemicals etc that they should not and are a health hazard, lead, pet food, building products contributing to a "sick house", etc. Any experience or thoughts would be appreciated.Although I do have the concerns, I am happy with performance and the set has definitely been an asset to my kitchen.
