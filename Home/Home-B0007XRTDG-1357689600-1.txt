review/summary: I don't want to use any other kitchen pan!review/text: I LOVE IT!! The heat is consistent, the non stick surface makes cleaning so easy - all I can say is I LOVE IT.I loved it so much the first time that I try to make meals I can make on this skillet.I love that it has a glass lid so that I can see what's happening and I also LOVE that it has a warm setting all the way up to 400 degrees.Gave it to my BF for xmas 2012 and I havent given him a chance to use it himself - no complaints as of yet!
