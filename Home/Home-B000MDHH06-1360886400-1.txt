review/summary: Great juicer for a great pricereview/text: This is a great juicer for beginers. It has everything that you need to get into juicing and feel incredible. The only thing about it is, since it is one of the cheaper ones, it does tend to clog up and it is harder to clean. If you want to get into juicing, I would suggest investing in one that comes fully equipped and its a lot easier to use.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002VAFVG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B0002VAFVG&linkCode;=as2&tag;=amazon070f-20
