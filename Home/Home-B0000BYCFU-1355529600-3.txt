review/summary: worked exactly as advertizedreview/text: Amazing in this day and age that something is advertized that exactly up to its specs. Everything about this equipment was exactly as described. I used it according to directions and it functioned perfectly. I was able to can turkey and turkey stock and it is now sitting in my pantry. I have used a few of the quarts already and it was perfectly fine. In fact it was delicious! Now I get about four gallons of stock from one leftover turkey that i used to throw out. That saves a lot of money on canned chicken broth that i used to have to buy every week and my own stock tastes better than the weak store bought stuff i used to buy.
