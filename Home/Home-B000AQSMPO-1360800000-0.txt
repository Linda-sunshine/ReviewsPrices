review/summary: This coffee maker is a piece of crapreview/text: Do not buy this product. I got my expensive Keurig as a gift and it lasted 6 months. I called customer service and they were very little help.I hate that someone spent money for this......If you want a good value and great coffee, go,for a Bunn.For the 6 months that it lasted, it was nice to have a fresh cup of coffee every time.
