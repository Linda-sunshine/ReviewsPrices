review/summary: Best coffee maker for the moneryreview/text: We have used this coffee maker for several months and I have to say that it makes coffee as good now as it did when it was new. Over the years i have spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on coffee makers that do not last very long and the quality of the coffee was poor regardless of what brand of beans we used. Also, this is the first machine that keeps the coffee fairly hot.
