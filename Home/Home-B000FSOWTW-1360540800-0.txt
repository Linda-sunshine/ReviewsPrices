review/summary: Nice Product for the Pricereview/text: I got this product on special and absolutely love the Foil Cutter and Wine opener part of it. The wine chiller is currently serving as my utensil holder on my counter-top however, so that was a refreshing bonus. I thought it didnt work at first because I kept pre-maturely releasing the "Down" button, just be sure to press "Down" until the Opener stops the cycle or else you will just remove the corkscrew without the cork attached. The Foil Cutter fits nicely on to the back of the charger and is simple to use. I think that for the money this product is well worth it.
