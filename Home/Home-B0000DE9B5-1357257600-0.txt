review/summary: One tiny flaw!review/text: I recently started drinking water out of a water bottle instead of using disposable water bottles and thought this little jug would be perfect for keeping my water cold in the fridge. It really is a lovely jug, but I wish I didn't have to take the lid off to get to the water. It took a while for me to realize I had to take the whole lid off!!! Other then that, the lid is perfect at sealing my water in. No leaks or anything. I also love the little beak that transfers water smoothly with no spill. Love my new jug!
