review/summary: TOTALLY AWESOMEreview/text: I read all the reviews and was unsure about this item. I'm sleeping on a very old futon mattress. I went ahead and ordered another futon mattress because I didn't think this 2 inch topper would help. I was so excited to put it on the futon. I normally don't write reviews but I just had to share this. I priced this at K-Mart and it cost too much. Well, I just got this on my old futon mattress and I feel like I'm laying on a cloud. This thing is worth every penny. I just can't believe a 2 inch memory foam mattress topper could help this much. I have a really bad back with some messed up disk. I'm totally in love with this mattress topper. You CAN'T go wrong buying this item.....
