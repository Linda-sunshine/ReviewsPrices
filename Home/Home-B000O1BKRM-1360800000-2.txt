review/summary: Best Ice Cubes! Love Tovolo ice trays and molds!review/text: These are great and I love them for several reasons:I love that they are BPA free. I recently decided to buy cube trays for my freezer and I was so lucky to find these.Aside from being BPA free they are a great flexible material and they make great CUBES; actual CUBES. Not rounds or odd shaped pieces but real cubes with no rounded bottoms or corners.Some people have complained about difficulty with getting the cubes out of tray. There is validity there; you can not treat them like traditional trays or they will simply do nothing. You have to 'relearn' how to empty your tray. Once you do that you should be okay with it. It does take a little more effort but it is well worth it in my opinion.I use a Berkey water filter system which produces the cleanest healthy water around and have never experienced any tainted taste in my cubes. My cubes are as pure and clear as I water I use to make them.If you are serious about your ice and health then I recommend these if you are willing to put in a little extra time for the better things in life.
