review/summary: Love it so far!review/text: My wife got me this juicer for my birthday. I wanted a juicer for a long time and finally got one. I've been using it for a few days now and loving it. I was a little worried that it only has one speed setting, but it turned out not be a problem at all. I've been juicing different fruits, veggies and really really loving it. It's not loud like some reviewers are saying. For $100 you won't find a better juicer.
