review/summary: Great Dehydrator!!review/text: Ours arrived quickly, well packaged, and was just as it was advertised. We have used it twice now, and this thing is quiet! We have had no issues with it. It comes with a great booklet to help you get started, and is priced better than anywhere else you can find it. I would suggest that you order extra trays to go along with it (Nesco LT-2SG Add-A-Tray for FD-61/FD-61WHC/FD-75A and FD-75PR Dehydrators, Set of 2) and the fruit roll sheets (Nesco LSS-2-6 Fruit Roll Sheets for FD-28JX/FD-37/FD-60/FD-61/FD-61WHC/FD75A and FD-75PR, Set of 2). They worked great as well!
