review/summary: WOW!!review/text: We love our Keurig B70 Platinum..... We love the way we can have variety Etc. If we do not want a whole pot of coffee...perfect. If we or someone we have visiting wants variety...perfect.... We love it. The only thing we did not love was going to costco one week after purchasing it and finding it not only cheaper but it also had with it 60 K-cups and a my K-cup for your own brew....The only thing I could suggest to make this brewing system better would be its own water pitcher to fill the reservoir. I know it is removable, but kind of a pain in the rear... LOL.
