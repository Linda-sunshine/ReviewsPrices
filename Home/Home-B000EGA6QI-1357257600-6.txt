review/summary: Top notch blender stickreview/text: This blender stick is excellent for my soap making projects. Gets my soap to saponify in about 20 minutes verses the 2-4 hour stirring method. The lye in my soap making process hasn't damaged the finish on this blender. It cleans up in a jiffy. I haven't used it for making anything else but I'm sure others have. I highly recommend this stick blender..
