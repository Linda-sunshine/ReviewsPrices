review/summary: Just what I needed!review/text: I grew tired of the usual drip coffee maker and this percolator makes me fall in love with coffee again.Pros:-Coffee has more body and depth.-Great for making a 3-cup afternoon pick-me-up.-Compact, doesn't take a lot of space on the counter.Cons:-Cleaning takes a bit more time-Coffee grind at the end of brewing cycle. Have to pour gently and leave a little coffee in the pot to avoid the grind.-Available reusable nylon filters do not fit the 6-cup percolator (too big). Had to return one and do not want to use paper filter either (no more paper in my coffee).
