review/summary: Flawed designreview/text: Flaw 1: Grinded material gets stuck under the blade. Need to use your finger to scoop it out. I haven't had this problem with other cheep grinders.Flaw 2: If you wash it out, you need to keep the grinder upside down to dry out. The metal bottom is not airtight sealed inside the device, so water can actually get under it. I couldn't figure out why my ground seeds, and coffee were always wet. Also not an issue with other cheep grinders I've bought.
