review/summary: Unbelievablereview/text: First off, it's around 16 inches high, not 30 inches like the site says. Secondly, the smell of the unit; it's awful. But I told myself that I could get over it in time. One other review also warned about the smell. Then it came the buttons and the remote control. First thing I noticed that I could not press the 60 degree button, when I tried really hard to do so, the 2hr or the 4hr button turned on instead, and they would turn on even if I already set 1hr heating, and I would have the 1hr and 2hr/4hr buttons turned on the same time. What!? I could not even press the 75 degree button, if I tried it, the oscillating button turned on instead!? And then I told myself to relax and convinced myself that I could get by with the remote control. Boy, I was wrong. I noticed that if I turned on the 70, 65, or 60 degree, the heater stopped oscillating. So it only oscillated in high heat. Bummer. Once I pressed the power button on the remote. Fan turned on at Max degree (which is above 85, so I guess, 90 degree?), then I pressed the remote to reduce the heat temperature, it jumped far back right at 75 degree! What about 85 and 80 degrees in between?? If I pressed to reduce furthermore, it did go down incrementally, 75, 70, 65 and 60 degrees. And there was one time when I clearly pressed the oscillating button on the remote to stop the oscillation, the fan stopped! I am really confused. But I'm not confused about not wanting this heater after all.
