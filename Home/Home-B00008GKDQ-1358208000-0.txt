review/summary: the best cast ironreview/text: I already have 3 lodge skillets and a tortilla pan, this grill griddle is the lay piece of cookware i will ever need. Lodge makes fantastic products that well last for generations if you care for them properly. While they do come pre seasoned, i definitely recommend a bit of additional seasoning to prevent food from sticking. A others have said, there its a bit of a cooler soot in the middle if you don't have a special griddle burner, but that is to be expected when heating something from two widely separated burners. It its the perfect size for two burners on my standard four burner has range,
