review/summary: Cast Iron for $15????review/text: I priced these at my local box retailer and they were $23........ I used them to make country breakfast gift baskets for xmas gifts and at $15 a piece I was able to make a lot more gift baskets than I needed. I really like the Lodge line of products and though I was pretty skeptical of $15 cast iron, I was really pleased with the results. they cook up just like moms old set form the 50's!
