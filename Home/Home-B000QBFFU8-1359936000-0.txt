review/summary: Simply Amazingreview/text: I saw the documentary on "Fat, Sick and Almost Dead" and was inspired to try out adding veggie and fruit juice to my diet. Not sure I can do the whole fast thing. I did research on the various juicers and decided on the Breville Multi-Speed... great price and the features I wanted. It was easy to assemble and use- and amazingly simple to clean. This thing takes all the juice out of whatever you put into it and separates the pulp in an easily removeable container. I throw the pulp in my compost pile - I thought i would have to get used to the taste of vegetable juice - kale, broccoli i expected to be yucky - when you add a piece of fruit into whatever veggie mix you put in - it is rather tasty - The juicing leaves my kitchen smelling like fresh cut fruit! I highly recommend the product - There are really no negatives- well perhaps the size is a bit large - but so well worth it. You won't be sorry
