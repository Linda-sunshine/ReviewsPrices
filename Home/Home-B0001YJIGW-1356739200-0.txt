review/summary: Works as describedreview/text: This is a great idea for a product. I like it alot, works as described - However there is one problem. It has a hole at the top of it to prevent overflowing. My bathtub is pretty large and the drain isn't at the very top of it, so I had to put tape over the hole to get a deeper water level.
