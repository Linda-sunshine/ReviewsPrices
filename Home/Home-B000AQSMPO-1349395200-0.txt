review/summary: Keurig B60 Special Editionreview/text: Finally bought one after all the hype. I seen one at a local car dealership while waiting for an oil change and saw first hand the ease and use of this product. The K Cups are a little pricey but there are deals at Amazon and local markets. I like the fact that there is no mess with leftover coffee grinds and cleaning. Just insert the K Cup and press the button. It takes less than a minute for the water to heat up. Glad I purchased this Keurig product.
