review/summary: I like the Pyrex/glass measuring cupsreview/text: somebody said they dropped theirs from 10 feet and it didn't break. I don't know about that. I've never broken one, but my housekeeper did, not sure if she dropped it or dropped a cast iron pan on it, but these things can break. That said, they are study and strong and won't break or chip as long as you don't drop it from too high. (still don't believe 10 feet - maybe that person has rubber floors). That said, I trust glass, and this is the only measuring cup I'll use. I like the quart size too.Edit, changing from 5 stars to 4. The reason is the spout is too small and pouring liquids from this thing takes patience and care. If you pour as fast as you expect a standard pyrex, you get liquid all over the counter. The wider circle, with no increase in the size of the spout (not sure what to call it), is a design flaw. I still like the item, but not as much as I would if I could just pour liquid from it without spillage like you can from the 1-pint pyrex.
