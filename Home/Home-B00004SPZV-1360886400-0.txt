review/summary: Great money saving device, one thing to watch out forreview/text: We had our first Misto sprayer for a couple of years before it stopped working. We recycled it and bought another from Amazon. The one we purchased arrived but did not work. Amazon, of course, remedied the problem right away and sent a replacement which worked fine. It seemed to be a fluke. I figured out that the first, defective device did not have a small rubber/plastic ring to keep the pressure in the can when you pump it. This tiny little missing piece kept the whole thing from working. Check yours for the plastic ring before you put oil in it!
