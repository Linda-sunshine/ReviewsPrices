review/summary: Not sure why Amazon has so many bad reviewsreview/text: I have had my machine (this exact model) for over 4 years now. The machine is used daily at least 2 times and at most 5 times a day (sometimes more). There isn't a day that goes by in my household that this machine is not used, unless we are away, which is rare. It has never ever failed us once, and works today as well as it did on day one. I got mine at Kohl's, all I can think is there is a flaw in the batch that Amazon is selling? I was shocked to see so many bad reviews. I love my machine. The Hubby drinks coffee usually a cup or two a day (a waste to try and brew in a regular coffee pot) which he loves switching flavors on and I like my teas, cappuccino and specialty drinks. We can switch between drinks in a matter of a minute or two. LOVE IT!!!!
