review/summary: Excellent bread maker . . . until it isn't . . .review/text: Sadly, I feel I have to write this review. This bread maker has worked beautifully for 1.5 years and I have loved the results. I use all whole wheat recipes and have enjoyed them all - the texture, flavor and heft of the loaves is great. The extra-large loaves are very tall so we slice the loaf vertically and then make small slices horizontally and it makes perfect pieces. All of a sudden, the loaves began to come out smaller and smaller despite using the exact same ingredients. At first I blamed it on the new whole wheat flour I had (crops can vary) but I tried various different brands with the same results. The loaves kept getting smaller and smaller until the XL was HALF the size it once was. I started researching this problem and it sounds like the first rising is not heating properly, which is resulting in poor loaves. After much consideration and reading that people are getting absolutely nowhere with Panasonic, I have decided to move on to a different bread maker (the Zojirushi BB-PAC20 Home Bakery Virtuoso) in hopes that it will last longer. To be fair, I would have kept and loved the Panasonic but cannot stand the sad little loaves it is spitting out. I don't want to spend hours and hours of my time fighting the unhelpful customer service folks so I am saying good-bye to the Panasonic. If I had not run into this problem (which is possible from reading other reviews) I would give the bread maker 5 stars.
