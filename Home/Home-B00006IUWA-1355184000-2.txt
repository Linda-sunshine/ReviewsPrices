review/summary: Better than sliced breadreview/text: The hot air popcorn is less expensive than microwave and healthier than oil popped corn. My recommendation to make it even better, lightly spray butter flavored Pam onto the popped corn as it's coming out of the popper. Salt will stick better and the popcorn tastes like you're at the movies. A good addition to our family.
