review/summary: Just like in the Movie, Juicer is User Friendly in use and clean up.review/text: The movie, &#34;Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead&#34; inspired me to use this machine. It is much better than jack Lalane's since it is easy to use and easy to clean. ALl you have to do with a pineapple is to quarter it and put it in the machine, skin and all. Same for other fruits, you just drop them in with their skin and seed and it is done in a second. Variable speed make the juicer user friendly too. I got it on Amazon for $150.
