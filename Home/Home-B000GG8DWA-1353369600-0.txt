review/summary: Works well for what it isreview/text: This is a very simple device and it provides excellent heat. We use it primarily to reduce the use of our oil furnace during the winter, in our 14x14 bedroom, and it works very well for that. It's been getting down into the 20s at night for the last week and we only need to keep the heater on 400 watts.So, to speak to another review, this heater does have an emergency shutoff if it's knocked over, but no, I'm not aware of an overheat option. But we only use this when we're around, we never leave it unattended, and we make sure that there's nothing - absolutely nothing - that could fall onto it. Yes, accidents can happen, but I think this heater is perfectly safe if you are very careful.We also use it in our living room at times, and of course it doesn't heat the room in the same way, but it's an open floorplan with a kitchen and dining area, so in that case it's really only good for direct heat, and maybe taking a bit of the chill off.
