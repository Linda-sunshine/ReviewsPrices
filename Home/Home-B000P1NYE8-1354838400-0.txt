review/summary: I love this scalereview/text: I use this scale to weigh out tobacco for making my own cigarettes, it works great. The scale came perfectly calibrated. One thing I really I like about compared to other scales is that it takes about a minute until it turns off on its own, other scales turn off much more quickly.For the price this scale is great!
