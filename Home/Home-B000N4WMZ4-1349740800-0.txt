review/summary: LeCreuset at 1/4 the price - Thank you Lodge! (and Amazon ; -)review/text: Performance: Side by side cooking with a LeCreuset 5 qt and my new Lodge 3 qt Dutch ovens confirmed these two products perform identically. The Lodge Dutch oven has a rounder bottom vs. the flatter bottom on the LC so the browning surface is a little larger on the LC, but I like the saucier shape of the Lodge for soup, chili, curry, etc. Color: Lodge Caribbean Blue matches LC Marseille Blue quite well if you want to mix in a less costly Lodge piece. Other Comments: The lid knob is not an issue - my pot arrived with a hefty stainless steel knob, and the "tripod" edge (there are 3 small bumps on the lid edge) that one reviewer mentioned doesn't seem to affect performance. The lid on this little baby is tight as rice (or at least tight enough to cook rice, as I did for my curry last night - it was fluffy and perfect). As far as wear is concerned, my LC cookware has chips in it after 30 years and I'm sure the Lodge will eventually have those as well since I use it every day but so far, so good! I'll update if any enamel chipping happens. Also, this came with rubber clips for the lid to prevent chipping while storing. Overall: I'm glad to see a quality product produced at a much more reasonable price. LeCreuset France, watch out!
