review/summary: these are a waste of $$$review/text: I bought these after wanting them for a while. I finally broke down and got three blue silicone trays by Tovolo. These were kind of a big investment to me given how much they cost. They ended up being a huge waste of money in the fact that I will never use ice made from them ever again. The Silicone off gasses an oil based residue right into the ice cubes and then into your drink. They will make your drink taste like a plastic factory and leave an impossible to remove white residue on your glasses.Stay far, far away from these potentially poisonous ice cube trays.
