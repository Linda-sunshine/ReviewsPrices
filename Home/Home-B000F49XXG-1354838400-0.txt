review/summary: Poor Grade Product Made in Chinareview/text: I purchased this machine and I had high expectations. It is after all a &#34;DeLonghi&#34;. After testing it for 3 days, I decided to give up. The filter holder won't clip with the shot filter and won't position to the middle as shown in the photo. I will look for another DeLonghi, but only if it's made in Italy.
