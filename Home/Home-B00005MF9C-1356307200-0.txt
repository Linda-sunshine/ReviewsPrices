review/summary: Must have for travelersreview/text: I know this may seem odd, but I travel a couple times a year and just cannot stand the nasty liquid they call coffee that you are provided in hotels so I would bring my coffee maker with me. This is less than convenient, the coffee maker is huge and by the time you add containers for the coffee, cream, sugar and cup, you almost need another piece of luggage.Then I found this. It's compact size is great for traveling. It's very basic in design, the quality could be a little better, but considering the cost, this is overall a great coffee maker for those that need to brew and cup of coffee and go or for those that enjoy there morning coffee and travel.I would highly recommend this.
