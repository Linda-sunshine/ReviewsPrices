review/summary: excellent comfortreview/text: There seemed to be an issue with the placement of a permanent nut so that the back of the chair is difficult to tighten, but this has had no real negative on the product. It is extremely comfortable, even more comfortable than my work chair. After a day at the office my back will get sore but when i get home and sit in this chair all pain is relieved. Excellent chair for the price, absolutely recommend!
