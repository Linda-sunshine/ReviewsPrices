review/summary: What I'd hoped forreview/text: Years ago I 'upgraded' (young me, then) and got rid of my cast iron cooking pans, and for years I've been sorry, but didn't want to spend more money re-purchasing. Something finally made me decide to buy this one - partially because these days all the pans are pre-seasoned, and partially because this one was made in USA. I've used it a few times so far, and find it is really better than my old pan, and I'm a happy (older and wiser?) person.
