review/summary: What is not to like?review/text: This is a wonderful--no, let me say, essential--tool in any active kitchen. It is all the advertisements say it is: absolutely non-stick, easy to use and to clean. It must be stored flat and used only in pans large enough to keep it flat while baking. But it does such a terrific job at heating efficiently and baking results are so consistently great, I wonder how I ever got along without it before! Highly, highly recommend and well-worth the price!
