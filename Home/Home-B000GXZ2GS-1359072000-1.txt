review/summary: Best cup of coffee yet,review/text: Best cup of home brewed coffee yet. Way better than my french press, and absolutely no grinds got into my cup (a pet peeve of mine with french pressing). I also got a hario hand grinder which may have made a difference. Cleanup is a snap, little final push and the puck of coffee just goes right into the recycle. PRO TIP: run hot water through your filter before pressing as it removes a bit of the acidic filter taste.
