review/summary: Great little dehydratorreview/text: Bought this thing because dried dog treats were costing me a fortune. This machine is simple to use, true to its instructions, and is saving me $ everytime I use it. I do wish they would have included on &#34;on board&#34; timer and on/off switch (hence the 4 rather than 5 stars), though an inexpensive &#34;plug timer&#34; works just as well.
