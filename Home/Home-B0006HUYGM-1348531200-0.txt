review/summary: Great Little Vacuumreview/text: I have been waiting a long time to find a little hand vac to vacuum my area rugs and am glad I waited. The vacuum is very powerful and can pick up even the tiniest particles of dust. The unit itself is a bit heavy, but is probably heavy so it can operate a stronger motor. My brother has this hand vac as well and loves it! I would highly recommend this hand vac to anyone and especially for the price on Amazon.
