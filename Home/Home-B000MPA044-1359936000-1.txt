review/summary: GREAT cooker!!review/text: I wouldn't take anything for purchasing this cooker. It's so quick/easy to prepare great/wholesome foods. It use to take 6-8 hrs. in crockpot for pre-soaked beans to cook & w/Cuisnart cooker 25-35 mins! Timesaver + electricity saver !!! Called cust. serv. once, they were efficient, pleasant, helpful & issue solved w/lst phone call---how's that for service? I'd rate #1. would definitely buy this prod. again & will quality of this prod. any other Cuisnart prod.
