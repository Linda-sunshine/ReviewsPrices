review/summary: Cuisinart Forever!review/text: I bought this one for my mom. I have owned one for 20 years and I love it. It has never failed, and is still incredibly sharp despite the fact I have never sharpened it. If all products were made as well as Cuisinarts, the world would be a better place. Mom had hers for a week and was teaching me new tricks with it. Gotta love moms!
