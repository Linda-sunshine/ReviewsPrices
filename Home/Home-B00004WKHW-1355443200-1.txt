review/summary: Great and I can't wait for a larger one!review/text: This chopper is really outstanding. I use it to chop walnuts very fine for walnut "meat" balls and it is really a nice appliance. I am hoping Santa will bring me the 14 cup Cuisinart soon!If you need a small food processor then don't hesitate. This one is really great and exceeded my expectations. Easy to use, easy to clean (just throw it in the dishwasher) and easy to store.
