review/summary: Not THAT good..review/text: I do not understand the rave reviews.Here is mine: Initially, good suction and power. Not great, just good. After the first couple of uses, the tiny conical filter gets clogged with dust. I have to clean it out EVERY time I vacuum and I'm only vacuuming about 700 sq ft of VERY low commercial carpet. If I vacuum twice with it, it will barely suck up a small blade of dry grass. Beating the crud out of the filter is a ritual prior to each use. The hose is a joke since it's only 6 inches long. Unless you have extension hose (not included) handy, you will not be able to reach many areas without lifting the cleaner itself. As stated it's a NARROW vacuum, maybe 10" wide and just doesn't cut it. I've had this cleaner for about 4 months and am now about to buy something else. If someone wants this one, it will be at my next garage sale.
