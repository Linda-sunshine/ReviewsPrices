review/summary: Seems sturdyreview/text: After destroying 2 can openers in the last year, I decided to do a little research before my next purchase. Have had 2 higher end openers crap out on me, but this one doesn't seem likely to die anytime soon. I don't like the locking feature, but its a minor annoyance, and as other reviewers mentioned, the magnet to get the can lid off is kind of laughable... I usually just leave a little can uncut and bend back the lids so they don't fall in, so I don't use it anyway. I have had it a few months now and it seems to be doing fine, but I will update if/when it dies!
