review/summary: Fantastic Purchasereview/text: I've had such great success with this product that I actually bought one for my Mother too. It's flexibility and mobility to get around corners, and in hard to reach places is a must for both a small apt, and for someone who is getting up in years. It is so light weight and easy to maneuver that it makes it easy for a quick once over or a full on cleaning day. Great investment and well worth the money!
