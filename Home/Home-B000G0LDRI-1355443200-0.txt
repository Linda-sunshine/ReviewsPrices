review/summary: Excellent humidifier, impossible to reach customer service.review/text: This humidifier is more than enough for my humble 1300 sq. ft. townhouse rental--we keep it at the &#34;two water drops&#34; setting and the fan on low and I still get ice on my crappy windows. I've started turning the humidistat down on colder days, and that seems to have helped the ice buildup.Unfortunately, due to my own clumsiness, I broke the threaded rim of one of the water tanks. While it still holds water, it does leak slowly and despite my many attempts to contact Honeywell (at several different contact numbers and email addresses) to purchase a replacement, I still haven't received a response. Great humidifier, but don't count on any product support.
