review/summary: Great affordable espresso machinereview/text: I bought this after seeing how much money my wife was spending on various coffee drinks. This thing has gotten a lot of use and we couldn't be happier. Very easy to use. It doesn't take long to warm up and we have had fun trying all different types of beans. Lattes are great and mochas with chocolate milk, espresso, and a little simple syrup have been big hits. The price is great on this but I almost wish i had spent a little more to get a fancier looking one since it spends much more time on my counter top than I thought it would! However as far as the function of this machine, I have no complaints.
