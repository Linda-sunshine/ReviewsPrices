review/summary: Great addition to the kitchenreview/text: Overall a great addition to my kitchen arsenal. So far does just about everthing to perfection though it doesnt like to do whole onions or fennel bulbs. I chose this model as i prefer the V type blade and wanted something self contained. The holder drains well and keeps everthing together and protected so you dont accidently grab a blade when reaching up to the shelf or in a drawer. My favorite uses are to thinly slice lemons and to finely dice ginger. Havent had it quite a week yet so im still experimenting but even with the shortcoming of not doing onion rings it saves me an amazing amount of time. I consider this a vital tool for anyone with physical disabilities. Though i suggest investing in a slice proof glove as the safety guard is a bit flimsy especially on lumpy items like the ginger.
