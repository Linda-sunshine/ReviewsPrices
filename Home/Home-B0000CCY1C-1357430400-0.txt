review/summary: Cookie Scoopreview/text: I have been looking forever for something to place pecan filling in the miniature muffin tins that have a flour & cream cheese pastry. This tool keeps the filling confined to the inside of the pastry without making a mess on the top or on the muffin tin. Results in a much neater miniature tart for presentation.
