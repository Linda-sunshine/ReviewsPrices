review/summary: Great coffee grinder, but long cleaning timereview/text: I used this grinder for 3 months, 2 to 3 times a week.Even if the grinder leaflet advises to grind the coffee as fresh as possible, I found the cleaning a bit too time-consuming, thus I only grind coffee as rarely as possible.I'll try and update my review in a few months, because I wonder if the different parts (a few of which are made of plastic) will last long or stay in the same state.PROS:- My espresso machine works wonders with this grounded coffee. It takes a few trials finding the perfect grinding size for your espresso machine, but then you won't regret it.- The plastic parts have not "moved" or been damaged so far (particularly the upper removable part of the grinder, composed of a grinding metal jaw surrounded by hard plastic, which worried me a bit at first).CONS:- Cleaning = 10 min. I don't want to spend 10 min every day grinding + cleaning the grinder, when making an espresso only takes 2 min. Or perhaps am I too thorough when I'm cleaning the machine, even if I'm only following the leaflet instructions. I sacrificed the freshness of my coffee instead.- Small plastic cleaning brush = will not last long. It alrealy looks damaged, even when I'm never really scraping or pushing too hard on it, but barely dusting all the coffee I can see. The plastic brush seems of an average quality, and I guess I'll use a toothbrush instead of buying an other new crappy identical Capresso brush.I'd buy this product again, since it's far better than all the other grinders I've used so far.
