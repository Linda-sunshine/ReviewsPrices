review/summary: Would not recommendreview/text: I agree with one of the previous reviews that looks can be deceptive as far as this kettle is concerned. Very poor quality. This pot basically disintegrated over the period of 6 months. First, the plastic power on button broke, steam started to escape through that opening so the foil on the handle and then on the lid peeled off. Capresso customer service sent me a replacement that went down exactly the same road. Would not recommend this product.
