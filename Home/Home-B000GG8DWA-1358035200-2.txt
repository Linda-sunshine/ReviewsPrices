review/summary: So nice to have a quiet, energy efficient heater!review/text: We have a large great room and it gets cold so we always have a space heater in the main seating area. They are always noisy and the last two either burned up or burned my outlet! This is the only kind of space heater I'll buy from now on.Pros:SilentVery energy efficientHasn't tripped the fuse (the fan models always tripped the fuse at least once every few weeks--and we have new wiring and a new box)Easy to use controlsAdjustable heatGreat priceVery lightweightCord wrapCons:No timerNo remoteAs my other room heaters die, I'll replace them with radiant heaters from now on.
