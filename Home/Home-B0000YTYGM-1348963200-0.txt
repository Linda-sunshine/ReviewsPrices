review/summary: This coffee maker will ruin your life!review/text: This absolutely the biggest pile of garbage I have ever purchased. It randomly will decide to spill coffee all over the kitchen whenever it feels like it. Buy this POS at your own peril.The spring loaded drain at the end of the basket clogs and/or does not allow coffee to flow in to the carafe and ends up all over the counter. This has happened a dozen times or so but will not happen again as I gave the chassis sans carafe to my 12 week old Golden Retriever puppy to destroy.No matter how many times or how well I clean it seems to overflow and spill onto the counter. Think about it....you're waking up on a Sunday morning, tired and not functioning well. Your loving wife has loaded up the coffee maker so all you have to do is push the button and in 5 minutes or fresh coffee! You stroll back into the kitchen to see your while counters brown, coffee grounds and coffee everywhere. It has even spilled onto the floor so aforementioned puppy can track paw prints all over the tile, but even better, all over our brand new carpet.So, I will post this review and shop for a new coffee maker. I will die before I purchase anything branded Cuisinart ever again.
