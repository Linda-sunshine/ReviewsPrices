review/summary: quick & easyreview/text: This pressure cooker is great. I have no fear of it exploding like I did with non electric pressure cookers. It is easy to use and is definitely fast. You can brown in it and go immediately to pressure. It is so quiet, you'll think it's not pressurizing. Great for last minute dishes.
