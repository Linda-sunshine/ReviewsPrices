review/summary: Great brewerreview/text: My wife and I were looking for a nice brewer that woudlnt break the bank and looked good in our kitchen. We bought it in white because we have white appliances and the color is real nice. I read a few complaints that when you open the lid any condensation drips down the back onto your counter and this is true but its very minimal and many coffee brewers do this. Its real easy to operate as well.
