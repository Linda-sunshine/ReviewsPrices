review/summary: Best Juicer for the Price!review/text: Do yourself a favor and buy this if you're in the market for a good juicer. You just can't beat the price. First, though, go check out the youtube video reviews that show how great this works. Yes, you can drop whole fruits/veggies in it, as long as they fit in the opening. It was delivered really quickly, too! Packaged perfectly. Already have friends buying this very juicer, too.
