review/summary: Bright, poor sounds, difficult to controlreview/text: The display is super bright in a dark room. The buttons are poorly laid out making it difficult to set alarms, or turn off your alarm. The interface is not intuitive at all and you will be racking your brain remembering how to change an alarm or set the time. You can actually hear the looping points in most of the sleep sounds.
