review/summary: Works really wellreview/text: I received one as a christmas present, per request. So far it hasn't failed to juice anything and there's very little "by-product" that goes to waste. I think I just made the best orange juice of my life using this juicer. Very easy to clean, every part is dishwasher safe!
