review/summary: Bang for your buck winreview/text: I already had one each of the Chef and Paring Victorinox knives, for a few years, and just got a second pair. There are small changes to handle and blade, both improvements. The photo shows the older version, which is almost indistinguishable from the new. Chef knife marking on the blade are the same, the handle has a smaller logo. Paring knife logo is smaller and placed differently on the blade. The general shape and qualities of both are the same.The blade itself has a slightly better grind to the edge. On the chef knife the angle is just a touch different but allows for smoother motion when doing rapid chopping. The tip is a little wider taper on the paring, making it less likely to lose the tip in a hard object. The handle is a little larger with the logo smaller and recessed, and has a slightly softer feel than the older models. This is the case for both the paring and the chef knife, so I knew it was a design improvement and not a manufacturing variance.These are great bang for your buck knifes (the chef and the paring). They can be used every day, have a myriad of functions, and clean easily. I would recommend hand washing but these will survive a dishwasher hit or two with minimal problems. Sharpening them is easy, and even easier with the newer edge angle. I've had one regrind for the edge of the older knifes (my Henckles needed three in the same time period and I use these more) , and it took a minimal effort to repair the usage.Some folks prefer a heavier steel blade on their chef knife. It was just fine for me. My more petite companion, she had a little difficulty with the handle size. The softer grip prevented any difficulties until she found her cutting rhythm and comfort. Works well with any cutting board. Save the plastic shipping cover for moving, picnics, or long term storage.
