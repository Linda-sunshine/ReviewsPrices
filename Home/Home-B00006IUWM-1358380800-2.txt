review/summary: Infant tested and approvedreview/text: Followed all the directions multiple times and, though I didn't think it was possible to dull my knives any more, I was sadly proven wrong. If you need to kid proof your cutlery this will do it. Gutless motor and not worth the cost of returning it. Even if I was of a mind to slit my wrists in frustration my knives are now all so dull that that wouldn't be possible. Save your money and look elsewhere.
