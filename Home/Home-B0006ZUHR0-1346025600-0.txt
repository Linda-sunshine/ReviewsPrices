review/summary: Finally! A really GOOD iron!review/text: I bought and returned about 3 or 4 irons in a matter of a year and a half. Water leaked, the heat plate heated unevenly, the handle was awkward. I had just about had it when I decided to try this one. Yay! It was great! I have had it now over 3 years and I have put some miles on it. We are a family of 6 and so ironing is a multiple times a week event. I just love this iron. Some might say, if you've used one iron, you've used them all....... WRONG!Pros- Weight is perfect. If an iron weighs too much you get tired to fast using it and if it weighs too little, you have to press down harder on your clothes to get that really sleek, smooth, crisp look. Either way, it's too much work. This iron has enough weight that you feel it is doing the work pressing, not you, but it also doesn't weigh so much that you feel you've gotten a biceps work out after you get done ironing!- The settings are great. I can actually tell a heat difference among the settings and the settings for the different fabrics are spot on.- Clear water basin makes it easy to know when you need to refill the water. No being 5 seconds from done with the last pair of pants and the steam suddenly stops!- Heats up quickly!- Lots of good steam. The steam is strong and keeps going! And the water doesn't leak!!- The heating plate is still as shiny as when I got it 3+ years ago.- Sturdy, quality construction.- Beep lets you know when its ready, plus the auto off feature are great!Cons- It doesn't actually do the ironing for you, you still have to physically iron clothes!!Highly recommend!!1-
