review/summary: Very Basic Alarm Clockreview/text: The reason I bought this clock is my wife would accidentally turn of my alarm when she turned hers off, due to the fact the switches where so close together. Now that doesn't happen since they are on the opposite sides. That is the plus. The clock is very basic as far as options go. The buzzer alarm is horrible. I am not a real heavy sleeper but I don't trust it to wake me up. I have it set to radio with the volume most of the way up. I do this just in case the station is off the air, then the static will wake me up. Settings are very easy to navigate. It uses a fob battery instead of a 9volt. The clock has a time zone setting to automatically adjust the time. My Citizen Eco-Drive watch is extremely accurate to the last second and the alarm clock was a couple of minutes off, even with the auto adjust. It does keep accurate time now. For a budget alarm clock it works well. The buzzer is my only real complaint, and the dual alarm settings are a plus.
