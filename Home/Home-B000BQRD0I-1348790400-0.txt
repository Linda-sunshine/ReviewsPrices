review/summary: Much better than an iron...review/text: My wife and I absolutely DESPISE ironing, and since we are both professionals who need to have a 'presentable' appearance for our jobs, ironing was a daily chore. Well, things have changed since we purchased this steamer. Easy to use and great for dress shirts, pants, jeans, and other materials. I can steam my own clothes, being a guy who NEVER irons, that is really saying something. The construction is well made, easy to assemble and take apart. Lightweight and easy to move around. The only complaint I have is sometimes you have to wiggle the nozzle to get the steam to come out if it stops (occasionaly this happens when it's getting warmed up).
