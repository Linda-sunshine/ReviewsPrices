review/summary: HB Big Mouth Juicer aka Waste of Moneyreview/text: After reading the positive comments on this juicer, I decided to order. I bought a GE juicer at Walmart the week before, and I was a bit disappointed in it, so I took it back and ordered this one.I tried it the first time and thought I must have either done something wrong or not gotten the same juicer that people raved about in the comments section.The juicer is a huge pain to put together. It made the even cheaper GE model from Walmart seem like a breeze. After finally locking it into place, I put in some kale and turned it on. Kale pulp shot out from between the machine and the blades and sprayed the counter top. The remainder of the kale went straight into the pulp bin. No juice appeared.So I rechecked everything to make sure I had put it together correctly. I had.So I emptied the pulp container back into the mouth and tried again. Same thing happened. I decided that since the thing had to be washed anyway, I'd try other vegetables and fruits. Talk about a mess!I did end up with some juice, but there were large pieces of apple and carrots that went straight into the pulp container. And the counter top looked like someone had thrown confetti. I wiped pulp from the counter, the wall and the cabinets.I wrangled the thing apart and washed all the pieces. The basket with the blades took 15 minutes to clean after a 30-minute soak in hot soapy water. The included cleaning brush kept leaving plastic bristles in the holes and I had to keep pulling them out. It was so much easier to use and clean the GE from Walmart.But I didn't want to give up so easily, so I tried to use the juicer again the next day. Same story.So I washed it up (one more time) and repackaged it. UPS will pick it up tomorrow.
