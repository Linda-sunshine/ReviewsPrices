review/summary: Great chair, not so good packagingreview/text: The chair was easy to assemble and my wife has no complaints.For the price I think it was good value.The chair is not well packed and the box took some delivery damage.All the pieces were there, but since there is no padding holding things in place they can potentially damage the box through handling.
