review/summary: CHECK YOUR BOX FOR ALL ITEMS !review/text: I have tried and tried to get the gold basket that was supposed to be included in my box with my coffeemaker. I have the original box and it states right on the box GOLD BASKET INCLUDED. I received a plastic basket that I use paper filters with but I am FED UP trying to get the darn thing from Cuisinart or Amazon. I am VERY disappointed in CUISINART and AMAZON. I have the photos too to prove what the box says. This overpriced coffeemaker and Cuisinart in general have gone downhill in the last 3 years. I'll be looking elsewhere for my kitchen items. SHAME ON YOU CUISINART!
