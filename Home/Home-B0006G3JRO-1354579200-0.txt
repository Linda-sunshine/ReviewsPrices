review/summary: Handles our daily abuse well!review/text: My wife decided to start drinking shakeology instead of breakfast every morning and immediately complained that our specialty Hamilton-Beach Smoothie-maker cannister-style blender took too long, left bigger ice chunks, and was too difficult to clean. I recommended trying an immersion blender but told her that it would need to be treated with care if she expected it to last very long (like using pre-crushed ice from our fridge dispenser and adding it in small amounts to reach her desired consistency). I should have known better, as she is not delicate at handling ANYTHING! She uses it on a daily basis and fills an enormous cup with whole ice cubes and not enough liquid to cover the cubes (because she wants it impossibly thick), then bears down on the stick-blender until it wails and growls like a wolverine is fighting a honey-badger in our garbage disposal! Amazingly, after a year of her daily flogging, this thing still looks and works like new. The interface between motor and stick is a 2-bladed metal piece (the plastic teeth only join the housing, not the drive mechanism). She doesn't like that she has to try several combinations of alignment before the motor and stick click together (but this will be the case with any 2-peice drive unit, so I dismissed that complaint). I do not understand how it is possible to damage the plastic teeth - ours are still like new. The blade still looks new (no bends or dings). I have used it directly in a pot with hot soups/sauces (not recommended) with no problems. I have absolutely no complaints about this unit and due to our experience thus far, expect a long service life.
