review/summary: Very easy to usereview/text: I bought this electric can opener for my parents as a Christmas gift last year (2011). They absolutely love it! My parents both have arthritis, so I wanted to get them a can opener that would be relatively hands-free and easy to use, and this one definitely is. They've had it for about a year and it's still working perfectly with no problems.
