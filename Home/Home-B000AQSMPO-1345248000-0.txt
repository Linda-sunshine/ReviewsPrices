review/summary: Great while it lastedreview/text: The coffee maker was great while it lasted. My wife and I do not get up at the same time, and have different tastes in coffee, so it was very convenient. We were very happy with the coffee maker.However, after about 18 months, the pump started failing, and now when the brew button is pressed, it only brews a cup about half the time. And when it does brew, it rarely brews a full cup. We've tried cleaning it many times, and this is clearly a mechanical failure.I would have given it 4-5 stars earlier, but I cannot give a positive review for such an expensive coffee maker which fails after 18 months.
