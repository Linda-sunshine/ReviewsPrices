review/summary: metal carafe leaks water all over while brewingreview/text: I didn't listen to the other reviews after I read them and went ahead and purchased this coffee pot as I have had couple Cuisinartcoffee makers with glass carafes. The reviews were all correct when they said the coffee pot leaks water all over. I tried itseveral different times and followed directions exactly and halfway through brew water started running off top of carafe & all over counter. What good is having a programmable pot if you have to stand and watch it all through the brew process, so you can stop it.Cuisinart really needs to sit up and listen and change this carafe lid as they will miss so many sales and have more & more returns. Ithink it is forming a vacuum halfway through the brewing process. Shouldn't be that difficult to get resolved. I had to buy different brand to get the stainless carafe, so they missed another sale or actually another one returned to them. Wake up Cuisinart!
