review/summary: It's okay...it does the jobreview/text: This machine is fine if you just drink espresso. If you're looking for a budget espresso maker and you don't plan to make cappuccinos or lattes, this will probably do just fine. Otherwise, you might want to spend the extra money and get something that will do the job better.
