review/summary: superior taste on juicesreview/text: I have a Turmix, a conventional juicer and the Omega.I made apple juice using the turmix and the Omega and the Omega juicer produced a fresher taste. It is said that the heat by friction of the conventional juicers "cook" just a little bit the fruits or vegetables and that heat also kills some heat-sensible enzymes.I highly reccommend this juicer, BUT keep your traditional juicer too, because with cucumber, pinneapple and tomatoe and others with the same consistency, the yield is somewhat poor.
