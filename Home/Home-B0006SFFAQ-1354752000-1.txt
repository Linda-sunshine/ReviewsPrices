review/summary: Good Coffee Makerreview/text: Overall the unit is well built, it is heavy in comparison to most. The water fill marks are viewable only from the top of the unit making it difficult for a short person to see them although when you can they are easy to read. (Due to it's heigth you must move the unit away from overhead cabinets to fill in any case so a shorter person could use a stool if necessary.) The selectable range heating element keeps the coffee just as you expect. We do not care for the permenant filter as while it does a great job of retaining the grounds, it is difficult to empty without washing the grounds down the drain. It is optional and paper #4 cone filters work just fine.
