review/summary: My New Dirt Devil Dynamite Bagless Uprightreview/text: The fact that I have hardwood flooring and only utilize two area rugs, led me to look for a small powerful vacumn. This product met and exceeded my needs. Although this is a recent purchase and has only been utilized twice, it has proven effective in terms of general cleaning.Additionally, it is light-weight, compact and powerful.
