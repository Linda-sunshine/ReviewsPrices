review/summary: Wow! What a step up!review/text: Over a year ago, I purchased a Black and Decker, low end juicer because we wanted the health benefits of juicing. The B&D; unit worked well and since it was my first exposure to a juicer of any kind it worked well for us. The only annoyance about the B&D; model was that the chute where you put the veggies was oddly shaped and I literally had to cut up everything into small pieces before putting it in there. It was time consuming.Fast forward to a month ago when we began a lifestyle change that would include drinking fresh juices daily once again. I wanted a juicer with a larger &#34;mouth&#34; but as small a footprint that I could find. We don't have a lot of space. I was torn between a Cuisinart and this one but the Cuisinart looked huge in the picture I saw online.So I went with this one. It is AMAZING. Twice as powerful as the old one, the chute is large, the pulp is more dry, it's so much easier to clean than the other one and it makes a lot of juice. I could not possibly be happier with this juicer.
