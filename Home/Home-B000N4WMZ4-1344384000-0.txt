review/summary: Dutch Ovenreview/text: I have been wanting to buy a Dutch Oven for a while now.When I looked on Amazon, as I usually do, I found this one. I couldn't believe when it arrived that it was just as heavy, sturdy, and looked wonderful to cook in, as all the very expensive ones. Then I used it. Believe me you won't be disappointed! I am a gourmet cook, and yes I didn't have a Dutch Oven before,but I am very happy I have a great one now for a great price! And it is beautiful too in the vibrant Island Spice Red.
