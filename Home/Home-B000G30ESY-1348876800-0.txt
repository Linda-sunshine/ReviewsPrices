review/summary: Easy To Use Rice Cookerreview/text: My wife and I enjoyed a fabulous dinner prepared by our daughter-in-law, Van, in San Francisco recently. We asked her how she got the rice cooked so well. She said "with my Zojirushi NS-LAC05XT Micom 3-Cup Rice Cooker". I wrote down the name and model number and when we arrived home ordered one for my wife. She has prepared rice in it for several meals and the rice always comes out done (not soggy or burned). To use the TV commercial guy's famous line, "set it and forget it"! The 3 cup model cooks enough rice for four. And if more people simply cook another batch quickly. My wife does not like to read technical manuals on how to use a product. She just pressed the digital buttons on the front panel and made her selections and continued preparing other dishes. On the other hand, I did have to read the manual to learn how to set the clock to the correct time. Van has owned her Zojirushi NS-LAC05XT Micom 3-Cup Rice Cooker for 3 years and said it has never failed to cook perfect rice for her!
