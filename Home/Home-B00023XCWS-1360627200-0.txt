review/summary: Does not last longreview/text: The on / off switch went bad after 4 months of daily use. The taste was very off...the plastic taste was very pronounced. Also, very easy to burn from steam leak when moving to pour and from over slosh of boiled water when pouring. Very dissappointing! A total waste of money...I will be replacing with one that is stainless or glass.
