review/summary: Heavy duty!review/text: Like many Christopher Kimball/Cooks Illustrated disciples, I consulted the equipment ratings for stand mixers. This 600 series mixer received stellar reviews, and Amazon's price sealed the deal.This is a HEAVY-duty mixer capable of great culinary achievements! (Did I mention, it's HEAVY?). The favorite thus far is whole wheat pizza crust. This mixer works like a charm! It's sleek, easy to clean, and Amazon shipping dazzled again. This mixer is a definite foodie must-have, and a great value.
