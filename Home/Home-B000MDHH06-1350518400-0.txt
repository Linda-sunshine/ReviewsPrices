review/summary: Was going to return it but forgot it in my car for three monthsreview/text: The unit works moderately well but doesn't "chew" the food up enough and you get a lot of waste, which in this day and age with the cost of food is maddening. Its also a bit difficult to clean. I think we should have just paid more and got a better one. Now this is going to make a very nice gift for someone else.
