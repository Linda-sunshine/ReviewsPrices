review/summary: light weight,does a great jobreview/text: I wanted a light weight vacuum and the Hoover Flair fit the bill. I also needed a vacuum that you can turn off the roller brush.Once again, Hoover Flair has that option. Now the good news, &#34;It does a great job.&#34; I have wood and tile floors throughout myhouse.
