review/summary: Amazing for making single-serve strong coffee/espressoreview/text: The Aerobie has worked great for me for over a year. It works really well for making small amounts of strong coffee, so when I want a lot of coffee I stick to the regular coffee pot system.The quality of flavor you get is among the best I've ever tried. It seems like it requires a lot of grounds (I think two-ish heaping tablespoons to get maybe half a cup of espresso) but it's worth it.
