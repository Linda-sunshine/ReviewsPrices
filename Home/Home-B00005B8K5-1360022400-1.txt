review/summary: Cult of Pyrexreview/text: Everyone in my life has received this set at one point or another, whether Christmas, Birthdays, House Warmings, Weddings, or just random occasions. I am a total convert to this product. Here's why:-Nesting Storage:Doesn't always work when you mix and match sets, but generally you can nest three different sizes inside each other.-Durable:I have dropped these on occasion, and they've survived. They've been through the dishwasher, lid and bowl, top and bottom shelf. Medium bowls have been broiled for french onion soup, all have been frozen and microwaved.-Insulated:Pour hot soup into one of the bowls and you have a good minute before the bowl gets hot enough to be uncomfortable. Plenty of time to lid and transfer to your freezer.-Convenient:My main use aside from leftovers is food prep. Buy 5 pounds of ground beef. Cook all of it, then separate out by pound into these containers and freeze. When you go to make dinner, simply microwave the beef and add to recipe. Cuts cooking time down massively.I can't say enough about Pyrex Storage. The display cabinet in my kitchen is basically a shrine to this product. You won't regret your purchase.
