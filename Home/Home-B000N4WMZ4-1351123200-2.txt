review/summary: it has performed admirably.review/text: If you'd like own this unique and indispensable kitchen tool without paying a huge premium for that French one, this one should make your top picks list. I've only had it for a couple of months, but have used it 4 times and it has performed admirably. The lid seals well and cleanup is a breeze.
