review/summary: Great juicer!review/text: I have only owned one juicer in the past before I ordered this one. I must say, I am pretty impressed. The price is good. It preforms well. It takes up very little space. And clean up is easy. I have only used it a few times. It has breezed through everything IO've tried so far: Whole carrots, whole apples (one at a time), whole stalks of celery, pineapple, and broccoli stalk. I love it! It makes juicing so easy. I'd absolutely purchase it as a gift, and recommend it to others.I looked around for a while to find what would be best for me. I am pleased with my choice. I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't tried things like ginger, or beets yet. I'm shire it will juice them easily though.
