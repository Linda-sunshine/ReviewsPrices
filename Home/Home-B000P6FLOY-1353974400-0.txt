review/summary: Melted on my strove top!!review/text: This was a well thought out product in design, look and feel. Plus I was happy with the price too. In fact I was raving about it.Plus, this is a stove top thermometer...with an excellent instant temperature probe and has worked great as such......until yesterday. While cooking on top of my stove, I also had my oven up to 525 F for pizza we were making. No problem, didn't think anything of it.The next morning I walk out and noticed I had left the Polder on overnight, so I reach for it to turn it over and turn it off (switch is on the bottom next to the battery compartment). Shocked, I find half of the bottom had melted, freezing the on-off switch in the on position and warping the battery door shut.I notice they don't allow you to leave pictures here which is sad as I have three.Note, this unit was equal distance between any surface burner and sitting where it has sat for many a recipe over the past month plus (got it on October 8th). The only change yesterday was the oven was up to 525 F (where my normal cooking is around 425 max).Worse, Amazon is saying (at least on their online returns site) that my time to return it has expired. So I now have a lengthy discussion with them and the maker of this product to get a refund.They dropped the ball on their materials research; wrong material for the base of their unit with poor heat dissipation properties.
