review/summary: I loved this vaccumreview/text: I don't know why we keep getting bum products from Amazon... this vaccum is so great for me. I manage two apartment buildings and I am responsible for vacuuming and general cleaning. One of the buildings is all stairs and the owner of the building bought an Oreck upright vaccum for me to clean with. It was very cumbersome so I started looking for something small and portable I could keep in my car when I go to clean. This little guy was perfect for the first couple months until the switch started shorting out on me. Now, to get it to turn on, I have to wiggle the switch several times to get it to come on, and wiggle it even more to get the rollers to engage. I think my husband can fix that, so I'm not too concerned there; but, recently, when I turn it on, a cloud of dust comes out of the back. I don't know if this is from being in the back of my car all the time or if I'm not cleaning the filter as often as I should. Either way, I'm disappointed that my vacuum doesn't work. That being said, when this one dies, I may still buy another and try to take better care of it and see where I get.
