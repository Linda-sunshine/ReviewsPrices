review/summary: Great Juicerreview/text: I had been looking into purchasing a juicer for about 2 months, I had done my research and found that this one would be the best to fit the needs of myself and my family. I have to say I am very happy with my purchase. I have been using this juicer for about a week.This juicer is very powerful, it makes it way through hard vegetables with ease and the pulp comes out very dry.&#34;Hard to juice&#34; leafy greens and wheat grass are juiced with ease.Assembly and cleaning are a breeze.The only draw back I can find at this point is the size of the shoot. It does increase prep time, but this does not outweigh all of the great things about this machine.I would recommend this juicer to anyone who is serious about starting juicing and making a journey to better health.
