review/summary: So far (after a week) doing great at dehumidifying our bathroomreview/text: We have a small bathroom ventilated only by a ceiling fan and have had trouble with mold. We've only had this dehumidifer for a week, so no opinion so far about its robustness, but so far it seems to be doing an excellent job: when showers make it very humid in there, this dehumidifier is taking a good quarter-cup of water out of the air over the course of maybe 3 hours. It's also quiet, certainly less noisy than the existing ceiling fan, and it doesn't take up much space. For us, this seems to have been a good choice as long as it holds up.
