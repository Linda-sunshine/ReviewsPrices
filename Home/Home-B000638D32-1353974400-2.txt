review/summary: Impressive for the pricereview/text: We chose this knife based on America's Test Kitchen recommendation. It has lived up to the expectations we had going in - it handles all of our daily prep needs and has become the favored knife in our kitchen. Both my husband and I find it comfortable and easy to use, something that isn't always the case with his hands being considerably larger than mine.
