review/summary: Getting Better With Each Usereview/text: My luck with cookware of this make has been uneven. That includes the heating properties, also uneven. With each successive use, this pan gets better and better. I do clean the pan immediately after each use, which prevents buildup on the surface that impairs even heating. Beats the comparable make griddle, both used on a gas stove. Just today, fried eggs did not stick, and hash browns browned evenly and flipped easily.
