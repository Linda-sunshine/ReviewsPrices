review/summary: Perfect for a couplereview/text: This coffee maker is perfect for a couple. I have not had any problems other people mention with spillage nor with clock going crazy. I have used it for several months and the clock is as I set it.The delay brew function works as expected and the auto shutoff works great for when you forget to turn it off after having coffee.If you dont need more than a standard (8oz) cup of coffee this is the coffee maker for you. It works great!
