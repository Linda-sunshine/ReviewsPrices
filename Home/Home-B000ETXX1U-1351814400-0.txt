review/summary: sturdy air bedreview/text: Our guests are arriving this weekend and based on other reviews I set up the bed a few days ago. There is a strong plastic odor at first, but it dissipates over a few days. The pump is fairly noisy, but fills up within a few minutes. The sides of this airbed are sturdy, and you can actually sit along the edge without sliding off. The height of the bed is great at 22", not too low. When you purchase sheets, be sure to get deep pocket sheets. I'm really pleased with the quality of the bed & look forward to hearing what our guests have to say. I am topping the bed with a mattress cover and eventually with a feather bed for added comfort.
