review/summary: Doesn't stack upreview/text: I purchased this coffee maker to replace a six year old Mr Coffee FTX45, to which the Cuisinart is similar. I immediately regretted it, without even tasting the coffee. First of all, there is no exterior water level indicator - the only indicator is inside the reservoir, and you have to look directly down into the unit to see it. Useless. Second, the eensy weensy little digital clock display is useless. It's very small and not illuminated, and it's recessed a little bit so that the only way to see what it's saying is to get up close and peer directly at it - not convenient if your coffeemaker - like mine - is located at counter level! Third, there is no brew strength control. You take what the Cuisinart gods give you. Fourth, it seemed difficult to program, compared to the Mr Coffee.On the upside, it is a really good looking model, and it might make a good cup of coffee. I'll never know - the missing features were an immediate deal breaker for me, and I took it back to the store without brewing anything.In short, it compared very poorly with my six year old Mr Coffee, which isn't dead but showing signs of old age. Apparently the FTX45 - with a big, legible digital-analogue clock face - is still sold, and I'm going to snap another one up quick!
