review/summary: Just what I wantedreview/text: I don't drink coffee everyday and my husband makes his too strong for my taste in the full--size coffeemaker. This product is perfect for when I feel like a cup of coffee. Once I figured out how much coffee to put in, I haven't been disappointed with the taste.I've had it for a few weeks now and haven't encountered any problems with it. It brews quickly, it's hot and the stainless steel mug helps keep it hot. I'm glad I bought this and would purchase it again.
