review/summary: I'm buying Anotherreview/text: I have owned this model coffee maker for at least 8 years, and it has come along through several moves. My favorite feature is I can program it so that the coffee is ready for me when I walk into the kitchen in the morning. Very nice for us not-awake, not-morning people!It has finally quit working (won't take up water), but I feel I've certainly gotten my money's worth out of this pot. I believe I paid $99 for it back then, and the new price is lower. I'll be ordering another!
