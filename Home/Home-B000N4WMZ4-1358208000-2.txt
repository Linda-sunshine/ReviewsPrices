review/summary: Love it!review/text: I spent weeks reading reviews and trying to decide what Dutch oven to get. I went to Williams-Sonoma and checked out the expensive ones. I decided to go with the less expensive brand, thinking if I didn't like it, I then would splurge and get one of the pricey ones. I am so glad, I went with the Lodge. This is a very nice pan and does just what I bought it for. I have made Arroz con pollo, French onion soup and pot roast in it. Looking forward to a lot more.
