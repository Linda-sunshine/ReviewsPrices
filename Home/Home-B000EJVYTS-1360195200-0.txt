review/summary: I FIXED IT BY SMACKING IT.review/text: Mine stopped working for a few days after 18 months of use, I replaced the batteries and the lights worked but no motor function. I emailed itouchless who responded in 15 minutes and asked me to troubleshoot and retry. That did not work, still no motor sound. I was going to take it apart (I don't think its possible) but instead I gave it a few good whacks. I know that's the first thing I should have done, but anyway it's working fine now. I was a day away from tossing it or ordering another lid for $40, so maybe this can help you. Good luck.Something else I just remembered: there is a rectangular plastic piece that the garbage bag fits over which is then fitted onto the inside of the can (essentially it hides and holds the bag inside). This broke a few months back, and I WISH THEY WOULD MAKE A METAL ONE because plastic, especially thin plastic, will eventually crack, or get stepped on. I superglued the piece and reinforced it with electrical tape, but I don't like vulnerable plastic pieces.Some tips:1) I use a scented garbage bag, the thing with the deodorizer wore out and I didn't see the point of buying another one2) Clean regularly! Especially if you let the trash get to the top... like any can it needs some attention to prevent stink.Overall, I do love the iTouchless. My wife and I are so used to this that living without it has been very, very difficult.I went to toss out some chopped veggies and was left without a way to open the garbage. I literally had to go back to the counter, put down my knife, OPEN the lid, pick up the knife to scrap the refuse in the bin, put down the knife and the cutting board, and CLOSE the lid again. Never again.
