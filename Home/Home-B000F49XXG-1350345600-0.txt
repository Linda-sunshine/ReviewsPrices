review/summary: Bang for the buck!review/text: So I got this machine about 2 weeks ago. After a bit of experimenting I managed to pull really smooth shots! Very happy. The steamer works good as well. The froth tends to be on the watery side, but you still manage to make delicious latte/cappuccinos once you gain the skills ;) !! Over all very happy with my purchase. Of course I am not comparing it with an expensive machine, but if you're looking for a cheap entry level machine, definitely recommended. (The only question is, how long will this last? haha! Cause if it breaks, it definitely doesn't worth fixing as you will most probably exceed the price of the machine!)
