review/summary: owned ours 2 yearsreview/text: As the title says, we have had ours 2 years. Problems: The prime light is always blinking. The fix, I pull the water reservoir and reseat it. Someone said they unplug theirs. I have not tried that. 89% of the time we get the right size drink. Very annoying when you get a very short drink. We do not use any filters on our machine. We have a filter on our refrigerator already that cleans the water. I would never consider using tap water on this thing. Most of you people are buying the machine to use the fancy K cups. Yes they are nice but they are expensive. We can make a cup of coffee for a about 3 or 4 cents verse the 40 plus cents on those cups. It takes a lot of discipline not to use those cups and clean the mesh screen of the reusable filter you have to buy separately. We have only had the one reusable filter as well. Never over tighten that or you will crack the lid. So far my husband has not overtightened it and he is a freak about tightening things.I would say the coffee maker has helped us stop wasting so much coffee. Before I was throwing out a near full pot every afternoon. For the price of coffee that was a lot of waste. It seems insane to spend $150 just to get water hot but we have enjoyed it. I do love the K cups but that is something we only do very rarely. The thing is, we still have the option.Three stars is what it gets though. The primer light drives me nuts. No matter how many times I clean the coffee maker it does not fix the problem.
