review/summary: Very Powerfulreview/text: I have had this vacuum for about 2 weeks now and I love it. It is so much quieter than the Dirt Devil vacuum that I was replacing. The other vacuum still worked, but it sounded like a jet taking off and my husband had to leave the kitchen every time I used it (I will admit to using it sometimes for spite if I was irritated at him, just to make him leave the room - a little passive/aggressive tactic). I mainly purchased this to use on tile in the kitchen and bathrooms, but I decided to try it on the stairs instead of using the attachment on my regular vacuum. I could not believe the amount of cat hair that this vacuum picked up from my stairs. I was doing them with the regular vacuum attachment every week, but when I used this I removed a softball sized amount of cat hair. When I showed it to my husband, the blood drained from his face and he wrinkled his nose in disgust at the thought of all that hair on the stairs (and this is from a man who rarely notices whether or not the house is clean). This does a great job on the laundry room tile, picking up all of the cat litter and spilled pieces of cat food in one pass. I don't normally write reviews, but I am so happy with this purchase that I had to let other people know about it.
