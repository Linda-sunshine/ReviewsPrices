review/summary: great for one yearreview/text: This garbage can was wonderful for one year. I only had to change the batteries once, the opening/closing mechanism started getting a little mixed up at about 9 months, and then the plastic around the open/close sensor peeled off. Next, the plastic around the hinge where it opens and closes started deteriorating until finally the lid broke off. The price was good compared to other electronic garbage cans, but if it only lasts for a year, not worth it. Back to the foot pedal garbage cans...
