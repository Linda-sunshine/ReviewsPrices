review/summary: Great little vacuumreview/text: So far, so good! Very powerful for a small vacuum. Works better than my Dyson for cleaning under sofa cushions. Only negative thing so far is that I feel the need to clean the filter each time I use it because it looks so dirty when I'm done. Other than that, great item.
