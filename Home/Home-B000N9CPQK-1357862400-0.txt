review/summary: works fine but the bright green lights are obnoxiousreview/text: reasonably quiet,and works well, but isn't there a better way to let me know the system is on other than to have a garrishly bright green light to do it? I use it in the bedroom to keep the dog's dander under control but the lights I have to cover or keep part of the cleaning system off.
