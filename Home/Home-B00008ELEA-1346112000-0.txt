review/summary: Farberware Coffee Potreview/text: The product, a 12-cup faberware Percolator, Model FCP412, worked fine for 3-months and then slowly would not heat pot to complete percolation. Now we only get luke warm, clear water when plugged in, using cold water as per instructions. We have had this type pot in the past and only replaced it because the cord to pot connection became faulty.
