review/summary: So far - So goodreview/text: Got caddy Monday. Applied strips, cleaned textured tile shower wall, placed caddy, removed caddy for bracket, and pressed down on brackets for 30-60 seconds. Let stay until Wednesday morning, rehung caddy, loaded with soap, shampoo, and cream rinse. Took shower using products. Got home this evening and everything is as I left it.Gave 4 stars because some other color besides just white to chose from would be nice.
