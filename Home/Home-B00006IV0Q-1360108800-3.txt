review/summary: Best Method of Home Brewing We Have Foundreview/text: The design of this coffee maker has not changed in years and if it has the changes were minor. The old saw, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it", was apparently taken to heart by Presto. A sturdy, well-balanced, easy to use attractive kitchen appliance that has been brewing up some of the best coffee we've ever made in our home.Easy cleaning as well.My wife and I are simple folk and we look forward to our morning cups of coffee and all the more so because we've come to rely on the Presto to dish out some great coffee and it always comes through for us. When guests drop in, no worries, while we chat the Presto perks and in minutes we're serving it up to their enjoyment.We take good care of it as it takes good care of us!
