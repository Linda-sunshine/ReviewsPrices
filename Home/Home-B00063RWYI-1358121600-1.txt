review/summary: Extremely versatilereview/text: Previously we had a camp dutch oven which means that it has legs and is not usable on most stove tops but is great for cooking while camping, or outside with charcoal, it was also too heavy to use effectively in the oven for baking bread and the like. Not this one, it is much lighter and works equally well on the stove top and in the oven. My wife says that if there were just one piece of oven equipment that she could keep and had to get rid of all the rest then this would be it. Works great for soups, stews, baking bread, stir frying, cooking steaks, hot smoking fish and chicken, and much else. It is not too heavy and as long as one is familiar with the very simple basic care of cast iron it is super easy to clean.Since it is Cast Iron it retains its heat very well allowing one to take it out of the oven and continue cooking for quite some time or to turn off the heat on the stove and still cook; something to be aware of, very useful if one knows it, possibly frustrating if one expects it to work like glass or nonstick pans.
