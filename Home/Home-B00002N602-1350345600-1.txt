review/summary: My second Pressure cookerreview/text: My firstPresto 01781 23-Quart Pressure Canner and Cookeris for canning. It is this huge cooker, not for your everyday meal. I picked the 4 quart cooker for its' size. I want to make smaller sized meals. If you give me a large pot, I am going to fill it up! Then I have to deal with all the left overs. This cooker is the right size for two with plenty of left overs for the week. My first recipe was with dried beans (black, pinto) for chili. The booklet said only cook for 3 min. after the quick soak (one hour). I did't believe that was possible. Because I have tried to cook dried bean on the stove top and it took hours and hours. And they still weren't done to my liking. So I left the beans in about five min. they were almost over cooked, tender and delicious!I am going to love this cooker. Next up is tough cuts of beef. See what I can do with them. Keep in mind you can only fill it 2/3 full while cooking with pressure. I believe this so food particles don't get trapped in the vent.The basic theory is you cook the longest cooking time ingredient first. Let's say, chuck roast then you release the pressure when almost done. That's the time you add Potatoes, onions seasonings and carrots. After reading the booklet for cooking times and recipes it is almost faster then a microwave oven.....REALLY!
