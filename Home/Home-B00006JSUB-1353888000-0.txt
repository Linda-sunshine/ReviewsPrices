review/summary: Manufacturing Defectreview/text: I have just received this item and unfortunately, it's defective. We have to return it and I have requested for replacement. This is a major disappointment. We were waiting for this for a long time. Also repacking and labeling return material is an added effort slapped on the consumer although it's not the consumer who is at fault.
