review/summary: Best popper I've had and this is my thirdreview/text: Before you think this is too cheap and won't last because this was my third one, I should say that each of the others survived at least 2 household moves and 3 to 4 years of use by a serious popcorn hound! My husband snacks on popcorn while watching football, movies and other times and probably makes popcorn at least once a week on average (sometimes twice on a Saturday). The only problem we've had is after a few years of use the plastic gear at the end of the crank handle came off the previous one and the whole crankshaft came apart. Still, can't complain after using a few years. My first one got dented during moves but still worked 3 or 4 years. Great little popper, but I wish I could find the larger capacity (> 6qt). Have recommended to all my friends.
