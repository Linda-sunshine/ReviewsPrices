review/summary: And I thought I was high maintenance...review/text: This product was great while it lasted. Grilled my chicken to perfection. Make sure to clean it right away after using it or else you will exert all your focus and energy trying to clean it later. DO NOT, I REPEAT IT, DO NOT leave it in the sink. EVER. Rookie move on my behalf, with the rust and all, but nonetheless taking care of it is too much to handle.
