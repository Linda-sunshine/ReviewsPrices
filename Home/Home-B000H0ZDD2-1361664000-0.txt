review/summary: Two years and going...review/text: Bought this in March 2011 to put in my bathroom. My house is mostly dry-ish, but with 3 of us using 1 shower, the main bathroom was never quite getting dry. Until I put this on the counter between the sinks. Now, the bathroom is dry in fairly short order after the bathing is done, and it's been going strong for 2 years, now. Just remember to dust off the vents on the front, from time to time, and you're in great shape.
