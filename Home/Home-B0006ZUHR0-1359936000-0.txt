review/summary: Great Ironreview/text: This is a great Iron. I've used it about 3 times a week for about four years. Excellent steam control and can be used to steam clothes very effectively in the vertical position using the push button. Heats up quickly and I appreciate the beep telling you it has reached it's programmed temperature. Sturdy and works well. I was careful with the water fill covering based on other reviews and had no problems.
