review/summary: Works as advertized - suited our needs very well!review/text: We were looking for something light and agile enough to use on stairs and for small jobs but with some real vacuum power. This was to be a supplement to our powerful, but cumbersome upright vacuum. The Eureka Hand-Held works very well. Certainly much more power than any cordless model I've tried. Also the separate motor that drives the roller helps with the cleaning action.The hose and attachments are very convenient and work well. Yes - the hose is short (as some reviews point out) but long enough. The unit is light enough to take the hose-end to the job!Emptying and keeping the filter clean is easy.The only reason I did not give 5 stars was lack of a longer hose and even stronger performance!
