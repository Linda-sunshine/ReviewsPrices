review/summary: Very Good Coffeemakerreview/text: The Cuisinart 12 cup programmable coffeemaker has met my expectations in most ways, and exceeded them in one. First, it looks as good in person as it does in internet photos. Second, it came out of the box almost fully assembled, and was easy to put immediately into use. Third, the quality of the coffee it makes is very good; it consistently brews my chosen coffees to taste as I would expect them to. Fourth, unlike many other coffeemakers I have tried, the stop and serve feature actually works. Fifth, it's very nice not to have to worry about a bottom heating element or an overheated carafe. The way in which it exceeded my expectations is that despite the absence of an exterior heating element, the insulated carafe truly does keep the coffee drinkably hot all day.I have two very minor gripes. First, it's quite tall, and won't fit under most kitchen cabinetry. As a result, it takes up precious open counter space in the kitchen. Second, it's not easy to clean the carafe's interior. You'll want to get a spiral, tube-cleaning type brush.
