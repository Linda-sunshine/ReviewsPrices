review/summary: Super griddle!review/text: A little over a year ago, when our third child started eating pancakes for breakfast with the rest of the family, I noticed just how long it was taking to make breakfast. Trust me, three young, hungry children will not let you forget that they are hungry! So when we had our fourth child in March, my husband found and purchased this griddle. We love it! Weekend breakfasts now take less than half the time to make, and there isn't as much "Mom, I'm hungry!" going around.I have never noticed any hot spots on the griddle, and it cooks everything perfectly. Aside from pancakes, I have used it to cook sausage, bacon, and even hamburgers. It did a great job with the burgers, but there was grease splatter to clean up (obviously).If you have a large family or are just tired of using two or three pans to make your breakfast, get this griddle. You won't be disappointed!
