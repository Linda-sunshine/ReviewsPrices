review/summary: Fantastic stand mixerreview/text: Finally, after years and years of wanting a KitchenAid stand mixer, I have one! I received one for Christmas. It's Cornflower Blue and looks so wonderful in my blue kitchen. The mixer and components are very well made and sturdy feeling ... nothing cheap or plastic-y with this unit. I made pumpkin bars to initiate my mixer and they turned out FAB. I can't wait to make more yummy baked goods in the weeks and years to come. It was a bonus that the mixer was assembled in the USA. Now, they just need to make all those parts here too! I'm so happy with my beautiful new KitchenAid Stand Mixer.
