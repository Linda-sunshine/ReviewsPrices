review/summary: Smooth flavor, beautiful crema, and no bitternessreview/text: I purchased this after seeing a mention of it in a magazine, and ended up lending it to a friend who liked it so much, I let him keep it. In the meantime, my co-worker got one, and I was reminded of how fantastic this little device is, so it was time to order a new one. We've taken to taste-testing it against other people's French Presses and other methods of coffee-making, and we win every time. Smooth flavor, beautiful crema, and no bitterness is what you get out of an Aeropress. The filters last forever, and the little &#34;puck&#34; of coffee at the end is great for putting into your compost or right into the garden.
