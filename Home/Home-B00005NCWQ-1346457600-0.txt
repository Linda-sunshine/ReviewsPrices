review/summary: Excellent productreview/text: Finally, after buying many coffee maker alternatives.....THIS inexpensive stove top coffee percolator wins! Fits my glass-top range burner beautifully and it boils up and percolates just like my parents did back in the 60's! All stainless steel. I also bought the glass top that Amazon recommends for this unit and I'm not disappointed. The plastic top that comes with it is ok, but we just don't like it as much as the glass top. Glass top fits like a glove, doesn't leak at all and big enough that you can see the color of your coffee to judge the strength. A cinch to clean. I buy my filters at Costco and just cut a small circle out of 'em so they'll fit in the basket and then cut a hole in the middle..perfect fit! The paper filters are NOT needed, but I prefer them for a nearly clean run of coffee. The entire house fills up with the rich coffee aroma from the oils being expressed repeatedly.....rather than a 1 time pass from a drip coffee maker. Reason we bought it: I missed the rich flavors of perked coffee from my teen years in the 60's. And we felt terrible about throwing away all those used plastic K-cups into the garbage! Thinking about getting another one for our travel trailer too!
