review/summary: Have used one for over 20 yearsreview/text: I just ordered this, so I haven't actually used this particular model. But I have been using a Black & Decker one-cup "Brew 'n Go" coffee maker for 20 years (maybe 25; I can't remember exactly). I use it at home on weekends (so use only twice a week). I just ordered this one for the office, where we have a bigger machine, but occasionally I need to make only a single cup, which is why I bought this.
