review/summary: Works great!review/text: I bought it a month ago. It was packaged well. Always read the manual before using. I have prepared a few kinds of dough and everything came out as I wanted it. There are four attachments that come with this one and you can buy more if you need. This mixer looks great and is now the king of my kitchen. I do plan to come back and update this review in a few months.
