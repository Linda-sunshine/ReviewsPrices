review/summary: adequatereview/text: I don't love this vacuum, but I don't hate it either. I took a chance since the positive reviews far outnumbered the negative ones. I share many of the concerns noted in the less-positive reviews. While it does seem to pick up dirt and hair, I do feel I need to empty the filter half way through vacuuming my stairs. It still picks up pet hair, but it's difficult to know it if is getting the unseen dirt and dust. This vacuum is larger, heavier and more cumbersome that the hand-held stair attachment that is no longer working on my canister vacuum. But, this was less expensive than a replacement attachment. The electric cord is long enough to do a full set of stairs.
