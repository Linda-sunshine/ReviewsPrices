review/summary: Great for my needs!review/text: I have had this toaster for about 6 years, and I absolutely love it. I need to replace it, not because of a design flaw, but because of user error on behalf of my hubby. Regardless, I will be purchasing this toaster again. Great for making quick work out of toast, burritos, pizza rolls, cheesy garlic bread, etc. No, it is not very deep, but we just make adjustments with what we are trying to make.
