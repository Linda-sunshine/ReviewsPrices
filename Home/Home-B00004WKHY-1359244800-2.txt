review/summary: In Lovereview/text: After never allowing myself to purchase a decent processor, I'm completely in love with this one. There is nothing revolutionary about it--it works, and works well. I would gladly spend the extra money for this one again instead of trying to use and immersion blender for everything or using a cheap machine who's motor burns every time its used.
