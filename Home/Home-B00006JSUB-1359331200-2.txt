review/summary: Great productreview/text: It cooks great out of the box. It is heavy, but its cast iron, so that was to be expected.It was seasoned well, and surprisingly for its heft, it heated up rather quick on our electric stove top.A word of caution, if you have a easy clean glass electric stove top, and you're particular about how it looks, pay close attention to not scratch the stove surface. We haven't, and not sure if we could, but regardless we are gentle with it when cooking.
