review/summary: Comfortable and sturdyreview/text: Bought this for my daughter to use for the summer while away for a summer job. She used it all summer without any problems. It held air and after the first few days of getting used to it she really liked it. Easy to inflate and easy to deflate. Highly recommend if you are needing something easy to move and use for a short term basis.
