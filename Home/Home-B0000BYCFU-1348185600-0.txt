review/summary: Presto Pressure Canner/Cookerreview/text: I looked and looked and after many comparisons decided on the Presto Pressure Canner/Cooker.It is well built, comes with the bottom rack and mine also came with a 15 lb requlator.After reading and "Following" all instruction cooked some veggies and canned them in the Presto. It worked great and was very easy to use. Directions are straight forward, easy to understand and quite helpful.I would recommend the pressure canner/cooker to anyone intent on doing home canning from a small to large amount. Grat product.
