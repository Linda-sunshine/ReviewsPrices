review/summary: an essential resource in the kitchenreview/text: I've been using Silpats regularly for about 10 years now. They are a little pricey for what they are, but they make baking (bread and cookies, in our household) much easier, and cleanup is a breeze. They wear out after a while, and I suspect that might be sped up by the number of times I've used it above its max-rated temperature, which is something like 425 degrees F. Even worn, however, they seem to work as well as they did brand-new, they just look a bit frayed on the edges and have accumulated some brown stains. They make good housewarming gifts because they are often the sort of thing that casual cooks don't think to get for themselves but find invaluable once they have them. Give at least two, since that allows for prep on one sheet while the other is in the oven.
