review/summary: Effortless device once used correctlyreview/text: Maybe I didn't read the instructions well enough. When 1st pressing the button to insert screw in the cork it takes several seconds to complete while holding the bottle at its base. Initially, I considered sending it back, but my son-in-law explained that I wasn't holding it in place long enough. Sure enough, it came easily out of the bottle, then pressing the other button, the cork extends out to be removed. The foil remover/cutter is a nice touch, too.
