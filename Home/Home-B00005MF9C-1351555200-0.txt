review/summary: Best little coffeemaker!review/text: I started with Starbucks Bistro, but like this one better. The Bistro was way more expensive and hard to find reasonably priced mugs. I liked the B&D so much, I ordered a second one for my travel trailer. It's easy to clean and with paper filters (#1s)it's a snap! More expensive is not always better. When all is said and done, hot water is hot water--it's what you put inside that makes the difference.
