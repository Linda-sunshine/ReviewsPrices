review/summary: Effective & affordablereview/text: I was pleased with the results after the very first use of the machine. It took a little more effort to assemble out of the box than I expected, but it's really user-friendly and gets the job done. Its tank holds enough water to clean a fairly large room without having to stop, but the cord is a little too short for large areas. I had to stop fairly often to move to a closer electrical outlet, but it wasn't enough of a negative to rate the machine less than 5-stars. I had already thoroughly cleaned the carpets with my new Dyson DC28, and this product still managed to pull out deep-down dust and debris to leave the carpet better than I imagined. I'm really glad I purchased this product and would recommend it to anyone.
