review/summary: The thermos I've always dreamed of...review/text: I'm going to get the only negative thing about this thermos out of the way first:It's fairly small, only holding 12-oz.That being said, everything else is phenomenal. It retains heat, cleans, seals, and travels better than any thermos I've tried before. Labeling it as a "tea tumbler" is really limiting its uses because it's perfect for any beverage. I love it enough to actually write a review (and that's saying something).
