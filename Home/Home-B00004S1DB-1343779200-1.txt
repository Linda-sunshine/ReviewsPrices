review/summary: Ehreview/text: There is no way the coffee will stay hot for the claimed 6 hours. Its hardly warm after about one. (Even after preheating the press.) The screen is also designed poorly, and does not seal against the spring and wall. I've used it 3 times and if had more and more grounds in it each time. I'll be returning it for something else.
