review/summary: Great humidifierreview/text: Humidifier works as described, is easy to use and keep clean as long as you sanitize it regularly. A simple white vinegar with water keeps it clean. Having it look like Thomas is a bonus for his fans. Only risk is making sure your child understands it is not a toy and not to be touched. So if your child is at a certain age and is able to grab things in his/her room, please keep this in mind.
