review/summary: Great for the moneyreview/text: We were looking for a larger dutch oven that didn't cost a fortune like Le Creuset. We have prepared several dishes in it already and really like it.We got the stainless steel knob on top. Glad Lodge listened to the reviews from customers. It cleans up well, even after browning stew meat, if you soak it and then I use a rough backed sponge to clean. Just remember to follow all care instructions because we had a Martha Stewart brand that we had to throw away because it chipped.
