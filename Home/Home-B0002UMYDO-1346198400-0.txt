review/summary: GET THIS ONE!review/text: My inexpensive Proctor Silex can opener lasted a good 20 years before it broke...so I went to a big box store and purchased an inexpensive ($20) Black & Decker. I knew after one use it was going back. It was loud and the motor whined like it was dying.Then to Amazon...all of the positive reviews got my attention and I ordered one in metallic. One reviewer also took the time to research brands and found that West Bend is the only manufacturer who will replace parts on their appliances.WE LOVE IT!!! It is absolutely handsome - love the design. It is quiet, attaches to the cans easily, has a bottle opener and knife sharpener on the back and I love, love, love that the cord can be hidden. It would be nice if the cord was automatically retractable but I'm not complaining. It is the nicest looking small appliance I have. Now I want a new toaster, blender, etc. to match this beauty lol! It looks like it costs more than it does. Great buy - don't miss this one!
