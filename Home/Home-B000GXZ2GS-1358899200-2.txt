review/summary: Love it! Get a Hotshot and you're all set...review/text: I use this on a daily basis with my Sunbeam HotshotSunbeam 6131 Hot Shot Hot Water Dispenser, Black. It's a very fast way to make a great cup of coffee inexpensively. If you're considering a Keurig or some other per-cup coffee solution, you'll find this makes better coffee with almost the same ease and cleanup.I use one scoop of coffee and fill with water... stir for 10 seconds, and plunge for 10 seconds to make mine and it's consistently great.
