review/summary: STICKING, CHIPPING - BOUGHT AS A CHRISTMAST GIFT AND NOW DON'T HAVE THE OPTION TO RETURNreview/text: I Bought this item for my sons girlfriend in Oct because I shop early for Christmas. It is supposed to already be seasoned, but it was sticking so bad she had to use soap to clean and something was chipping off the grill. That can't be too healthy, have to wonder what ended up in her food. So she looked online to see how to season it thinking that might help and it doesn't. She says everthing sticks to it really bad. Now I am trying to return it for her and it's past the time and can't return. Not a good policy especially for Christmast Gifts.
