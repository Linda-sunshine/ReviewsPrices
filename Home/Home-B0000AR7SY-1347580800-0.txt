review/summary: Poor Designreview/text: I bought this Capresso burr grinder to replace a cheap blade grinder. It seemed OK at first, though made of somewhat flimsy plastic. I must agree with the comments about it being hard to clean completely, with old coffee grounds inevitably remaining in the channel between grinder and receptacle. However, mine seemed to work fine until two days ago, when the bean hopper would not fit back onto the machine. Apparently, in trying to get it in, I pushed/rotated the tabs on the grinder mechanism underneath the white threads that rotate the grinder. This locks up the machine, and I could not figure out how to get it loose. Even tried pliers, which would have ruined it had I pulled hard enough. I came back and looked at the reviews here, remembering some other people had had this problem. Thankfully I saw "Tron's" review ("Design flaw? What design flaw?")because it had the remedy. I was able to fix it using a butter knife pushed into the black slot to rotate the housing counter-clockwise and retrieve the grinder mechanism, as instructed. It sure would have been nice if this fix had been included in the instruction manual. Anyway, I will continue to use it as long as it works, but would not buy another.
