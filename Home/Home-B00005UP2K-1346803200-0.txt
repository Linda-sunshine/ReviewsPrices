review/summary: A Dream Come Truereview/text: I have been dreaming about owning these mixers for years. After using the same model (different color) at a friends house for Christmas cookies it made me want to find one even more. We did some research & I found this one for a REALLY good price. After the rebates we'd be paying $$$ so we jumped and got it. It is definitely more beautiful in person than any of the pictures I found on line. It feels very solid and well made. After plugging it in we instantly noticed the power... it was all I hoped for. It doesn't skip a beat and I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone. This has made cooking so much easier everyday and I'm not sure what I did without it. I fully expect to never have to buy another mixer!
