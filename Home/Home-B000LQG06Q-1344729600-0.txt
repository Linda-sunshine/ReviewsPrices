review/summary: New life for an old mattressreview/text: We purchased this foam topper for a spare bedroom that had a mattress that was considered too firm for most older adults. After putting the topper on, my wife and I slept on it for a couple of nights to give it a try. What a difference! I wouldn't hesitate to offer this bed now to any visitor of any age.
