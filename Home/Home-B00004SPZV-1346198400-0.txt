review/summary: Just Bought a Second One for a Gift!review/text: I read the mixed reviews but decided to try out the Misto. I honestly don't know why there are mixed reviews - I have had my Misto for almost a year, it's used almost daily and totally rocks. Always works, never clogs, nice even mist, and an elegant exterior that looks nice if left on the counter. In fact, I like it so much I keep telling friends about it and just bought one for a relative as a gift.I have also used it with oils other than olive and it still works great. I can't honestly think of any way to improve upon this product, it does just what it claims to do.
