review/summary: Great Coffee Pot in a perfect colorreview/text: I had a rough time finding this specific coffee pot in the metallic red color. My husband is a professional Chef so the Kitchen is his. He has it done in red and cream with hickory cabinets. Every department store I went to had the black or the stainless steel colors. Thank goodness Amazon saved me with having the last one in stock This goes perfect in the Kitchen and my husband loves the removable filter so you can clean the inside of the machine. Brews wonderful and gives us a great cup of coffee every time!
