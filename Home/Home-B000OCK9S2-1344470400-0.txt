review/summary: Conair sound therapy clockreview/text: The sounds on this clock are excellant, very realistic. But you can't change the sound from the default to wake up to, which is what I wanted, only to go to sleep to. Also the face is bright enough to read by even at its dimmest, but the numbers don't stand out enough to read without my glasses, even at its brightest.
