review/summary: percolator Presto 12 cupreview/text: My Oster coffeemaker had broke after 8 years of use and couldn't find another. I spent a day looking for a replacement untill I found this presto percolator. All reviews looked great to me. This is smaller than my old coffeemaker and looks long lasting. You can't get any better than stainless.I ordered on Friday and I am now (Monday)enjoying my first cup. My coffee tastes better. It's truely given my coffee a boost.Also thanks to amazon for getting it to me quickly.
