review/summary: No thermostat it is either on or off with only two settings.review/text: Firstly I thought it was free shipping by buying it directly from Amazon - It cost an extra $10 shipping. I could have bought it for about $30 which included shipping but must have misread the Amazon ad and paid about $40 - That was the start -I also thought that the heat had a thermostat - It doesn't you are either on or off with only 2 setting.Not a happy camper with this deal.
