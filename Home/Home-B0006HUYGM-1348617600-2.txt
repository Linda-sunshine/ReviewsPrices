review/summary: BEST hand vac I've ever ownedreview/text: This amazing little vacuum is fantastic. It opperates exactly as the review states. I love the cord, which extends all the way up my 14 stairs. This is the first time that's been the case compared to others.I've read that the filter is too small. Unless you plan to vacuum your entire house, this is not the case. It held more than enough for all the cat hair that accumulates, which it efficiently picks up, and would have held more. Incidently, I have three cats, so it's also wonderful for uphosltery. Cleaning the filter is very easy and took 3 minutes with simple steps I devised. I simply brushed the heavy debris off with a whisk broom then rinsed it using my kitchen sink sprayer and allowed it to dry in the dish strainer.The only minor downside is that, to me, is that it seems heavy. But, I eliminated the weight by holding it underneath with my left hand. Highly recommended, especially for the price. Shipping was incredibly fast. I received it in 2 days with FREE shipping.
