review/summary: Great product great pricereview/text: Great product, water tank is easy to access, and comes out for easy filling. Heats fast and pressure is perfect for such a small machine. It's a little top-heavy though, so you have to hold it down when pulling in the espresso filter handle tight...but there is a benefit to that as well because the machine isn't ridiculously heavy, so you can easily put it away when not in use.
