review/summary: Decent little disposable vaccumreview/text: Pretty decent did it's job of sucking up stuff. Never really had a problem with this. I read bad reviews about it dying but decided to take my chances with it. 20 Months later mine died too :( I used it very little and i'm not sure why it died. I was cleaning one day and suddenly it just stopped working. I haven't checked the manufacture warranty but maybe i can get it replaced. We'll see...
