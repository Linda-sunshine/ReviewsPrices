review/summary: Nothing beats the smell of fresh breadreview/text: I have had this for about 2 weeks now and I love it. I have used it to make a few loaves of bread, cinnamon rolls, breadsticks and pizza dough. Its great. I love the seperate yeast addition, and the delayed bake cycle. I set it before bed and our house smells like fresh baked bread in the morning. Can't wait to use it in our camper.
