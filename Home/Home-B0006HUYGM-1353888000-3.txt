review/summary: Eureka hand-held vacuumreview/text: This vacuum is powerful, light, and can extend all over any given space, due to its long cord. Cleaning out the dust bin is no fun, but I don't know if there's any way around that. It's small enough to store easily on a closet shelf, too -- which is good, as it doesn't have any way to hang, and the cord doesn't have anything to wrap around. I'm very pleased with this vacuum and hope it lasts a long time!
