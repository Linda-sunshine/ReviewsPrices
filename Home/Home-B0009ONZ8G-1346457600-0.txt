review/summary: The vacuum sliced it's own electrical cordreview/text: Ordered this 5 months ago. Today it sliced it's own cord (like straw). Dangerous. Can't return.DON'T ORDER THIS PRODUCT.P.S. I called Hoover, this item is not covered under Warranty. I note we have had Hoover's for 30 years. I have never ripped a cord by going over it accidentally. Further, as the machine is quite awkwardly designed with attachments actually attached to the machine in various configurations, all of which are problematic, it is very difficult to use this without going over the cord.In any event, the cord is smaller than it used to be in diameter, thus making it easy to be swallowed by the vacuum. Hoover does not cover this, and the local dealer, who stated it would cost over $60.00 to replace the chord, which requires 45 minutes worth of work (Maytag this isn't), was quite rude when I stated I could not in good conscience buy Hoover again, stated "I frankly don't care whether or not you buy Hoover". So much for his customer base. Needless to say, he is apparently too lazy to want the business.Seriously, clearly Hoover is not what it used to be. Cheap is fine, but dangerous is not.
