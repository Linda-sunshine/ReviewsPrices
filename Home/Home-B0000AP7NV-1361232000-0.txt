review/summary: Fits easily in my refrigerator doorreview/text: The size is just fine for me, as I live alone. It fits pretty much anywhere in my fridge. It's more than enough to fill up a big water bottle. I pretty much refill it every time I use it, so I don't run out of filtered water. Good price and good product.
