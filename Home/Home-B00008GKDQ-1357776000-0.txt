review/summary: Far Better and Cheaper Than Factory Griddlereview/text: When I contacted Samsung Parts for the factory replacement griddle for our new FX510BGS gas range (it didn't come with one), they said that they were reluctant tto sell me the one for the FX710BGS since it was too short on some 510 ranges(!?!) - say what? So after looking around on several User Boards, someone recommended this Lodge Grill/Griddle. It's cast iron (rather than aluminum like the factory griddle) and two-sided as well. A little heavy, but fits perfectly on our range with no wobbles. Even heating and minimal cleaning/care needed. A great find!
