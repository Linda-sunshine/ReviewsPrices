review/summary: Where are the accessories?review/text: This mandoline works great, not really worth it for small batches, tricky for the cleaning part and rather flimsy on the storage side, but the most important question is:Where do we get the accessories from? Not at Amazon in the US, not anywhere in the US, barely Amazon in Germany, and only on the German site which does not translate into English!The 3.5 mm insert is great for many things but still too large for thin julienne (e.g. carrots salad), and the other 7mm insert is also great for many other things but still too thin for thicker julienne (e.g. real french fries). We need an importer and amazon US seller for the 1.6 mm and 10mm inserts, and other useful and popular accessories.
