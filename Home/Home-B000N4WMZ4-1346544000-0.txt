review/summary: not for cooking with red winereview/text: I bought this replacement pot for occasional cooking. My previous pot lasted me over 10 years. Yesterday after slow cooking a brisket of beef previously soaked in red wine the enamel got seriously stained. Nowhere in the page of "instructions" it said that I can't cook food soaked in wine! Here goes my coq-au-vin! Bleaching it for hours helped to eliminate the dark spots but the bottom of the pan is no longer white but specked and lightly stained. Now I had to waste enormous amount of energy and time to mail the heavy item back and get a replacement since the warranty expired in just one year. Amazon was, of course, very helpful, but just going through the rigamorole of returning such a heavy item: getting a carton box, packing and mailing it was a lot of tedious trouble. I really wish that the manufacturer read such reviews, and implemented some kind of quality control, so the poor sods like me won't get stuck with the inferior product.
