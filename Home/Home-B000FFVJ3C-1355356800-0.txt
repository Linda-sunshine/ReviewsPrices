review/summary: Your reviews were the best!review/text: I researched dehydrdators, relying heavily on the user reviews, then I ordered this one. It is fantastic. I also ordered the clean tray inserts for each level due to the customer recommendations, which was fantastic advice. As an example, I used my Cuisinant food processor to slice paper thin slices of Granny Smith apples yesterday. I distributed the apple slices onto the top of the clean tray inserts. Set the machine to &#34;fruits and vegetables&#34;. Two hours later, I was rewarded with apple chips that were unbelievably delicious and healthy. I removed the clean tray inserts and instead of pulling the ultra thin chips off, I bent them slightly and let the apple chips drop into a large bowl. There was virtually no residue to clean up from making the apple chips. The only problem is that they were all eaten way too fast, so I ordered more trays and clean liners to expand to 12 levels from the 5 the dehydrator comes with. My only wish is that the trays would fit in the dishwasher in a vertical position, but they are too tall, so I just stack them horizontally one upon the another and run everything but the top motor through the dishwasher. Of course, they are so big that they have to have their own dedicated dishwasher cycle.
