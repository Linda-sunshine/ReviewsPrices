review/summary: Not your grandmother's old dehydrator! Great buy!review/text: Love this dehydrator. Quiet, easy to use and fast! Comes with a great little book and have found many recipes on Youtube as well.Have been taking advantage of fresh fruit prices as well as the fruits that grow in the yard. Fruit leather has become the family and friends favorite. Looking forward to making jerky next.Easy to clean and the multi temp feature is an absolute plus. Comes with all the racks and trays but I bought two extra fruit trays for the leather. Good thing I did because the kids are eating fruit faster than ever. We even snuck in fruit rollups into the movies instead of candy.The price is certainly right for this product. Shipping was fast and we could not be happier!
