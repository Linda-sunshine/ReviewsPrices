review/summary: A surprise and welcome gift!review/text: After twenty-some years of marriage, it's fairly difficult to surprise my wife with a birthday gift. Not that a gift at all wasn't a surprise; we agreed not to buy gifts this year in lieu of a Caribbean vacation. But I wanted to give her something, and we had been scouring restaurants for the last couple of weeks on a quest for her to find waffles on the menu. It never occured to her that I would buy something like this. She loves it! It works very well; she has not burned one yet. A nice addition to our kitchen appliances indeed. T.
