review/summary: I love them but they keep breakingreview/text: I'm ordering my 3rd one now because the platic parts broke on the first two. I would have given I top stars but for this because I love them. While I would like them to be sturdier, I figure it is kid of my fault. Our tea makers get heavy usage - about 5x a day. The first one lasted about a year then my son dropped it it the sink and one little foot broke off. It wouldn't stay level without the foot, so I bought number two. It only lasted a month. My dad was washing some dishes after we had him over for dinner and he knocked it of the counter. The bottom broke apart so it is toast. I'm just glad I have the first one to hold me over till the next one comes.Before those I had a Teavana version that lasted 8+ years. We finally tossed it when it wouldn't come clean anymore. It didn't have a removable screen. Both of these ones did. I'm sticking with the Adagio version despite the breakage problems because I wonder though if the old Teavana was sturdier because was old enough to still have BPA. I've read that BPA is a plastic hardener. I would rather be more careful with the Adagio and be able to clean it.One last thing, the adagio is a hair taller. This only matters to me because I had a perfect storage spot for the Teavana, but the minuscule difference makes the Adagio not fit.
