review/summary: powerfull and easy to usereview/text: Man thus vacuum cleaner can suck up dirt. The thing is seriously strong for its size. It has a long power cord, about 25ft or so that gets stored at the back around the cleaner. There is an easy to use switch on the top that powers the unit on or off, and a 3rd setting to activate the roller brushes. (excellent for tiles or carpets)The only complaints I have, is with the noise, the neighbors are going to know you are cleaning the house. In addition to the dust bucket being finnegy to get out and back in. Make sure you have the unit over a dust bin or trash bag before opening it as it can spill dust all over. Lastly, although the pipe can be stored nicely on the unit, it is a bit short, a longer pipe or maybe an extension would be a nice addition.For the price, this unit rocks.
