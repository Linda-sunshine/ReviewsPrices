review/summary: it picks up so much dust and dirt that you can't even seereview/text: the floors in my house are pretty clean--no shoes allowed indoors and I have a cleaning lady come in every other week to do the heavy cleaning. I was just looking for something small and hand-held for the little messes that come from having a toddler in the house. I was shocked the first time I used this vacuum. I did just the rug under my dining room table and there was so much dust and crumbs that this picked up. it is heavy and a little awkward to lug around (like most hand-helds that work well), but the suction on it is incredible.
