review/summary: Cleaning is a bit problem, but still it is very good.review/text: It is believed in some part of Japan that fasting, say, in morning hours, may increase your immune system while you may take a cup of apple+carrot Juice or two. I started short hour fasting in the morning a couple of weeks ago, and using this Juicer to produce juice.It is delicious and I can believe that this machine destroys any nutrition in fruits in a least possible manner.I hope to continue this new habit until I reach 120 pounds with 5'-5&#34; tall.
