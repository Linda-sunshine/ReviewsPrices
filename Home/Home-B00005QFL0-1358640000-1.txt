review/summary: Excellent Bread Maker!review/text: Panasonic SD-YD250 Automatic Bread Maker with Yeast Dispenser, WhiteWe've had this bread machine for over 2 1/2 years now. It's been cranking out over two loaves a week since we've had it, with a little summer vacation thrown in because it deserves a little time off. No problems with moving parts or anything else.. It cleans easily (and be sure to do so). It does everything they say it will, perfectly. We make lots of dense multi-grains, and from time to time the dough is so dense that the rotor will bog down, even lock up (so we add a bit of water); this is hard on a motor - makes me cringe when I hear it - but it keeps running. I expect the people who report problems have their point, but if you make a few million of something, you're bound to make a couple of lemons, and I can't speak to Panasonic's help desk because I've never needed it. Just look at the review count. I think you can trust that the odds are very good that this machine will give you good service for many years. I've never had another machine, so I can't compare, but in absolute terms, I don't need anything better even if it's made. I only hope that when this one finally breaks, they still make one like it, because I'd buy another one in a heartbeat.
