review/summary: WOWreview/text: I am a huge coffee drinker and sometimes make one or 2 pots of coffee a day this coffee pot while expensive if you plan on buying the K cups is great. Me personally I bought the reusable K cup and love it it makes piping hot coffee at a moments notice it allows me to keep other flavors of coffee and tea around for guests and to be quite honest it just looks cool sitting on my counter radiating that nice blue light. I still have yet to find the perfect k cup for me but I think this is still a keeper for me. I have done some research that told me that these coffeemakers tend to go out at about 18 months but my plan for that is to keep my box and receipt handy and wait for that to happen before my one year warranty is up.
