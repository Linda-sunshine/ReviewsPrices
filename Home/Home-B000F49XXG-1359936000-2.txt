review/summary: Great for cappuccino.review/text: I've been using this now for 9 months, and daily, if not multiple times per day! I adore it! Wonderful crema, if espresso is pressed right. It does take some time to figure out the right process for the perfect cup (it says one thing, but I've found that 1 scoop, pressed lightly, then another 1/4th scoop then fully pressed works perfectly), and a few other adjusting details. Overall, its simple, fast, and easy to use and clean!My only complaint, and the reason it doesn't get five stars, is that the steamer is a bit lacking on strength. For milk it works great, but if you try to use the steamer to heat a cup of chai (tastes great that way if you are wondering), then you are out of luck! It will quickly lose power before the cup is even warm. And the steamer does leak a little on occasion, but I expected that as most do.
