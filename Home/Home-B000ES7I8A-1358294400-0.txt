review/summary: False advertisingreview/text: If you want this because it is suppose to be an 8 cup kettle buy something else. It barely heats 5 cups. The only reason I don't send it back is because my wife wanted it for Christmas and wanted the steel look. But she did think that it would heat 8 cups like our Braun does. I filled it to the max line but it is just under 5 cups.
