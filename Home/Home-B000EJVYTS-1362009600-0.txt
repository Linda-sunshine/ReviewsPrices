review/summary: I like itreview/text: It fits in the space that I needed it too and looks great. The price is amazing for such a well designed and manufactured can. Most trash cans (automatic or not) cost twice this. So I suggest this.Cons: The sensor is a little sensitive so walking by it will set it off sometimes, but it's more funny than not, you can pretend it is an inanimate object with a personality. &#34;No Trashy! You just ate!&#34; Tickles my silly bone.
