review/summary: Awesome Thermosreview/text: I just got my Thermos today and decided to test it out. I have to say, this thermos is legit. I followed the instructions on pre-heating the thermos before pouring in my coffee (boiling water) at 2PM today. Burnt my tongue around 4:30PM (which is a good thing, it means that the thermos is doing its job). It was at, what I consider the perfect temp, for the next two to three hours. And now at 10:40PM, my coffee is still warm. This is the best thermos (because it's also completely leak proof!) that I had ever had. You will get your money's worth with this product.I am so loving this thermos!
