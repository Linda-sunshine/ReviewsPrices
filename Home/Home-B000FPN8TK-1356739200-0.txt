review/summary: Making Tea Is So Easy!review/text: I bought some loose leaf tea online that I loved, but I was having trouble making a nice cup. I tried using a steeper at first, but that really didn't make the tea as strong as I wanted it to be, so I went searching for something a bit better and came across this product. I've really enjoyed using this so far. It's one of the most simple brewers to use and cleaning it up only takes less than 30 seconds. Also, the mesh filter works very well and hasn't let any of the tea through. I'm definitely buying this again if mine breaks.
