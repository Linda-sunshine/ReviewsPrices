review/summary: Bouncing popcornreview/text: This popper is highly rated, but has some shortcomings. The some of the kernels bounce up and out of the popper before they pop. The popcorn reservoir needs to be an inch or so higher. My old air popper had the butter cup so that it could be removed while the popcorn was popping. That allowed me to butter it more evenly. All that said, it really pops well once the corn starts popping. A couple of small design changes would make this a superior product.
