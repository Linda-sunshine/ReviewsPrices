review/summary: Does the job!review/text: For the price, this chair really gets the job done. It has a real sturdy build, a nice mesh back, and a relatively comfortable cushion. The arms on the chair get the job done, though they can be a bit wobbly. One thing I found the chair to be missing is the ability to rock back and forth. Most chairs these days come with this as a standard feature. If you're in the market for a good task chair, pick this one up. If you're looking for a lounge chair, look elsewhere.
