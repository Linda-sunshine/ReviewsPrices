review/summary: Steaming the wrinkles away!review/text: I would have given this 5 stars and perhaps I should, since the only hesitation I have is with the CREASE portion of the device and that's probably because of operator error. It heats up super fast, doesn't spit out hot water and eliminates the wrinkles in seconds. I've wanted a fabric steamer for 20 years and never thought it was worth the money. What was I thinking? I may have permanently retired my iron and ironing board. I always read the reviews from Amazon and also as many other reviews as I can find online. This model was a reasonable compromise between cost and features. It holds more water than I'd be willing to let sit in the machine, given the number of times a week that I use this device. I use filtered water in the reservoir. Cord is sufficiently long. Easy to assemble and fits nicely in the corner. I recently used it on a pair of wool trousers and it was great in removing the wrinkles but no wet fabric resulted! Very happy with this purchase.
