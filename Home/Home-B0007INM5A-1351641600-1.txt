review/summary: Love it!review/text: I was spending a lot of money buying the pods, and there aren't many stores in my area that carry anything but regular coffee pods. I had to constantly order flavored coffee pods through the internet. Now I can buy my favorite flavored coffee beans or grounds and use it in my Senseo. I have found that if I don't grind my coffee beans fine enough, the pods will clog and I have to wait a few hours to get it back out (the machine forms a vacuum). But that is the only problem I have had. I have one pod at home and one at work. As long as I have coffee on hand, I can always use my Senseo coffee maker!
