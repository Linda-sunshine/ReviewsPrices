review/summary: Workhorsereview/text: I owned this digital thermometer for over five years and have been completely happy with the speed and accuracy of the unit. Unfortunately, I had a brain lapse and left it in the roast when I closed the oven door. Needless to say, it wilted! I'm back on Amazon to buy a replacement and will be happy to buy the Taylor model again. By the way, I never submerge this thermometer in dishwater - I scrub the probe with an SOS pad, rinse and then wipe the top part clean with a damp cloth. I've never had any condensation on the screen.
