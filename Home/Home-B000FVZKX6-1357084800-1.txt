review/summary: Thought about sending them backreview/text: I'm a fan of flannel sheets. When I got these, the texture was so very different that I'm used to, that I was going to send them back because I felt I was misled by the ad. Then I realized that they are listed as the VELVET flannel. I read other reviews that raved about them, so I kept them. Glad I did!! They are warmer and thicker than the cheaper traditional flannel.
