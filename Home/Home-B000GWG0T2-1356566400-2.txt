review/summary: Finally a pan that works when cooking eggsreview/text: I went through few pans before America's Test kitchen suggested this pan. The were right eggs come right of with no scraping required. If you cook eggs for the kids or yourself often this is a pan to buy. I just purchased the 8 inch one as well.
