review/summary: Consistent defective filtersreview/text: I've had this unit for a year. The design is good but I have had problems with the quality control of the filters. For the last four months I have been noticing filters that have water in them and they don't last as long as they should (2.5-3 months). I suspect Pur may be intentionally using up some of the filters to make people by them sooner. When they work it does a good job of removing chlorine. At this point I don't think the filters are worth the hassle so unless you absolutely need this shape go with a different one.
