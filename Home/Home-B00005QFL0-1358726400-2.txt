review/summary: 2 years later, still make perfect breadreview/text: I bought this bread machine about 2 years ago. From the beginning, this machine has given me the excellent jobs. I tried most of the recipes from the recipe book which came with the machine and also I got many other good recipes from internet. I cannot be happier with all the results. I use this machine relatively a lot, approximately, 2-3 times a week. Not just our everyday sandwich bread, I bake bread for taking it to my daughter's play date, for party (hard nuts & dried fruits bread), etc. Since my bread got good reputation among my friends, a handful friends of mine bought this machine and they are very happy, too. No more store bought bread which got so much chemical in and last more than 2-3 weeks! (scary...)
