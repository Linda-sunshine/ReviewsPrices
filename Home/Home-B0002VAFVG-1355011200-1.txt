review/summary: Family-sized perfectionreview/text: This baby makes juice so fast and so well, you will be tempted to make more of it - and that's a great bonus. Cleaning is relatively quick. Two settings adjust for softer, juicier fruits and harder, less juicy fruits and veggies.Tip: Place a used plastic supermarket bag in the dry fiber / trash receptacle for quicker clean-up.
