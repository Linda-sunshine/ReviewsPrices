review/summary: Quality Alarm Clockreview/text: I bought this for my husband for the holidays as his alarm clock stopped working. Loved the fact that there were two alarm settings so he could keep one set for weekdays and one for weekends. Also, love the "Sleep Off" feature which I have on my alarm clock because it ensures that you don't forget to set the alarm and oversleep (although this no longer happens since we now have a toddler in the house!). The only downside is that the alarm tone itself is pretty quiet and unobtrusive - not want you what in an alarm that's supposed to wake you up. I often don't hear it going off and even when I'm awake it's still pretty quiet. Sony should work on making the alarm louder or more annoying or at least have a setting to adjust the alarm tone itself.
