review/summary: Perfect for Stairsreview/text: I needed a vacuum for carpeted stairs. This is a very powerful vacuum with a rotating brush that may be enabled or diasabled as desired. It does a fantastic job of vacuuming carpeted stairs. I find it not to be too heavy and easy to empty and clean. The cord is adequate for my needs and wraps conveniently around the base of the handle for easy storage. An attachment kit is available that will add to the versatility of this compact unit, I really like it,
