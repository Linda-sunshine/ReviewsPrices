review/summary: Great coffee makerreview/text: I purchased this for my daughter's use in her dorm room. It's perfect for that environment. It's compact, produces a good cup of coffee and is easy to keep clean.As an alternative, you might want to consider one of the pod-type coffee makers...we use one at home. Those units have pre-measured ground coffee in sealed single serving "pods." You insert the pod, press the button, and have a fresh cup of coffee 30 seconds later. There's no mess with coffee grounds and for clean-up, you simply toss the pod. They're more expensive but even easier to use than the Mr. Coffee brewer. See the Keurig and Nespresso coffeemakers for more info.
