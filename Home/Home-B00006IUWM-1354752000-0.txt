review/summary: Sharpened the same knife 3 times...review/text: Maybe I'm doing this wrong, but I haven't really been able to produce a really nice fine sharp knife since I got this thing. It does sharpen the knifes a little bit, but I'm thinking about taking the cover off so I can better angle the knife to get more gusto out of it. If I do, I'll update this review with results.
