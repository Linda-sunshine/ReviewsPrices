review/summary: Packaging, disturbs mereview/text: My wife and I bought two sets of this item. Both of them came undamaged and in good condition. The thing that scared me was that the containers were packaged within a box and arranged in proper cut packaging. It is hard to explain, but I was thinking that it would be easy to drop this box and, depending on the quality of the pyrex, it would shatter. There is not much protection other than the 'sleeves' or slots that these were placed in.Overall, the pyrex looks nice, is functional, and there are no problems as of yet.
