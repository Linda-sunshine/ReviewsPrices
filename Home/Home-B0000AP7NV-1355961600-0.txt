review/summary: Nicereview/text: This pitcher is nice because it is slim and fits in our constantly full fridge. It seems to make good water. It is on the small size, which is fine for us because we only have 2 water drinkers. However, if your family all enjoy water, you would want a much bigger pitcher as you would be constantly refilling it.
