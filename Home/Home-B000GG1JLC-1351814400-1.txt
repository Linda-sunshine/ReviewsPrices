review/summary: I can now see my tiesreview/text: I am not the most organized person and my ties were just sitting on a shelf in my closet. There are many fancy tie contraptions out there, but this simple and affordable device does the job masterfully. I hang my ties on two of these and now I can quickly turn these to find the tie that matches my shirt. I give it four stars because the spokes are spaced close together and I place my ties on every other spoke to make it a little easier to sort through. Not a big deal considering how low the cost of these are.
