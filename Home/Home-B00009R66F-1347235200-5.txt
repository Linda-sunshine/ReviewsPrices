review/summary: feels a bit flimsy but cleans wellreview/text: Feels cheap , light, and plasticy however cleans lightly soiled carpets well. Just put in hot water and solution. This probably wont last more than a year or two but its cheap enough so that i dont care. A very good product otherwise. Does a great job leaves carpet looking new. For badly soiled carpets this wont cut it.
