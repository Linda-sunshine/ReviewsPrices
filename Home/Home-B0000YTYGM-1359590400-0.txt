review/summary: Works great.review/text: Despite all the reviews mentioning spillovers, my unit showed no tendency to overflow. Although I am sure that it is essential to put the lid on correctly, this is very easy to do, with both tactile and visual indication that it is on correctly. I like not having to fiddle with the lid to begin pouring. And the pour rate is fine with me. Like many coffeemakers, this one defines &#34;cup&#34; to mean something of its own choosing, in this case, 5 ounces. There is some confusion, however, in the manual about the meaning of &#34;cup.&#34; On page 6, it says to use 2 level tablespoons of coffee per cup. This would seem to indicate that to brew the maximum of 12 cups, 24 tablespoons should be used. But on page 4 there is a note that no more than 15 tablespoons should be used, otherwise overflow will occur. On this basis, 7 1/2 cups would be the maximum that could be brewed. Maybe there is an inconsistency in the meaning of &#34;cup&#34; here? I suspect so, since I found that using 2 tablespoons of grounds per 5-ounce cup produced coffee that was much too strong, even bitter, for me. If I use 1 tablespoon per 6-ounce cup, as suggested on the coffee bean container, I get what seems like an average brew strength.
