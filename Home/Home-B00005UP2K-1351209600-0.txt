review/summary: Best mixer EVER!review/text: I absolutely love this mixer. I use my mothers on a daily basis and just dread when I have to return home and I don't have one. It is the sturdiest mixer I have ever used. Most mixers I use with dough are really bogged down. They can not withstand the dough. This stand mixer has never given me a day of trouble. As for the attatchments, I would definately recommend getting what you think you will need. They have never failed me. The different attachments are very easy to attach and remove. Once you use this you will never want to use another.
