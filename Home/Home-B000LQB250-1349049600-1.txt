review/summary: This pad changed my lifereview/text: After getting this pad to transform my notoriously bad dorm bed, my life has been different. I sleep through the night, I never have any aches or pains in the mornings, and I feel well rested. It is a few inches short, but it doesn't affect anything - the spot is easily covered by my pillow. This was a great purchase.
