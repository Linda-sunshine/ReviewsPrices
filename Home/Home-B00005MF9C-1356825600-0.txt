review/summary: Nice and hot!review/text: The secret to a good cup of coffee is very hot brewing temp (200-205). I just got this unit and the first thing I did was to check the brew temp: 200. I don't drink coffee all day long so this gives me 15oz of hot coffee in a thermal mug and I am good for the day. Small footprint on the counter, quick and easy clean up. Great product so far.
