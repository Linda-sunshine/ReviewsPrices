review/summary: Love my mixer!review/text: The mixer is totally worth the money spent. It was very handy during the holidays. I've made bread, cookies, and cakes with ease. I love it because with my bad shoulder it just made mixing batters so much easier. I especially love that I bought it in a green pear color. Typically you find it in black, white or red in the stores. More color choices through Amazon. Highly recomend it!
