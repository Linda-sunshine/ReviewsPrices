review/summary: 2 quarts of heavenreview/text: Learn to make the best vanilla on earth and it is all downhill from there. Easy to add berries, candy, flavorings to the basic, delicious vanilla. You need a 2 quart container for most recipes. 1 and 1/2 quart could leave you with excess mix for your favorite recipe.
