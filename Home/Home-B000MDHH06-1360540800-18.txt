review/summary: It gets the job donereview/text: Super easy set-up, juices everything and leaves very little waste behind. For those comments about it being a PITA to clean up, I'd disagree. Yeah, it probably takes all of 5 minutes to rinse everything and use the brush to clean the grater, but it's really not that big of a deal. All the parts snap together in a cinch and come apart just as easily. LOVE this juicer.
