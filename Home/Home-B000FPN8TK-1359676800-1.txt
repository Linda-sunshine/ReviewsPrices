review/summary: I love this thing!!review/text: Talk about convenience!! I am a voracious Yerba Mate drinker, but i buy loose leaf like the other teas i buy and this thing is the BEST! Ive ben using it about 4 to 5 times a day without any issues. Sturdy, easy to use, no hassle.. Im thinking of buying the 32 ounce so i can brew large amounts for summer time..
