review/summary: Works great on induction cooktop.review/text: I bought this to use on my new induction cooker and it works great. I like the 4-Quart size because it is shorter than the 6-Quart and fits in my crowded cabinet. It replaces my inherited Mirror-matic that is solid aluminum. Consider the 6-Quart if you are cooking for more than 4 people.
