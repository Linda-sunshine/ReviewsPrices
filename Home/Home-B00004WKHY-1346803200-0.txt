review/summary: Decent food processorreview/text: This is a solid, decent 11-cup food processor. I haven't had any problems with it and have used it to shred carrots and cabbage, make hummus and nutella (oh, yeah, it was awesome), and "grind" meat. Now, it worked wonderfully for these things, but, really, don't go putting liquid in this food processor. Use your head: this is a food processor not a liquid processor (a.k.a. a blender).This processor is quite sturdy and has a wonderfully heavy base, so it doesn't "dance" on the counter top. It also looks quite nice, especially for the price. Its motor seems to be powerful enough too, given how well it worked for the (very thick, dense) nutella.
