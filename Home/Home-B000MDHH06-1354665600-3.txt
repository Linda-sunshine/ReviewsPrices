review/summary: Works great! Love it.review/text: It is easy to use and easy to clean up. Most parts are dishwasher safe on the top rack but I clean it up right away by washing it by hand. The pulp that is left after making the juice seemed dryer than the pulp from other juicer I used to use, which means this juicer might be getting more juices out from the fruits.I love it. I rarely rate items I purchase from Amazon but I felt like I wanted to for this item.
