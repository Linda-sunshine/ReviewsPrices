review/summary: gets the job donereview/text: Had it for a few days now and seems to work quite well. Haven't noticed a difference in air quality yet, but I don't think that's physiologically possible anyway. The idea is to filter out particles small enough to get into the deepest air sacs. Because this is a HEPA filter, it must do so. On high it is kinda' loud, but I generally leave it on all day when I'm at work and turn it off at night. I like to use it as white noise now and then in fact. A nice bonus feature is that it has a little night light on it too. Clearly, the price is unbeatable and the permanent filters will save you in the long run. From my limited experience I can say that this is a good product.
