review/summary: Wonderful!review/text: I have been coveting this griddle forever and I decided to buy it. I personally hate making pancakes in skillet pans one at a time. I love that it's so big and easy to clean. I was able to make pancakes, sausage and eggs on this one griddle without over crowding. It is a little too big for my cabinets so I just store it on top of my fridge and everything is right with the world. Go ahead and buy it...you know you want to.
