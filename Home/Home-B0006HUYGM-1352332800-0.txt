review/summary: Exceeded My Expectationsreview/text: Originally, I set out to purchase a secondShark V1510 Bagless Cyclonic Hand Vacbecause I knew it had great suction and had a cord long enough for our stairs. The one we have ended up getting reappropriated to cleaning out our vehicles, so I wanted a dedicated "in-house" one for cleaning the stairs, as well as any odd and end cleaning where a hand-held vacuum was called for. I came across this one during a Gold Box Deal, and decided to try it. I was so surprised at how well it performs. Not only is the suction great, but also it is also noticeably lighter (weighs 5 lbs) and not as loud as the Shark (weighs 6.2 lbs) I have.The cord length is a generous 20 feet, has the revolving brush, 2 motors: 1 for the suction extension, 1 for the revolving brush. The visor over the revolving brush does well for the stair cleaning (my primary purpose for this machine), and the bagless filter and removeable dust cup is easy to empty and clean.In addition to purchasing this, I also purchased this Micro Vacuum Attachment Kit:Micro Vacuum Attachment Kit - 7 Piecethat works wonderfully with this handheld vacuum, (cleaning fans, keyboards, etc).Here's my PRO's for this Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum:*Powerful**Weighs only 5 Pounds**2 dedicated motors**Roller brush visor/shield works great for full stair cleaning**Easy to empty debris/clean/maintain**20 foot cord**Cord wraps around machine when not in use**Vacuum hose is easy to use, stays put when not needed**Crevice tool attachment fits snugly in base of machine**Debris cup is clear, so you know when it needs to be emptied**On/Off, roller brush, and vacuum hose controls are all built into handle*CON's:*I have found NO CON's to this hand-held vacuum*I highly recommend this Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum to anyone looking for great quality at this price point, it has exceeded my expectations with the power, weight and thoughtful construction.
