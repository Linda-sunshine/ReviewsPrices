review/summary: I like itreview/text: I really like this humidifier. Last year I had the humidifer that left white dust all over my house. This one doesn't. It puts out a lot of moisture and I love allthe features, like shutting off when your level is set and coming on when it is not. The only drawback is that it is a little bit loud for TV viewing therefore I turn it way down or off when we do.
