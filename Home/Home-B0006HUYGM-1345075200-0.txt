review/summary: Works Greatreview/text: This little vacuum serves the purpose for which I bought it. I have been lugging a full size heavy vacuum up and down the carpeted stairs of my home for 3 years to clean them. I finally couldn't do it anymore physically. This little vacuum had such great suction. I could not believe the amount of dog hair it picked up. It was embarrassing that my other (good quality) full vacuum had left so much behind. However, it was always ackward to try and use the hand tools to suction the stairs with the big vacuum. This allows you to really reach all the corners and sides. It was very inexpensive and works great. It's also easy enough to carry around and lift. I am very happy with it.
