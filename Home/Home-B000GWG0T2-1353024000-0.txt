review/summary: Pan sides too shallowreview/text: The T-Fal pan has a great not stick surface , however the design of the pans sides are much too low and shallow. I find myself consistently losing home fries and other things "overboard " as I attempt to flip over with a spatula. I am very careful now but I find myself at least a few times a week cursing at the pan as I loose something to the floor.
