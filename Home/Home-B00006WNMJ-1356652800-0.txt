review/summary: Great way to stop the pitcher madness.review/text: We never filled up our Brita pitcher, and couldn't afford to keep buying the filters on their schedule. Our Culligan faucet filter is great. We set up the deliveries for every three months and the water (in SoCal, here) has vastly improved in taste. Super convenient, I even fill the coffee pot with it. Now I get compliments on how good my store brand coffee tastes. True story.
