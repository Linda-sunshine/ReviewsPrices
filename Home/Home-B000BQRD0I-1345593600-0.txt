review/summary: Steam is not consistantreview/text: This is the second steamer I have purchased. The first one broke because of my error, I left it on with no water. Anyway, I got this one in the hope it would perform as well as my first one, but it didn't. The steam output was very inconsistant. It would steam for a while and then stop for no reason I could see. I'd turn it on and off to no avail and the next time I tried to use it it would work fine. It only worked about a forth of the times I tried to use it. I returned the item.
