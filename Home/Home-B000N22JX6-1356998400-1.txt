review/summary: Small in size--Big in heatreview/text: I bought this heater two weeks ago and have been using it for a week and a half. I am so impressed with this heater that I can't help but comment on it to my wife every time I pass by it. I have a small house of 1150 sq/ft and this small heater heats half of my house. I am not kidding. In fact I have not had to use the whole house heater since we got this little one. It may have something to do with the layout of the house but regardless of the reason it is still heating up the whole front of the house and maintaining the temp at an even 68 degrees. I am running it for about 14-16 hours a day and it has not given me any problems.well almost no problems.It has triggered the breaker twice under certain conditions like when we're running the microwave and the coffee maker at the same time that we have the heater on at maximum output. That just means that we have to be more aware of what we're running and try not to run the things that will trigger the cirquit breaker. That being said, the fact that we're making do with nothing else but this small heater, makes up for any inconveniance that we have had so far.So with that I'll have to say that this little heater is Great. PS, The remote is also Great.Over all It's four stars.Would be Five if it wasn't for the breaker thing.
