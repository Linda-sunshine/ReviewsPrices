review/summary: Probe not functional after 3-4 usesreview/text: ...so this was a disappointing product, and I'm a disappointed customer. I buy thousands of dollars of products every year through Amazon, and product quality had been noticeably declining over the past 2 years. Amazon- take care that quality doesn't slip too far or it will be time to evaluate other online merchants.
