review/summary: overkill and top heavyreview/text: This is a very large item and enough top heavy that it dumped my first attempt all over the counter. A few years ago I had one about half this size that I liked very well. I'm sure this one is probably more powerful and will probably handle larger things better - like pureeing in a pot, but it seems like overkill for smoothies. It takes up more space on the countertop than I expected, and the little plastic carafe that comes with it is too lightweight and ill shaped to support it. The base is narrow and the top large, which makes it spill over more easily. I'm going to look for a heavier and larger, straight-sided glass to use it with. Or possibly set the little plastic carafe inside a heavy straight-sided bowl to make it more sturdy. I find it especially odd for these two items to be paired together because the carafe for my smaller stick blender was taller than this and had a wider base and straight sides.
