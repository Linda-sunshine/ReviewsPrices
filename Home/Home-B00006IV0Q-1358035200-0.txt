review/summary: really hot coffeereview/text: Finally, I found a coffee pot that makes the coffee hot. I bought a Bunn because of the great reviews but still had to microwave the coffee. I returned the Bunn. The presto makes good coffee and it is nice and hot. I almost took off a star because it takes a little longer than other makers, but it is worth the wait.
