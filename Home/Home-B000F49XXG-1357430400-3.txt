review/summary: Need Tiny Cups, but works wellreview/text: Overall this makes good espresso and the steamers works as expected. In order to make a decent cup of coffee though, you have to pull out the little overflow tray where the cups normally rest. We can only get the steamer to make froth with skim milk, but I think that has more to do with the steaming process than the machine. The quality of the parts are sturdy and we really like the detachable water reservoir that you can carry to the faucet rather.
