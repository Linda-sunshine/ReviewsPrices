review/summary: It works GREAT, and no flipping requiredreview/text: So I bought this waffle maker based on the reviews, even though I was a bit skeptical how fluffy the waffles would be without flipping (ie..rotating) the waffle maker. I've used friends waffle makers, but they all had the kind that you have to flip/rotate. Well, THIS waffle maker makes PERFECT, crispy, fluffy waffles. And at a great price too.
