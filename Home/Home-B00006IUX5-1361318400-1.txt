review/summary: Perfect sizereview/text: I have another coffee grinder which is difficult to clean as you have to take it apart etc. This one holds the perfect amount of beans that i use for a pot of coffee and is quick (my other one ran too long). I just take a paper towel and wipe out when finished. The retractable cord is also nice as i like to leave this sit on my counter. Great buy
