review/summary: Perfect Loafreview/text: I love this breadmaker, I have not had a bad loaf in this machine yet! It fits perfectly under my cupboards, look very nice on my counter top, easy to use,the display buttons and panel are easy to read. The pan comes out very easily, easy to clean, and has all the settings and features of a much more expensive machine. Looks very nice on my counter, and made the best loaf of banana bread I have ever made. Would recommend.
