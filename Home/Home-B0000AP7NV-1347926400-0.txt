review/summary: Dirty, but it worksreview/text: My pitcher was dirty right out of the package-- it had black granules and scratch marks all over the place. That being said, it was fairly easy to wash out the granules and scrub the pitcher to make it look sort of new. I'm pretty disappointed though because when I open a package, I expect to see a shiny, clean product. Other than that though, the Slim Pitcher works very well. As a student, it's much more convenient to have a filter than to have to buy tons of water bottles. This pitcher holds plenty of water and I don't have to refill it too often. It's inexpensive, useful, and convenient. I would recommend this to other students and any one else.
