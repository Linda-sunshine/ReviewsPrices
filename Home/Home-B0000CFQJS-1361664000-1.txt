review/summary: Worksreview/text: I've been wanting one of these filters for years. Not sure what took me so long to actually purchase one. It's not that coffee filters are expensive or anything, I always just hated adding more things to landfills.Other than having to finagle it into the filter area on my prehistoric Proctor Silex, it works well. I like that I don't have to wait for the coffee to finish dripping a few minutes to grab the carafe. Beware though ,if you use a very fine blend you'll get some 'sludge' at the bottom of your cup.By the way, rinsing it is easier with the spray option on the faucet.
