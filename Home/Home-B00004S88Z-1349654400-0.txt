review/summary: Steam Pressure Gaugereview/text: Oct. 8, 2012: The All American 21.5 qt. canner is outstanding. A very professional product made by a very profession company.I received my canner just 4 days ago and spent the weekend canning chicken, beef, beef/spaghetti sauce, and meatloaf. I noticed the gear steam pressure gauge did not go to 10 but stayed at 9 on the dial. The pressure regulator weight was set at 10 lbs. for MI altitude and it did jump and sputter as the instructions said it would. Just to make sure the gear steam pressure gauge was operating correctly with the needle at 9 (instead of 10), I called All American today and actually spoke with a person. (No automatic recording or dozens of buttons to push at this American company!) The gear steam gauge is allowed a plus/minus (+/-) 2 lb. tolerance difference. The 9 lb. pressure my canner registered on the steam gauge dial is perfectly normal. As long as the regulator weight jumped/sputtered when the canner pressure reached 10 lb. weight, the canner is operating within standards. I am very happy with the All American canner. I only wish I had purchased one years ago. Thank you to all the reviews on Amazon as that is what helped me make the decision to buy the All American.In addition, Amazon is amazing with their delivery service and efficient return policy.
