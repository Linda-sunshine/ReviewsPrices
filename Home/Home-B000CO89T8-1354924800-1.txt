review/summary: completely worthlessreview/text: I read the reviews and considered the pros and cons before purchasing this product. I read about it working best if you have a flat bottomed cup and that the beverage needs to be hot in order for it to work. I used the most flat cups i own and tried many different sizes all of which were wide to cover the hot plate of the product. Every time the beverage did not remain hot and cooled to a dull lukewarm after a few minutes as if my tea was not even on a heating element! Amazingly it could not even keep the littlest amount of liquid at the bottom of the cup warm enough to be pleasing! I was searching for a beverage warmer that would replace my tea light one so i wouldnt have to keep purchasing tea light candles and had high hopes for this product. So disappointed!!! Why why manufacture a product that doesnt work? Now its headed for a landfill forever! And its a cheap quality appliance, so flimsy, it feels like it even if it did work it would break easily and never outlast its warranty! If you like your beverage to remain hot SAVE YOUR MONEY! If you dont mind an oh so slightly warm drink then go ahead and buy it after all it is labeled as a mug WARMER.
