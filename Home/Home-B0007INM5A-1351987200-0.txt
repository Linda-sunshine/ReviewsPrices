review/summary: Coffee loverreview/text: My brother gave me his Senseo as he was getting married and wanted a bigger pot. So I took it. Little did I realize that the coffee Pods were not only HARD to find, but when found, awfully expensive, especially in these economic times. Free coffee pot did not warrant huge price for coffee. So to Amazon I go. Found this and several others. In reading the reviews for this product, decided to give it a go.My brother only gave me the one cup insert, i think it was suppose to have one for a two cup, but, alas, it was gone.After washing the coffee maker out with vinger and waiting for the order to arrive at my door (fast delivery, I love the Amazon Prime) I gave it a go.I did not find it made a mess, I can put in any flavor of coffee I desire. I did not find it was a mess to clean out either. The product works very well, in my humble opinion, though the coffee, regardless of filling it, is not as strong as I would like it. I do think if I had the two cup one and made it for 1 cup it would be nice and stout.So, though I love the stouter coffee, I have to give this product 5 stars. It is easy to fill up, to close the pod up, to clean out. I do not think this product has a thing to do with the strength of my coffee preference.Well worth the money
