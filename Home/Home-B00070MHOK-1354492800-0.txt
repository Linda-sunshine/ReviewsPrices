review/summary: Great Productreview/text: I don't like to iron if I don't have to because there are so many steps involved and takes up so much time and energy. But I was running into the problem of wanting to wear clothes and having no time to iron or straighten out the fabric. So I bought this product for those times. It heats up so quick, and starts steaming right away. It straightens out the fabric so quickly and so well. I used it on a scrub top, nurse uniform,that were wrinkled all over, especially at the v-neck and this product's steam took those away in less than a minute after steaming up.I recommend this product.
