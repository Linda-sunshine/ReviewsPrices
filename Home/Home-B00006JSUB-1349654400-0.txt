review/summary: solid as a rockreview/text: I bought the 10 inch and now have this 12 inch unit. Just threw out the old one we've had for 40+years. This pan is gorgeous, if a pot can be gorgeous. Cast iron is the only way to cook and I do a lot of cooking. Of course, the main attribute is the even heat distribution and constant temperature of the pan once you get it up. Need to get a couple of bigger units, say a 6 and an 8 quart along with a sauce pan and I can throw out all our old Farberware (will have to do it when she is not looking). Now this is not a Le Cruzette, but who cares; it does not cost $130 and it's made in America.
