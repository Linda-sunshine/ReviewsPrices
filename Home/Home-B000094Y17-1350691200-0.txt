review/summary: Lid Falls offreview/text: I bought this because Brita has such a good reputation, and it was an extremely attractive product. However, the lid is very poorly designed, and frequently falls off during use. Everyone in my family has had problems with this. I never had an earlier version of the Brita, but I wish there was an alternative, because the lid issue is a real nuisance.
