review/summary: Panasonic Bread Maker - it's okreview/text: I had a Panasonic bread maker that I used for many years and it finally quit working so I purchased this one as a replacement. I can say the old one worked much better and was easier to use than this one. The recipe measurements are odd. The bread function works fine; but, I have yet to get the recipe for the dough (dinner rolls) to come out ok. Not sure if the recipe ratios are off or what as the rolls do not raise much and are very dense. I do like the option of different sized loaves of bread.
