review/summary: Works greatreview/text: Love this sharpener. Did the paper test before and after and it definitely worked on our chef knifes. You can see where it actually grinds the knife down (in a good way). Not sure I'd use it for serrated though as the instruction booklet even says that over time serrations will go away. Yikes!Otherwise, I'm very happy to have sharp knives again.
