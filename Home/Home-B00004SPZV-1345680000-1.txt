review/summary: Misty might be a better product namereview/text: The Misto really does spray olive oil out pretty evenly, but it doesn't come out like a typical spray bottle does. It's very misty, even more so than a cologne or perfume bottle. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just not what I expected.For me, it only means I have to spray a little bit longer. Aside from that, the Misto is very cool and a lot better than sloshing your bottle all over the pan.
