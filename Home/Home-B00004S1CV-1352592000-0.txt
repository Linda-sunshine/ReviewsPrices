review/summary: One of the best purchases of my life!review/text: This is an amazing product. I've had it for a year and no problems at all. You can use the strainer for loose tea, but I use it all the time without the strainer with tea bags, hot chocolate and coffee. Easy to wash and drink out of. It is absolutely leak-proof, very sturdy (not tipsy at all to be placed by a computer for instance) and the liquid stays steaming hot for hours. So impressive! People who have used it can't believe the heat retention. Buy it! A must for yourself and a perfect gift, especially in cold weather.
