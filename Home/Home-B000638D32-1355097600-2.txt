review/summary: Excellent knife for the pricereview/text: I bought this knife about a year ago because of the rave reviews and it definitely hasn't let me down yet. I use it almost daily and the edge is still very sharp. I bought this with a combo of the AccuSharp knife sharpner, which I run it through every once in a while. I would recommend this knife to anyone on a budget or enjoys cooking. Of course this is a stamped blade but it offers great price/performance.
