review/summary: Love the sound therapy, don't love the clockreview/text: Pros:- Great assortment of sounds that can be used to drown out other noises (husband playing games downstairs, neighbors working on cars or playing loud music, traffic, whatever). You can keep the noise playing continuously or set it to go for a period of time.- Love that it has two alarms- Can use a battery for backup in case you lose powerCons:- The clock display is extremely bright - even when you change to the low contrast setting. It is so bright, I had to keep my old alarm clock plugged in to use as a clock and turn this one against the wall. Perhaps it wouldn't be so bad for a nursery where you might want a little light to check in on a baby anyway, but it is way too much light for me.- If you use the radio as an alarm and press the snooze button, you can still hear the radio - just quieter. Maybe that's not such a bad thing since I should be getting up anyway.
