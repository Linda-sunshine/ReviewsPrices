review/summary: Best Kettle for the offered pricereview/text: I an 100% sure this one is the best kettle for the price.- Heats water really quick- Have Min/Max levels very visibly marked- No odd smell that many other kettles create- Auto turn off is a needed and nice feature. At this price this feature is a value add- Short power chord is a plus for me as I don't need to roll it. But it might be a drawback for some as they need to pull out every time to pour water
