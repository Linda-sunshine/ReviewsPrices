review/summary: Still one of my favorite knives after 3 yearsreview/text: I can't believe I love a knife with a plastic handle, but I do. It is hands down the most used knife I own. It holds it's edge as good as my professional blades, and feels good in the hand. I highly, highly recommend this to anyone.
