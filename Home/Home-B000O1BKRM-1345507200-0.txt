review/summary: I am in LOVE!!!review/text: I don't often write reviews - but after reading the others, I felt I should weigh in. I LOVE THESE TRAYS!!! I have both these trays and the "King" size trays. I find them just as easy to fill as a standard ice tray, and I've always loaded my ice cube trays with two hands, anyway - so big deal! We actually have an ice maker in our fridge, and I still choose to use these trays instead. Here's why:- LOVE the shape!! The square cubes created by these trays require fewer cubes per glass, and take longer to dissolve in your drink. Plus, they look nice.- I LOVE that you can remove only as many cubes as you want. This way they don't stick together - you don't have the hassle of getting a huge chunk of ice that you can't possibly fit into your glass. All you have to do to remove a cube is push up from the bottom. Quite possibly one of the most ingenious features of these tray, IMO.- They take up less space in your freezer. Who doesn't love that?- No problems with spilling on the way into the freezer - if you don't OVERFILL them!!- I have had these for several months, and I have experienced no odor problems whatsoever. I don't know what all the fuss is about. I don't store them any special way, I don't have to jump through tons of hoops to use them. I use them just like any other ice cube tray.In summation - if you are even considering them, buy them! You won't regret it. In fact, I am here to order more!!
