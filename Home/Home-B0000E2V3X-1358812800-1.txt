review/summary: Fabulous pan!!!review/text: I love making homemade pizza and this pan is perfect for that. I use a bread machine to make the dough, then roll it out and bake on this pan. Crusts turn out perfect, crusty outside, chewy inside. Heats evenly and the cast iron is nicely seasoned. A big plus that Lodge products are made in the USA.
