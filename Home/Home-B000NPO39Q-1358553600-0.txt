review/summary: Great Addition for my Nativity Setreview/text: I received Willow Tree nativity figurines as a gift a few years back. For the past couple of years I've wanted to add the 3 Wisemen for Epiphany. I was able to get these figures, and they arrived in time to make the journey from the east end of my house, arriving in time for the Feast of the Epiphany. They make a great addition to my nativity set. I look forward to continuing to add figurines in the years to come.
