review/summary: Kitchen-Aid Dissapointmentreview/text: This blender was purchased 16 months ago. I decided on Kitchen Aid because of the great reviews and, I thought, great Kitchen-Aid product reliability. I used this blender almost exclusively for smoothies. This was at least the third blender I have purchased and decided to spend the higher price thinking it will outlast previous, cheaper machines. I actually didn't start using this blender on a continuing basis until 3 weeks ago. When making smoothies I add crushed ice after all fruits are fully pureed. Within 10 seconds the blender started leaking from base of jar. The blade is attached thru jar base and sealed by a nut on bottom of jar and a corresponding nut below the blade on inside of jar. I have to retighten nut after each use but because you can't really grip,and hold in place inner nut that is on inside below blade, it keeps loosening up and leaking. This is poor product design and a useless appliance. If you are looking for a blender that will stand up to daily use THEN PASS ON THIS PRODUCT.
