review/summary: WOULD YOU LIKE A CUP OF COFFEE? Buy this Black & Decker model!review/text: This Black & Decker coffeemaker is a replacement for the my previous one like it. My other coffeemaker, same brand and model, lasted many year's. I like it so much that I wanted to by same model and brand again. They are of good quality and brew your single cup coffee really, really fast. I highly recommend it. Besides coffee, you can heat your water for tea, coco mix, etc.
