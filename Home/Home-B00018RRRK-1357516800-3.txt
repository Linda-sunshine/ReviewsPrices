review/summary: Yeah, mine broke, too.review/text: My experience with this bore little difference those of most people here in the "2 stars or lower" zone. However, I'm not giving it one star because when the Cuisinart worked it worked quite well. I'm not an espresso drinker nor am I all that anally retentive about getting the most uniform grind from a $50 grinder. All in all, this unit worked quite efficiently, in spite of the noise. Like others, what bugged me most when it was working was the coffee residue sticking to the holder, the tendency for the "coffee spout" to get plugged up even when the contained wasn't filled, and the very awkward power cord location that made it difficult to keep it 'flat' on a surface. However, I did like the fact that it was relatively easy to clean (except for the "spout" where the ground coffee came out; that was a "q-tip" challenge) and the generous 1/2 pound hopper.Then, of course, it busted, like it has with so many others here. For me, I had it for about a year and half. I used it perhaps once every three weeks to grind about a pound of coffee, a process that took about a total of, say, 10 minutes of actual "motor on" time per pound. Of course, the motor isn't continuously on since it shuts off after a certain time and you have to pour our the container, so, at most, we're talking about 2 minutes of steady 'on-time' at a time. So, if we multiply 26 actual times it was used by a total of 10 minutes per session, we get 260 minutes--less than 5 hours--of actual "running" time. So, for $50 I bought a coffee mill that lasted only 5 hours worth of use. Not a particularly cost effective solution.I've learned my lesson with this one and am upgrading to get the Kitchenaid Pro Burr Gringer (which, at this writing, normally goes for $199 or so but is on sale online for $159 with free delivery from Another Big Box Electronics Chain that I Can't Name Here.
