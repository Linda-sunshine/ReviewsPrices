review/summary: Well made, tough and makes good coffeereview/text: I purchased this to use on my boat to make coffee and have been using it for several years now and it makes good coffee. I thought it was a tad expensive for what it is but there aren't really any alternatives. The rubber exterior keeps it from sliding around and the vacuum insulation keeps the coffee hot. The top can be rotated to close off the spout to minimize heat loss and slow down any spills. I have knocked it over a couple of times and as long as it it has been pressed all the way down and it doesn't fall to the floor the amount that spills out when the spout is closed is fairly small so the risk of getting soaked with hot coffee is minimal.Another nice aspect is that the rubber cover can't be removed. I used to have another vacuum insulated coffee press that was all metal and came with a rubber 'coaster' which got lost. Once the rubber coaster was lost the bare metal pot that would just slide around on the table, counter or deck and it was no longer practical to use on a boat.
