review/summary: Good vacuum, small drawbacksreview/text: I got this vacuum for my mom for Christmas. So far she has been pleased with its actual performance, but she has a few complaints. First, it is heavy so it is portable but hard to use for long periods of time because of size and weight. Second, the dust cup is small. She has two cats that shed a lot and she has to empty the cup several times while vacuuming a single area. These are complaints you could apply pretty much across the board to handheld vacuums, especially in this price range, so I would still recommend this product and I would purchase again.
