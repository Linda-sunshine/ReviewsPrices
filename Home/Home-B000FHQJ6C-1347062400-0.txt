review/summary: Great for Larger Fruit and Veg.review/text: My husband and I wanted to start juicing but didnt want to buy a really expensive juicer until we knew we were committed to it. We really have enjoyed this little juicer. The only problem is the "big mouth". You really dont need a big mouth unless you are juicing for 4 or more people, but if its just you or your partner there is no reason for the big mouth. The reason is it not the best is because when we put berries or spinach leaves in it they shoot straight out the back from the speed. I think if the mouth was smaller it would allow the berries and grapes and such to stay in the blade area longer.Its a great entry level juicer and we love it...I would just recommend a smaller shoot.
