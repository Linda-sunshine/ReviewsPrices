review/summary: Great Espressoreview/text: For the price, this makes a great espresso. It requires a little care in that you have to hand wash and dry to keep it looking nice, but it is well worth it. IMO, this is not made for more than 2 servings. I usually make one cup for myself and it is perfect for that. After time, you will have to replace the o-ring for a nominal cost. I haven't had to yet, but I can tell that it is getting close to that time. It's small for easy storage. I have had mine for over a year and love it.
