review/summary: If only it were more cleverreview/text: We had the elephant for our boys and needed an additional humidifier now that our 2-yr-old daughter has her own room. I really like that the elephant shoots steam from it's trunk and was hoping that the owl would shoot steam from it's &#34;ear&#34; feathers but it just comes from the top of the head. You can't tell from the photos where it will come from.Another difference is that the elephant (an older model) has an on/off switch separate from the knob and the new owl one does not. I would rather it have the switch (very small and in the back) to ensure that it stays off if curious children mess with the knob (in front and visible), cuz I'm paranoid about it being run while empty and breaking.All things considered, it's super cute and works fine.
