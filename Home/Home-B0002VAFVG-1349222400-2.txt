review/summary: Absolutely fabulous juicerreview/text: I juice ~50 ounces of juice 6 mornings per week. That is breakfast for myself and my fiance. This thing is a workhorse. From leafy greens to hard, fibrous roots; the Breville 800 JEXL breaks them down with ease. It looks great on the counter (pro-tip: measure from your counter to your cabinets to make sure it will fit - fits for me but it is a tall guy), it is very well-built, and it makes juice super-fast. As with any juicer, there is a lot of clean-up, but this one breaks down easily and isn't too tough. I carve out 25 minutes each morning to gather ingredients, make juice, and clean my juicer. The wide mouth is another awesome feature. It fits whole 2.5" Fuji apples, big bunches of spinach, or multiple carrots/celerty stalks/etc at a time without having to cut stuff up first. This is a big time-saver.I strongly recomend this juicer to anyone.
