review/summary: Candidate for a recallreview/text: Purchased this product in June 2010, just over two years ago. Today, what I thought was a great coffeemaker (Cuisinart DCC-1200) could have started an electrical fire in my house. Circumstance: coffee maker was turned OFF but plugged in. All of a sudden, heard a bubbling sound in the carafe-- c. 1 cup of coffee was boiling on its own. Then smoke started coming out rear where cord is attached. Unplugged entire unit immediately and took outside. Smoke was coming out of the bottom metal plate. I checked other consumer advocacy sites and discovered similar complaints. This product should be recalled. At the very least, please unplug when unattended and not at home.
