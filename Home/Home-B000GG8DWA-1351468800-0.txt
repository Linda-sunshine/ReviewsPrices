review/summary: Two Wonderful Yearsreview/text: By far this is the greatest heater I have used thus far. The one I had (which died a week ago) stayed in my bathroom most of the time and kept my son and I extremely warm. When left on overnight in a closed room sleeping, we would wake up sweating.Being in a bathroom and having a 5 year old, it had water sprayed on it, it had been peed on (gross I know) and so much more but it still lasted 2 winters! I will be purchasing another one and now that my son is older I have no doubt that this new one will last at least 5 years.
