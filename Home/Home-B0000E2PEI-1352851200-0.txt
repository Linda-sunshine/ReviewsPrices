review/summary: junkreview/text: Bought this scale last night at a membership store to replace an aging scale I had. I bought this one soley because of the price. Earlier in the day I was at another store and tested out samples of other scales that were higher priced and the weight was more accurate to my last reading at my docs office. I took it out of the box and set it up. This scale gave me three different readings, one was off from my docs office by 4lbs so I attributed that to heavier clothes. This morning I miraculously lost 8lbs from last night! my diet must be working!!! I thought lets try setting 8 lb barbells on it. They weigh 0 ! then I held the 8lb barbels, the weight difference from my last reading 4lbs, whoa that's an accurate scale the barbels must have went on a diet too!!. Seriously. I read other reviews and others have had the same problems, I also think Taylor is posting some of their own positive reviews on this site. Guess how fast this is going back to the membership store? I guess you get what you pay for. One thing I learned is Taylor is not a reputable brand and cannot produce an accurate reading scale.
