review/summary: love it but disappointedreview/text: I have injuries to my C-spine and this is the best pillow i have ever had for sleeping my head tentions and pain in my shoulders and neck were lessend during my times of rest. Sadly !!!! the sewing is very poor and i had a hole in it and the small beeds are coming out. I am planing on getting a new one but maybe from a different company
