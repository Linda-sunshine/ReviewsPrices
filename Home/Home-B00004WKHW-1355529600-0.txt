review/summary: Love it!review/text: This is the perfect little food processor. I read tons of reviews, and I wanted something that was durable, efficient, and inexpensive. Its perfect for chopping vegetables, and I am pretty sure I even threw in some pecans. Though, I did try stale bread on Thanksgiving, and I got a little nervous it may break (FYI). Either way it is perfect for the small things, and I really have no complaints. There are two settings--chop and grind, but I don't really know the difference.
