review/summary: Mr. Coffee 4 cup permanent filter did not fitreview/text: The Mr. Coffee GTF2-1 Basket-Style Gold Tone Permanent Filter did not fit into my Mr. Coffee 4 cup coffee basket. The filter is cone shaped whereas the coffee maker's basket has straight sides. One would think that a small Mr. Coffee filter would fit a small Mr. Coffee coffee maker. But that was just not the case. I have yet to find a permanent filter for the small coffee maker.
