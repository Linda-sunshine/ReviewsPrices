review/summary: cheap qualityreview/text: I sleep with a fan for white noise. I had always wondered whether a sound machine would work better. Maybe, but not this one. The sounds are okay, but the buttons occasionally choose not to work, making it impossible to change the sounds or even turn the power off. I have given it to my daughters who are willing to sleep with it on one setting, but I could not sleep with it on. I would not buy this one again.
