review/summary: Works Great Until it Lights on Fire... Yes, it Lights on FIRE!review/text: The Cuisinart DCC-1200 is one of the coolest looking coffeemakers around; but after it tries to kill you, your opinion will change.My wife purchased this coffee maker two years ago and just this morning it made a loud "Pop" sound and proceeded to set itself on fire. The burner area was red hot, the coffee in the pot was boiling, the plastic around the burner was melting, and smoke was pouring out of it. My wife and I were both upstairs just before this incident and luckily she just happened to go downstairs and heard a "Popping" sound from the kitchen and was curious enough to investigate further.She pulled out the glass pot, unplugged the coffeemaker, and tossed it outside in the grass where it continued to smolder. The smell of melted plastic and burned wire filled the kitchen. IF THIS HAPPENED WITH US UPSTAIRS IT WOULD HAVE STARTED A HUGE KITCHEN FIRE; IF THIS HAPPENED WITH NOBODY HOME THE ENTIRE HOUSE COULD HAVE BURNED DOWN.After searching Google for "Cuisinart coffeemaker fire" I was blown away to find HUNDREDS of reports of the same exact thing happening to other people. Please do the search yourself before buying this coffeemaker.After this incident and reviewing the other reports of fire, I will NEVER buy a Cuisinart coffeemaker again. I cannot believe that this coffeemaker has not been recalled. When an electrical appliance fails, it should short out, not set itself on fire.If your Cuisinart DCC-1200 coffeemaker hasn't caught fire yet, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT *EVER* LEAVE THE POT UNATTENDED. ALSO, I WOULD BE VERY AFRAID TO USE THE AUTO TIMER JUST IN CASE IT LIGHTS ITSELF ON FIRE BEFORE YOU WAKE UP; and keep a fire extinguisher handy.We reported this incident to the Consumer Product Safety Commission; hopefully they will force a recall and save someone's life. This is not a rare occurrence and Cuisinart's current response appears to be ignoring the problem and hoping that nobody gets hurt or killed.
