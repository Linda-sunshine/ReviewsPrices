review/summary: One Bad Ass Ironreview/text: My old iron was seeing its final days as the power cord was malfunctioning. I have never bought an iron for myself before and thought this was the appropriate time. The Black and Decker D2030 seemed like a good one so I went ahead and made the purchase. Upon taking it out of the box I was surprised at the weight and how awesome it looked. I was excited to use it and went ahead and began ironing some clothes that were in my clean clothes laundry basket. This thing did a heck of a job, heated up quick, steam settings are great and this thing is simply one BAD ASS IRON. I was so excited that I had to text my buddies and let them know that I had the baddest iron on the planet. Sadly at 25 I am feeling old that something like this excites me. None the less, if you do a lot of ironing you want this thing.
