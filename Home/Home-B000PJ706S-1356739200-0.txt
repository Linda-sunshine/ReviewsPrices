review/summary: Almost four blissful years until that smell appeared...review/text: I've had this kettle for almost four years and it still works well, but I have detected a chemical smell/taste in the kettle itself and the water after I use it. I buy filtered water that has no smell or taste. Only once or twice in all this time have I needed to use vinegar and/or 'barkeeper's friend' to remove calcium build-up/rust on the heating element.I'm so bummed because I've loved this water heater as opposed to the plastic one I used to have. From reading all the reviews and similar complaints as well as not finding a water heater without plastic parts, I'll purchase a metal kettle for the stove top. Old school!
