review/summary: The suction on this thing is GREAT.review/text: This vacuum is perfect for a smaller apartment. It is small, the handle collapses, and it is light enough for me to pick up for a few moments. The best part is that it has excellent suction and the canister means there are no bags to clean. I've used mine for about a year now in my new place, with no problems. It works great. Sometimes I have to pull clumps of hair from the rollers, but I have a lot of hair around my home so it's really not unexpected. It's certainly better than paying for a Dyson, which I have heard aren't as great as they seem anyway. This guy definitely does the job, and fits into a small closet. Love it!
