review/summary: I returned itreview/text: It certainly looked good. A toaster and an oven. However, you could not fit two slices of bread in the toaster - what's with that?! And, the instructions say not to bake a potatoe. They are correct you couldn't get a potatoe in the oven. Hamilton Beach needs to go back to the drawing board.
