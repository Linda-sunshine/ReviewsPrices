review/summary: Great quality...15 inch is HUGE!review/text: I bought the 15 inch pan for a Christmas gift for my sister's fiance who just moved into his own apartment, but ended up returning it for the 12 inch. My husband and I got quite the laugh when we opened the box from amazon with the 15 inch pan in it....it was worth the purchase just for that, but really there is no way we could have given this as a gift. The pan would have covered the whole stovetop, and it just wasn't realistic for someone living in an apartment. We thought about keeping it for ourselves, but I'm not sure where we would have stored it. I think it would be ideal for a cabin or for camping to use over the camp fire. The 12-inch was exactly what we were looking for, and the lodge logic brand is the only way to go!
