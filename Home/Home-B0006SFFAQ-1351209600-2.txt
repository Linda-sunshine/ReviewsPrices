review/summary: T-bone22review/text: Two other friends of mine have this particular coffee maker so I wasn't surprised by its performance. In addition to all the switches, lights and dials, this coffee maker makes a very good cup of coffee! Because it heats the water at a higher temperature than my old one, I use about 1/3 less coffee to obtain the same strength. Nice.The only slight disadvantage is the faintness of the fill lines on the side of the pot. I find them difficult to see early in the morning, particularly since I haven't had my first cup of coffee!
