review/summary: Amazon Verified Purchase - Great mattress padreview/text: I bought one pad and decided to buy another, both Queen size. The day they arrived, I bought a new King size bed and got rid of one of the Queen beds. I was very happy to see I could easily return one of the mattress pads (I had only opened the box, none of the packaging). I used the one mattress pad and I am very happy with it. It fits very tight which I like. I ordered a King mattress pad. These are great!
