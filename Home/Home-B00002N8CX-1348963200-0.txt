review/summary: Great functionality, performance and valuereview/text: Needed a small, light duty, vacuum for our store. After checking various reviews, purchased this item from Amazon. It is compact, lightweight, has lots of power and uses a readiliy available dirt bag, which I prefer. It comes with a normal complement of useful accessories and has a convenient length power cord. We use it for bare floors and low-pile carpeting and its performance exceeds our expectations. Three minor, non deal-breaking negative elements are - 1) the hose and tubes are friction fit and can disconnect easily; 2) The hose is corregated plastic and seems a bit cheap; 3)the power cord has a wrap-up rather than retractable storage mechanism. But, the cord wrap-up holder is well designed and located. I would say that the performance is surprisingly beyond light duty and the dirt bag holds plenty of dirt before needing to be changed. All, in all, this is a very good answer if you want an inexpensive, convenient vacuum.
