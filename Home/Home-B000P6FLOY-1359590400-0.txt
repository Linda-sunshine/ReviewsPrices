review/summary: A great meat thermometerreview/text: I'm so glad I bought this! It's much better than the probe that came with my Kitchen Aid oven, and I can watch the temps rise on the display. The cord is long, so it fits on my counter when it's in the over, and cleaning is a breeze. I also like the regular timer more than the one on my oven (without the probe). This is a great product, and I've had flawless results...the calibrations are the important thing here, and this one is right on.
