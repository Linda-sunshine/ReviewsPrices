review/summary: Good reliable coffee maker that keeps your coffee warm all dayreview/text: We have had this coffee maker for over a year now and it works great. There are many reviewers here who complained of coffee leaking out during brewing. The only time ours leaked was when we did not screw on the lid properly (user error). To keep the coffee hot all day, I pre-warm the carafe by filling it with hot water for a few minutes before using. To keep the carafe clean, I fill it with boiling water and a tablespoon of dishwasher detergent, let it sit overnight, and then rinse it off the next morning. Doing this every two weeks keeps the inside of the carafe looking like new. No scrubbing needed. I also keep the coffee-maker clean using vinegar. I fill the coffee-maker with half part water and half part white vinegar and and turn it on, then brew it again with just water. Vinegar helps prevent calcium build-up. Someone here complained that the red ball indicator on their machine stopped working. The red ball should not get stuck in the chamber unless the chamber is filled with calcium and gunk. Regular cleaning should prevent this from happening. Yes, the machine does have a rather loud beep to tell you the coffee is done. It does not bother us. In fact, we like it because we can hear it anywhere in the house. It lets us know when the coffee is done so that we can go into the kitchen to unplug the coffee maker (we unplug our small appliaces when not in use to conserve energy). We would recommend this coffee-maker. Amazon has great prices and fantastic customer service so we would recommend purchasing from them.
