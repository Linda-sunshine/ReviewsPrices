review/summary: Great sheets and long lastingreview/text: I bought a set of these sheets in January 2007 as well as a couple of other sets from other manufacturers. These are still going strong while one of the other sets pilled after a few months and one of thes fitted sheets eventually wore and ripped. These, however, are still smooth and soft and sturdy. They are pretty thick but I still find them soft and I love the sheen and how smooth they feel. I was searching around to replenish my stock and was so glad to find that Amazon is still carrying them as now I am going to buy 2 more sets. I got the Cafe color which is a deep rich gold hue which did not fade. The pockets are nice and deep and fit my pillow top mattress with room to spare.Update -I ordered 2 more sets - one in chocolate and the other in turquoise. The chocolate set shunk so much on the very 1st washing, that it didn't even fit the queen size bed. I estimate it shunk about 4-5 inches on each side. I returned to Amazon, no questions asked. The turquoise set shunk as well but at least it still fit the bed after washing. It was quite large before the washing and snug after. Washed only in cold water. Definate quality control issues with these sheets, buyer beware.
