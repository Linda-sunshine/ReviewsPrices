review/summary: Best value among true HEPA air purifiers.review/text: Of all the "true HEPA" air purifiers in the 200 to 250 CADR range, Honeywell 50250 is the least expensive. CADR is the Clean Air Delivery Rate. The higher the CADR number, the greater the volume of air gets filtered per minute.Prices at Amazon.com250 CADR__Honeywell 50250_______ $129.99_5-year warranty315 CADR__Whirlpool AP45030K____ $249.99_1-year211 CADR__GE AFHC21AM_________ $214.99_1-year240 CADR__Blueair 403____________ $549.00_5-yearI bought this from seller Amazon in December 2012. I would have given this 50250 a 5-star rating if the noise is not so loud.I have a Duracraft HEPA air purifier which is still operating without any problems after 8 years. I notice the Honeywell and the discontinued Duracraft air purifiers use the same design.Make sure you plug air purifiers into a surge protector to make them last longer.
