review/summary: Lid does NOT fitreview/text: Lid does not fit, pops up on one side, have to bang it in, then I get flakes of cast iron in the pot. Was working with amazon to get a replacement, but the product is "under review" the person on the amazon help line could not tell me what what the reason was and the department that does the reviews sometimes responds to internal emails and sometimes does not. The help desk uses the web (the external web that we all get) to find out the status of a review....really amazon...really? Anyway, amazon does not let you post a picture...so hopefully they don't take out this link to imgur [...] so you can see for yourself.EDIT: ok so they did take out my link...this should work: imgur dot com slash 65T6H
