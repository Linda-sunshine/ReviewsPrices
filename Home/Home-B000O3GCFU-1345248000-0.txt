review/summary: Great thermos for travel, work, adult & babyreview/text: I purchased the 10oz Foogo Thermos leakproof stainless steel jar a few months ago for the purpose of carrying cold beverages (milk) to work. It has served me well. I eat my cereal at work. What I do is fill it with milk the night before, place in fridge and bring to work next day with small bag of cereal. Milk stays cold. I have also drank the milk later in day, like afternoon, and it remained cold. I have not tried this thermos for hot beverages or other foods. It does not leak at all as long as you make sure it is sealed tight and properly. It only leaked twice due to my sealing the lid a little lopsided. I recommend this product.
