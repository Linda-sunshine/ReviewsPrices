review/summary: Keurig B40 Elite Brewing Systemreview/text: Says it takes 4 minutes to heat water when in fact it takes about 1 minute. Coffee is easy to make and quality is predictable. I also like that I can use my own freshly ground coffee beans with the eco brew cups. Love this option and they work well. Hope it lasts a long time.
