review/summary: Great size, still holds a lotreview/text: This pitcher is wonderful for a mini-fridge or fridges that don't have a lot of spare room. It fits right in the door, yet still holds a lot of water. I withheld a star simply for the material it is made of, as it seems that it can scraped or fractured semi-easily. But I still recommend this 100%, just be a little careful while using it.
