review/summary: Lasts through the night...review/text: Works very well for my nursery. It lasts a long time without having to refill frequently. My husband usually turns it on when we go to bed at 10pm and lasts until 4pm the next day as long as water has not dried out. Just make sure it is cleaned after each use.
