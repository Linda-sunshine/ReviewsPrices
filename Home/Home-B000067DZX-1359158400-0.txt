review/summary: Great tasting waterreview/text: Maybe not the most technologically advanced but meets my needs.Price was at least 3 dollars per filter cheaper than groceryThe water tastes great and coffee stays fresher longer. My maker will last longer too due to less solid residue.Will order again...
