review/summary: Works just finereview/text: I was worried by some of the reviews that this wouldn't quite work well enough. I have found the opposite to the be the case. This keeps my coffee and tea at a temp that definitely hot but still drinkable. I did switch out from using a tapered base cup to one that was wider at the bottom based off some of the reviews, so I can't say how well it would have worked with my old cup, but it does a fine job with the new one.
