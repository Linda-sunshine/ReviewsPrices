review/summary: This thing is a piece of crap!review/text: Agree entirely on all bad reviews listed above!We bought the 13-Gallon itouchless trash can in August 2012 and it worked fine for about a month.For some reason the lid stopped working in September. We changed the batteries, used adapter, cleaned the sensor. Nothing worked.So disappointed. Do not buy this trash can!
