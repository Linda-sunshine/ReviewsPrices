review/summary: Pressure Problemreview/text: This problem may have already been addressed, but there are just too many reviews for me to make sure. On several other websites I have read reviews of this pressure cooker by people complaining that it will come up to pressure and then immediately go to "warm". This happened to me on both of my cookers so I checked the "trouble shooting" guide in the user's manual and there was the answer. This usually happens after browning if you do not let it cool off for a couple of minutes before beginning to cook under pressure. Solved the problem for me.
