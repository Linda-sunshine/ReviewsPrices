review/summary: Nice bean grinder....review/text: Works really well, automatic function is nice - load it and walk away. Easy to disassemble, clean, etc. Grind selection is more than adequate. It's even pretty quiet! Only complaint is the plastic bean loader is a bit fragile, especially when you are trying to remove it to clean - the flanges are not very strong and can be broken if you aren't careful to turn it completely around to the area where it's removable. I would buy it again without hesitation, just need to be aware of the thin plastic flanges of the bean loader.
