review/summary: Really pretty but not as good as the &#34;plain&#34; Brita pitcherreview/text: I love that its red. But thats pretty much where my love for this pitcher ends. Its definitely not as well made as the old Brita pitchers. Very often when you go to pour the water, the entire top of the pitcher falls off. You have to hold the pitcher with one hand and hold the top on with the other. Really annoying.
