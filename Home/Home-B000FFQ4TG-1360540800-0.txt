review/summary: the greatest home drip brew coffee machinereview/text: We just bought our 3rd BUNN coffee brewer. They last on average 12 years. Even though the NHBB does not have an auto brew timer your really don't need it because it only takes 3-4 minutes max. for it to brew a full 10 cup pot of coffee. It is much easier to pour the water in the top resevoir than the Cusinart we were temporarily using. We prefer to use paper filters in the filter pot as we just knock it against the garbage and the filter pot is clean with a short rinse under hot water: no cleaning out stuck coffee grounds. The warming plate keeps the coffee piping hot for several hours (our family usually drink all the coffee within 30 mintues). We especially like it for big family parties because it is so fast. When we go away for more than 2-3 days we unplug it from the wall. If you are not in a big reckless hurry, the glass coffee pot will pour without dripping all over the counter or table. If you get to agressive, it will over pour and leak spill on the counter or table. We will purchase another one...in 12 years.
