review/summary: Pet Owner's Life-Saverreview/text: This machine, coupled with Hoover Platinum Collection Pet Plus Carpet-and-Upholstery Detergent, pretty much saved my sanity. I was having a faint but noticeable urine smell in my house resulting from an in-training puppy and a cat with a severe UTI. Though both of them are over that, the smell remained, and was driving me insane. You definitely do not want that aroma greeting your guests!!This machine is pretty easy to use. Both the top and bottom are easy to remove. The top canister holds the clean water and can be filled up in the sinks, quickly snapping out and in with a level with almost no effort. The bottom canister holding the dirty water is taken out by leaning the top part back and unhooking two level in the side and is just as easy to get back in.It is slightly loud, but has good suction and cleans amazingly. My house smells normal again and my carpet looks great. I never had any issues with it leaking or anything and it is pretty easy to store. Definitely a must-have for pet owners.
