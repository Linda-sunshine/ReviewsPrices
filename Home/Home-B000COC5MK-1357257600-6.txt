review/summary: Save your money and time, use a traditional corkscrew - this thing is useless.review/text: Maybe I got a defective one considering I only bought this becaues of the great reviews, but mine has turned out to be nothing but junk. It worked maybe 4-5 times on newer corks (inexpensive wine) and although it had some entertainment value using it, I could do the same job in less time with a traditional double hinged waiters corkscrew. Even while it worked though, it would not pull out softer corks from more aged wines, it just crumbled them and tore them up. I ended up going back with my trusty waiters corkscrew to finally get those open.I saw that many people reviewed this item and said it works fine at first, but quits in a few months. Well, they were luckier than me because mine only made it a couple of weeks before it quit working. Then when I pressed the button down the screw went about 1/4&#34; into the cork and stopped like the battery was dead. I put it on the charger for three days after that to make sure it was fully charged and tried again...it did the same thing. I have now tried it twice more over the last week, but it still stops after it hits cork. Since the original packaging went out with all the the other Christmas wrapping and boxes, I can't even send it back now for a refund. (My mistake!) So I spent $20 to open 5 bottles of wine over two weeks, - and now I just have a paperweight with a red light on top!! Save your money.
