review/summary: Pops it just like I rememberreview/text: I remember going to my friends house when I was young and they would make popcorn with the air popper. It produces great popcorn without all the oil. I never liked the over buttered popcorn those microwave bags create. This allows for greater control of how much salt or butter on my popcorn which I like. It doesn't have an on/off switch so you have to watch it, but wasn't that bit of deal back then and it wasn't an issue for me now. You do have to put enough kernels to reach the line as it seems throw out more kernels when you add fewer kernels to pop. Only thing is I wish it would pop all kernels but I don't think that would happen no matter what method one uses as most of the time it depends on the kernel. I haven't had any issues with the motor so far, it seems to hold up for over a year now.
