review/summary: Not for my usesreview/text: I must say I didn't use this grinder to make coffee. I am a placenta specialist and I needed a new grinder to grind dried product before inserting into vegetarian capsules.I found the machine to be very messy. The product fell through the top excessively during grinding and the lid is very hard to take off (especially with gloved hands) so by opening the lid, more of a mess happens.Also the retractable cord which got covered in product due to the messiness is almost impossible to clean, because it all got inside the unit too.This was a one time use for me because I can't clean it properly. Might be great for coffee tho..
