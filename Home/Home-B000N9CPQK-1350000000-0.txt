review/summary: jaybeereview/text: This air purifier has performed very well. Before we got this, no matter how clean I kept the house and litter box, when we would come into the house it smelled a little musty. Now we can't smell anything when we come in. The unit also arrived very promptly as promised. We have two, one for the living room and one for the bedroom. We love them. My daughter has a big dog and was so impressed, she got one for her home.
