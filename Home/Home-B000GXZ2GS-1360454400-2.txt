review/summary: Make great coffee with very little workreview/text: I was intrigued by the reviews here and videos I saw in other websites that I got one of this for Christmas. The aeropress makes a great cup of coffee every time with little effort. It makes better coffee than my drip coffee maker (which I have not used since getting this) and if you buy some good coffee you are in for a treat. Total prep time is about 4 minutes including clean up, and 2 of those are to heat the water in the microwave.
