review/summary: FINALLY long enough 4.5 starsreview/text: I hate when the top sheet has about an inch or two to tuck under our super thick mattress. You buy sheets that say they are for &#34;mattresses up to 18&#34; but while the fitted sheet is great, the top either has either the same length or 3 extra inches that disappear when they are washed. I looked at hotel sheets (Hilton has sheets this long) but they were $150 I think. So I was thrilled to find these.First, though, why the 4.5 stars rating: The sheets smelled so strongly of gasoline or something when I opened them, I had to weigh &#34;really long&#34; against &#34;really nauseating&#34;. I washed the sheets twice in hot water, soaking them with some product for smelly laundry. I was still skeptical that sleeping with my face in the pillow wouldn't detect a lingering odor. But nope. They were fine. And even after all the hot water, I have about 10 inches tucked under the mattress with the top edge of the sheet flat to the top edge of the mattress. I want to give away all the rest of my annoying sheets, and treat myself to another set of these.People who like thin percale sheets, that float lightly over their bodies, will not be excited. But those of us that love the heavy smooth substantial sheets found in many hotels, will be delighted
