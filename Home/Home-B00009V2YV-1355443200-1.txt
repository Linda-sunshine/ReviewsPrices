review/summary: Easy to set upreview/text: This radio works as advertised and was extremely easy to set up. The default weather radio connects to the strongest signal NOAA weather station and saves that setting. But you can change it easily if you want. The AM/FM radio portion has a digital tuner with decent sensitivity and selectivity, and the saved stations feature (3 AM, 3 FM) is very convenient. The reason I took off a star is that there is no sleep feature . This could have been added at relatively little cost.
