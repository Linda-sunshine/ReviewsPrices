review/summary: excellent coffee by the cupreview/text: I bought the Keurig B60 as a birthday gift for my brother. I really enjoy mine. I love the fresh every time concept and it is so quick to make that you are not waiting for several cups to run through a coffee maker. He loves it. He also likes the fresh every time concept. Good gift for a "hard to by for man".
