review/summary: a piece of junkreview/text: This machine leaks from every possible place! Leaks from inside the machine, into the tray, all over my counter and the floor. It uses 20 oz. of water to make a double espresso.... most of which is leaking out everywhere! What a piece of junk. I'm returning it as soon as possible.
