review/summary: Wife loves it!review/text: Got this as an x-mas gift for the wife and she likes it so much more than her previous cheap blender. It's more expensive then your run of the mill juicer but it's definitely worth the price. My wife was going through a ton of fruits and veggies every week using her old juicer. This juicer gets her double the amount if not triple the amount her old juicer used to spit out. You will definitely see the machine pay for itself in the amount of money saved on veggies and fruits compared to a cheaper juicer.
