review/summary: Where's the manual?review/text: I purchased this machine on Amazon and it arrived about a week ago. But it did not have any manual or any paperwork at all. I am in Afghanistan so it was a big hassle to send it back so I waited a few days until I could get on the Internet again as I am in a very remote place and went to Sunbeam's web site and downloaded a manual today. I am going back to my quarters now and attempt to make my first bread. If it turns out good, I will upgrade my review. I just hope the personnel at the factory did not leave anything else out!
