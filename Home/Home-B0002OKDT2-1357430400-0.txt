review/summary: Way too much of a pain in the neck to usereview/text: I normally use a centrifugal juicer and decided to try a masticating juicer because I have heard they extract more juice and the juice has a longer shelf life, but after using this juicer I found that I didn't really get any more juice than I normally do with the centrifugal juicer and it was such a pain in the neck to use that it would never be worth it to me to use this on a consistent basis. If you are looking for a juicer that is easy to use, this is NOT it. The chute was incredibly small so I literally had to cut everything just to feed it down the cute.
