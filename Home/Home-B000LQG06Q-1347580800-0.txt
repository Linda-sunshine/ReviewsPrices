review/summary: great topperreview/text: This is a great mattress topper at a great price. It is the second one I've bought for two different beds. The quality and price can't be beat by any of the stores I shopped at. There was no odor on unwrapping, which I had read could be a problem with some of the other memory foams. I will probably be buying again at a future date for another bed in my home. The two inches is quite comfortable and adequate for comfort.
