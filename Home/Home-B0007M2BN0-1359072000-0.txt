review/summary: works but is it better?review/text: I purchased this because I really like eating protein for a snack, especially hard boiled eggs. I was expecting a 5 minute cook time (I really had no idea) and that is not what I got.This is easy to set up, it is three parts, you put water in the bottom, place the eggs on the tray, put the top on, and throw it in the microwave.The only issue is that for me to get hard boiled eggs in my microwave (Samsung Over the Range 900 watts) it takes 13 minutes to cook. If I just throw a pot on the stove it takes 20 minutes to cook four eggs.Since this is a three piece thing that recommends hand washing (top shelf dishwasher safe), I am having a hard time with thinking this is actually a time saver.I think this will be a product that goes into my donate pile....
