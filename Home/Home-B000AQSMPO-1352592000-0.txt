review/summary: Stopped working after a yearreview/text: I loved my Keurig B60. But right after the one year warranty expired so did my Keuring. It shut off and never came back on. Debating about buying another one. I was wondering if they fixed the bugs. I have read a lot of complaints about the Keurig not lasting much past a year.
