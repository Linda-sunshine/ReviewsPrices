review/summary: kind of fun....review/text: I love hard boiled eggs, but I am not a fan of making them. I thought this egg boiler would be fun to try. It worked well, but you will probably need some trial runs to find the best cook time for your individual microwave. The suggested times were close, but not quite how I like my eggs. I also had a little bit of trouble peeling the egg shells off at first, but overall it was still easier than expected to remove the shells.Overall I really like the product, and I went back and bought another one for my mother. I would say its a good idea for people who don't need to make a lot of eggs at once (4 at a time is the max) and who don't mind using a few eggs to optimize cooking times. Mine will certainly get a good amount of use.
