review/summary: Great bread machinereview/text: I use it mostly in the wintertime and just used it the other day. Made some herb cheese bread in it and it was perfect in every way. Medium setting generates a darker crust than I want so I put it on light and it comes out perfect. I would recommend for anyone who wants the taste of homemade bread. Not noisy as noisy as compared to my old breadmachine.
