review/summary: HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!review/text: We got this as a wedding gift, not on my list. My husband just threw it in the garbage after three years, literally in the garbage. The thing was poorly designed, very messy, it should come with a skewer to clean out the grinder part, instead you get a little brush that doesn't even reach!!!! The container that holds the ground coffee is square making an even bigger mess when you dump it into the coffee filter! And because the container that holds the beans is poorly designed we had to shake the grinder to get the beans down into the grinder portion. Don't buy!!!!!!!
