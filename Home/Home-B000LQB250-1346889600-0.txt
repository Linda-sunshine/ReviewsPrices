review/summary: Twin Size, Huge Disappointmentreview/text: I hate leaving bad feedback but I am extremely disappointed with the mattress topper that was sent. I ordered 2 of the same exact mattress toppers in twin xl throughout the past 4 years, and were very satisfied. I ordered 2 more of the same mattress toppers in twin and this is not even memory foam. It feels just like regular, cheap foam - this is not at all dense, and it is questionable to even call this "memory foam." I am very upset, and I apparently can't return it.
