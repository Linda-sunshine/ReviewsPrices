review/summary: Great Productreview/text: Wife had never owned one and wanted to see if they were as good as advertised. She is very happy with her new blender. Everything about the blender is just what she wanted. Ease of use. Ease of cleanup. Comfortable grip. All were great. Unit cleans up easily and is dishwasher safe. Others have written that the seals leak and allow water to intrude into the stick. She has not had this problem at all. If you want an immersion blender this one is about the best we've seen.
