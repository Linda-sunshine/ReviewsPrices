review/summary: So easy! So delicious!review/text: I loved my Moka Express 3-Cup Espresso Maker. I made a pot every morning, drank half and saved the other half for the next day. Best/Worst thing ever for my caffeine addiction until one day I forgot to put the gasket in, got a bunch of grounds stuck in the tube to the main reservoir and then compounded my error by putting it in the dishwasher. The dishwasher ruined the finish.I just ordered a new one and I promise to follow the instructions. What can I say? I hadn't had any espresso yet that morning...
