review/summary: Fantastic - Can't beat itreview/text: Very good product. Performs exactly as expected. Not having an "off" switch seems a bit odd, but you just unplug it when you're done. Very simple, but a quality product. I really like that it's not over-engineered. Great example of when something works, don't make it too complex! Very happy with this product. You can pay more for extra bells & whistles, but you don't need them.
