review/summary: Just awesomereview/text: For the coffee and tea enthusiast, I highly recommend. My wife had this mug for over a year before I decided to buy one of my own. You can make tea at 8am and at 5pm, with the lid on, the tea is still toasty, as if you just made it. Easy to use and well put together. Worth every penny and more affordable by $10 on Amazon than I purchased at my local tea shop.
