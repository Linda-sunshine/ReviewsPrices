review/summary: The perfect gift for a new motherreview/text: beautiful piece. It is about 1 foot tall and doesn't take up much space but it makes me so happy when I see it. I love the smootheness of the piece tho I don't know what it is made of, too cold to be wood. I also like the piece with dad holding baby whil sitting and mom behind him, I opted to get this one thinking it would take up less space but they are small. Mine was purchased at Hallmark and they have a great selection.
