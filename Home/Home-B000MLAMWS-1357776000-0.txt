review/summary: KitchenAid Professional 600review/text: My husband had been telling me for a while to get a stand mixer. Quite frankly I didn't think I would use it. Well, I was wrong, I have had this mixer for over a year now and I use it so much that it has a permanent place on my counter top. Some of the things I use it for are Mashed Potatoes (I've done up to 10 pounds), Meatloaf, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, White Bread Dough, Doggie cookies, Cake Mix and Whipping Cream.We also have the pasta maker and ravioli maker attachment, they are a really cool feature, but just too much work for me. I highly recommend this stand mixer. We did post a video on YouTube demonstrating some of items above. If you are interested, just search WeRmudfun on YouTube.
