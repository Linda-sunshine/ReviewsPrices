review/summary: This best flannel sheet I have ever had.review/text: This the softest flannel sheet that we have ever had. It washes up so nice - no loss of fabric in the wash. It is so easy to put on our thick mattress - so other sheets seem to shrink up fast and are so difficult to put on the mattress. Sleeping between the two sheets is like being in a luxurious cocoon. We ordered two more for our cabin in Minnesota and will order one more for Hawaii.
