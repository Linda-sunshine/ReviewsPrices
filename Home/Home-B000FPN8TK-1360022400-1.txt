review/summary: SUPER EASYreview/text: I love this teapot. I enjoy using loose tea leaves and this pot makes it so easy. I add the leaves to the pot, get hot water directly from my Keurig, wait two minutes, place this pot on top of my cup so it can fill it, and simply rinse the teapot out so it is ready for the next brew. Super easy. This makes a great gift since everyone who sees what it does is just amazed.
