review/summary: Great!!review/text: I owned a store for years, and this inexpensive version of our industrial one works great at home! The chamber holds enough water to steam quite a few pieces of clothing. (Side note, we used it to remove old wallpaper backing and it works amazing! Haha.) Highly recommended!! Works great for things you have to hang dry and don't want to shrink by putting in the dryer, or for clothes ordered online with major creases. Cheaper and easier than an iron and ironing board. Do it.
