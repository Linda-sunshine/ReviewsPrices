review/summary: Great vacuum - still going after 5+ years!review/text: Got this because of my allergies.Still kicking today!Replaced the filter a few times along the way (cheap generic ones on Amazon) no problem.The only reason it is short a star is recently we discovered that it isn't great at taking care of pine needles after Christams.Other than that, great, compact vacuum for small to large sized apartment.
