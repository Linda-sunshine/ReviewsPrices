review/summary: Great performance at a great pricereview/text: I am a big fan of more expensive Henckels knives, but decided to try out this knife based on recommendations from one of my favorite cooking shows, America's Test Kitchen, as I never seem to have enough chef's knives in the house. Wow, were they right. Knife has a study handle fit, is well balanced between blade and handle, easy to clean and most importantly delivers precise cuts. I still love my Henckels, but am also pleased to have a high quality but much less expensive Victorinox in my knife drawer.
