review/summary: Works great for some types of vegetables, not so well with othersreview/text: First off, this machine is awesome for hard fruits & veggies such as apples and carrots. I can insert an entire granny smith apple into the chute and it is juiced within 2 seconds. I use it almost every day and it is as sturdy as any juicer I've ever seen. My only complaint is that a centrifugal juicer just doesn't get the job done with leafy green vegetables such as kale and spinach. Putting even three bunches of kale into the juicer results in about 1/2 cup of green juice and a big pile of pulp. Better to use a masticating juicer for leafy greens.
