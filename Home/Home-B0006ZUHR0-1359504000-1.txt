review/summary: love itreview/text: the Black & Decker D2030 Auto-Off Digital Advantage Iron works like a charm. it gets the work done and it does it pretty well. the temperature can be preset to a desired temp based on the type of clothing you are ironing with. the functionality is simple and i was able to use without reading the manual and instruction that came with the iron . one time i forgot the iron and left in on connected to the sucker. i came back and it had turned it self off. that is a very big advantage for a forgetful person like me
