review/summary: Nice chair.review/text: It wasnt too hard to put together. Seat is heavy and I was worried about bending the arms putting the chair together, with the seat on my floor. Chair feel good to me so far, this is my first day of use tho. Cushion is softer than my previous chair. The arm adjusters are kinda flimsy, takes a few tries to get it how you want. I see ppl saying the chair isnt deep or long enough. Adjust the back and seat until its how you want it. I thought it wasnt too....until I adjusted the back...and scooted my butt back in the seat...lol.On that note...easy to adjust the seat and back. I do wish the seat, back and up/down levers were more closer together. The up/down lever is perfect, the others are too far back and low to me. You can loosen the knobs on the arms underneath the seat to make them wider or closer. You have to put the knobs thru the long hole to do that. (There is a long and a regular hole under the seat)
