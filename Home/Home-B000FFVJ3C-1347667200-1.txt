review/summary: nesco fd-75pr 700-watt food dehydratorreview/text: This is my second food dehydrator and it is a much better product than my first one. Aside from good construction, I like having the ability to select the temperature. The one thing I don't like is that there is no off switch and it must be uplugged each time I want to look inside. It does an excellent job of drying food quickly and I was able to purchase extra trays, leather sheets and micropore sheets.
