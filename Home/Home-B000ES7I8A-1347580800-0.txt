review/summary: Speedy Kettle, No Plasticreview/text: As a big drinker of coffee and tea I've been wanting an electric kettle for a while but haven't found one without plastic that seemed like it delivered the goods. I always trying to minimize the amount of contact that boiling water that I'm going to drink has with plastic, but finding an electric kettle that is all metal (or ceramic) that delivers fast boiling times has been a difficult task. I've tried multiple metal kettles and at least one ceramic kettle but none of them delivered an acceptably fast boil. That search is over with this electric kettle. Boiling water never comes in contact with plastic and the kettle is fast an effective. The water comes out tasting great, with no taste that I can detect imparted by this kettle. A full 8 cups of water takes less than five minutes to boil and smaller portions are even faster. There is one plastic part that could come in contact with boiling water, specifically a plastic strainer that attaches to the lid, however it takes about 30 seconds to remove the strainer (and if you ever want to use it you can easily replace it). I've been enjoying more tea than ever lately and it's thanks to this speedy little guy!
