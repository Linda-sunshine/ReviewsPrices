review/summary: Good product that arrived safely and promptlyreview/text: We have used it twice. I am very heavy, Bob lighter. The bed inflated quickly to firm and stayed that way all night. It took about six minutes to deflate, somewhat longer than to inflate. It folds well, but I assume in a cold camp area folding the heavy plastic or plasticized material would present stiffness.
