review/summary: Capresso H20 Plus Glass Water Kettlereview/text: After reading the reviews I purchased this kettle from another source (closer by). It performed well for one year and 45 days. In fact it got admiration from guests and I enjoyed its heating speed and other qualities.On the one year and 46th day it simply would not go on-at all. I called the compay and told the customer service the above. He asked when and where I had bought it and proceeded to offer me a new one at $35.00 with no shipping costs. I said that I was not interested in buying another that would last only a litlle over a year. I suggested that he inform his company that their product and offer was not satisfactory; he was in a hurry and I doubt that he will pass it on. (I suspect he has heard this complaint before!)I will not buy another product from them and I do not recommend this kettle due to its built-in obsolescence. That is very bad for the environment. I had read other reviews complaining that it lasted only a short time, but I confess that I thought maybe they had mis-used it. I apologize to the those if I was mistaken. I am careful and I have followed the instructions to the letter-it has not been mis-used.So, it's back to heating a pot of water on the stove top-maybe that's more economical in the long run anyway.
