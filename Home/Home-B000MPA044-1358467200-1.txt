review/summary: new methodreview/text: As a child my mother would cook using a pressure cooker, I have never used one. I remember the ease of cooking fresh meals for my father when he got home from work. He did not have regular hours and would come home at different times every day. In a half hour she would have a fresh meal made so that we could have dinner as a family. I have not had the opportunity to use the pressure cooker yet but I am looking forward to rebuilding my memories.I was amazed at the speed of delivery and look forward to doing business with this seller again.
