review/summary: Perfect cup of coffeereview/text: I love the taste of coffee that this thing makes. I am using espresso roast from Starbucks and I am loving it. Will try Illy next. One thing that I would recommend is to make your coffee with stove at low or else the boiling coffee on the top part of the container spills even with the reservoir half.
