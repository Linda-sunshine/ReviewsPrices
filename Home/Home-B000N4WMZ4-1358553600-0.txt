review/summary: good quality and constructionreview/text: I purchased this from Amazon late December and have used about ten times. I own more than a handful of lodge products and all have done very well however this is my first coated cast iron. Nonetheless, it is very well constructed, with details like the black porcelain enameled rim of the pot and the lid setting it apart from some of the other inexpensive alternatives. for the price it's a better quality than I expected. It also had really fast shipping and I would trust this company again and will prefer from them in the future.
