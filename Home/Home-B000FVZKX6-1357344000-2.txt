review/summary: Terrific!review/text: 5 stars for everything- quality, softness, and durability. I've been buying these sheets for years and they are great. Deep corners, too. Color stays the same forever, as best as I can tell. Much less lint in the dryer than other flannel sheets- actually, very little lint- period.
