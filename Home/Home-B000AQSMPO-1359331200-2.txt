review/summary: Barely used and now brokenreview/text: We received this model as a gift. We're not hard core coffee drinkers, which is why we thought this would be a good idea. We could purchase the K-cups instead of large bags of coffee, they would last a while, and we wouldn't have to brew a whole pot for the one or two cups we drink once a week or so. We probably used the machine 30-40 times and now it's broken. It turns on, makes some noise like it's working, then shuts itself off. It never pulls in any water or heats it. We always used bottled water so it shouldn't be a problem with scaling or deposits. We can't get it to work even occasionally. It's just beyond a year so it's out of warranty. I feel bad that the person who gave it to us spent $150 on it since we're probably going to end up throwing it out. I've heard you can call Keurig and complain and they'll sell you a new one for $100, but I'm really on the fence about this product. When it worked, it worked great. But there are obviously huge reliability issues with these machines. One of my friends is on his third machine. It seems like everyone else I know who has one has had problems with it as well. This isn't a throw away machine. It should last longer than a year with occasional use. If I were looking for a new one, I'd probably wait for a new model and see if there are quality issues with it before buying. They don't exactly have a good track record though.
