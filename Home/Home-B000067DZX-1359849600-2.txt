review/summary: Filters work wellreview/text: I've been using these water filters for a couple of years now. I have both a PUR water pitcher and a PUR water dispenser. The water tastes good after running through these filters. I live in a suburban area on the outside of the capitol city of our state. We have a relatively new water treatment plant but our water still isn't as good without some filteration.
