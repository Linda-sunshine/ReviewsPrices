review/summary: Good idea, bad resultsreview/text: This looked like the perfect product to make coffee without the cost and mess of paper filters. The results did not live up to the expectations. When making coffee with this filter and using the water filter, the coffee? comes out as slightly colored water. Not good. When making coffee with the basket and leaving the water filter off, there is a lot of sediment in the bottom of the pot and your cup. That was not acceptable to me so I have put the filter basket up in the cupboard and am back to buying and using paper filters. The coffee now comes out great. (I buy my coffee in bulk at the market and grind it there using "drip" grind)
