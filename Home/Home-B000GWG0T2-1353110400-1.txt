review/summary: A chipper BAD version of the GOOD pan??review/text: Do NOT buy this one. I was looking for inexpressive yet functional non-stick for quite some time. I bought this one based on the American kitchen review, but it looks like they were talking about a different pan? As the matter of fact, they were talking about a pan that was supposed to be $36. When I saw it for $25 I've become even happier. The pan looked nice out of the box, but then I put it on my electrical oven and in 30 seconds the bottom center went UP!!! creating a very uneven surface. I have never saw anything like this or any of my inexpensive pots and pans have ever had this. TOTAL WASTE of every sent of 25 dollars.
