review/summary: Works well for a little while.review/text: I've purchased two of these over the past two years, because I really liked the infrared heat when working - I put it next to my desk in my small office. However, neither lasted a full season. They were inexpensive enough not to get too upset about it, but now that the price is higher I guess I won't be getting a third. And no, there is no way to get money back once it's not working.
