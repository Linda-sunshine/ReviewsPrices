review/summary: Very Happyreview/text: We decided to give this a chance since the reviews were good and our Melita died in less than a year and before that a Cuisinart in less than two years. We love it so far, it works great. Easy to program...holds 10 cups....pot easy to pour but if our happiness changes, we will update this review.
