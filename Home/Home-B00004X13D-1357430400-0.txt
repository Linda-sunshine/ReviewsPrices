review/summary: After a year, waffles sticking a lot.review/text: After just over a year and only occasional use, waffles now stick constantly. I do use spray. Also a pain to clean around the plates. Would be better if the plates were removable. Now buying a replacement. Many thanks to all those who leave reviews: makes picking one a breeze.
