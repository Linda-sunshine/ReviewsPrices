review/summary: Takes very long to pop upreview/text: I purchased this product because of it's stainless interior, it's quality and style, but I was surprised to see that the automatic pop up doesn't work properly, after the water reaches boiling, it would continue to bubble for at least a minute or two, (and for boiling water that's allot, making wet the whole cabinet above it from the steam) till it finally stops, I have had other Kettle's (cheaper) that popped immediately as water reached boiling.
