review/summary: Good space heatingreview/text: Puts off a lot of heat for such a small unit. My only dislike... the arrow showing where you've turned the dial. It's all white and hard to see. A black marker fixed that in a snap.The switch on this unit can be left in an "on" position while unplugged, allowing it to instantly power up once it is plugged in. This is useful if you are using a programmable outlet to determine a schedule to turn this unit on and off. (For example, either a Heavy Duty Timed Outlet or a Thermostatically Controlled Outlet).
