review/summary: Absolutely one of the bestreview/text: In terms of price vs performance this knife sharpener is absolutely one of the best. Extremely easy to use and phenomenal sharpness on the blades when using this product. Highly recommend. Maybe the only thing bad I could say is that it is a bit loud, but it's a knife sharpener. It's stone rubbing against metal. Why would anyone expect that to be quiet?
