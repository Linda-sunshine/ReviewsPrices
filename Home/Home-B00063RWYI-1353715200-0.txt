review/summary: I love it!review/text: It's heavy, but I love it. I made my first ever pot roast with a huge piece of chuck, and it was absolutely awesome! I was able to sear it/brown the onions, potatoes, carrots and hunk of meat really nicely first -- the pan really gets nice and evenly hot. And then I threw it all in the oven with some beef stock on 275 for 4 hours (this was a HUGE chunk of meat) and OMG it was one of the tastiest things I've ever made. And yes, I attribute it to the Dutch oven. It holds the heat really well and cooks so evenly. I'm really happy with this purchase.
