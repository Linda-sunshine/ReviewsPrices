review/summary: Good productreview/text: This pan is too good. Gets heated up way sooner than other pan. Keep it on a very low flame and it should take care of the rest. I use it to make dosas (INDIAN crepes). Its tough in the beginning, but u get used to it later. As far as maintaining is concerned, rub it with cooking oil and keep it aside after use. that helps to have a smooth use next time.
