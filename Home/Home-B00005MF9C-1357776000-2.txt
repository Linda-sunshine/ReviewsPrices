review/summary: You get what you pay for....review/text: It's inexpensive because it's very low quality. The whole thing smells like melting plastic when it brews, and I'm guessing it's because the plastic it's made out of is so soft and flimsy. Makes me wonder how many chemicals are getting into the coffee. It also makes a mess as the grounds tend to overflow from the strainer. Oh well, at least it was cheap.
