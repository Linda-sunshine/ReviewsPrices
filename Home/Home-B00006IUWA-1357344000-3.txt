review/summary: Vast improvement over microwave popcorn: save money, easy to use, just as fast, much better tastingreview/text: Simple product that is designed well, works well, and ends up saving you money. I am not a huge popcorn eater but was browsing around Amazon and came across this. I was intrigued by the positive reviews and price. I shopped popcorn and saw you could get a 5lb of organic popcorn for under $12.Great Northern Organic Yellow Gourmet Popcorn--5 PoundsI also liked that it is just hot air, but in a good way. So organic popcorn just corn and hot air, and then any butter and/or salt I want to add.It works pretty well. A half cup of kernels produces a substantial amount of popcorn. It does pop out some unpopped kernels at the beginning and it can send those some distance. But after a minute or so you start getting the flood of popped corn. Almost everything pops just a few kernels left and zero burned popcorn every time I have used it.The measuring cup on top you can put butter in and if it is at room temp or if you microwave it for a few second then put it in the cup it will melt it. I use a small amount of salt and butter and just great tasting popcorn. Much better than microwave, money saver, fun for our 2.5 year old to watch the popcorn pop. Good purchase, recommended.
