review/summary: Update - no longer workingreview/text: This trash can works as advertised and looks great also! I love that my garbage bag is hidden from view.12/10/12 - I felt I needed to update my review. The lid is no longer working. Sometimes we unplug it from the wall and plug it back in and it will work. Other times it doesn't. Sometimes it opens but doesn't close. It's easiest to actually lift the lid at this point rather than get frustrated when it doesn't work.
