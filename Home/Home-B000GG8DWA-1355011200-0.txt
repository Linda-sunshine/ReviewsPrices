review/summary: Cute and Good So Farreview/text: This heater gives off a very pretty orangish light and of course works on only 400 watts on the low setting. It's a supplementary heat source to make things toasty on cold mornings and it works well. I've plugged it into a power bar and use the power bar as an on/off switch - did this because reviews on here seemed to indicate the heater just quit working for some people and I thought perhaps that might be the on/on/settings switch going on the heater.
