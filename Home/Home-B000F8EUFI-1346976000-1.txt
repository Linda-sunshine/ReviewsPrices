review/summary: Great for cat hair!review/text: I was cautious about buying this since it was so cheap. Honestly. But upon using it the first time my apprehension was relieved and I discovered how awesome this vacuum is!! I have 2 cats, which means I have a lot of cat hair. Other vacuums don't even come close to picking it up, but this one just sucks it away. I am totally satisfied with this purchase.
