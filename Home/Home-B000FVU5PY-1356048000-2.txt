review/summary: Easy 5-starsreview/text: Okay, so this is not quite as luxurious as my 800tc sheet set, but for the price, I don't think the quality and fit will be beat. Very comfortable and fits on my 12&#34; tall mattress with no problem. The fitted sheet was almost too big at first, but after washing and drying a couple times, it got nicely snug. I would not hesitate to purchase these again
