review/summary: Cheap and Chippy - Crackled All Over!review/text: I couldn't afford a Le Creuset just yet (not many can) so I settled on this from Amazon after reading great reviews about it. One thing is certain, it is a bargain. However, it chipped within the first month of use, revealing the cast iron underneath. Then, something peculiar began to happen. The interior cream enamel developed a million little micro-cracks, so much so that after about 8 months of use, the surface resembled an ancient oil painting. This was after the chips continued to develop and grow. Pretty soon, I had to throw it away because I couldn't trust that I wouldn't bite down on a piece of it and break a tooth. I now own two Le Creuset pieces and have yet to see a chip, crack, or any defect after months of use. I supposed you get what you pay for.
