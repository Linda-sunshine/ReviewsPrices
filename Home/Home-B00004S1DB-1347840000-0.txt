review/summary: Good pressreview/text: I have had this for about a week now. So far it works well, and I love the fact that it keeps the coffee hot. I have had no problem with grinds getting through the mesh either. It makes about 4 regular size cups of coffee so not suitable for large crowds but perfect for just a few people.
