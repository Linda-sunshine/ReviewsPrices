review/summary: Tin Roof..RUSTEDreview/text: After using my Lodge 7 quart for the first time for a pot roast,I noticed a little rust and so seasoned it,but now after making a stew, I notice alot of rust..so much for pre-seasoning..It's not a big deal to season it again,but I would have assumed that the factory pre-seasoning would have lasted longer,particularly for the price I paid
