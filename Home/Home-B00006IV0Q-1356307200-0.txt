review/summary: hot percolator coffee.review/text: After 40 years of drinking luke warm, plastic coffee, I gave up. Got to thinking about how much I used to like my mom's coffee out of the percolator. Read reviews and decided that I was just another person who got sucked in by great marketing for the drip coffee makers.Bought this percolator, the coffee is hot, hot, hot and it tastes great. Once you adjust the amount of coffee for your own personal taste, you won't be running to Starbucks to get a good cup of coffee.Clean up is no big deal, maybe an extra minute over the drip maker, but to have all stainless is worth an extra minute in the morning.
