review/summary: Goooooood coffee!review/text: I always thought the best coffee in the universe was what my Granma gave me back in the 40's with biscuits and white gravy - all made on the woodstove. Yes, in 1946 I was 2 yrs old and drinking black coffee with two sugars......hey, my Granma didn't know any better. In the 50's my mom & dad moved up to an electric percolator. But by then I had become addicted to Ovaltine. In the 60's mom was sold on Joe DiMaggio's pitch for Mr. Coffee. Lousy coffee. I got married and moved out. Long story slightly shorter. The cat knocked my Cuisineart coffee pot off the counter and broke it. I read all the reviews on Amazon and thought I'd give this a shot. Holy smokes, great coffee!! The only thing that would make it better would be my mom and Granma hanging out in my kitchen. Still drink a glass of Ovaltine and night though.Seriously, give this pot a try - it is absolutely the best. And here is a shameless plug for Chock Full of Nuts French Roast Coffee, it's very reasonably priced (stock up when there is a sale) and this pot extracts every bit of goodness out of it.A tip of the hat and a big THANK YOU to Amazon for selling me something I would have never ever considered and really would have missed out on.
