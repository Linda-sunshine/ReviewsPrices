review/summary: Ginsu knivesreview/text: I bought this set of knives at the begining of the year and for the most part these knives are really good. Although they say dishwasher safe, every time i put them in the dishwasher they came out slightly rusty. Now I just wash them by hand and they don't rust. So I wouldn't suggest to put them into the dishwasher. Over all they are still sharp and great to use. I have had no other problems with them, so I just might buy another set at some point.
