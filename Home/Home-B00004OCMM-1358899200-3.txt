review/summary: Best Manual Openerreview/text: This thing is solid, well constructed with no looseness and makes opening a can an almost enjoyable experience. I've had a lot of can openers that start getting to be more of a battle with continued use. One of them, with a very recognizable brand name, started jumping off the track a few times around the top of the can and it became very hard to turn the knob. The OXO feels fabulous, smooth, very easy to turn, it's just a great can opener! Bring on the cans!!!!! Highly recommended and worth the extra money. The Mercedes-Benz of can openers!! I also bought one as a gift. I like to make homemade chili and with the tomato sauces, canned tomatoes, three kinds of canned beans, canned paste, it was becoming a real chore opening all of those cans....now....it's a breeze. Get this! It's the best.
