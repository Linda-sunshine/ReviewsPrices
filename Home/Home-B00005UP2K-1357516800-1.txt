review/summary: You'll also need a hand-mixer and a good repairmanreview/text: In the beginning, my KA worked very well for large batches of cookies and mixing huge cakes. HOWEVER it only worked for large batches. Things like pancake batter, a single coffeecake, 2 egg whites, and whipped cream don't have enough volume to mix in the KA. You'll need a handmixer if you don't want to stir those things up by hand.Another huge problem is that the thing broke. For the price of this KA, it should be reliable. Mine didn't even last a year, and I cannot find a repairman. Phone calls to KA yielded the information that I'd have to drive 3 hours over the mountains to get someone to look at it and see if it can be fixed. We can only use the mixer by constantly sliding the power level back and forth with one hand, while whacking the KA on the side with the other hand. My daughters are willing to do that, but I am not.
