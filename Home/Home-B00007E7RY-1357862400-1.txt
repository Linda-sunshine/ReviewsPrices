review/summary: Worth Every Pennyreview/text: We live in a very dusty farm community and have constant sinus and allergy problems. We put this purifier in the bedroom and noticed a HUGE improvement practically overnight. It does generate a little white noise but my wife likes that when she's sleeping, so we were able to put away the bedside fan we've always used for that purpose.
