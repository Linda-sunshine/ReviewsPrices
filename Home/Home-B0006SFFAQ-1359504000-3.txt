review/summary: Beautiful But Flawed Designreview/text: Beautiful But Flawed DesignI will agree with several other reviewers that this is a beautiful but flawed machine.1. First the minor annoyances. The water fill reservoir is located in the very back of the machine and is awkward to use. It is difficult not to spill water either onto your countertop or into the coffee grounds.2. The basket is too small for 12 cups with anything extra for strength/flavor adjustment. With a full 12-cup pot, coffee will either be on the weak side, or if you try to compensate and fill the basket coffee grounds will overflow and accumulate on the underside of the lid.3. Brew Pause feature is non-functional. At first I thought the basket was leaking because water would continue to drip whenever the carafe was removed. Further investigation revealed the basket was not leaking, but the drip is the result of hot water & steam escaping around the basket. This happens even with the basket locked securely in place. This is obviously a design flaw as many others have experienced the same problem.4. Lastly, and my major complaint with this machine is the basket fitment, which is a 2-step requirement. The basket will only fit one way and this is no problem. The second requirement is the basket must be pushed down and snapped into proper locking position. This crucial second step is very easy to overlook as the lid appears to be closed and timer set for your morning coffee. However, should you fail in accomplishing this all-important second step, this machine will dump the entire 12-cups of coffee and grounds onto your kitchen and floor. I see by the reviews others have experienced this AM disaster as well, some believing their machines had exploded overnight.
