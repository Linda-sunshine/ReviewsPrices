review/summary: Broke after 5 months!review/text: This was one of the worst coffee makers I have ever purchased! I miss my Braun! The lid over the basket of grounds would always be full of coffee after brewing and the clock is too little. Difficult to clean and now it won't even brew. What a waste of money.
