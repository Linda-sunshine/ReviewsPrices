review/summary: arrived with dead batteryreview/text: The clock itself seems pretty good, but right out of the box its internal battery appears to be dead, as it doesn't seem to 'remember' the time, and certainly does NOT come preprogrammed to the time, as stated in its manual. So one has to assume it's just been sitting in a warehouse a very long time and no one checks them before they ship. That, to say the least is disappointing. My &#34;automatic time set clock&#34; wasn't.
