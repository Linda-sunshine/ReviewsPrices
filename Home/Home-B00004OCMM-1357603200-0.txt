review/summary: Nice!review/text: I bought this on the suggestion of another reviewer when I was looking at replacing my rusted Kitchen-Aid can opener attachment for my mixer. It arrived quickly. A well made attractive can opener that makes opening cans easy and doesn't have to sit out on the counter top.
