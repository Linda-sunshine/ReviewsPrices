review/summary: So Far Very Pleasedreview/text: Over the years we have had many different coffee makers; so far we are very ,very pleased with this unit. As far as durability I cannot address that issue yet. What we do like is this, we can select a coffee style we like e.g. I like a strong robust coffee, my wife like it a little weaker and my in-laws prefer a weaker blend. Instead of brewing a whole pot of coffee, now we can brew to each person's desire,without wasting coffee.I often like a cup of coffee at night, but because of the caffeine, I go without, but now I can brew a single cup of decaf robust coffee without the waste.To increase the life of the brewing machinery I would be very, very careful to use a water filtration system before brewing.There is a filter provided with the coffee maker, but I feel it is less than adequate; that is if you do not change the small filter very often. Some parts of the county has water that is very brackish and has a very high mineral continent, you should purchase some type of water filtering system with the coffee maker. We are luck here we have some of the best water in the county, but we still filter the water we use.Most coffee pot very seldom last more than 3 years before giving up, I imagine this will be so with this pot, I'll just go buy another when that day comes.The only draw back is the coffee packets are pretty expensive, about 70 cents a cup, but if you enjoy good coffee that isn't to bad considering what you pay at Starbucks etc.
