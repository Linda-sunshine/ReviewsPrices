review/summary: weak speaker, inaccruate timekeepingreview/text: i returned this. the speaker was crappy which wouldn't be a problem except the radio i was replacing, which is a 15 year old GE clock radio, had a bigger, fuller sound. i thought i was upgrading but i guess they made better stuff back then. And just like many other negative reviews the auto-time set was off 5 minutes. i don't see how an auto time set is a necessary function for a clock radio anyway, did that many people complain about having to manually set their clocks?
