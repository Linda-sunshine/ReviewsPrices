review/summary: Words can't describe how much I love this thing.review/text: This is my second-most beloved item in my kitchen (the first being my KitchenAid stand mixer). After finding myself endlessly frustrated with baking stones (hard to clean, hard to maneuver, unimpressive results), I bought this. It's all of the things the baking stone wasn't. It cleans up with a couple of swipes of a paper towel, unless cheese gets baked on, in which case all you have to do is let it sit on the burner for a minute or two, then it scrapes right off. The handles make it easy to put in and out of the oven, although it is pretty heavy. But hey! That just means using it counts as your weight training for the day, right? :-)But most of all, it makes a gorgeous pizza, with a beautifully crisp-on-the-outside-but-tender-on-the-inside crust and perfectly cooked toppings. I now make homemade pizza at least once a week because the results are so good.And it's versatile. Oven fries and hash browns come out perfectly, and it's great for roasting veggies and baking cookies (when I bake cookies, I use parchment paper to prevent any off flavors). Free-form bread loaves look professional.The key to success with this is pre-heating. Cast iron takes a while to heat up, so just plopping food on it while it's cold will yield disappointing results.
