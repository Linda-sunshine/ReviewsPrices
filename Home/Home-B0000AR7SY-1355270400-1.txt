review/summary: Great, When it Worked...review/text: We loved this grinder for the VERY short time it functioned! We make coffee every morning and it worked well for 7 days and then it didn't work at all. The Capresso company had us ship it back to them for a replacement. Hopefully the second one will work longer than the first, but in the meantime we're back to using an old Krups grinder we were given as a wedding gift 26 years ago. I'm hoping I can update this review with a positive outcome regarding this grinder! I plan on buying another grinder for our vacation home. It won't be a Capresso.
