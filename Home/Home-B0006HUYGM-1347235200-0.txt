review/summary: WOW!review/text: I originally bought an Oreck canister vac (not from Amazon). It destroyed the electrical outlet it was plugged into about one minute into it's first use (to be fair, here, Oreck said it has never had a similar complaint). In addition, the dirt cup was easy to open up and empty, but hard to get back together again.This Eureka hand-held vac is not as loud as the Oreck canister vac, is super easy to operate and empty, plus the dirt cup easily clicks back into place. It does a terrific job of picking up cat hair from my furniture and sucks up dirt easily. At one-fifth the cost of an Oreck canister vac, the Eureka hand-held vac is a terrific value, without sacrificing any suctioning power for the difference in price and smaller size. The Eureka stores in a very small amount of space.Other reviews here have stated that it was a little heavy, but I did not find that to be the case. I have a permanent shoulder /arm disability. I did not have any trouble using this little Eureka vac -- even with my bad arm!I love this little Eureka vac. I think you will too!
