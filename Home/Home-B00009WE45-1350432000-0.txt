review/summary: Stopped workingreview/text: The thermometer worked for a month or so and then could not be adjusted and it fogged up so you could not see the digital readout (it is supposed to be waterproof and I was pretty careful with submerging it in water because of other reviews). I bought it mostly to check the temperature of milk when making yogurt, so I am back to testing with my little finger like our great grandmothers used to. It was past the date to return it to Amazon and I have not contacted the manufacturer yet. I can not recommend the product to anyone, unless the replacement works well and lasts for years.
