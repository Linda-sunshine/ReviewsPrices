review/summary: For $80?!! Best bang for your vacuum cleaner buck bar none.review/text: Honestly, I'm surprised Hoover actually produces these as it's got to cut into sales of higher priced models they sell. Okay, there are no bells and whistles, but for every day vacuuming needs, for LESS than 100 bucks, it's an awesome deal. I've had mine for several years now. I'm no 'clean gene' so this serves my needs to the 'T'. Five stars in my book.
