review/summary: 21-1/2 quart pressure cannerreview/text: Very good quality pressure canner. Heavy and beautiful looking canner. Big enough to can 7 quart jars and 14 pint jars. This canner will last me many years. The main reason that I purchased a pressure canner was to can tomatoes and some low acid veggies. This canner is made in the USA and not some cheap China made. Love it!!
