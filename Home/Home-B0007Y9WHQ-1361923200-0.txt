review/summary: For any low-carb/low-GI enthusiast - you MUST have this.review/text: It works perfectly, as advertised. Mrs and I have totally, and I mean TOTALLY, have replaced white-carb pasta with butternut, yellow, and zucchini squashes. Use the coarse spiral blade; blanch the squash curly strands in boiling water for about 30 seconds (a little more for butternut)? And you have the perfect bed for any traditional pasta gravy recipe.Don't let anyone fool you. EMPTY CARBS (white flour, sugars, white rice, white potatoes, etc.) are the root of all evil in the modern 'first world' diet. This device is a great tool that allows you to enjoy any traditional pasta dish with absolutely zero ramifications. If a carb isn't embedded in a fruit, vegetable, or whole grain - it probably ought not enter your mouth in anything but minuscule quantities.
