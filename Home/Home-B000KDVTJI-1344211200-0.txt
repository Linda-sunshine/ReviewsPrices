review/summary: Bad Tastereview/text: We needed a new hot water kettle and found the Aroma on sale. The style was perfect and performance was good, however it gave the water a terrible taste and smell, similar to boiled plastic. I followed the directions for cleaning prior to use, however after 5 full boiling cycles with fresh water each time and 2 cups of wasted coffee I gave up and returned it.
