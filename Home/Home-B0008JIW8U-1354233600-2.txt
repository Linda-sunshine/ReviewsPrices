review/summary: So Far So Good, Tips for Best Performencereview/text: Alright I have had this for a week now and have noticed a few things. First off this is a great machine, basic no thrills. Brew coffee button, set delay brew,time,off, this is all I really need in a coffee machine.As far as operation goes:Very fast. When you start brewing you will have your full 4-cups in about 5 min tops. I read about plastic smelling coffee, so before I ran my first batch through I cycled white vinegar then water twice just in-case. I have noticed no weird taste or smell and usually do this anyway with any parts on machines that come in contact with food.For people unsatisfied about coffee temperature I have noticed no such issue. But if you want really super hot coffee, you can leave the lid up and there is a drain spout that cycles the water so the reservoir in the back will heat up. You can close the lid when its to your liking.I ordered a 4-cup permanent filter(same brand) and it fits perfectly. The coffee receives the right amount of brew time with no burnt/watery taste. Make sure if you get a permanent filter it has a solid bottom so the water doesn't drip right throughI cannot comment on longevity yet so I will update as time goes on. Overall very pleased!
