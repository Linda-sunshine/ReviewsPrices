review/summary: Maybe it will work, maybe it won't.review/text: There is only one place in the entire house where the alarm on this will function and that's only if it's pointing in the right direction and sitting at the perfect angle. When I clean the counter where it rests, it's a struggle to return it to that perfect alignment and I often think I've gotten it right only to find it blinking away to &#34;check reception&#34; an hour later. Ridiculous! The radio comes in crystal clear so I'm not sure why this thing can't receive the emergency broadcasts. Being so unreliable renders the product useless as a weather alert.
