review/summary: This was a great purchase!review/text: After going through a number of cheap can openers in a relatively short amount of time (thanks, roommates!), I decided to buy a more expensive one that would hopefully last. This one is great! Very durable and no problems whatsoever during the 6 months I've had it, with frequent use. I've never bought an expensive utensil before but I'm very glad that I did.
