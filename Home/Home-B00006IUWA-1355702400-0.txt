review/summary: Nostalgicreview/text: I had a presto popper several years ago and had fond memories of it. I now have diabetes and wanted this popper because there's no need for oil. You can melt butter in the measuring cup, But I choose to spritz with olive oil and use a little popcorn seasoning. This exceeded my expectations. Airy and light with no unpopped kernels. I would buy again in an instant. Thumbs up. John
