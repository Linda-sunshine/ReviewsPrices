review/summary: Misto Oil Sprayerreview/text: It took me a while to find an oil sprayer that got decent reviews and would work with most cooking oils and this one seemed to be the one. So far, I have only used it for olive oil and it works as described. Compared to an aerosol store-bought product it does not produce as fine or even a mist but considering I have full control of the oils I want to use that have not other additives I am quite satisfied so far. Had been using commercial brands of canola oil but I wanted to get away from them since canola is a GMO crop and the fact that they always seemed to contain lecithin. Lecithin is fine except for the fact that it can tend to build up or "shellac" some of my non-stick skillets over a period of time. Pure oil is just better overall and I know the quality of the oil used.
