review/summary: Fantastic concept, but quality makes the griddle fall shortreview/text: I bought this griddle in September 2011. It worked well enough for me until it broke.Pros:*The tilting option is great because it allows you to easily drain for greasy items, and then being able to level it out for items like pancakes where you need a level surface.*The extra room means less batches and less cook-time.Cons:*Uneven cooking surface means you have to watch things closely and move stuff around*Extra large size makes cleaning a pain*the same mechanism that allows the griddle to tilt is cheap plastic and it broke after 8 months of moderate use. I was able to superglue it back together however.
