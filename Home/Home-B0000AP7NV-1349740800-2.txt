review/summary: The perfect pitcherreview/text: This pitcher was exactly what I was looking for. It's small enough to fit in the door of my refrigerator. It's also easy to refill and I like that they provide a static cling, low tech way to remind me to change the filter. I had previously owned the Brita tank with the spigot but it was too big and took up too much space in my refrigerator. This pitcher is small enough that I can keep it out on my counter without looking like it's clutter.
