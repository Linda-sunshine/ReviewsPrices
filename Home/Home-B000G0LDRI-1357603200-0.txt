review/summary: Ahhh, humidity!!review/text: Living in an area with typically low humidity and experiencing a cold winter with the furnace running frequently to further dry the air out, the increased humidity provided by this humidifier is a welcome relief. Sinuses feel better, much less static electricity, and an all around more enjoyable environment. My only complaint, and it's really a minor one, is the bubbling noise you hear occasionally as water drains from one of the twin reservoirs into the base of the system. Kind of like the sound you hear when dispensing water from a 5-gallon bottle on a cooler. Other than that it has been a wonderful addition to our home and the combined capacity of 4-5 gallons between the twin reservoirs means you only have to refill the humidifier twice a day. I would recommend this product to anyone needing the raise the humidity in their home.
