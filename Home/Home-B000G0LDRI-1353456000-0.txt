review/summary: WOULD RECOMMEND!review/text: The Humidifier does what it is suppose to. It does need refilling about every 24 hours, but I expected that. Easy to refill and to switch around the filter. Makes a slight whine on the lowest fan setting, but it is not a deal breaker. Not too loud, since the cats like to sit next to it during the HIGH setting. Helps keep us non-dry in the winter and lets the heater work less to keep the house at a decent temp. Definitely would recommend to a friend.I place it at the foot of my stairs, so it can hit the main level and the upper level as well.
