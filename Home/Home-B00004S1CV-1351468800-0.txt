review/summary: Not Water Tight But A Great Bottlereview/text: I'm extremely happy with this Thermos. It keeps drinks cold or hot for hours, is easy to clean, and has a nice look to it.One thing to note: even with the two lids on the bottle, it's not entirely a water tight seal. I put protein powder and milk into the Thermos this morning and started shaking it to mix it. A little bit of liquid came out in between the top seal and the drink lid. Again, hardly a complaint against the bottle. But it's worth noting that while it gives the illusion of being sealed, it's not.
