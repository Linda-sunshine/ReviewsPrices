review/summary: LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!review/text: This is one awesome cleaner! I have what I'd like to think is a very clean house, but using this cleaner it most certainly was not as clean as I thought! It picked up so much dirt I couldn't believe it. My carpets now feel soft and fluffy, especially in high traffic areas. It also removed the one stain in my carpet! I have tried since we bought the house to get that stain out with numerous cleaning products- had no luck, but this machine removed it with a small amount of scrubbing! I would highly suggest buying this product. I found that most of the bad reviews were due to not putting it together correctly (as I tried to do it without reading the instructions and it leaked- went back and did it the right way and it doesn't leak at all!)
