review/summary: Great juicerreview/text: My husband and I purchased this because we wanted to start making our own juice and it has been great. It is fast and efficient. My only complaint is that it is a little difficult to clean the 'grater/strainer' piece. They send a scrubbing brush with it but it gets caught in the little holes and makes for an awkward cleaning. I usually give up and place it in the dishwasher. Other than that it is a good product with a good price.
