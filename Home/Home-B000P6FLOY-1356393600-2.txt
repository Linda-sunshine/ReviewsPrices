review/summary: Terrible, defective out of the package.review/text: Opened up the package this morning to cook my turkey. The LCD read "Lo" when I turned it on after inserting the probe into my turkey. I just though maybe it didn't register a temperature until it hit a certain temperature. After an hour or so of cooking, I got on Amazon to read reviews and it turns out the "Lo" means my probe is bad. I saw a couple of people say the battery could be low, I replaced the battery with a brand new one, still "Lo" on the LCD screen. So I have this turkey in my oven and no way to know when it's done. I bought a natural turkey without one of those inaccurate pop-up thermometers stuck in them. No way I'm spending $10 for another probe that might not even work when I get it. I would rather spend $20 or more on a better brand and model.
