review/summary: DO YOU REALLY NEED IT?review/text: I think is a good buy if you are on a raw diet or want to eat a lot of vegetables. If you don't want to eat pasta, try the yam noodles, they are low carb, if you are worrying about eating to much carbs, which is not my case. I dont think I will buy it again if mine breaks, also when you do the carrots it stains the white plastic, even if you wash it right a way!
