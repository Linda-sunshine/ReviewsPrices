review/summary: Works great, seems to be lacking accessories though.review/text: I've never had another processor to compare this one to but I think its perfect! actually amazing! Powerful, quick, easy to use and clean and pretty quite for what it does.My only complaint is that it doesn't have a 1mm slicing disc, when I did my research I could have sworn I saw one but I guess I was confused, easy to have happen I guess when you're researching every single processor out there! I'm really into raw food and was looking forward to making sweet potato chips in my dehydrator but with out the 1mm disc that's pretty much impossible. I may return the unit but I have yet to decide.
