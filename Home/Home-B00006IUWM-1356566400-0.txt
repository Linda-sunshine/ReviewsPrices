review/summary: Never taken the time to write a review but use them.review/text: Not that I am a chef but I do love to cook. I had always hand sharped with a hard stone. I just used this on my three year old knives and just wow. Sharper than out of the box. quick efficient great value. Dont think you could possibly be dissapointed. Only reason not 5 stars or more, you will have a small amount of metal dust filings on your counter. Just wipe up afterwards. Its not like your using this everyday. Next dinner party I have, having all my friends bring their sets over.
