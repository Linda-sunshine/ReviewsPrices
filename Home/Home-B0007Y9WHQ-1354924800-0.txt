review/summary: Expectations?review/text: My review will come in two parts, THE PRODUCT and THE SELLERTHE PRODUCTSilly me, I actually EXPECTED to be able to use this product! This product, sold by AMAZON by the way, came missing the handle. THE HANDLE!! The one thing, other than the blades of course, that is necessary to make this product work!THE SELLERShame on you AMAZON, LLC. Not only did it take almost the maximum amount of days to arrive (one day shy of full term), it arrived incomplete. The only good thing was that the refund came quickly, Seriously AMAZON, step your QA department game up.
