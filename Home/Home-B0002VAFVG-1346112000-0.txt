review/summary: Powerful, easy to use and care for workhorse of a juicer!review/text: My sister, also a proud owner of same Breville model, highly recommended this juicer to me. She had chosen this model after doing a ton of research and has been really pleased with her choice. After having it for a couple of weeks now and having made a ton of different kinds of juices, I have found it to be a really solid, well-built unit that's easy to use and care for. I've always wanted a juicer but was concerned it would be more work than fun. I'm delighted and having loads of fun!
