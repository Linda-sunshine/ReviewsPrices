review/summary: It needs more than 5 starsreview/text: I received this from Amazon today after ordering it a couple of days ago. I just vacuumed my stairs and I am disgusted about how much dirt the vacuum sucked up! It did an amazing job, I think I had enough let hair for a couple of extra pets. I had more than enough cord to easily do the whole stairs and there isn't an outlet that is near the stairs. The flip top that easily vacuums the backs of the stairs is ingenious. I love the fact that the cord is designed to wrap around the base and that the crevice tool stores in the base of the vacuum.The only improvement I can come up with, other than a self-vacuum switch, is a light in the front. It would make it easier to vacuum the stairs to the basement.Excellent product!
