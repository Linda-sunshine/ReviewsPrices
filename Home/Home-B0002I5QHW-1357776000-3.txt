review/summary: Work's great, lightweight and easy to clean.review/text: I ordered this for my wife to make ham salad. It arrived in two days and it is exactly what we needed. We had purchased one at our local rural king and it was too heavy and made out of cast iron. This one has suction cup and you can sit it on table or counter and turn the dial to lock and you can't move it. My wife fixed the salad and had her sister's down for lunch and everyone loved it. I'm ordering more for her sister's.
