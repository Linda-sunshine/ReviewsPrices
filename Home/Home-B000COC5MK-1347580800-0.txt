review/summary: handy gadget to havereview/text: I ordered this after using my sister-in-law's. I like it a lot. Small, rechargeable, gets the job done. Comes with a foil cutter. Just cut the foil, put the opener on top and hold the button - voila! It's open. Press reverse to spit the cork out in your hand.I've used it on quite a few bottles - both cork and plastic corks - never had a problem.
