review/summary: Good productreview/text: I live in the desert and we get a ton of sand storms and I have 2 dogs. I have cleaned some high traffic areas and so for it is doing a fantastic job. The only issue i have, is the attachments and pretty much everything else seems to be a thin plastic. i am a little scared about breaking them. But over all I am happy with it.
