review/summary: very dangerous to usereview/text: I've had my v-slicer for 30 years now and have almost sliced off a finger more than once. Dont even think about using this without the holder. To many unprotected razor sharp blades. Very dangerous piece of equipment! Other than that I found it very limited in the variety of cuts. I would like to make waffle fries but cannot with this. Also the slice blade is either too thin or too thick. The other blade hasnt been much use to me either. It has been sitting in the garage and not sure how to dispose of this. Im an experience home cook and make most everything from scratch. I've been looking for a different mandoline for some time and have not pulled the trigger as of yet.
