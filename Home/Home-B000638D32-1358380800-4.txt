review/summary: Surprisingly excellentreview/text: Very very sharp and the no-slip handle is a definite plus. We own several very expensive European knives, but this Victorinox is a hidden secret...It exceeds the utility of our other knives made by famous &#34;Classic&#34; manufacturers....and it is a fraction of the cost of those other knives.
