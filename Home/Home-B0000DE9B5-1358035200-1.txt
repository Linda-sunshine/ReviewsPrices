review/summary: Perfect for juicereview/text: This pitcher is perfect for our apple juice (which we buy in a huge gallon glass jug that doesn't fit in the refrigerator very well). After reading the mixed reviews about the lid and difficulty achieving a seal when I got the jug the first thing I did was attempt to take the lid off and put it back on. Other reviewers were right, the trick is simply to push the lid down with one hand while turning with the other. I have no issues achieving a seal though my husband (who has bigger hands) says it sometimes take him several tries. I would recommend this and will probably buy more for other products.
