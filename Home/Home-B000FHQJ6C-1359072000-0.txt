review/summary: Hamilton Beach 67650A Juicerreview/text: This is my second juicer, as my husband put my Kuvings Juicer away and for some reason can't now find it. I just received the Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Pro Juice Extractor and am in love. I juiced cabbage, carrots, cucumber, parsley, ginger,radishes and a red bell pepper- delicious. I lined to pulp catcher with a plastic bag- so no mess to clean up there and while the container is a tad small that catches the juice, I just poured it into a glass and completed juicing. This juicer is actually heavier than the Kuvings, and has metal latches which the other one doesn't. Feels sturdier. The pulp isn't dust dry, but not truly wet. I'm making vegetable soup tomorrow, so will add the pulp to that- no waste.I recommend this one, it worked great.
