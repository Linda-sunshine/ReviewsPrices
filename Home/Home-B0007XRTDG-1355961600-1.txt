review/summary: Don't Waste Your Moneyreview/text: Maybe their manufacturing process has changed or something, but this skillet started losing the non-stick after about 3 months of nothing but making bacon, eggs, and burgers/chops/steaks. No metal or anything else ever touched on the surface (bought the silicone spatula at the same time just for this) and yet it still started flaking. It seems to follow the burners under the surface. It's a shame, really; for about a month this was my favorite way to cook dinner, now just looking for somewhere to recycle this piece of garbage.
