review/summary: AC/DC Connector runs VERY hotreview/text: To be fair, the manufacturer does indicate that this should be used in a small, enclosed space. It is simply not effective in anything larger than, say, a closet. However, please be aware that the ac/dc connector runs very hot at the plug-in. VERY hot. Therefore, I would not be comfortable using this small electronic in a small, enclosed space where it can't be closely monitored. To be honest, it makes me too nervous to use where it would be most effective, so that's why the one-star. This, unfortunately, was a waste of money.
