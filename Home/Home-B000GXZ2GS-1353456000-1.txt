review/summary: Makes Great Coffeereview/text: The AeroPress is really simple to use.It is rather affordable, and makes great coffee.You will need is a method of having boiling filtered water on hand to pour into the Aeropress. I use an electric kettle, and use the hot water once it comes off the boil. (I've found that having hot water off the boil is key to having good coffee out of the Aeropress).It's good if you're a single cup coffee drinker, but it can be a little slow to make enough coffee if you're serving guests. It also travels well, in case you're in a country that doesn't have very many coffee shops, and you need your coffee fix.
