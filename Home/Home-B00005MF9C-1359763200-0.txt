review/summary: my 2nd one, and if needed, I'll buy anotherreview/text: The choices, in this price range, are limited for cup-at-a-time brewer so we're pleased that this one works just fine for us. If the coffee grinds are very fine you'll want to use a paper filter instead of the one provided. And yes, every few days it needs wiping down because grinds, of any consistency, do get all over. And the seating of the filter/basket is important to avoid complete grind/water spill over; but, it's so obvious how to place it correctly I had to laugh at the 1-2 star reviews complaining about this. You can't close the top if basket isn't set properly.After a about 2 yrs, our first one broke...don't remember how or why, just pulled up Amazon.com and with a sigh of relief, ordered the same one again at the same price!. Now THAT'S impressive. I removed 1 star because I thought it should have lasted longer than 2 years. Still not as aggravating as when our fancy multi-brew took a dive way too early and replacing that was well over 20 bux.
