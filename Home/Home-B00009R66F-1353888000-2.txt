review/summary: Better and cheaper than Bissell ProHeat for Pet ownersreview/text: My Bissell died 4 months after purchase- common issue, water stuck in hoses. It was not worth fixing it, so I just threw out $170 worth of merchandise.Hoover looks cheaper but does a better job cleaning the carpets, they actually smell and look clean afterwards. Bissell does a better job on the outside, but does not clean as deep as Hoover and rotates same water over and over again. Hoover stops working after it runs out of clean hot water. So, at the end of the day, I am more satisfied with Hoover.However, Hoover washing liquids suck, they are useless, I am using the Rug Doctor ones for better results and Clorox Spray for pet stains. Carpets look like new!
