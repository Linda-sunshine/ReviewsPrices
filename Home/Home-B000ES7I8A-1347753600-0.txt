review/summary: Unreliablereview/text: I own three of these. When they work, they're great. But the switch below the handle (used to turn the kettle on) and the mechanism in the base (which makes the electrical connection to the kettle) regularly malfunction on all three kettles. Very irritating. Find something that's more reliable.
