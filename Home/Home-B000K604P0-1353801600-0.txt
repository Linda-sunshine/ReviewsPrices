review/summary: Beware! This works better than advertised!review/text: I have the smaller, 12 oz version which comes with an infuser. I bought this simply for the convenience of the single-handed operation.First, this thermos is amazing at keeping things hot, perhaps a bit too good in fact. It is easy to scald your lips/tongue if you are not careful, especially if you drink from this in a moving car that is going along a bumpy road. Even with the lid open (in drinking position), the contents are scalding hot for over an hour. If closed, I have been able to enjoy a hot drink all day long (almost eight hours). I tend to leave this in the car and drink from it while driving around during the day. If you flip the lid closed in between, it will really last all day. Be careful though, it works too well.Only negative is that this one is bigger than the 12 oz model so it is harder to carry it in your jacket. The smaller unit fits easily in the pocket. I also like the infuser that comes with it.I also noted some people have had issues with leakage. It happens to me with both units as well, but what I found is that apart from not filling the bottle above the mark, you also need to put the screw-top lid on it with the flip-top open. Somehow if you tighten the lid with it completely closed, it creates a slight leak, especially if the liquid is piping hot and steaming. Don't know why it should but it does. The same thing happens with the smaller thermos, you need to screw-on the two parts of the lid separately.Otherwise this is the best travel-mugs/thermoses out there.
