review/summary: Great pitcher that does what it should do!review/text: I got this Brita water pitcher a little over a year ago to bring to college with me so I would not have to continually buy water bottles and waste more money. It has been great. While you do have to wait for the water to filter through to the bottom before pouring more in, it's not a problem, I tend to do it while brushing my teeth or something, fill the top part, brush my teeth, then fill the top part again and I'm done! I have not had any problems with the part that covers the spout, it works well. Also, as for the top piece, I have not had any problems with it, and it seals well. Water can leak out onto the top of the handle if it is filled too much, but this is not the fault of the Brita, it is my fault for putting too much water in at a time which is completely fixable. It is definitely worth buying!
