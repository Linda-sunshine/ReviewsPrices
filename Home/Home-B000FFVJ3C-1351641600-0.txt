review/summary: The Nesco FD 75A 700 Watt Food Dehydrator is the BEST!!!review/text: After having some cheap food dehydrators in the past, I decided to try this one when my last dehydrator lasted just 2 weeks. You pay a little more, but well worth the money. This dehydraytor dries food in very little time. So far, we have used it to dry bananas, tomatoes, figs, apples, squash, eggplant and peppers. We have added 2 more trays. Next we will try jerky!
