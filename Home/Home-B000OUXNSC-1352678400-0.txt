review/summary: Buyer Beware - great product - questionable pricing practicesreview/text: I purchased two extra long twin a week or so ago. I was so happy with the quality that I ordered a Cal King and two Queens yesterday. I had wanted another four Queen as we have many sofa sleepers to accommodate weekend guests. I was limited to two, as they only had 18 left. Go figure. Guess I thought a sale was a sale. It's not as though I was purchasing the entire lot. Goodness, I would have brought them down to 14! Anyway, I went to order the last four today. To my surprise, the price had more than doubled on the Queen and King size. Seems any item they are low on they double(+) the price. I take great issue with this. While I believe money is made by "supply and demand" I really didn't expect this out of Amazon. Seems dishonest - not illegal - but a questionable practice none the less. Certainly not customer friendly in these hard times. They already had them in stock. It's not as though it was a new shipment they paid more for. I am very disappointed in Amazon and will question their pricing practices in the future. JUST TO REMIND YOU, THE QUEEN AND KING SIZES WERE MORE THAN HALF THIS PRICE YESTERDAY!! I would not have purchased them at the current "limited quantities" price. Just wait until they get more in. The price will probably be reduced yet again.
