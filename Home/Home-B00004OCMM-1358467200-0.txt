review/summary: Worth the extra cashreview/text: I always brought the cheap 5 to 7 dollar opener. They would break after awhile and after my last one broke I decided to purchase a high quality one. In general I don't have a problem spending a few more bucks if I'm getting a good, solid, high quality tool. I took a deep breath and spent more than double the highest price I have ever paid for an opener. I can say I'm very happy I purchased this one as it has not failed me at all, not even in the slightest way. Clicks onto the can nicely, hds it perfect and I never struggle with turning the gear. I highly recommend this opener. It has become a very useful and dependable kitchen tool. Thank you to all the other reviewers as that's why i took such a leap of faith. I purchased this in december of 2012
