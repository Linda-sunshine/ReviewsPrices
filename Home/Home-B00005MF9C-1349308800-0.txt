review/summary: Convenientreview/text: I am not a heavy coffee drinker. I just need one cup in the morning to wake me up on the go. This coffee maker does not have fancy features. Just fulfill my basic coffee need and it serves the function well. Auto-shutoff after finishing brewing is one feature I like. What I don't like is the cup is quite hot to hold. The manufacturer should insulate it better than that.
