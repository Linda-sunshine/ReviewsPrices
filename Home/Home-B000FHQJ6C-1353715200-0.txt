review/summary: Used this daily for 3 months before it died...review/text: I was new to juicing when I bought this so I was okay with getting a juicer that wasn't the greatest but had decent reviews.. Well, I should have just spent the extra money because it didn't last long. One of the silver clip things that hold the parts together fell off after a month, I continued to use it, I just had to reconnect the piece daily. One day I used it and the metal blade piece started flying off even though I attached it well before turning it on. It started grinding the plastic lid so I had to throw my juice out because it had plastic in it. It is a VERY loud juicer. This really isn't a big deal to me, but when I wake up early and have guests in town I have to wait to juice until they are awake because it sounds like a jet engine. It is a pain to clean too. I never felt like i could get it completely clean. The reason why the juicer gets one star is because after three months of juicing, one day it started making a funny noise and started to smell after I turned it on and the plastic that connects the blade piece to the base was shredding. :( I used this juicer a lot but feel it should have lasted longer. Because I juice everyday, I have invested in an Omega J8006 masticating juicer (masticating juicers are supposed to be better than centrifugal juicers for many reasons). 15 yr warranty and better for juicing greens.. If you are going to use a juicer daily, invest in a good one. If you only use it once in awhile this one may be okay.
