review/summary: Good Fitreview/text: I bought this when we purchased a new mattress. Our mattress is a pillowtop and it fits well and is comfortable. The top padding wraps around the mattress edges slightly and offers decent protection. It has held up to being washed and dried well. The item description does not say it is waterproof but when I've had spills I removed the pad quickly afterward and they have not gone through the pad. I don't know how well it would protect against a heavy spill that stayed on the bed for a while before the pad was removed.
