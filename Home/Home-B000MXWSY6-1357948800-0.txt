review/summary: Good productreview/text: Nice size, easily read and very functional. Always nice to have battery back-up with power outages. For me, the only disadvantage is the small button to turn the alarm off. It's a turn button rather than a push button. Hard to get hold of, especially just waking from a deep sleep.
