review/summary: Victory!!review/text: Shelling hardboiled eggs became a Herculean battle I almost always lost, starting years ago. I watched videos of sure-fire methods that would work once, then defeat me. My husband loves hardboiled eggs for breakfast so I surrendered and ordered this. For three days this little alien spere called to me and I dared to try it after my husband left the house this morning! Four large eggs, past their expiration date, were offered to the microwave and timed for six minutes, allowing for the 1200W appliance. After six minutes, I removed one, sliced it in half, and the yolk was still runny. The remaining three eggs went back in for two minutes, allowed to rest for two minutes, placed under cold water, and one was sliced...yay! I won this time and removing the shells went smoothly:-) I will have a happy husband.
