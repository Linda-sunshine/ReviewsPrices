review/summary: This little device may save your coffee-makerreview/text: Life's little lessons say "just buy the d*#% thing!" I was "debating" whether I wanted to spend the money -- ALL $5 of it -- on a permanent coffee filter for my Mr. Coffee. I have plenty of the paper ones for my 12-cup maker. Why get yet another accessory to clean, or lose? I ruined my previous Mr. Coffee when the water drip thing inside caused my filter to fold over the coffee grounds and spill/splatter ground coffee in every nook and cranny of the device. It was ruined! Coffee everywhere and a PAIN to try to clean.This permanent one eliminates that problem altogether. It's simple, easy to use, and easy to clean. No spilled grounds, clean Mr. Coffee, happy customer.
