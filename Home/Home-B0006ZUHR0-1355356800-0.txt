review/summary: The best iron everreview/text: I go through irons like crazy taking them back to Costco just about every time. This iron is literally the best I have ever had. It heats up fast, it is heavy so I do not have to press down hard, the steam is perfect every time and the best part is that for some reason it seems to use very little water so I can iron 10 shirts with one fill of the iron!! Buy it you will love it!!
