review/summary: Works well, much easier than typical corkscrewreview/text: This product is to replace an electric wine bottle opener given to me as a gift last year, which broke. I loved that electric opener. This one works very well, but it is not as quite as easy to use as my previous one. You can not see when the corkscrew is all the way in and starts to pull out the cork - my old one you could. Also, it does not enter the cork as nearly as easily as my old one. But for the price, it works well and has a very sleek look. All in all, I like it.
