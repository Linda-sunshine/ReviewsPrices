review/summary: Not really sure what to doreview/text: I have a dog that is allergic to just about everything - so I have to make him treats. Needless, to say the Nesco FD-75PR get a good workout. Unfortunately, I have gone through 2 of these machine in about 4 years. The second one just went this past weekend. I need to purchase another one - but I don't know if it's better to get a more expensive model (hoping it will last longer) or just to expect this because I use it so much...?? I use it every week without fail and sometimes twice a week - is that considered excessive? Not sure - does anyone have any suggestions? Overall I have been pleased with the dehydrating "end product" - just not how long it lasts!
