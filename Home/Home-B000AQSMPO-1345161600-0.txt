review/summary: Dont waste your moneyreview/text: Keurig model B-60. I am very disappointed with this machine. I spent $150 for it, have owned it for 2 1/2 years with light use, about 4-5 cups per day and not used every day either. It started leaking after 1 year. I managed to control that for the next 1 1/2 year along with some minor issues like occasional erratic behaviors, small cups erratic menu readings etc.... It just stopped working yesterday, no lights or anything. I will not spend another dime on one of these machines and neither will any of my friends. At least 4 of my coworkers have similar issues. I am going to spread the word that these things are JUNK! For the amount of money we have spent on these and the expensive k-cups they should last for years! I am a very dissatisfied customer!
