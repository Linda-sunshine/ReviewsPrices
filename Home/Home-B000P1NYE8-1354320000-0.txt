review/summary: Great product for small measurements!review/text: I use this scale for measuring hops for homebrewing. It has several measurement modes and has a zero reset button so you can zero out the container. The display is backlit so this scale can be used in low light situations. Mine has the tendancy to have an incomplete display on the final number, but as this is 1/100 of an oz. it is not a big problem for me.
