review/summary: I love my mixerreview/text: Granted, I have had a few problems with getting the correct mixer that is working. The first one they shipped stalled at speed 2. Since most kneeding is done at speed 2, that was a problem. Kitchenaid sent me a new mixer in turnaround mail. In the mean time, I used the old one, so was not inconcienved. The second mixer was a thing to behold. For some wonderful reason, the company had upgraded me to the artisan series. Now that was love at first sight. The bowl has a wonderful handle and the whole machine just seems to be a little bit stronger. I jumped in and make homemade noodles, ravioli and batches of cookies. This machine just ate each task up. I did have one problem, the lock lever just kept slipping so instead of being able to walk away when the machine was kneeding, I had to stand there and relock the head approximately every minute. If I did not keep adjusting the lock, the head would leap up out of the bowl. Annoying, but not a major deal. Today, I called kitchenaid to see if there was a way to adjust the problem and they said "to make sure you have no further problems, a new mixer is on the way." The people at customer service are well above average. So, this weekend we will make more scratch pizza (my sons want it on the weekly rotation - what fun to top theri own pizza), and a big batch of ravioli. Since the cookie jar is empty, some yummy cookies are also probable. I home that you have as much fun with your mixer as I am having with mine.
