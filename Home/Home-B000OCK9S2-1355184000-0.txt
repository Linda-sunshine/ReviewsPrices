review/summary: not the best.review/text: I have used &#34;white noise&#34; machines for many years. This one has a few repeating noises that take away from the white noise effect and make it difficult to fall asleep sometimes. It's okay, but not the best I've used. Also, the radio has terrible reception, and the alarm is difficult to navigate but easy to &#34;accidentally&#34; set.
