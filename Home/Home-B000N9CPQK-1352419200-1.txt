review/summary: Good, compact air purifierreview/text: I bought this product in the hopes that it would help with my bedroom's dust and pet dander problem. It has helped. The low setting provides adequate air flow while still being acceptably low on noise. The high and medium settings get noisy, but what I do is run it on Low while I am at home and on High when I go to work or out. It has really helped clean the dust and pet dander out and I (and my sinuses) feel much much better. I've had the product for a few months and the indicator light for me to change the filter hasn't come on yet.Another plus is the design of the device. It was really great that Honeywell designed the air intake to be in the front, and the clean exhaust to shoot up/forward out of the rear of the device. You'll enjoy the design as it pulls in the dirty air from the middle of the room rather than from the wall that you have it up against.
