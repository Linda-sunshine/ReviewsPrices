review/summary: Love this steam cleanerreview/text: I had an old model of the Hoover steam cleaner. It worked well for me over the past 15 years so I decided to try the updated version of it when the old Hoover developed a problem. The pickup tank, which was made of plastic and looked a lot like the updated tank, fatigued and broke so it would not lock down. The new Hoover works like a dream.I read the reviews and particularly the * reviews. I took note of the complaints that the new Hoover leaked water and someone said it was because you had to follow the assembly instructions so that you heard a LOUD snap. I never heard the loud snap and was concerned it would leak. I called the Hoover tech line and learned that they had corrected that problem. My steam cleaner does NOT leak and it works like a dream!
