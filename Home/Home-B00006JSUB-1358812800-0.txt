review/summary: Love it!!!review/text: This is a product I have longed to buy myself for years! But it's also been one of those things that I always looked at but never got around to buying it. I decided to take advantage of a gift card I received from someone at my job and FINALLY purchase this skillet. It was the absolutely best decision I could have made. The minute I received it, I cleaned it and started using it. Used it twice that day. First I fried some pork chops on it and later that day we made a pineapple cake. This skillet did just fine with both things. The cake came out spongy soft and lifted right off the skillet. I am sure we will make good use out of this purchase for a long, long time.
