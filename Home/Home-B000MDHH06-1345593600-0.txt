review/summary: Nice Juicer but...review/text: Family of 3, so this juicers size was perfect. Got it up and running in no time, and its easy to clean. We made several glasses of great fresh juice. However, just after four uses, I noticed the side was leaking. I took it a part and noticed that the top piece at the bottom of the shoot had cracked. Need to get another part.Update they replaced the part quickly. Be sure to keep your records if needed. Has not broken again.
