review/summary: Juicer Food Chute Broken But Amazon Replaced Quicklyreview/text: Initial item had broken food chute but Amazon replaced it quickly. We've used the juicer a few times now and it does a great job. We are new to juicing so we're still learning what taste good and how much to make. The product itself seems easy to clean, the filter takes a little extra time to clean. The motor is a little noisy as you amp up the speed for harder vegetables/fruits but it definitely does the job. It's also easy to use, just takes a little time at first for orientation of everything.
