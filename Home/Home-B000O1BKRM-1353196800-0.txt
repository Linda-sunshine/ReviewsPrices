review/summary: I really like these!review/text: I bought these trays because I can't stand the regular plastic ones- the cubes freeze together, don't come out, and when they do they pop out all over the place!These are awesome! None of that junk like with plastic trays. I also love that they're one ounce servings.I use these to freeze carrot juice I've juiced, because I buy the huge bag of carrots and put the juice in my smoothies. I just juice some, freeze the juice, and store the cubes in a ziplock in my freezer (I use them fairly quickly, but hate taking up fridge space with 20lbs of carrots.I have found it's easiest to push the cubes out from the center, as other reviewers stated. It does take a little longer for stuff to freeze, but it's just because it's silicone and not plastic. I also ran them through the dishwasher twice before I used them and they don't have any smell or leave any taste on the stuff I put in them. I like them so much I asked for more for Christmas. :)
