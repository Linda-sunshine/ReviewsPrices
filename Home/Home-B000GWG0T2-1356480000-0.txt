review/summary: High Quality Low Priced Non Stick Frying Panreview/text: Searing: There is a red circle in the middle of this pan on the cooking surface. It has a pattern in it. When heating the pan, the pattern turns to a solid red when the pan is hot enough to sear. It works really well. The pan worked perfectly and most importantly IT DID NOT WARP. The bottom is thicker than most other pans in this price range. The thicker metal holds heat better and provides a nice sear when cooking meats.Non-Stick Surface: Excellent even with metal utensils. I did oil the pan after washing like a cast iron pan. The instructions say to do so. I also oiled the pan after using for the first couple of uses. Not sure if this helped but the non stick surface is perfect.Baking: The handle is rated to 450 so popping it in the oven is not a problem.I've purchased a lot of &#34;cheaper&#34; pans in this price range and all of them warped on the bottom, then wobbled on the cook top there after, and I threw them out. And forget putting them in the oven. This has a surprisingly heavy construction, durable cooking surface, and oven rated/comfortable handle. The only con is there is no lid but I have a couple that fit. Great pan for the price.
