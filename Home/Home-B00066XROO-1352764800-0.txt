review/summary: Presto Did Itreview/text: This grindle is easy to clean! As a teacher, I used the grindle to make pumpkin pancakes for the Halloween party. It evenly heated the quantity of pancakes used to feed over 25 students and their parents. It is large enough to also handle the large amount of people to be served so everyone eats at the same time. I would buy this product again. Love it.
