review/summary: Great price, lots of steam!review/text: I have no complaints over this iron. It makes lots of steam for steaming delicate garments, it's heavy enough that you don't have to press down to get wrinkles out, and it's pretty quiet. It also turns off if you forget about it, and beeps when it's ready.
