review/summary: Good little machinereview/text: This is basically the coffee maker you see in hotel rooms. It actually probably is that coffee maker. One point that wasn't clear to me when ordering it, I don't know how much a "cup" is but this is a two-mug coffee machine. Which is fine, since that's the amount of coffee I like to drink in the morning, but be aware you can't make enough coffee for a family, or even a couple, with this machine.I like the "delay" function, which is what they call the function that lets you schedule a brew for a specific time. One thing that threw me off was that the clock has an AM and a PM function, so make sure you're setting the timed brew and clock both correctly; I missed a morning because I had unknowingly set the clock off 12 hours!
