review/summary: Breaks down rather quicklyreview/text: I have always paid a premium for Kitchen Aid products because of their high quality reputation versus opting out for a cheaper appliance. The very first time I used the mixer it started to leak oil right above where the attachements spin. I called Kitchen Aid to inquire as to why this was happening. They said, this was normal, I thought to myself, oil leaking right above our food is probably a bad thng. Anyway, the next time I used it, it stopped mixing after a few minutes of use. Again, I called and they said its a safety feature when the machine gets too hot. I felt this was rather annoying since in mid use you have to pull out your dough and nead by hand. Anyway, It sat for a few months and when I came to use it again, it was dead. You could hear the motor grinding but the attachements failed to spin. It was dead after using no more than 10 times. I called service and was very annoyed by thier questioning. They were asking, what kind of speed I used it on, what I used it for, how many consecutive minutes it was on. Finally, if I had read the user instructions. Anyway, it's now a 50 pound pile of junk that will probably get tossed out. The warranty is only for 1 year, although it was only used a few times for some light mixing... I would advice anyone who wants this unit to buy a warranty and use it often before the warranty expires. For this kind of money, you should get more than 10 uses out of a professional machine!
