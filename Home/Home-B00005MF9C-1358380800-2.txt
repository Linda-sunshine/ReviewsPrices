review/summary: For a cup of coffeereview/text: Ok, $15 -vs- $99 + for a one cup coffee maker. Only difference, no K cups and you dump the grounds out of the included filter. No mystery here. The mug that came with is cheesy but than any cup or mug that will clear the height will work. So if your lazy, pampered, and got extra cash, get a Keurig. In the blind-fold taster test, no one will know the difference : )
