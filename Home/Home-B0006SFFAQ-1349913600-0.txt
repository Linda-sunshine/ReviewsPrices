review/summary: Does what it saysreview/text: I've used Cuisinart appliances before. This is basic coffee maker with a timer and shut off. It uses a triangle kind of mesh cone. I like the kind with a flatter bottom so it can stand. It makes good coffee fairly quickly and hot. I am not into those little pre measured single cup deals that seem so popular. I like to make a pot and have it hot for a couple of hours.It's a hundred bucks and in my opinion that is about twenty too high
