review/summary: The little engine that couldreview/text: This little food chopper is awesome. For a single person, living alone, this food chopper is perfect. The engine is quite durable. I was able to mince small amounts of meat without any issues. I would recommend you cut the meat into small pieces first. I'm looking forward to making other dishes. The price is great and it's easy to clean. I would recommend this product.
