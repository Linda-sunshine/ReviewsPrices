review/summary: Someone built a better mousetrap, I mean ice cube trayreview/text: Ever since I was a child and was tormented by those old aluminum ice cube trays with the lever running down the middle, I have had a deep-seated hatred of ice cube trays. Even some of the more modern versions were disappointing because their longevity was so short. These trays are both versatile and easy to use. Versatile because my wife has found that she can freeze anything in these trays and there is no possibility of sticking (she freezes various stocks, coconut milk, etc, that she uses in small portions). Easy to use because you can remove one cube without disturbing the rest of the tray.
