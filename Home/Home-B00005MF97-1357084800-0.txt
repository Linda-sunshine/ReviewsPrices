review/summary: Handy - an essential for me!review/text: I loved my last blender to death but that brand is no longer available. This one has a bigger cup so I now love it even more than the one it replaced. Can I please say the blades are ~super~duper~ sharp? This is something of value in this day and age where nothing is sharp and nothing gets hot anymore. It is a snap to clean compared to getting the blender out, and made the smoothest most beautifully textured chutney i have ever made. The cilantro looked like green velvet after a whirl in here. The only down side is that the way it seals at the top, you might get a few drips that scootch by, but it's not a big deal. A very nice product. It shipped very quickly as well. Happy with the whole thing. The size of the cup is a big plus over similar models. I use it to blend onions into a paste or tomatoes into a paste before sauteeing for &#34;curries&#34; and it's nice not to have to do multiple batches due to smaller cup size.
