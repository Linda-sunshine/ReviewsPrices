review/summary: Called customer service and they have done nothing to fix problem with leaksreview/text: I was just about to order this blender when I quickly read the reviews and noticed it has huge issues with the carafe leaking. I called customer service 1-800-541-6390 to see if they had done anything to fix this problem. No, they had not and would not even admit that there were any leak issues!!! I guess no one over at Kitchenaid has the ability to read!!!!She said it had a one year warranty....I am not going to buy a small appliance for $140 that most likely will break from all the reading I have done.STAY AWAY FROM KITCHENAID-THEY SEEM TO NOT CARE WHEN THEIR PRODUCTS DO NOT HOLD UP!!!On a side note I own a Kitchenaid pro 600 mixer that I do love, but it quit running after a year. I had to spend over $100 to fix it. The repair man asked me what I was mixing when it died on me. Try mashed potatoes! I doubt my grandma's Kitchenaid mixer broke after only 1 year.
