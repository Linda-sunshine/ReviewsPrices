review/summary: Puts out the moisture, small tanks, rattles- annoying but functionalreview/text: This humidifier does the trick as far as putting out moisture and cleaning the air. The plastic is quite a bit thinner (cheaper) than my old honeywell humidifier. The 9 gallon output is true, but the tanks only hold about 4 gallons, so you have to fill it twice a day to get that much.Another thing I don't really care for, and it is not in the description is the auto-off when it runs out of water. If it runs out and you are not there to change it right away, it is likely to grow mold. The drying and circulating action would prevent that if it were left on. I don't like having to be ON it all the time.Also, it seems almost like the filter is alittle large for the unit and the cover doesnt fit tightly into the grooves like it does without a filter in it. There is some rattling occassionally, especially when the water levels get low. You have to go smack it alittle to make it stop, or completely refill the unit. It doesn't usually rattle when it is completely full.It's higher maintenance than I expected in these aspects. I thought that the 9 gallon output would be compensated by large tanks, and dealing with the rattling is an issue. I put it upstairs at the top of the steps so that the noise wouldn't bother us as much in the living room. It's annoying, but not enough to send it back because I'm lazy. I will put up with it.
