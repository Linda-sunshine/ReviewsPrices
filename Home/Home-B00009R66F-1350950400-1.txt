review/summary: Hoover carpet cleanerreview/text: I've had this product for several months now and have used it often. Overall I'm satisfied with it and think it's a great value for the price.Pros:-It's easy to clean, compared to many competitor products.-There are only two compartments to work with. Some cleaners have a separate container for the fluid, but I found that I like having one container for both the clean water and the detergent.-The hand attachment works better than on some competitors, but it is a little gimmicky to work with.Cons:-The cord is a little short which makes it more difficult when you "plan" your cleaning so that you don't walk on wet carpet. The cord is also attached in an awkward spot (at the bottom of the machine) which is annoying but not a huge deal-There are no settings to lower or raise the brushes from off the ground. Sometimes it seemed like the brushes didn't go down far enough into the carpet to give it a good deep cleaning.
