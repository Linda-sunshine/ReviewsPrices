review/summary: Great quality non-stick pan, comfortable handlereview/text: I really love this non-stick pan!We had been using our All-Clad saute pan for years, which I love. But this T-Fal is *awesome*.The non-stick is as good as I've seen. You can saute cheese, give it a little shake and it will just slide around. Cleanup is SO easy, just a quick rinse and wipe and it's as good as new.So far I can't think of anything to improve this pan. The shape is perfect, the handle is really comfortable, it doesn't have the flimsy feel like other budget-pans, but is not heavy. Highly recommended.
