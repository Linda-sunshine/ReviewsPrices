review/summary: Love Love Lovereview/text: I registered for this item on my Wedding Registry. I absolutely love it. I use it everyday to make tea / iced tea. It takes about 30 seconds or so once you turn it on to heat up the water. For best results, choose the smallest or medium size per K Cup or the flavor is somewhat watered down. Easy clean up, holds plenty of water without refilling after each cup. I even bought the reusable K Cups to fill with your own coffee or tea grounds. Definitely recommend.
