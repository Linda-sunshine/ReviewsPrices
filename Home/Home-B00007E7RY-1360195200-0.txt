review/summary: Works well, but its loud even on the lowest settingreview/text: I've owned HEPA air purifiers since they started making them. When my current one broke after 8 years of use, I read all the reviews and decided to buy this one. I was looking for one that had a long filter life (5 years) and it has that. It's bigger than my old HEPA filter and takes up more space. One nice feature is that it's lightweight, even though it is big. My biggest problem with this unit is that it's loud. On the lowest setting, you can hear it from the room next door. My other units are very quiet on the low setting and you can only hear them from the room they're in. Bottom line: It works fine, but it's big and loud.
