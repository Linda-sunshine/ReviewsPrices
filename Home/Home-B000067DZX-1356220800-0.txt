review/summary: Filter great -- price terrible!review/text: I bought this 4-pk with the pitcher. Love the pitcher and filter is typical good PUR filtration, which is why I bought it -- but a couple days after I ordered I found this same 4-pk for $15 at all the Wally Worlds around my area. So, check local prices for pitcher and filters first. Usually I get a great deal here on Amazon, but not this time :o( I see that some have reviewed this as a "good" price so either the price has bounced around a bit or their areas are more expensive. Just a word to the wise.
