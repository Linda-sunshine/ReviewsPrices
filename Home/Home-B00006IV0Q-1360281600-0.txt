review/summary: Best tasting coffee made at homereview/text: I think this beats any of the coffee makers under $100. It gets the coffee nice and hot too. Unfortunately you can't leave the coffee in it for too long as it will start tasting burnt. Unfortunately it also doesn't have an auto-off option.
