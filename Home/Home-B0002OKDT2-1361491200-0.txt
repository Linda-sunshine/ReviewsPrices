review/summary: If your on the fence BUY IT!!! Best invesment for your life and familyreview/text: Ive done extensive research on juciers trying to decide which one to buy. This one was the only one that could juice everything. Regualr breville and jack la lane juciers ( non-masticating) cannot jucie wheat grass or herbs or any grass form. This is amazing. I watched Dan the life regenerator o you tube and he uses this and saya nothing but good things about it! I jucied as soon as I got it and I will never use anything else. It WAY easier to clean , 4 little parts took 2 mins. love it my 5yr old loves it !
