review/summary: bought it for my husbandreview/text: my husband is a picky coffee drinker... and he didnt like the old pot we had so i bought this as well as a permanent filter.. and 3tbs + water = perfection he says.. he loves it! easy to set! that is a super bonus! My husband is the only coffee drinker in the house.. so on the weekdays he sets it before he goes to bed to auto turn on in the morning.. and on the weekends he makes a few cups through out the day... best tiny coffee pot ever.. makes just enough for him for work.. and enough to have a cup or two at home..
