review/summary: Kitchenaid Professional 600review/text: I bought the Professional 600 after having the smaller Kitchenaid stand mixer. Which is still going after close to 20 years. I wanted something alittle more heavy duty. I hate this mixer. The attachments seem to not reach the bottom of the bowl. So, I have to stir everything constantly. Never had this problem with the smaller one.
