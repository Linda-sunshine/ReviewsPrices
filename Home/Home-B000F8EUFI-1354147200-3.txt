review/summary: Far exceeded expectations!review/text: My husband and I have a small 2 bedroom cottage that is covered in almost every room in carpet. Being a broke couple starting out, we could barely afford to buy a new vacuum when our last one finally kicked the bucket - so we tried to shop around and find the best deal for the money, and we ended up with this little guy.... boy can it kick! This thing does the job and more! Then folds up nicely in the closet for easy storage - our older vacuum, was huge and wouldn't fit anywhere. It's really a kick butt machine - the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it doesn't have an adjustable setting depending on carpet - not that it matters for us, but it might matter to someone. Also, there isn't a pedal to release the body from the upright 90 degree position, which I looked for on the machine for about 5 minutes, turns out, you just give it a little pull and it releases to an easier angle to maneuver around the house. You have to empty it basically every time because the canister is smaller, but still, it's a great deal for the money and has great power! :)
