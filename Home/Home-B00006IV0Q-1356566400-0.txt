review/summary: Best Coffee Ever!review/text: My mother had a Presto coffee maker which we used till the cord fell apart. ( she died in 1999, don't know how many years she'd used it!) Couldn't find a replacement. Saw this coffe maker on Amazon and purchased it! Then found replacement cord too! Bought 3! Will hopefully have these coffee pots till we die! Yeah Love perked coffee!
