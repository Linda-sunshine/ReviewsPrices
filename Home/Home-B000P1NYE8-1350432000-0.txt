review/summary: defintely a keeperreview/text: loved it right off the bat. small, lightweight, an very easy to use. turn it on, zero it out, place the lid on top, zero it out once more, place a nickle on top, an if it weighs exactly 5.0 grams, its in perfect condition. uses 2 AAA batteries, which it comes with 2 anyway so no more tryin to find the right sized watch batteries.
