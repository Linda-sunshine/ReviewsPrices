review/summary: Too noisyreview/text: So to start I generally never have to write a bad review as I try to do my research prior to purchase. Unfortunately this humidifier has prompted me to be eager to write a bad review. It is way too noisy, the two plastic containers that you fill, and the removeable fan and housing all rest on a base. What I suspect is happening is that the fan is viberating and it is resonating throughout the base. Everything is plastic and there is no channel, or sound dampening around the fan and housing when it rests on the base. I am an engineer, so I naturally have attempted to improve it; I lined the base with thick tape where the containers and fan housing rest on the base and that helped some. The fan motor is mounted upside down in the housing and has 4 pillars that extend to the top of the housing, this acts like an amplifier for sound due to motor vibration. I put a heavy duty rubberband around the pillars to help with the noise but it is still annoying. If I fiddle with the two containers and the fan housing that rest on the base enough, I can get it to where it is quiet.... eventually though the annoying sounds come back - generally in the middle of the night. QuietCare labeled on the top of this humidifier as it is making extremely annoying sounds is a great example of scarcasm at best. By the way, my house is not quiet to begin with; an 8 yr old, 5 yr. old, and 9 mo. old... still the humidifier stands out.
