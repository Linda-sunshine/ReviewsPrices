review/summary: Great tasting pizza!review/text: We buy all of our ingredients at Trader Joe's and make our own pizza's with this cast iron pizza pan. The other nice advantage of using cast iron is that when you come back for seconds the pizza is still very warm because cast iron retains heat for such a long time.
