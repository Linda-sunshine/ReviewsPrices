review/summary: Water flow slows to trickle after 1 monthreview/text: The water flow on this filter starts to come to a trickle about 3-4 weeks after use. I live in NYC. I experienced a similar problem with Pur filters so there's probably something about NYC tap water that isn't accounted for in these filters. It's hard to blame Culligan for this if the problem also occurs on competitors' products.When it works, it seems to do the job.
