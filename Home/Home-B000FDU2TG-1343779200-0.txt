review/summary: Works great, but not exactly "quiet"review/text: We bought this a few months ago and have been very happy with it. Makes great smoothies and cleans up really easily. The blades are integrated with the pitcher, so it's easier to clean as long as you rinse it out fairly soon after you use it. Goes through the dishwasher without any problems. Blenders are loud, and this one is quieter than the Oyster we had before. This is a relative scale though, so don't think you can turn it on and expect the baby to sleep through. Overall we are very happy with this product and recommend it highly.
