review/summary: Nopereview/text: Ruined two batches of fudge because I tried to use this the normal thermometer in candy way... by fastening to the side of pan. It doesn't work!! Might be accurate when held in the syrup without the yellow holder but it is hard to read the digital display as it mists over!!! All in all I may return it and I certainly wouldn't purchase another!!
