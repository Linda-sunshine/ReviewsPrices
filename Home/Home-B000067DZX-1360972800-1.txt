review/summary: Bottled Water vs. Filter Waterreview/text: I have been using the PUR Pitcher daily for over a decade! I change the filters every 60 days. Buying PUR filters is much less expensive than buying bottled water. Interesting fact: The FDA regulates bottled water, but not tap water. The EPA regulates tap water, but not bottled water. The FDA's permissible standards for chemicals, toxins, metals, contaminants, etc. in bottled water is much lower than the EPA's permissible standards. I want my drinking water regulated by the EPA, thankyouverymuch.
