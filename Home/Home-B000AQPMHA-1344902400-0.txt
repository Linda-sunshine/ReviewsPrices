review/summary: My Keurigreview/text: This is one of the best things I ever bought myself. I said I could not afford it and that a regular coffee pot was good enough... then I used one at a friends house and just "fell in love". No more mess around the pot, or coffee dripped on the counter. Its clean, neat and makes ever so good coffee in a minute. No more waiting for the pot to brew. It has made getting up in the morning a real treat....well maybe not a real treat but a whole lot easier..
