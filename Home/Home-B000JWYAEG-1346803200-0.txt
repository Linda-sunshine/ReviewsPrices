review/summary: Do Not Buy These Sheetsreview/text: This is the last time I will EVER buy sheets that are not made in the USA. These are from India. After unboxing, leaving the package on the table for 2 days I unzipped the plastic, removed them from the casing (king size so there was a lot of fabric) and saw what looked like black grease spots on the top (dress) part of the top sheet and on one pillow case (they are WHITE sheets). My husband had already thrown the packaging material away so I tried to use a spot remover product before washing them. The grease (magic marker?) spots did not come out and they are so wrinkled after washing that I will have to iron them. It's been a while since I have bought sheets and thought these would be nice, 600 ct., nothing feels quality about them. Heavy, wrinkled. Really my first bad experience with Amazon products but I won't forget.
