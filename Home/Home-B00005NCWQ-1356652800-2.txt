review/summary: Glad I have it.review/text: Someday when the power is out I'll be really glad I have this, as I think it will work on my wood stove. It makes good coffee but note: if you're expecting company, get the pot going well in advance! It takes a long time, especially if you're anxious, and especially if you like your coffee strong. I got the Melitta filters for it, so I can still grind my coffee very fine. What I noticed about the flavor of the coffee was that is was extremely smooth--no bite like high-end coffee shops--and that has always been the mark of the best coffee. I also got the glass top, and would recommend it to the purists out there. A great buy.
