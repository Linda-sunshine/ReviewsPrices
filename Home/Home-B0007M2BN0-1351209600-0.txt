review/summary: fell apart within first weekreview/text: I love this egg cooker. And just bought my second one not long ago. The first one fell apart (the top came apart) but that was not too bad as I had used the heck out of it. I even gave them out as Xmas presents last year. So I happily came back on amazon and bought myself another one. And this one came apart within the first week. I have been using it anyway but it's hard as the top doesn't really fit on the bottom and the metal inside part of the top has come apart, so I have to just sort of put the thing together and be very careful with it. I don't know if they aren't making them as good as they used to, but this situation just isn't good. Basically, I want a new one or my money back.
