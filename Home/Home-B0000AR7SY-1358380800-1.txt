review/summary: Fantastic grinderreview/text: We have this at work and I love it so much I bought one for home. I love that I can set the grind and it's great that you just turn a dial to grind the cup amount you need. My only complaint on the one I bought for home is that there is a lot of static that the grounds fly all over the place but I attribute this to it being new because the one at work does not have the static. I think the combination of the grind level and it being a burr grinder changes the taste of the coffee in a good way. Overall very happy and I think it's worth the money.
