review/summary: Nice set and very sharpreview/text: It was time to upgrade to a matching knife set. Overall it's been a good value. I have seen here and there little rust spots that wipe off the surface. This occurred by leaving in the dishwasher till the next day even though it went through the drying cycle. Rinsing off after use and removing from dishwasher after they are washed should provide years of service. Much better quality than the bed bath and beyond no name set I had before.
