review/summary: Just what I neededreview/text: I bought this product for my Montessori classroom where I taught my Lower Elementary students to grind and brew coffee as a part of their Grace & Courtesy lessons. It is perfect for their size (5-7 year olds) and is safe to touch in most places. The water only takes about 2 minutes to come to a rolling boil. They love that they can see through the blue transparent side and can carry it easily. It has held up with it's daily use for the month that I have owned it so far. If need be, I would buy this same product again.
