review/summary: Love It!review/text: Not great for baking; the position of the rack to put the pan on is a little close to the element which results in a little extra "browning". Maybe I will just work on temperature adjusting to bake a can of crescent rolls, etc. The toaster part makes the perfect toast very quickly. The size is just right for the countertop and heating up a piece of pizza, etc. - again, may need to adjust temperature because of the distance from the rack to the element. Otherwise, I love this! So much better than our big old toaster oven that took a half-hour for toast and took up loads of counter space.
