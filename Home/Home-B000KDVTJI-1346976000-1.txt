review/summary: Every tea drinker needs onereview/text: This type of electric water kettle was in every hotel we stayed in when we took our trip to Ireland and England a couple of years ago. We are big hot tea drinkers and if you are too, this kettle is a must. It heats water in about 90-120 seconds --I can hardly get a cup heated faster in the microwave (and I try to avoid running the microwave with kids in the kitchen. Yes, I'm paranoid).I bought one for my mother and she loves it, and then my brother and nephew had to have their own too. I just bought another for my tea drinking son who went off to college. We are a 4 Aroma kettle family now. LOL.Mine is over 2 years old and still going strong.
