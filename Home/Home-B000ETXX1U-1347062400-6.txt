review/summary: Mattress was shipped with a burnt out pumpreview/text: I was really anticipating trying out this mattress from all the positive reviews online. When I received the package it looked legit. I opened it up and plugged it in, all I hear is a loud humming noise. No air going in, so I turn it to deflateMode and same noise happens and no air is being sucked out. I'm really disappointed that this air mattress failed me. I needed one by this week so I guess I will be sleeping on the floor now. Another thing is I don't know how this product is a Wenzel? It does not say anything about that brand on the box, on the mattress, or even on the pump? It just says I insta-bed all over it. I am going to try exchanging this product to give them another shot. I will update my review to let everyone know how it goes.
