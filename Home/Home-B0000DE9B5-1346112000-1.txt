review/summary: Good jug - you'll need to know the trick for the lidreview/text: These are good jugs, I would give them 5 stars if the spout was a little bigger so it would pour cleanly and the handle were a little bigger. But the medium size is just right and the square shape fits in the fridge door.The trick to getting the lids to lock is: you need to turn the "dial" PAST the arrow that says Close. It takes a little extra effort to push past it the first time, but once you get it works every time.
