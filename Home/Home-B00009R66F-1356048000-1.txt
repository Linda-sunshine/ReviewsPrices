review/summary: Amazing!review/text: I absolutely love this steamer! It's easy to assemble and to use, keeps the dirty water separate from the clean water and it sucks up the water really good. I tried different steamers before this one, but none of them really cleaned my carpet. The brushes on this one will really scrub the stains off and then the suction will lift up all the dirt. I've also used it on upholstery and you can even use it to detail cars. I wouldn't return it, sell it or trade it for anything else!
