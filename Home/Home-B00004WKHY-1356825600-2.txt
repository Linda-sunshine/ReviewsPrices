review/summary: Everything I want in a food processorreview/text: Bought to replace an Oster, and this wasn't all that much more money. It is so far superior, chops like nobody's business. Very nice looking on the counter too, as a bonus. It did take a little while to figure how to use it, but finally watched the video that came with it and figured it out. Highly recommended.
