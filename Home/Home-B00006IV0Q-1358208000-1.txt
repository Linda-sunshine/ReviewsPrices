review/summary: the best coffee pot i have ever usedreview/text: i chose this coffee pot because it is a percolator as opposed to a drip pot and i know that coffee tastes better when it perks. most importantly tho to our family is the coffee is always extremely HOT as opposed to warm basically with other types or methods of making coffee. it stays hot while plugged in and the coffee never tastes burned or old. i highly recommend this pot if you really enjoy a GOOD CUP OF COFFEE.
