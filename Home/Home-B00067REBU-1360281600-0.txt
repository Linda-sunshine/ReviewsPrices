review/summary: EASY Bread!review/text: I looked many places to find this machine. I had one previously for 10+ years and loved it. It is a great EASY to use machine. When I become a better cook there may be a need for more but not now! The recipes that come with it are said to use too much yeast so I use packets and the bread comes out beautifully.
