review/summary: Glad I bought thisreview/text: It has 4 different settings so you can see what your face looks like in different lighttings. The middle mirror flips and is on one end, zoomed in... which is nice. All in all, I like it. Glad I bought it. I've been tired of doing my makeup in less than ideal lighting and then hoping I don't look like clown face once I'm in the sun. - _ - haha. Now, I know what I look like when I leave my apartment...yayyyyyyyyyyy!!!! :))
