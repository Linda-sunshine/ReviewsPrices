review/summary: Good when it worksreview/text: I have had this food processor for about 3 months. I've used it maybe 5 times to make dips and hummus. The second time I used it the unit would not cut on. I checked to make sure everything was on properly and plugged in, but nothing happened when I turned it on. I assumed I had a faulty unit so I called Cuisinart. The lady I spoke to had me reset the unit by sliding a flat object in between the handle and work bowl base. She said it happens sometimes when things aren't connected properly. I was happy that it was atleast working again and didn't think anything of it. I've used it twice since then with no problems. Today I went to turn the unit on and again nothing happened. I checked to make sure everything was lined up right and connected properly. This time I found the reset button and the unit started working. However, when I was done and went to remove the work bowl from the base it refused to budge. It appears that the reset lever has somehow locked the bowl to the base, and my husband and I struggled for a half an hour trying to remove it without damaging it. We finally called Cuisinart and were told they would ship us a replacement after we paid for shipping to send the damaged unit back and we have to cover the shipping on the new one. I think this is very poor customer service considering I bought this from Amazon so that I would not have to pay for shipping to begin with. This is the first and last Cuisinart product we will be buying. I bought this specific food processor due to all the good reviews, but unfortunately I can only give 3 stars due to the hassle and poor customer service.
