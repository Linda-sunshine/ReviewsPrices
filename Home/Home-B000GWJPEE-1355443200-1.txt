review/summary: Works Finereview/text: The Crane Dragon works fine for us. No problems so far. My only complaint is that this thing looks like a Dinosaur or a Lizard, not a Dragon. A Dragon has wings and whatnot while this thing is armless.Keep in mind that when you buy this thing if you intend to run it during the night, you will need to refill it once per day. Not a big deal for us but keep that in mind.
