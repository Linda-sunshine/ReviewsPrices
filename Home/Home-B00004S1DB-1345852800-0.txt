review/summary: Too much to cleanreview/text: To begin with the product broke the second time I used it but it still is a quality carafe so I'll keep it. I guess it is a true press but with no filter you have grounds at the bottom that even if contained in the brewing still must be flushed from the carafe after use. Too much work for me
