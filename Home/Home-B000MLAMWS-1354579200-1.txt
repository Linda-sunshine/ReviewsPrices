review/summary: Perfect!review/text: I recently purchased this KA mixer and so I am still getting used to it. Because it is a heavy duty mixer, as the instructions explain, batters, doughs, et al will require less mixing than may be indicated in a recipe which is written for an "ordinary mixer". So, it may take some experimentation to produce the desired results. I am looking forward to it. Thus far I have made bread dough and pizza dough. The dough hook handled the kneading so I didn't have to - and that saved time and produced a better product. I am very pleased with the power of the machine. Be prepared, however, this mixer is very tall and heavy; it will take up a lot of counter space or cabinet space if you chose to store it. It may be a chore for a person of slight strength to "lug" out. Enjoy
