review/summary: Small little percolatorreview/text: I bought this percolator because of the reviews. Unfortunately it is very small. 6 cups it leaves grounds so I only make 4 cups at a time. The ground basket is very tiny and you will need smaller fingers to manage the filter in it. I do like the taste of the coffee. It is very hot and it doesn't seem to cause the coffee any bitterness if left - but then again it is small - 4 cups or actually 2 mug fulls. If I had the option I would return it and get a larger size.
