review/summary: Does not clear cigarette smoke as claimedreview/text: I live in a 1968 condo building above a smoker. The smoke penetrates my condo unit especially in the bathroom where he smokes at night. Neither this nor an smaller &#34;purifer&#34; clears the smoke. In fact both just makes it worse in the living room. Both(Honeywell) models claim to clear the cigarette smoke. But in fact they make it worse. THEY ARE BOTH JUST GIANT NON-EFFICIENT FANS. THE SMALLER MODEL HELPS VERY SLIGHTLY IN THE BATHROOM. RUNNING THE SHOWER WITH COLD WATER IS THE MOST EFFICIENT.
