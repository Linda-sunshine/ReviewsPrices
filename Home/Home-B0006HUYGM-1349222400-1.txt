review/summary: Powerful Little Handy Vacreview/text: This little vac is sturdy with a solid feel and motors through various clean-up jobs. I use it when I am doing home improvement projects around the house. Beats lugging a big old shop vac around and helps me avoid using the Dyson. The attached hose with nozzle is also very handy and a great feature. All in all I'd highly recommend it.
