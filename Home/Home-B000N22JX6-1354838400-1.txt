review/summary: good looking heater with some issuesreview/text: Good things first: decent heater, decent looking and relatively quiet. Well, it's not that quiet but it could be worse. It's good enough that I'm happy with it.Now for the bad: the remote control doesn't work, and no, I'm not sending it back just for the remote. It's just disappointing. And also, Amazon sent mine in its original box (They always double-box their stuff, so I'm not sure why they sent this one in its original box). And UPS did a lovely job destroying the box, and maybe that's why the remote doesn't work. With the squashed box and amateurish tape job, it almost seems like they sent me a used one or an open-box. Either way, I'm not happy with Amazon. I expected better.
