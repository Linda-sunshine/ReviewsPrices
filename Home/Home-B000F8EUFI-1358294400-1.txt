review/summary: Economical price for an economic performancereview/text: We were very happy when we first purchased this vacuum -- $50 was a steal and our house doesn't demand daily vacuuming. And let's be honest -- $500 for a vacuum is just unreasonable.About a year later though, we're really dissatisfied. The hose continues to get clogged up with hair and dust, and the only way to remove it is to take the vacuum apart and manually dig out the hair. It's frustrating beyond compare to have to dig out all the hair and dust you just sucked up.Fifty bucks was worth it at the time, but I'm now on the hunt for something I don't have to disembowel every other use.
