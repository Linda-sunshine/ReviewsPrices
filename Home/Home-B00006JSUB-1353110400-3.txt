review/summary: 15-inch version is great, but massivereview/text: If you're getting your first cast iron skillet, this is a great brand and a great value. Absolutely happy with the performance and use the pan frequently. I would say think carefully about the size - the 15 inch is massive and quite heavy. Storage might be a challenge if you are space limited.
