review/summary: cook unevenly and easily stick.....review/text: Since you can't flip it, it does not cook evenly if you don't load enough batter in. That of course is not a major problem compares to the stickiness...... We just can't stand how easily it sticks and how inconvenient to clear it afterward. So we return it after the first day, what a disappointment........
