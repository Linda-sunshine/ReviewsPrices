review/summary: Great Pitcher Filterreview/text: When I was looking for a filtered water system, I found there were many options. I wasn't sure if I wanted one that I poured or one like this. After reading the reviews, I decided to go with this one. I'm glad I did. I like how it is long and skinny so it doesn't take up much room in the fridge. It holds more water than the pouring pitcher. The spout is easy to use and I haven't had any trouble with leaking. It fills up quickly and the water tastes great. I'm still not sure if it is any better than a pouring pitcher, but I'm happy with it.
