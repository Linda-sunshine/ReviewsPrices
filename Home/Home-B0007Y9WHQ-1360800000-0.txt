review/summary: Not a bad little tool, but could be improved somewhatreview/text: I'm only going to give this 3 stars for now. Reason is that the plastic seems a bit thin/flimsy in places, and I'm afraid that overuse may break a couple things AND....the directions are AWFUL. Pictograms more than directions, actually......It's pretty easy to use, but there are some things you can do, for instance, to minimize wastage of the food, and it's not listed.You also need to be sure to push the food forward with the stationary handle not the one you turn. The one you turn seems flimsy, but the other one is pretty solid. Also, the suction cups work on my table very well, which is nice.That said, it does what I wanted it to do for the most part. It cuts fairly thin, which I wanted for dehydrating. The blades that cut in noodles or curly are fine, and I've done stir fry with things like zucchini and I've made homemade hashbrowns with it. Both turned out fine.Cleanup is fine with a water spray extension on my sink. I have no dishwasher, so cleaning the prongs would be hard without the sprayer. I use a toothbrush to clean the blades, because they are SHARP and will cut you. I recommend spraying it off immediately after use each and every time. I also dry mine immediately with either paper towels or a Skoy cloth to absorb all the water.I only paid $30 for this item and got free shipping. Had I paid more, I would have felt I'd paid to much. As it is, I'll probably use it a couple of times a week or maybe less. Not something I'll use daily, but not too bad.
