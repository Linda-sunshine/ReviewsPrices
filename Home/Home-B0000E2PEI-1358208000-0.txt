review/summary: Don't buy it!review/text: I bought this just over a year ago & now it doesn't work. Tried replacing the battery - didn't fix issue. Scale started showing lower and lower numbers (which would have been nice if I'd been really losing the weight), then wouldn't register at all. Now it shows 0.0 when you step on it and when you step off it starts showing 350 + lbs and rising... My last scale lasted more than 10 years and only had to be replaced when a heavy object dropped on it. Very disappointed.
