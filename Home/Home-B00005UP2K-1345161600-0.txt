review/summary: Not strong enoughreview/text: I purchased this about a year ago on a sponsored link and I must say the product did not hold up that well. I wish I had purchased the professional one instead. For $ 100.00 more please take a look at them before you buy. Mine is starting to have a lot of movement in the head part and also when I make bread or pizza it actually stops when the bread dough on the hook gets a little dry. Over all it is a okay machine but if you want something to make bread dough or pizza dough like I do, get the professional one.Update: I did wind up purchasing the Pro 600 from KitchenAid and I must say that machine handles all my needs!! The Pro 600 is really a good product, I wish that the kitchenaid adds for the Artisan collection would not say that it makes bread as the machine is not strong enough to handle the bread dough.
