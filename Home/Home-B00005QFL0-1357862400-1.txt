review/summary: The best thing since...well...sliced bread!review/text: I've been making bread the traditional way for decades. My husband did all the research to find the best machine in this price range. I was initially against the purchase (what's better than the &#34;old way&#34;), but I have to say, this is a great product! For those new to owning a bread maker, this is very easy to use. I especially like the programmable feature--you can time it just right to have hot bread ready when the meal is ready. We will be purchasing a second machine as a gift for our daughter.
