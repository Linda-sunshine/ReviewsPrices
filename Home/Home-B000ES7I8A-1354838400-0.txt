review/summary: Could be better.review/text: The body of the kettle is fully stainless steel, but not the lid which is plastic and has a slight "modern plastic" smell when hot. My biggest complain is the consistent dripping from the spout when pouring. The shape of the spout needs to be improved. The real capacity is 1.2 Liter. It is not the most powerful kettle, so it takes some time to boil 1 liter of water, but it is not noisy. There is no automatic shut-off when lifting the kettle from its base, but this feature is not common in the USA.
