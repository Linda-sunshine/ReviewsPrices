review/summary: Very good, but there's room for improvementreview/text: I bought this griddle because is large enough to heat tortillas. It will do 2 at a time. I also cook breakfast on it quite a bit. That's usually 4-5 strips of bacon, 3 eggs, and 2 slices of toast.It heats quickly. It is hotter over the element with the center being cooler than the edges. It's not bad at all, but it is there. The non stick surface is fantastic. I wish i had it on my expensive pots and pans instead of what came with them. The front edge has a nice shape for cracking eggs.The only downside is that the heating surface doesn't remove from the base like Presto's 07061 model does. This would help a lot with cleaning especially the drain area. The problem is that the front edge of the cooking surface extends over the draining trough. It's hard to get up under the cooking surface to clean this area out.They could also make a positive lock for the sides. The sides swing outward causing the front to tilt downward to allow grease to drain. I don't use this feature and have no plans to for the foreseeable future. Handing the big griddle, especially during cleaning, is more difficult because the handles will swing around. A way to lock them in place would be helpful.Overall, it's a very nice griddle.
