review/summary: Junk--and possibly hazardousreview/text: I had used an older one of these at work and was thinking that this would be good for my mother, who is in her 80s, to make herself a cup of tea. The first problem that I discovered when I read the instructions is that it must be unplugged after every use or can overheat. This is both a nuisance and hazardous for older adults (or anyone) who might forget to unplug it so I decided that it wouldn't be good for my mother after all. Then I took it home and thought I might use it myself. The first time I used it I filled it with less than the maximum amount of water stated in the instructions, but it started spewing hot water all over the counter anyway. Then it simply stopped working--I couldn't get it to heat water again. Needless to say I returned it.
