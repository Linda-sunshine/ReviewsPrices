review/summary: Cute but just okayreview/text: I LOVE elephants and I think this humidifier is adorable. While it does make a difference being right next to my bed, it doesn't really effectively humidify my entire room. It might work better in a smaller room. I also bought this because I thought it'd be ultra quiet, since I'm a light sleeper. While it is quieter than some humidifiers, it's probably louder than the one I bought from Walgreens a couple of years back, and it's definitely louder than a Pure Guardian. I also find it difficult to get back on the base after cleaning, there's no obvious arrow or &#34;front&#34; and since it's round you kind of have to turn it until it fits into the base. And the lights on it are REALLY bright, I actually put bandaids over them because they light up my room. But it's cute, easy to clean, and it holds up and serves it's purpose.
