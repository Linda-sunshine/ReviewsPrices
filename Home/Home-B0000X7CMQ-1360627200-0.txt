review/summary: Zojirushi 10 cup Coffee Makerreview/text: On the plus side, the Zojirushi makes a really good cup of coffee -- better and hotter than many other standard drip coffee makers. It's also stylish, and easy to clean.On the downside -- and it's a big downside -- the design of the drip mechanism is seriously flawed. The hole from the bottom of the coffee cone MUST PRECISELY match up with the hole in the top of the carafe, else, the coffee just simply pours out of the bottom of the cone and all over your counter. It's a real mess! Being off-center even just a millimeter results in coffee all over the counter & not in the carafe.The designers of this Zojirushi coffee maker need to take a cue from the designers of the Mr. Coffee coffee maker: allow more space between the bottom of the coffee cone and the top of the coffee carafe/pot.
