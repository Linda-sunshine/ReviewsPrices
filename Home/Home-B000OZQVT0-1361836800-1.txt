review/summary: Yes, a bit spendy, but perform as describedreview/text: We have been using the Real Flame Gel Fuel all winter in our 'fireplace'. As promised they do crackle like a real flame would. They emit a tremendous amount of heat as well (our fireplace used 3 canisters at a time). Burn time, average 2-3 hours on the large fuel cans. We had purchased the small ones, to try for shorter burns, however they do not fit well in the canister holders on our fireplace, so I do not recommend them. The down sides are two-fold. 1.) Cost, it is not cheap. 2.) They do have an odor, the further down they burn the more charred/gas type odor you will notice.
