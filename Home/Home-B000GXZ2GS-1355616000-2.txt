review/summary: Great satisfying coffeereview/text: I like quality not quantity. Therefore, when I use my Aeropress, I enjoy it so much that I don't feel the need for more. I used to drink too much coffee not for any other reason than it left me unsatisfied. Like good rich chocolates, you only need one to satisfy the want.And, the Aeropress can be stored in the cabinet with the glasses. I live in a 5th wheel RV where counter space is at a premium. I love not having a coffee pot take up precious counter space.I have had my Aeropress for two years now and it works as great at the first day. I can't say that for the many electric drip pots I've had, especially since we no longer have "made in the USA" reliability!
