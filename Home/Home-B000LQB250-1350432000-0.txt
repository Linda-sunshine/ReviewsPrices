review/summary: Made sleeping a lot more enjoyable!review/text: For my first year living off campus, I got a bed for free at a family friend's garage sale. Despite the upside of the price for this bed, it was absolutely hard as a rock! I couldn't sleep without waking up with aches and pains. It was literally as bad as sleeping on the floor. I caved and bought this memory topper, hoping it would help.It arrived in only a few days, and I unrolled it and let it sit for a few hours. The smell, while not something that was absolutely awesome, wasn't overwhelming and I ended up putting the topper on my bed later that night. It was a bit of an adjustment from the surface I'd been sleeping on before, but within a week of breaking it in, I was sleeping SO much better than before. Now my bed is something I enjoy being in, not something I dread.If someone's bed was as hard as mine, I would absolutely recommend this foam topper. It changed my sleeping for the better!
