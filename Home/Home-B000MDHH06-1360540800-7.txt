review/summary: We love Brevillereview/text: This is our second Breville and we love juicing almost daily. My partner travels for work and takes along the Compact for juicing during the week (a great alternative to dining out every night). It's well designed and cleans easily. We haven't done a taste comparison with a larger Breville, but the Compact seems to work just as well (in spite of not having speed control) and the juice is just as delicious and easy to prepare. Overall we prefer Breville compared to several other juicers we've owned because of the quantity of juice extracted and ease and speed of use.
