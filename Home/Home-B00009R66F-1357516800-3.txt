review/summary: The quality on this product has gone WAY downreview/text: We have a lot of carpets and live in a place with lots of dust, so we have bought quite a number of Hoover Carpet Cleaners over the years. We've always been happy with our carpet cleaners from Hoover. However, this product looks the same, but the quality has gone way way down. I'm so disappointed. The other Hoovers were easy to clean. With this model, in order to clean it, you have to unscrew the section to clean to clean it and the screws are really really hard to reach. I don't want to fiddle with unscrewing sections every time I want to clean it.Additionally, if it is dirty (and it always dirty after we've been shampooing the carpet) the screws are covered in gunge and I have to get my hands filled with gunge to fight to get the screws off and I have to t;rn the unit almost upside down to get to the screws. Arrrggggh. The other solution is to not clean it very often but this means that it will smell and the dirt and grime will dry inside the unit.Also, other Hoovers have had a way to either shampoo or rinse the carpet while they were being used. With this unit you can only shampoo which means leaving shampoo in your carpet. I guess you could empty the shampoo out of it (which wastes shampoo) and fill the unit up with clear water. But this is a huge hassle. Additionally the other Hoovers have had plastic that seemed strong. This plastic is flimsy. We are really disappointed and probably won't be buying Hoover products again.
