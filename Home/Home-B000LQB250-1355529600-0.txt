review/summary: Awesome productreview/text: This is an awesome product. Used it to rejuvenate an aging king size mattress. First nights sleep sold me. It was so comfortable I didn't want to get out of bed in the morning. The only drawback (a minor one) was the green tea scent used to mask any chemical odor from the manufacture of the product. It had more the aroma of wintergreen, not unpleasant just unexpected. Odor was gone within two weeks. I suffer from arthritis and now look forward to pain free rest. Glad I bought this product.
