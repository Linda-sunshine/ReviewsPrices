review/summary: Very nice kettlereview/text: Big selling point was that it is not hot to the touch. Got this for my daughter's dorm room, and most kettles with their very hot exteriors aren't safe for cramped quarters. While the outside does get a bit warm, it can be touched quite safely. A huge plus, given that a different one we tried burned my wife's hand when she tested the external temperature. We see where other reviewers have complained about it it pouring too much and spilling, because of its wide lip. We haven't found that to be a problem, as long as you don't try to pour too quickly.
