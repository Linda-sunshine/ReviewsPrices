review/summary: LOOKS REAL but JUST ANOTHER RIPOFF of the slimy 1% that shipped the factory to Chinareview/text: It probably cost them $10 to make this thing. The rest is your contribution to the super-rich CEO salary of this company. The original Mr. Farber must be turning in his grave.Made in China. It worked great for the summer but for the last week it's been luke warm. We didn't realize it was the unit "cooling off" our coffee - so fast, until today. I wish I had looked at the negative feedback on this before I bought it. But I am 63 and I loved these units all my life, until now. I will probably open it up and see if I can modify it, but I really don't need another handyman project repairing Chinese junk. I have enough of those weekend jobs to do already.By now you must have heard that the financial capital industry disassembled factories all over this country in the last two decades and reassembled them all over China. Ameircan workers mostly did this task before they got laid off, so it must have felt like they were digging their own income graves, to bury their own jobs.When we bought it, we thought the high price implied quality, but we got fooled again.I once thought Chinese industry might improve in quality the way Taiwan and Korea once did. But China is a communist state, centrally controlled and regulated, and there is little incentive for them to be competitive. It is mostly young destitute farmer kids from the hinterland working in those factories - sending the money home - in prison-like "efficiency" dorm conditions.I am more biased against Chinese products than I ever was, but not the Chinese people, who are good people. I think there are a number of hard-working, honest, resourceful people in China that do really good work, but most of the garbage is sent here.
