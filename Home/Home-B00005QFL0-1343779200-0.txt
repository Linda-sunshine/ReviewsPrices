review/summary: Panasonic SD-YD250 Automatic Bread Makerreview/text: So, here I am; reviewer #1001 of Panasonic SD-YD250 Automatic Bread Maker.Thereof, since celebration is bout to begin let's make it snappy: no Bohemian philosophies, no gluten-free preaching, no badmouthing competition, and no lengthy descriptions of what to do to get that bread ohh so fluffy and crunchy and all that jazz.We are going to make it simple this time = THIS THING WORKS.I have been baking bread by hand for 30 years plus and not all the time have motivation to play with it cause it is time consuming and I have to work for a living, hence the bread machine. I had a couple of good brands in the past for those everyday needs and they expired. Then I tried couple of major brands and it was a joke. This unit is as close to good Italian, French or Austrian bakery results as you can get without doing it by hand yourself, for say 4 hours. I do hope that explains. Advice to elevation baking: the higher you are the less yeast and gluten if added you use, so what was 2 tea spoons in Florida, becomes 1.3 spoon at 4000 feet and 1.0 in Colorado Mountains. Then let this thing do the rest of thinking. It is great gizmo and most certainly worth every penny. If it does not last forever, then I will get replacement of the same brand with hope it works just as good. Supermarket bread just does not excite me much - I like to know what I eat.
