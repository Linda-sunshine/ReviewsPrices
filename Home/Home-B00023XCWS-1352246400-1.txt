review/summary: Excellent Little Kettlereview/text: I bought this kettle for my office. I wanted it to heat water for tea, on days when I didn't feel like coffee, and for hot water for oatmeal. When I got the kettle, I was suprised by how petite it was, but this was not an issue for me. The small size lets it sit perfectly on my cabinet and holds plenty of water for 2-3 cups of hot beverage and oatmeal. I find that it does bring water to a full boil, and does so quickly. I never noticed a plastic-y taste, as some reviewers mentioned. When I opened the kettle, I let it sit overnight filled with soapy water, with the lid open. The next morning, I washed it out with soap and water. Then I ran a pot of water through the kettle, discarding the water. When I made my first cup to drink, I never noticed a plastic-y taste. I would definitely recommend this kettle, especially at this reasonable price!
