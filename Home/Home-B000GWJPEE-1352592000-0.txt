review/summary: Ok Productreview/text: This is the 4th Crane humidifier that we have purchased in 2 years. They do not last long. The fan has gone out on two of them inside of a year. This one seems to work ok; meaning no vibrations or noise. The nightlight is not bright at all, which may be good for some kids. Our daughter likes the Hello Kitty part of it, so that has worked out well. Our only hope is that it makes it through the winter.
