review/summary: Good & Simple...review/text: We have had this thing for about half a year now, and use it virtually on a daily basis. My wife loves coffee and I love making coffee with this thing, so it's a shared experience, despite the fact that I really can't stand coffee. Being a "one person who drink coffee" home, we were close to buying a capsule machine. However, the available flavours in Norway are very limited, and the price pr cup rather high. Thats when we stumbled on to the Aeropress.So, I am not experienced at making coffee, but based on the feedback from everyone I have made a cup of Aeropress coffee for, this thing makes really good coffee. Compared to the french press I used to have for making coffee for friends & family, this one is sure a lot nicer. It tastes better, and it is a LOT easier to clean. It is a cheap, easy way to make a great cup quickly.
