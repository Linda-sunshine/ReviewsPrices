review/summary: Works Great!review/text: I bought two of these, one was a gift for a friend who needed something simple to clean around things like the litter box. I wanted it for doing the stairs and just the quick job around the house so I didn't have to drag out the tank of a vacuum. It's got great power and the brush works better than expected. The power cord length is awesome, I think it's longer than the regular vacuum and just stiff enough that it stays out the way. The only draw back is that the hose is just two short, had they made it more extendable or included an extension it would be awesome. I think someone mentioned that there are some extensions you can get or that it works with standard extensions - I'm going to check into that.
