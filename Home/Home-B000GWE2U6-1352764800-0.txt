review/summary: Best yet!review/text: This is the fourth humidifier I've owned and I must say, it is the best yet! I've been disappointed in the past, mainly with the output and effectiveness of other humidifiers. This one works (amazingly, in fact) and I can SEE (as well as feel) the difference! The mist is thick, but as long as you don't set it too high, it doesn't make everything around it wet. I'm pregnant and have been suffering from a lot of congestion, especially at night. I've been using this humidifier for about 2 weeks now and it has definitely helped ease my symptoms. I can finally breathe out of my nose again. It's easy to clean, no difficult areas to wipe down and only needs about 20 minutes of care once a week. Just use a little bit of water and vinegar and remember to change the water every night (or day) before using. I read some reviews saying that the tank is small and runs out before morning. Luckily, it has an auto shut-off in the event that it does. However, I've only had this happen once, and it was because I forgot to change/add water to the tank before I went to sleep. As long as you fill the tank each night, I think it should last. Also, the cute design is an added bonus.
