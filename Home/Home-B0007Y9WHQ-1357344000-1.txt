review/summary: The art of eating veggiesreview/text: I've used this item for a few dishes and really enjoyed the texture and shapes that it created with my vegetables. The only thing I would note is that I wished it cut all types of vegetables (small, medium, and large). This gadget only cuts certain types of veggies that have to be large enough to fit for nice spiral cutting. Other than that I'm a pleased customer.
