review/summary: Eh.review/text: It's a great looking design, and works smoothly, but I actually get annoyed by the locking feature--I don't think it serves much of a purpose and I guess I don't get the big advantage. It's not for me and will probably end up getting a different one as soon as I don't feel guilty about spending the money on this one.
