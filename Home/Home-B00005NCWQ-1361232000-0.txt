review/summary: Very Usefulreview/text: This percolator can brew 8 cups of coffee very quickly. While it may not brew coffee as fast as a Keurig, it brews a much more robust cup of coffee and can be used in the kitchen or outdoors while camping or tailgating. The only downsides that I have encountered is that the container itself must be hand washed although the basket can be washed in a dish washer and the measuring marks are on the interior of the container next to the handle which makes it a bit awkward to read when filling up with water. Other than those two little issues this percolator rocks and fills the house with an amazing aroma of fresh brewed coffee.
