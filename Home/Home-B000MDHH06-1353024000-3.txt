review/summary: Love it, but it's still messy;)review/text: Well, I've grown so tired of the Jack Lalanne Power Juicer because it's such a mess to clean. So, I tried the Ninja when its packaging said it was also a "juicer"- I assure you; it is not. So, I searched and found this compact Breville and was happy to see the pulp was ejected into a shoot. So I bought it. First day, I was already much happier. It is easier to clean and dump, thought it fills quick, but I can get a full cup (the one that comes with the juicer) full of juice before I have to clean it. Still, it is a bit messy and I see little pieces of Kale and splattered juice over the counter that I have to clean up before my wife chokes me, ha-ha. But all in all it isn't too bad to handle.With that said, a friend of mine has the bigger Breville with the separate shoot. She simply puts a small plastic bag in it to collect the pulp and she now has even less mess than I do. Still, either way, you'll have to take off the lid to clean it as well as wash clean the blade, but it's well worth the juice.Breville, I'm waiting for the day you make a juicer that simply squashes each fruit/veggie so flat, it pours right out and you simply throw away a whole skin. Then, I will be content:) But for now, I love my juicer!
