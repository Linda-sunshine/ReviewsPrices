review/summary: Big shoes to fillreview/text: My alarm clock of 20 years recently broke - I've tried replacing it a couple times over the years but every clock was either too bright or did not have the simple layout I had become accustomed to. This clock fits the bill! The light isn't too bright at night and it's simple to use - hopefully this lasts another 20 years!
