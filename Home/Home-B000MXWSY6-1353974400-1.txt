review/summary: Everything you'd want in a clock radioreview/text: I recently replaced our old nightstand clock as it was almost 20 years old and the last relic from my college days. After researching extensively on Amazon I came across this one and here are the things you need to know about this clock:1. The time is set at the factory for you in EST. It maintains the time through a simple button battery. Seems to last better than the traditional 9V setup you see from other clocks. When I plugged it in, the time was immediately correct as I reside in the eastern US.2. The brightness of the display has 3, count them 3 levels. My biggest gripe about my old clock was that it was too bright. This has a very low setting that is perfect if you plan to keep it on the night stand next to your bed.3. Setting the alarm is easy and OBVIOUS! You cant mess up what alarm is set and for what time. Something I find important in an alarm clock.The radio works just fine and the sound is what you would expect of a Sony. The footprint is small, not tiny, but good. All and all a great purchase for the price.
