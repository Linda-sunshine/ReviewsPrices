review/summary: I like it a lotreview/text: I an drinking a cup of decaf right now. It's perfect. The other day I gave away the Keurig, today I give away my Senseo. I have a pretty glass teapot on the stove heating water and a small Aerobie in the drainer waiting to make the next cup. It's perfect for me. I put in coffee for about two cups (marker on maker) and then pour water for four cups. You can add water after making the espresso to make it taste like an American coffee, but I would just as soon all my coffee go through the system. I am using the paper filters though I did consider the permanent mesh filter. But I suspect the paper offers a cleaner neater drink. I am very satisfied with the purchase.
