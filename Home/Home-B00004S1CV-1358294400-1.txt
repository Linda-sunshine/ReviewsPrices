review/summary: Infuser basket mesh is too large for loose leaf teareview/text: My husband bought me two tea mug infusers, from Amazon, this week. The first one to arrive was the clear sided one made by Aladdin, that has the drop down infuser basket (made out of fine mesh) in the lid. I absolutely LOVE that one and have used it nonstop at work all week. This one I am going to try to return on my day off tomorrow, I've had it less than a week so I'm hoping that won't be a problem. I haven't used this one because I can see that the infuser mesh is WAY too large to keep some of the loose leaf teas that I brew from falling through the mesh and into my tea. If you're a diehard, loose leaf tea drinker and want a mug like this then I highly recommend the Aladdin. I am planning on purchasing a couple more of the Aladdins so that I don't have to keep washing the same one over and over throughout my work week.
