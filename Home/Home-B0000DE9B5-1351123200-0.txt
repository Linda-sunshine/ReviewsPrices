review/summary: Not as tricky as everyone says, but not greatreview/text: I bought two pitchers from amazon, this guy is the big loser. This isn't as complicated to use as everyone claims, and mine DID come with instructions. The problem is, the lid wasn't well designed, it doesn't work super well (especially when the rubber ring gets cold in the fridge). I like the shape, but sadly, I found this guy leaked on me fairly often. Not my fave.
