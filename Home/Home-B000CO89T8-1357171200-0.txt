review/summary: Warm Coffee, mmmmmmreview/text: I asked for this item for Christmas. I read some of the reviews and wasn't sure it would do the job. Just hoped for warm coffee. The first time I tried it, I only turned it on briefly and felt the warming pad. It seemed to warm up fast.I finally tested it with my morning coffee and have to say I was pleasantly surprised. It keeps my coffee warm and, dare I say, hot! I now use it every morning 'cause there's nothing worse than accidentally sipping a cold cup of coffee. I also noticed the thinner my coffee cup, the hotter the coffee. I would definitely recommend this to others. I've already told my mother (the gift giver) she should get one too.
