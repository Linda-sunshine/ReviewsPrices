review/summary: Makes life in the kitchen easyreview/text: Works great. A must have for any one who seriously uses their kitchen, and cut lots of veggies.Four stars only because of the quality of the plastic. It gets stained easily by the food, and color is almost impossible to wash off. So from first use it already looked old.
