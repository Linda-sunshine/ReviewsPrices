review/summary: Not as good as penquinreview/text: I borrowed the Penguin from a neighbor which was awesome so I purchased this one only because of the color. Slightly disappointed because it doesn't seem to produce as must steam as the penquin. I'm not sure if their is a difference in power or output, but thought I would share.
