review/summary: Comfortable!review/text: I ordered this for my daughter who is in college. Her mattress was very hard and uncomfortable. I was warned about the smell so I opened it up at home for a week before I brought it to her. She LOVES this topper and said she sleeps so well now! Her roommate wants one!
