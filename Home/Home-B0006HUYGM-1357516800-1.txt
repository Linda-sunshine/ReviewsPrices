review/summary: Better than Anticipatedreview/text: Eureka does it again. This works awrsome on my stairs. Much more power than anticipated. I have an entertainment room downstairs and have black carpet leading down to it. I have to keep the door closed because I have a white cat who loves anything darker than a tan. So he is up and down the stairs and leaves his hair everywhere. This works awesome. And this flip up bar to do the verticle part of the stairs is amazing. Also works awesome on the couch's. I have not gotten to the cars yet, but I know it will work great.
