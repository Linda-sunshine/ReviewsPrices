review/summary: love it!review/text: I was introduced to the stovetop espresso maker on vacation out of the US, and knew I had to own one when I got home! After lots of online research, I purchased this Bialetti 6-cup model. I love it! It's tricky getting the heat right on an electric stove, but I figured out its quirks quickly after a few uses. I had to make 2 or 3 &#34;throw away&#34; pots before getting to actually drink a cup due to little bits of aluminum finding its way into my coffee, but I purposely used coffee I wasn't fond of, knowing I would have to do that. Also, the first time I used it, I had water or steam trying to escape from the screw seal.... turns out, I hadn't tightened it quite enough. Easily fixed! It makes really strong coffee, which is perfect if you love lattes.... it actually tastes like COFFEE instead of sweetened milky water :) Very, very happy with this purchase!
