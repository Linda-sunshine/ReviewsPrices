review/summary: Coffee maker is good...but the coffee pot is terriblereview/text: We have had a BUNN for years (1st coffee maker over 20 years) love them! When ours broke, we purchase the new one. The shape and color is very sophisticated and goes with our kitchen, however the coffee pot is terrible. The condensation on the lid leaks all over the counter as you pour your coffee...we have to use our OLD pot with the new maker. That's obnoxious.
