review/summary: The two separate water tanks make this a great productreview/text: I have tried numerous humidifiers over the years, ranging from inexpensive ones to very expensive ones, such as theVenta Airwasher -Charcoal, 554436. Take a look at the price of the Venta. And, that does not include the fluids you have to use on a regular basis.I have concluded that there is no perfect humidifier. With every unit, you have to put up with trade-offs. In the case of the Venta, of which I had two, keeping the mold growing from the inside of the tank and among the fan was the challenge, even though I spent about $20 a month of Venta conditioning and cleaning fluids.The biggest downside of the Venta was refilling the tank. I had to carry this massive tank to the sink, fill it out, and try not to spill any on the way back to where I was using the humidifier.By comparison, this Honeywell Humidifier has two separate tanks with handles. What a back saver!Now, I don't expect this Honeywell unit to be perfect, Yes, it is a big loud on the highest setting.For the price - again keep in mind how much I paid for the Venta - this is a five-star product.
