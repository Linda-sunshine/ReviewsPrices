review/summary: Absolutely love my cast iron!review/text: Had one of these growing up my whole life then realized I needed to have one of my own. These are fantastic and it's my go-to pan when cooking. Love that it can go in the oven, too, if you're making a deep dish pizza or cornbread. Get this and you won't be disappointed. It's so well made, it's probably the only one you'll ever need!
