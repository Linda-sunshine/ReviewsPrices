review/summary: It is poorly engineered for the construction materials used.review/text: Our dispenser broke this morning. The plastic flap lever controlling its valve started to slide out of its base yesterday and came off completely this morning. When I turned the unit over to slide it back in I found that I had to rotate the struts it fit onto outward to gain access. The mere rotation of the struts caused them to come apart--I use this phrase advisedly because they didn't seem to &#34;break off&#34; as in a frank fracture. Examination of the broken part revealed that it was a plastic made to thin for the support it was supposed to provide. This is one case where &#34;cheap&#34; is demonstrably different from &#34;inexpensive&#34;. I won't waste the money and time to return the item. I certainly won't bother to have it repaired. We are willing to spend a little more to get a product that works. All the others sold by Amazon do not dispense entirely by simple gravity as does the Sunbeam. I think this design would be better than all of them for our purposes if it were better engineered.
