review/summary: Bowl cracked in first month, quit working within 2 yearsreview/text: I have to agree with others that this thing did a fine job for such a small unit. However, the bowl cracked within the first month of use. When liquids finally started to leak from the crack, I bought a replacement bowl. Unfortunately, I only got to use the 2nd bowl twice because the darn motor stopped working! It's also very unsanitary given that you cannot fully clean the top part which contains the motor & power cord. Try making a spicy peanut salad dressing & then be limited to using only a damp cloth to clean it&#8212;gross.
