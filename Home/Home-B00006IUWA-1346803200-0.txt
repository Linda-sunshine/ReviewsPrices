review/summary: Simple and easyreview/text: You get exactly what you want with this popper-- an easy, quick and no fuss air popper. I don't use the top cup for melting butter because I find it's easier just to microwave a little butter and then put the popper away without having to do any cleaning. Pretty much all you have to do for this is plug it in and unplug it and you've got some fresh popcorn not laden in chemicals. Totally worth it!
