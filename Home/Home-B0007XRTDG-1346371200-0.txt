review/summary: It's BIG enough for dinner and left overs!review/text: I admit that when I order something...I don't usually pay attention to dimensions in the descriptions or take any time to reference a ruler/yardstick if I do notice. All I know is that I wanted an electric skillet. I was more than pleased when this arrived. This is a great size for making meals for large families, I am thinking scrambled eggs for 20 or more guests would work, too. The only drawback that I can think of is finding somewhere to stow it when you aren't making breakfast for the Duggar Family. It heats evenly and was everything I ever wanted in an electric skillet.
