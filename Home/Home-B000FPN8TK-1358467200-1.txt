review/summary: Steeped Tea Pleasurereview/text: I truly like this teapot. I have a hotshot to boil the water then pour the water into this teapot with my loose tea. It is so easy to then dispense the tea from the bottom of the teapot to any size cup. I made an extra full amount to the top of the teapot to test if the tea would stay warm for a time while I completed the first cup. I was pleased that the tea stayed warm. Granted I do not drink my teas as hot as some people do but I was still hot for me. I also like the fact that it is BPA free. I would recomend this Ingenuitea teapot to anyone whom enjoys tea.
