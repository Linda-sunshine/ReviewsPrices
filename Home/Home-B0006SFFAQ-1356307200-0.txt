review/summary: Pretty Nice Coffee Makerreview/text: It's a pretty nice coffee maker. Makes great tasting coffee, and the filter in it works really well. The water filter keeps the coffee tasting really good.Only complaint is that the device doesn't have a quality look (pretty &#34;cheesy&#34; plastic front/side). But I guess a lot of products are like that anymore. Hard to find a quality product that will last for years, but not real complaints for this yet. We've had it for about 3 months now, and its still working well.
