review/summary: Great grinderreview/text: I ordered one after moving in by myself. This was the brand my roommate had had for years, and it always delivered nice, ground beans which I later turned into beautiful coffee to shove in my face.This is a great grinder, and definitely last long enough to justify paying $20 for it.
