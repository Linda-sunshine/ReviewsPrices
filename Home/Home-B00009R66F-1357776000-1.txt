review/summary: Love it!review/text: The price was great, arrived quickly, and I love how well it cleans the carpets. The stair/upholstery attachment oversprays when using on the stairs, especially the top edge of the risers, but even that wasn't an issue for me. The carpet dried quickly and I didn't notice any chemical odors. I used the Hoover cleaning solution. Downside is that the water tank empties rather quickly if you are doing large areas, and the return tank has be emptied frequently. I would recommend it highly.
