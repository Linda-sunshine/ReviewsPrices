review/summary: Stopped working and bad customer supportreview/text: The machine started producing short cups after around 2 years. I tried all troubleshooting steps on the Keurig website with no success. I then called customer support. They would not repair nor replace the unit. I then noticed numerous reviews saying the pump on this unit frequently fails and Keurig will not replace/repair. Although this is beyond warranty it is a lemon based on numerous reviews with the same issue identified. Keurig should replace it at no cost. I will buy a different brand to replace it and will not buy anything from Keurig in the future.
