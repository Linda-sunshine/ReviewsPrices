review/summary: Awesome!review/text: I yearned for a mixer like this for years. I had a handheld that just didn't cut it for me. I couldn't use it for any heavy doughs and had to hold it. It was also limited on speeds, so using it for things like egg whites just made a huge mess I have increase my baking with the Artisan. I love it. I've made breads, dinner rolls, cakes, mashed potatoes (seriously gets them creamy and so smooth using so much less milk and butter), cookies, frostings............. I am very pleased with the kitchen aid and am happy that I finally broke down and got one. It has made my baking much more enjoyable. And it looks fantastic on my counter. The cornflower blue is so pretty and the finish is great.
