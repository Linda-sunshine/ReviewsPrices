review/summary: Great for everyone- especially senior citizens!!review/text: We have had our original OXO steel can opener for more than five years. We just bought a second one for my mother. You cannot break this opener!My mother came for a visit and fell in love with our can opener. Who wouldn't? Of all the can openers I have ever tried, this one is the best. If you have arthritic conditions, you will want this can opener. By far, this is the easiest to turn and use. It is easy on the hands.They seem to be strong and sturdy and I have never had trouble with mine. This is a great addition to any kitchen or perfect as a gift for anyone who has issues using their hands for opening/turning.
