review/summary: Worth every penny!review/text: We bought this because of how easy it was to use. The first time we used it, our kids all crowded around to watch the popcorn pop! They were screaming with excitement. It was so funny! Making popcorn is so easy now and our kids love to watch it every time. This is definitely worth the small price you pay!
