review/summary: very good, tips for berber carpet and cleaning methodsreview/text: I was surprised with the ease of using this machine. Despite appearing consumer quality, it works in commercial mode.Installation:Easiest thing in the world. It had 3 main pieces and attachments to be attached later; Clean water tank, dirt water tank, and the rest of the machine..Additional attachment, which you will be using gladly later are a bit trick to hook up, but not a big deal..Cleaning:As soon as I opened the package, I could not wait to read the manual fully, and started to clean my barber carpet. Hooked up the 3 main pieces together, filled in the tank with hot water and 6oz sample shampoo came free with the machine (use the measuring cup provided).The machine operates in a simple method..It sprays out the clean water deep into the carpet when you push it ahead..and sucks the water back from the carpet when pulling it back..So, you need to ensure that right amount of clean water goes into carpet..and more importantly, that all the water that dissolves the dirt in the carpet get sucked back into the dirty water tank..So, you must move the machine on carpet as much as it takes to ensure all the dirty water is sucked back in..After spraying the water into carpet, if you press one of the triggers in the handle, all machine does is to sick back the dirty water from the carpet, make sure you suck it back until the carpet gets almost dry, that is the main trick..The brushes operate in primary mode to effectively scrub the carpet, but you have option to turn them off..I did not..The stairwell attachment worked perfectly fine with me, unlike some reviewers. It actually works better cleaning in spots..After cleaning the floor with regular system, I still had some shady areas with cleaned but visible spots, and used the small stairwell attachment to go over and totally eliminated the stains...So, I suggest you use that attachment to clean smaller spots afterwards if needed..Barber carpet:I think, barber carpets are hard to clean in comparison to regular, since they are dense and compact..But this machine handles them very good.Shampoo:I wanted to clean the basement floor thoroughly which was about 500 sqf, I used up the complimentary 6oz shampoo, and in addition one third of the 20oz Hoover shampoo I got from Amazon from $20 (which actually smelled better)..So if your carpet is dirt, I suggest you also order a large shampoo with the machine.Cleaning:Cleaning was very easy..Simply wash both container, took out the brush and rinse, you are done..Value:I wanted to get this instead of hiring carpet cleaner, which may do better job with their pro machinery, but I had to freedom of taking my time and moving around the furniture by owning my own..if you have few rooms and do not plan to use this often, I suggest you hire a professional cleaner to do it for you to save time and energy..But Still, this is a great machine to keep around to clean bad spills and stains..It works very well...Verdict: Buy It !
