review/summary: Great Skillet.review/text: This replaced our old one & was it's twin. The exception is the non stick coating appears to have improved over the last 10 yrs.Heats pretty evenly, & big enough to cook 1/2 lb. of bacon at a time. I( took a tip from another reviewer & used blue loctite when assembling the legs/handles, & have had no loosening issues that I had with the last skillet (which is still going strong at my daughter's house). I suggest you get this one, a real bargain for $40!
