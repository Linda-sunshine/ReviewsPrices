review/summary: What alarm!!review/text: Once I figured out how to set the time on the alarm clock it was great. But I am not savvy when it comes to figuring out things. I missed two meeting because I thought the alarm was set. But let me blame it on me and not the product.This alarm can set duo settings which is great and has several other features on it. So if two people need to get up at different times, you can actually use one alarm clock.
