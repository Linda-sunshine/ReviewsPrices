review/summary: Must have for singlesreview/text: I bought this as a gift for a single man. When visiting him, he used this daily. He used it from everything to making marinades for the barbeque (something I'd never thought of), to chopping onions, tomatoes, chiles and avocados for guacamole, as well as for everything else. In fact, everything he did with this cut the time down to nothing. It made me think about all the time I spend cutting everything.It is a very small food processor, and that's the beauty of it. So little to clean, and very easy and quick to clean - a few seconds and you're done. A man's dream come true, packed with a lot of power to boot. I want one myself now, for chopping sauteed veggie additives, such as onion, celery, etc. Don't know how well it would handle carrots, as I didn't experience that. But, I did experience the miraculous, time saving benefits of adding those special touches to dishes that I tend to skip now due to laborious cutting of flavor enhancing ingredients. Truth be told, this is a must have, and I want one.
