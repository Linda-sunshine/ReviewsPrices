review/summary: Excellent heater, heats more square footage than advertisedreview/text: I was cold and miserable in my new house - this heater really changed everything for me. The oscillating fan function combined with the max heat setting allowed me to heat my large living room and large kitchen. I don't need to wear a jacket inside, and it hasn't hurt my heating bill too much - before I was using my electric wall heater in my bedroom to heat the living room and kitchen, so this is probably a far more efficient solution. I was expecting it to heat only right around my couch, but it really warms up the whole house. I leave it going all the time, for a few months now - so far so good.
