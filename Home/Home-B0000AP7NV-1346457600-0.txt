review/summary: ok but smaller than we expectedreview/text: If I knew of the size, I would have gotten a bigger one. Its just a little hard to lift it off with one hand sometimes for me. I like it. There water doesn't smell or anything. Just wash it like 10 times and let the water run through the filter thing before you drink from it. And also before that you have to drown the filter thingy like 20 mins in cold water to make sure you don't really drink the chemicals or whatever which keeps it from drying. Get it if you want it for yourself or for daily use for upto 2 people.
