review/summary: Glorified dust mopreview/text: This is a 3 star dust mop and 2 star vacuum. Having hard wood floors led me to believe I could get away with a vacuum on the low end of the price scale, and while with extra effort this machine can get the job done it really is only good for dust bunnies and pet hair. Anything heavier than a dust ball gets spit out the rear due to the spinning brush and in order to get it up you have to hit the material just right or it just kicks it out. Sand, cereal, pet food the suction just isn't there so if your idea of easy clean up for your hardwood involves a quick vacuum and a wet swif this machine will add a lot of time and effort to that process.
