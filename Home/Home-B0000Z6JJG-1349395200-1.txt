review/summary: not what I expectedreview/text: I purchased the salad shooter primarily to shred lettuce. The lettuce becomes mushy even when fresh lettuce is used. I have returned to shredding the lettuce with my hands and a knife. I also found that it did not work well for celery as it clogs up and does not always give nice slices.
