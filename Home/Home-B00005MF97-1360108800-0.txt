review/summary: Great to use.review/text: This product has saved my husband's life. I had surgery in my right shoulder and it is difficult for me to scramble eggs for an omelet or tuna for a sandwich. Easy to make my own dressing. I love the product. Very easy to use. Easy to clean. Highly recommend it.
