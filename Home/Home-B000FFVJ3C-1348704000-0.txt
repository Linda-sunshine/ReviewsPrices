review/summary: Great dehydratorreview/text: I purchased this dehydrator for the main purpose of making dog treats. I have used it for sweet potatoes and carrots and it works great and fast. I have already saved enough money in 3 months not having to pay ridiculous store prices for treats to pay for this dehydrator. I now also know what exactly I am giving my dog and that they are safe. He loves the homemade treats. I am trying chicken next. This particular model also comes with everything you need, including fruit roll up sheets, jerky seasoning, and the trays for small items so they don't fall through the grates. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I wish it had an off/on switch. You have to unplug it to turn it off and my outlet is not the easiest to access. It is a little noisy but not bad.
