review/summary: Tiny!review/text: I knew it was a smaller rice cooker, but I didn't expect it to be that tiny! Its great though.. I love how it sings to you when you make rice, and sings when rice is done. You can change this, but I like it. Its perfect for my boyfriend and I.. but if you have more than 3 people to feed you'll need to make multiple pots of rice. I'd suggest the bigger size if you eat a lot or entertain a lot. I really like that it has a portable handle, and that it has a rubber rim that seals the rice in. The reason I give it 4 stars is because it isn't clear on how to make the different kinds of rice.If you use the 'fingertip' of water above the rice, like you do in most med. rice cookers.. it still works in this small one. I recommend!
