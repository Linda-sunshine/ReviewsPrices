review/summary: Breville da bomb!review/text: I just moved across country, leaving most of my stuff in storage. But I have found that I can't LIVE without my Breville Juice Fountain... so I just ordered another... so now I have one for Arizona and one for New York. I juiced hundreds of pounds of prickly pear fruit to make jelly and this machine lasts forever. It's very easy to clean once you get the hang of it. I've experimented with different combinations. My favorite is carrot/pear/beets/ginger/pineapple/cilantro!
