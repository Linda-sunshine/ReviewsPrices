review/summary: Great lightweight vacuum!review/text: I've been using this vacuum a few times a week for a little over a month and love it so far! I go straight from my rugs to hardwood floors without any adjustments which is nice. I admit I never thought such a tiny affordable vacuum would do such a good job but I am impressed so far.It's amazingly lightweight, great if you have to go up and down stairs. I have 2 short hair dogs and this has handled the task better than the full size vacuums I've had. Though one of them ate the attachment piece the day it came out of the box so I wouldn't know how well that works...5/5 would recommend to a friend!
