review/summary: Jan 2013 review - Chair is easy to put togetherreview/text: The bad: The arm rests were NOT brand new. They weren't wrapped in plastic AND they both had scratches on them. I think they were used as a floor model.The good: All that said, the chair was real easy to put together and feels comfortable. The seat is ok. It's not the most comfortable office chair seat but it's ok.For the money, this is a good deal. I'd definitely recommend.
