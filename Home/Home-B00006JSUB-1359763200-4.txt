review/summary: Great Value-Right size!review/text: Lodge Logic has a good reputation for their cast iron products. We have a wood stove and I was looking for cast iron products that we could use if there was a power outage of some kind. I'm guessing the &#34;pre-seasoned&#34; process of these items are done in mass production. I will have to season it again as there are some bare spots around the rim. No biggie though, The shipping was free and arrived in two days. (prime member) I'm sure I'll be using this for years to come.
