review/summary: Great if you plan to only use it a few times...review/text: So let's be serious- most of you will receive this stick blender, think it is such a neat little gadget, and that it will make you a smoothie/soup making wiz, use it twice and shove it in a drawer or cabinet somewhere to be forgotten until your next yard sale. If you're one of those people, this product is for you! But if you are actually going to use this on a regular basis, buy something else.We're on our second one right now, and it was dead quicker than the last one, which lasted about three weeks. If you check out the customer photos, we had the same problem as Juan Chow- the plastic part melts and erodes and then the blade just can't spin! You can mess with it, pop it in and out and try to get another use out of it but watch your fingers! It would be a simple enough fix, Cuisinart would just need to replace a really cheap plastic part with the metal equivalent. If they did that, this thing could be an heirloom. The blade is really sharp and for the first couple uses when it does work, it's lovely.Also, Cuisinart will replace this faulty product, but you better be willing to shell out slightly less than the cost of a new one to have it shipped to you (why did I even take the time to register it?). Amazon was much better about replacing it and shipping it for free (although they did notify the person who gave it to us as a gift... lame). We'll be giving them a call to see what we can do about credit to purchase a different blender, or else just getting on some sort of frequent replacement list so they can send us a new one every two weeks.
