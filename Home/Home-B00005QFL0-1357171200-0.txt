review/summary: SD-YD250review/text: This is my 3rd Panasonic Breadmaker. My fisrt unit made suberb bread. It got old (about 18 yrs old) and quit working. replaced it with a SD-YD250. The bread not quit as good but good. It fell off the counter top and broke. Had this one for several weeks. Again Good bread but not as good as the first unit. It was a different model. I sure its not made any longer.
