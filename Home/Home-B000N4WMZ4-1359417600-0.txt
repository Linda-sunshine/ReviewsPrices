review/summary: Beautifulreview/text: This is a really wonderful dutch oven. The color is very beautiful. This is much less pricey option than the ones by Le Creuset. I've cooked many stews and soups in this and it is a really great and sturdy pot. Very easy to clean the inside. My only complaint about this pot is that it is very heavy, but then again, a dutch oven is expected to be heavy.
