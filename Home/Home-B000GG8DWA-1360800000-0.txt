review/summary: Good Heaterreview/text: This is a very good space heater. Others have commented that it takes a while to warm up, but I don't think it's any slower than other infrared heaters. I put it on high first thing to warm up my office and then set it on low and it maintains the temperature very well.This is heater is not for a huge space. It does very well for my office which is about 10 ft x 15 ft. For me it was worth buying.
