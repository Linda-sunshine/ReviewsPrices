review/summary: stop perkingreview/text: I guess the general opinion is they don't make things like they use to. I have had to purchase 2 12-c percoators in the last year for the same problem. They start perking and after 3 minutes they stop, eventhough I make sure the disc on the stem is loose when I plug it in. Because of this problem, I will not buy another Farberware. Has anyone experienced this same problem?
