review/summary: Good, not greatreview/text: This product arrived on time but was very dirty. The inside had a bunch of the black particles in it so I ran it through the dishwasher. The grime came off but it was a little concerning at first. The filter monitor at the top doesn't work at all, but I can live without it. Finally, the top doesn't stay on tight and you need to hold it down while pouring. On the plus side, I rarely have to fill it up compared to the 6-cup pitcher I had before and I love the orange color!
