review/summary: Wonderful productreview/text: I had this in my wishlist & received it for Christmas. I've used it several times & I love it. Its smaller than the one I had previously but that is perfect for us. Only 3 at home anymore.I love that this is made of stainless steel. The insert is still made of aluminum which Im not thrilled about but I dont have to use it if I dont want to.This pressure cooker is also a lot quieter than my old one is. I appreciate that a LOT!Its a great product and Im so happy to have it.
