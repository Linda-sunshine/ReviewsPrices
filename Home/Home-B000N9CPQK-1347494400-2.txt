review/summary: excellentreview/text: It is a great purchase for the price and is a huge help with my allergies. I'm allergic to all of my animals and I live on a dirt road so it's also helping to keep the dust under control. I have bought 2 already and plan on buying 2 more before the end of the year. Reading prior reviews and customer issues on this product helped me to decide this was what I wanted. It is a little loud when it is on high but I keep them all on low settings and it is just a quiet hum now that I'm used to and don't even notice anymore.
