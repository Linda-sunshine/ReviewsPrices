review/summary: Not as advertisedreview/text: VERY disappointed. I have purchased many remanufactured items in the pastand have never been unhappy, never - until now.There is no gold filter. I have read and re-read the description by Abe's and havefound nothing that states the remanufactured item includes anything lessthan the new item.The coffee maker lid has fine scratches on it as well as the area around thefilter opening. There is a dent (albeit very small) on the front of themachine. I suppose that I can accept the cosmetic condition even though Ihave never received a remanufactured item that didn't appear new. The carafelooks new.Now the part that REALLY bothers me - I ran a pot of clean water through themachine as I have always done with any coffee maker that I have purchased inthe past. What I didn't get was a carafe of clean water. What I did get wasa carafe with a lot of white calcium deposits. I ran a cycle through withvinegar and water to remove the remainder of the calcium from the coffeemaker. In addition to white flakes there were also some brown flakes ofunknown substance. Perhaps somone reheated their coffee by running it backthrough the machine. This machine is replacing a DCC-1200 that was purchasednew about six or seven years ago. It finally died. There were no deposits ofany kind after running the initial pot of water through it upon purchase,norhas there ever been with any coffee maker in the past. I definatelyconsider this product "used" and not "remanufactured". The seller will issuea refund, but I have to pay to have the coffee maker sent to him. Cuisinartwill replace the machine, but in addition to the expense of sending it to them,they want $10.00 to sent the replacement to me.
