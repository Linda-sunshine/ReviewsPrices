review/summary: Very convenientreview/text: I decided to purchase a carpet cleaner because, if left to my own devices, I would never go to the store to rent one. This device is much lighter than the commercial models you'd rent at the store, and relatively easy to use. Unfortunately, the lightweight plastic construction, in my opinion, gives this cleaner a cheap or flimsy feeling. While it may feel fragile, I have yet to experience any issues operating it apart from an improperly seated waste water container, that while easy to fix, briefly impaired my operation of the device. A good selection of attachments are included with the device. My one complaint is that the clear plastic screen in front is screwed on, and to clean it you either need to unscrew it or fish out whatever is in there with a plastic stick they included in the packaging, which is either inconvenient or, quite frankly, a disgusting experience.Not sure why it is called a steamvac, as it clearly lacks any sort of heating element.
