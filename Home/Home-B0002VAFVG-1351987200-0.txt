review/summary: BEST JUICER I HAVE EVER OWNED!review/text: After juicing for years and years, I pretty much stopped after I retired - mostly because I grew too lazy to go through all that vegetable chopping beforehand and all the messy and time consuming cleanup afterwards.I finally decided to get a new juicer and researched every one out there for about the last 7 or 8 months. I settled on the Breville 800JEXL because it had outstanding reviews, had stainless steel parts that fit all together, included a form fitting large pitcher and the bonus was that it looked great.I can now honestly say, after having my juicer for a couple of months now, that this is the BEST JUICER I have ever owned - and I have owned an Omega, Jack LaLanne, Acme and even a Kitchenaid (yes they used to make centrifugal juicers and mine lasted me for YEARS.)This juicer is not only phenomenally fast, but there is NO problem with parsley - which often can just destroy a less powerful juicer - and I find parsley is a key ingredient for providing an energy boost. Also, there is no need to cut up your stuff. I can fit 3 or 4 large carrots at a time, a whole apple or pear at a time, and 4 stalks of celery at a time. Also I like the way it has two speeds - 1 for soft stuff like grapes and another for hard stuff like carrots. By far, however, the determining factor for me is the cleanup. The way this juicer is made - all stainless steel and well designed - cleanup takes only a minute or two. The design of the strainer and the supplied cleaning brush is such that cleaning the strainer takes only a few seconds under running water. There is no more trying to rinse out all that pulp that just will not wash out of the extractor of every other centrifugal juicer I have ever owned.You will not regret buying this juicer. If you do, you can only be one of those people who has to find a flaw with even the most perfect thing.
