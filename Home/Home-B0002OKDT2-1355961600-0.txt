review/summary: Oopsreview/text: Just received juicer. No sign of the juicer screen. Can't be used to juice without this part. And instructions say it needs to be put together to use the machine. There were 18 parts in box and screen was nowhere to be seen. Checked trash and wrapping in case I missed it. Checked parts list and illustrations to see if I was reading it wrong. Tried calling their customer service: waited 11 minutes on hold then they dropped call. Called again left message, no call back. Called again they answered but dropped call again. Called again. Agent couldn't hear me, I hung up and tried again. Talked to agent who advised me that they ship part already assembled hidden in mechanism contrary to illustration in instructions. She advised me to take machine apart to see if missing part was already inside. It was. Lots of needless worry. Just posting this in case some other old fart has similar problem to save them from going through the same hassle. Love the juicer. Wish their instructions matched up with the way they ship it. Wished their phones worked.
