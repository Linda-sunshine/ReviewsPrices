review/summary: Better then imaginedreview/text: I read a lot of reviews before deciding to purchase this handy little tool. I was looking for a meat grinder and sausage stuffer. This little plastic Norpro did the trick! We ground 6 pounds of meat and fat in no time with no problems. I was concerned that we might have trouble with some sinew as I was not 100 percent during my meat prep. Not even 1 time did we have to stop and disassemble to clean out the grinder. My sausage came out the perfect consistency, we used the smaller of the 2 plates and when we used the stuffer tube it performed flawlessly, making a nice even sausage. My only complaint is that the sausage stuffer tube is too small to make Brats.
