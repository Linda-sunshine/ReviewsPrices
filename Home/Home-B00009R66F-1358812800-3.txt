review/summary: Good Machinereview/text: This machine works good. The hose for furniture and stairs doesn't stay attached all the time which I think keeps it from getting plugged up. I had one that the hose was always attached and every time I went to use it, it had to be unplugged. I like this design better and it cleans well.
