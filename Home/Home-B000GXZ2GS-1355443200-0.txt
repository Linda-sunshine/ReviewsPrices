review/summary: Overhyped and Overratedreview/text: I bought this product based on the ENORMOUSLY HIGH 5-star reviews, but honestly, this isnt all that it as lived up to be. Turst me, I WANTED to like this thing, but I bought an "Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker" and it is BY FAR a better expresso maker. I even compared both products at the same time and the aeropress is not as good.I wont be using the AeroPress anymore, and will be using the Bialetti 6800 expresso maker.I am kind of worried that this AeroPress has too many "FALSE RATINGS" aka I think people were hired to give the AeroPress 5 star reviews......
