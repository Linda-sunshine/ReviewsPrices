review/summary: Seems Accurate But Hard to Readreview/text: We have no way of knowing if this scale is accurate, but it's consistent. However, my husband finds the liquid-crystal display hard to read. The figures are big enough, but they're black on a dark gray background and not illuminated. I invited him to replace this scale with one of his own choosing, but I think he secretly likes being able to see right through the scale to the floor.
