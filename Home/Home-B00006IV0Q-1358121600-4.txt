review/summary: Fantastic!review/text: This is a great coffee pot. After reading all of the reviews I selected Presto because it received the best overall rating. Someone said that the coffee basket holes got clogged, but if you use paper filters it is not going to be a problem. The coffee pot is well constructed and has a &#8216;heft&#8217; to it. The fact that it is made in China was a concern of mine, only because of so many crappy things coming out of that country. Apparently the Presto people have insured that the Chinese manufactures of their products adhere to Presto&#8217;s high quality standard in manufacturing. I was replacing my Farberware coffee pot and even considered getting another one, but the reviews were so poor so I took a chance and went for the Presto. I am glad I did.
