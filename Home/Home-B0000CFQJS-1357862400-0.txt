review/summary: Works great and replaces messy paper filtersreview/text: I was skeptical about using a permanent filter in lieu of the paper filter, but this works great. Less mess and easy to clean. And I think it even makes better coffee. Seriously, the coffee tastes better through this filter than through the paper filters.
