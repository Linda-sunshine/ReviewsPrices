review/summary: LOVE IT!!!!!!!review/text: I finally decided to replace my Welbilt and I am soooooo glad I did. This machine works very well. Bakes beautiful loafs of bread. Not sure why the complaints about the beeper, it not that bad, it does what it is suppose to do, alert you of it's status. I definitely recommend it.
