review/summary: After Almost 3 years, it caught fire!review/text: I LOVE this steamer, here's my guarantee that the darn thing kicks butt, but here's the small fault. it started a small smokey fire this afternoon inside it's white shell in the circuit boards...luckily i had spray water available (was ironing a shirt) and was able to put it out quickly. I'd give this steamer 5 stars, but it tried to end my life today after ~3 years of loyalty...amazon made true with their EXCELLENT customer service as usual, and are sending me a new one...AFTER 3 years! now that is customer service.
