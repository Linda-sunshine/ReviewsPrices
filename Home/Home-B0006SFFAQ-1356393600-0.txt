review/summary: Cuisinart 12 Cup Coffee Potreview/text: I waited to get a white coffee pot, at more money than the black, and it turned out to be more of a gray pot. The clockon the pot can not be seen and I'm not sure if it's supposed to be that way or if there is supposed to be a light in it to make it be seen. It is not important enough for me to go to the trouble of returning it. Also, I do not like the small pouring area in it. You have to be very steady not to drip the water when filling it. It is fast and makes good coffee and for that I am grateful.
