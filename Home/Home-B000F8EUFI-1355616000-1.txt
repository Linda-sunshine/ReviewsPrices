review/summary: Won't even suck up Cheerios on tile floorsreview/text: This vacuum does not have a lot of power at all. I have all tile floors and feel I have to go really slow so it picks everything up. My one year old spilled Cheerios and when trying to vacuum them up, the vacuum wasn't powerful enough to suck them up. I was left with smashed up Cheerios on the floor instead. It is very light-weight and compact, but it needs a few more amps of power to actually clean. I've owned this vacuum for 6 months and still use the broom to sweep up whats left behind.
