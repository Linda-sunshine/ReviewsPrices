review/summary: Pleasedreview/text: The good: Good coating, very stick-resistant. I've had it over a year, use it often, and the coating doesn't seem to have worn off at all ( I never use metal utensils). The pan has a fairly solid construction (not quite enough to prevent warping, see below), especially for its price.The not so bueno: No big complaints. Slight warping when heated; eggs tend to slide from the center to the outside.The gimmicky: The thermo-spot hot indicator is pretty useless. It works, I suppose, but who really needs it?
