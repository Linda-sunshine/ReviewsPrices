review/summary: High Tech Openerreview/text: The opener is Sturdy -- seems like it will work forever. It feels good -- the handles are comfortable; the knob is easy to turn. The opener seems well worth the price (about $10 more than one you can get at your friendly neighborhood supermarket). Only minor issue is not being able to put it in the dishwasher.
