review/summary: Greatest Ironreview/text: This iron is awesome! I have always used the old fashioned black handled black and decker and switched to this lighter weight one and absolutely love it. It's nice because sometimes when I am in the middle of ironing and forget and go about my business with other things it shuts off by itself...it has enough different settings too that you can be precise with the temp.
