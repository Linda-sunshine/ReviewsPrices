review/summary: Great hand-held vacuum at a good pricereview/text: Needed a hand-held vacuum that would work well for the stairs and this one seemed to fit the bill.Pros:Long cordRotating cover so you can vacuum horizontal or verticalStrong vacuum - I am always amazed how much it picks upCrevice tool on vacuumEasy to emptyCons:The dust cup is difficult to clean. It seems to be made of some sort of material that acts like velcro and when you go to empty the dust cup, it seems everything is stuck to the filter so you have to shake, scrape and wack the filter to get the dirt off. BUT this is my only complaint. I think you can wash the filters if they get too dirty. You can also buy replacement filters for $7.50.Overall this is a great hand-vac. Very powerful and has some great extra features that other hand vacs don't have. And for the price, you can't beat it! I highly recommend this hand vac.
