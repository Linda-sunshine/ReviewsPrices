review/summary: Love my Keurig!review/text: To be honest, I was on the fence about buying a Keurig. I had heard a lot of good things, but I wasn't sure the coffee would be quite as good as what I am used to. I am so glad that I went for it! I am having so much fun with this machine! Not only does the coffee taste great, but every morning I look forward to choosing a different flavor of coffee. I have also used it to make hot chocolate and tea and everything tastes just as good. It was incredibly easy to set up and the whole process of making coffee takes about 20 seconds! My Keurig is my favorite new appliance!
