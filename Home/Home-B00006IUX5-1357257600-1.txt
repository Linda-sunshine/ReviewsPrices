review/summary: Good grinder, will buy again when this one diesreview/text: I've had this coffee grinder for almost a year now and am very happy with it.It's true that it only has one speed, so if you need to vary the grinding time depending on how fine you want your coffee. Also, it helps to tilt it or shake it mildly while grinding to get a uniform grind throughout. People are complaining a lot about this grinder, but I haven't had any problems except the plastic button used to start the grinder came unglued from the cover once. Nothing a little gorilla glue couldn't fix.Wipe it down with a barely-damp cloth after use....
