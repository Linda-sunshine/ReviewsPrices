review/summary: Not bad, not great.review/text: I bought this to temporarily replace my electric coffee maker and then to use when we were camping. It makes an "ok" cup of press coffee, but always seems to let a ton of grounds in. It does keep the coffee kind of warm out in the wild, but not as hot as I was expecting. meh.
