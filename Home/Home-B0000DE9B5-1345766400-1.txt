review/summary: Great pitcher and lid does work!review/text: Very happy indeed with this purchase. Just what I wanted to fit in the fridge door, glass, and it arrived intact.I was reading suggestions about the lid's operation and thought I was doing it right, but was still stumped until I got to "The Secret" shared by the helpful reviewer who wrote:>>Simply hold the edge of the lid to keep it from turning. With the other hand, rotate the plastic handle clockwise until the lid seals. "THE SECRET": There is a point of resistance where you need a little extra force to get past the raised, instructional arrows on the lid.>>Now that's figured out, I will be ordering another one.
