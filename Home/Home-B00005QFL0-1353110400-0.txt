review/summary: EXCELLENT FRENCH BREAD!review/text: UPDATE: This unit flat out died on the 30th day after purchase. Well, by die I mean it quit making proper bread. Instead it turned out hollow loaves, or flat loaves of cooked goop - but not bread. Luckily, Amazon promptly and cheerfully replaced it, so we have high hopes it was a glitch.PRIOR REVIEW: We have used this product twice a day since we received it. We have only made French Bread, which has earned rave reviews from everyone who has tried it. Like all bread machines, the loaf is a funny shape, but we cut it horizontally first and end up with two loaves, both with lots of crust which is the point with French Bread! The Yeast Holder is a good idea: no worries about the yeast going wrong as it sits, waiting to start cooking in the middle of the night (French Bread takes six hours, so you've got to plan ahead to have fresh hot bread for breakfast or dinner.) However, the recipe is simple and the results worth it.
