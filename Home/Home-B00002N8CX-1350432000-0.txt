review/summary: Pretty good overall, very good for the pricereview/text: The Eureka Mighty Mite is made in China.I bought mine from Amazon in September 2011, so just over a year ago. It has very good suction, and it is cheap. The attachments aren't very effective, but overall, it is a pretty good vacuum. I have a golden retriever, so the vacuum is a little overmatched, but considering it is about $60, I have no complaints whatsoever.I did just buy a more expensive vacuum, which is much better. Mighty Mite is now my teams backup QB. I hope I don't need to use him, but I am confident that if our number 1 goes down with an injury the Mighty Mite knows the playbook, and can perform capably under center.Go Bears!
