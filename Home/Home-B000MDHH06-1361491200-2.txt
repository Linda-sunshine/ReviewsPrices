review/summary: Great Juicerreview/text: It works great. I tried to make 2 pitchers of juice and I think it made the metal filter clog. Lesson learned for me: wash the filter between each pitcher filled. Also, there were some chunks of fruit/veggies that didn't get juiced. I just took them out and sent them back through the juicer.
