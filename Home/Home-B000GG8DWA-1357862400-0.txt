review/summary: Fine, except for the terrible switch.review/text: This product does what it claims to except that the switch has the worst possible design. It's a dial which rotates freely. By that, I mean that it doesn't stop on one end, it just continually rotates in either direction, with no stop. Furthermore, the SIX dial markings are &#34;800W OFF 800W 400W OFF 400W&#34; in that order. So, the OFFs are across from each other, but each 800 is across from a 400 and vice versa. It makes no sense. You have to turn on a light to see what you're doing, so it takes away from the safety and convenience of the heater.
