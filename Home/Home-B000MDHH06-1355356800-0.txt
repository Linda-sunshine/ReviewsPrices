review/summary: Simple to use, clean, store and transport.review/text: I take mine to work and juice at work and this is just perfect for that. I transport it in a cloth shopping bag and everything fits perfectly. It's super easy to use, to clean (most just soak a couple minutes in hot soapy water, everything comes right off. The blade/filter requires a few extra moments of effort to properly clean, still not &#34;hard&#34; to clean.
