review/summary: Finally a can opener that my wife can use !!!review/text: After trying virtually every can opener ever made, and even resorting to using my Swiss Army Knife, and a P-38 (works, but slow and tedious), this OXO can opener is a dream !!!!. Smooth, easy to hold, and easy to turn the handle. Initial order of this item was never shipped, and I did have to wade through many web pages to find out how to contact Amazon customer service - they should put contact information in a more obvious spot. But when I finally talked to a rep, they overnighted a no charge replacement for the missing one.
