review/summary: Great for storagereview/text: I love these plastic storage caps for my canning jars. I use them for storing items in the pantry or the fridge. It is nice to have a lid that isn't two parts sometimes - much easier to remove and put back on. They also hold up well in the dishwasher in my experience. Metal lids and bands can rust, but these won't.
