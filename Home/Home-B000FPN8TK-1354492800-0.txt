review/summary: easy/great for fresh coffee at workreview/text: This works great! I use if for COFFEE when at work. WE don't have a coffeemaker, so I just use ground coffee in this baby & pour over water boiled in the microwave in my mug. I let it steep & it works just like a FRENCH PRESS. The stainless strainer doesn't let any coffee through & NO pouring; just sit it on your cup & bam! Delicious & simple; blows instant coffee away. A little pesky to clean, but a fresh cup of coffee is worth it!!
