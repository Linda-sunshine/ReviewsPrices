review/summary: Splendid Commercial Quality Mixerreview/text: This is my second Kitchenaid stand mixer. The first one (a tilt head before the Artisan series came out) must have been depressed; It walked off the counter mixing a bread dough when I went to pee. These are made very well but not THAT well. It took a coffee grinder with it on the way down. But I digress.If you have never owned a Kitchenaid Stand Mixer before, you are in for a real treat. The quality is just superb.First things first. The bowl lifter is infinitely better (in my opinion) because you can leave the mixer against the wall. The tilt head requires that you pull it out to clear the cabinet overhang. The bowl is wider and squatter than the tilt-head models which is a plus. Without the bowl retainer on the tilt-head models, the base is much easier to clean.They improved the bread hook. The old wire hanger type that caused my last machine to walk away has been replaced with a spiral kneeder which replicates hand kneeding. I make water bagels and pizza frequently using bread flour and this does a terrific job. I grind all of my own meat at well so the extra power comes in handy. Of course, it also turns out a delicate angel food cake. By the way, just to be clear, while this is commercial quality. It is not a commercial mixer with a commercial warranty.One tip. There is one exposed screw on the back of the lifter that fine tunes the blade clearance. Check it in the instruction manual and adjust before first use.
