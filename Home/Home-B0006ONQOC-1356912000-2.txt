review/summary: Like it much better than we thoughtreview/text: We were skeptical when we received this as a gift, but the difference between fresh ice cream and even the best from the store is greater than we thought. Will make enough for 12-16 good servings, so two or three batches are enough for a good-sized party. On the other hand, we can make a pint at a time when we're just having dinner for four.
