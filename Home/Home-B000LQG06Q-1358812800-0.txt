review/summary: Great topperreview/text: Good value. I replaced an aging 3&#34; topper that was 15 years old. The 2&#34; is more than enough. I recommend buying the bag or cover for these. I used the one I already had. I aired mine our to 3 days and It could have used more time. The smell is not too bad sort of like peppermint toothpaste. Feels wonderful to sleep on.
