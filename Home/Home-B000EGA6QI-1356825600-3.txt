review/summary: No replacement partsreview/text: Things break when they are used. These days, manufacturers seem to want you to buy another copy or upgrade when the smallest plastic thingy cracks or goes wrong. That's not environmentally sustainable, and manufacturers need to accept responsibility for the life cycle of their products.We owned a CSB-76 for just about a year, when the plastic base cracked. We are out of luck. Not only can you not get a replacement plastic housing, you cannot get a complete replacement mixing stick, but have to re-purchase the motor and everything. What would happen if the blades dulled?We are getting another hand blender, but we will be sure it has replacement parts first, and it WILL NOT BE A CUISINART.
