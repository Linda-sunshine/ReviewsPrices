review/summary: I love my Keurig! My days of cleaning coffeepots are OVER!review/text: Let me start by saying I HATED cleaning my coffeepot . . . I'm the only one who drinks coffee, and I make it before work, so it was usually not done brewing when I would pour & go. By the time I got home it had sat there all day and was nasty. My wife wouldn't do it (reasonably) since she doesn't drink coffee.For this reason I had slowly migrated to buying coffee on the way to work, and spending $2-3 or more per day for a decent cup.Enter the Keurig . . . brewing takes less than 60 seconds, right into my travel mug, and no mess to clean up! I buy Starbucks and Green Mountain Extra Bold flavors, plus some others for variety, and my coffee tastes WAY better than the stuff I would make in my old pot . . for about 50 cents a cup (even Starbucks is this cheap if you buy large boxes.)If you are like me and you buy coffee from Starbucks, Caribou, Tim Hortons, Dunkin', etc. every day, and you want to save money, then a Keurig brewer is a great investment which will pay off in just a few months.And it's nice when you have company as you can offer each guest whatever kind of coffee they like. I have the 30-cup carousel and we keep several flavors on hand for those occasions . . . it's fun!The only people who should not get a Keurig, are those who always brew at home with a traditional pot and drink it all, or those who grind your own coffee for the flavor. If you are one of them, then this machine is probably not for you, as there's no real cost or time advantage vs. those methods.
