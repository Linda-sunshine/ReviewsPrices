review/summary: See review below...review/text: It does a good job of keeping the coffee hot, but the pilot light is hidden behind the cup and it's too easy to pick up the last cup and not notice that the light's still on...and heat's being made. Or you can just leave the cup on the warmer with the heat on over the weekend for a Monday morning surprise. The light should be diametrically opposite the electric cord.
