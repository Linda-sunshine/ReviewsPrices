review/summary: Cover is bulky and hard to cleanreview/text: I purchased a 7-cup version of this about a year ago. I recently bought the 9-cup and found that Cuisinart no longer includes the basic cover, which is what I used with the smaller unit 99.9 percent of the time. The cover shown in the photo comes in 3-parts, stands a lot taller than the basic cover and has nooks and crannies that are hard to clean and dry. The functionality of the food processor is still good but the cover is a pain.
