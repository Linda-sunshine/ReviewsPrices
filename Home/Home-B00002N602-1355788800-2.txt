review/summary: Love it!review/text: My Mom had one that used to scare me to death. That hissing vent reminded me of ticking bomb. This does the same sound, but it has safety features my Mom's didn't have. Heats up very fast and does the job lickety-split! Going to be great for this summer since it gets too hot in here to bake. I can cook a chicken in 2/3rds less the time! There is no psi meter, but Mom's didn't either and it didn't matter. Definitely reaches 15psi. I do have to keep an eye on it as sometimes I have to adjust the heat depending on the contents. But since it doesn't take that long, it isn't much of an issue.
