review/summary: pizzareview/text: Recieved pizzazz pizza maker on time and in good shape. Have had one for 10 years myself and purchased this for my daughter. She had one for 10 years also but used hers more than I did and it finally died. I'm sure she will love a new one again. It cooks faster than any other pizza maker that we've tried and no mess, no long wait and can store away easily,GREAT!!!!!!
