review/summary: Works great - looks goodreview/text: Works very well with big and small cans. Love the removable &#34;works&#34; section for easy cleaning. The locking feature is new for me (last new can opener was 30 years ago) and it is nice. You get it started and can walk away. When finished, it holds the can in place until you want it. Magnet grabs every lid I've tried so far. Don't know what else I'd like as far as functionality.Only downside is that the the silver plastic is plastic. It if was metal, this would be the best looking can opener. Since it is plastic, it is good looking but not great looking on the counter in a stainless kitchen.
