review/summary: easy to use and quick, but very wastefulreview/text: ProsThis is very easy to usefeeding stuff in is much faster than with auger type juicersit is fairly easy to cleanConsit wastes a lot of juice leaving it in the pulpI feed greens, fruits and vegetables in and got about 3.5 cups of juiceI then fed the pulp in to an auger type juicer and got another 2 cups of juiceNormally when I use an auger juicer with the same amount of stuff, I get about 5 cups of juiceThe only advantage to this juicer is that it takes a little less than half the time to process everything.So now I regularly use this first since i own it already. This step makes it really easy then to feed the better juicer. The overall time is about the same, but it takes a lot less effort.However I wouldn't normally recommend that anyone buy both because of the cost.
