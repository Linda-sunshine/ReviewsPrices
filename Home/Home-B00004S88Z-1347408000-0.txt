review/summary: This beauty is going to last several lifetimes! Works like a champ too!review/text: Does the All American cost more than Presto? Yes. Is it worth the extra price? Absolutely. This unit is made to last and work for generations. Ease of operation, the security of a metal to metal seal... why buy a cheap Chinese made Presto that won't last through 2 seasons when you can pay a little extra for an heirloom quality tool you'll love to use.
