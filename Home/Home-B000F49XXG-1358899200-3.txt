review/summary: DE'LONGHI EC155 BAR PUMP ESPRESSO AND CAPPUCCINO MAKERreview/text: THIS THING REALLY WORKS. I'VE HAD FOUR (4) OTHER ESPRESSO MAKERS AND I COULD NEVER GET THE MACHINETO MAKE THE LA CREME (BROWNISH FOAM). I TRIED ALL KINDS AND GRINDS (EXTRA-FINE TO COURSE), 5# TO 30#OF PRESSURE TAMPING THE GROUND COFFEE IN THE HOLDER, NOTHING WORKED....FINALLY: THE &#34;SECRET&#34; MUST BE IN THE PLASTIC CHECK VALVE IN THE BOTTEM OF THE GROUND COFFEE HOLDER... (DE'LONGHI).I USE EITHER FINE OR EXTRA FINE GRIND FROM MY (COMPREMO) CONICAL CONE COFFEE GRINDER..$35, 2% ORGANIC MILK, R.O. WATER, NEVER TAP WATER...AND ABOUT #30 OF PRESSURE WITH A METAL ($6) TAMPER, AND COSTCO ESPESSO COFFEE.
