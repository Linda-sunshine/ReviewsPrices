review/summary: buy the lid as well & be cautious about rust, but it's greatreview/text: I love this pan and use it frequently. I don't have issues with maintaining the season or with the heating up time, etc. I wish i had a good lid for it, and i rusted it very slightly on the bottom trying to clean it over just a few hours, but that's easy to fix. I recommend this item.
