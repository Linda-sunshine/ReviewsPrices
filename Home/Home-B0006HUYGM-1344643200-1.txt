review/summary: Powerful Little Handheld...review/text: Since my Oreck vac doesn't have a hose extension, I was in desperate need of small vacuum that had a hose and crevice attachment. I got an excellent deal on this vacuum at K-Mart due to someone marking it with the wrong price. I immediately put it to work cleaning 3 fans in my house that were caked in dust. This has excellent suction and I was able to get the job done quickly.After about 20-25 minutes of cleaning fans, I took it outside to clean my patio furniture cushions. I got through two out of four chairs before it overheated and shut itself off. A bit of a bummer, but I've had other machines do this, so it's not the end of the world. If this machine holds it's suction power, than I don't mind it shutting off after 30 minutes. Most of the time I won't be using it near that long anyway.The dust cup removes and empties easily and holds quite a bit. The hose isn't very long, so you will have to hold the vacuum in one hand while cleaning anything that's off the floor, and depending on what your cleaning and how long it takes, the machine can get a bit heavy. Oh, and the cord, which is very long, can be a pain. I kept stepping on it and getting my feet tangled in it...a retractable cord would have been nice, but I'll appreciate the long cord when I'm using this to clean my car.Overall, while its not perfect, I definitely recommend it. It's much more powerful than a handheld DustBuster, but not as big and cumbersome as a full size vacuum with a hose. I'm very happy with this purchase.
