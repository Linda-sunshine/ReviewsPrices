review/summary: Toaster oven reviewreview/text: It's an excellent toaster, it looks good, it's small, compact , it looks modern, but the oven part is too small for most things...only flat items, small pizza, or flat food, not a muffin or small portion of leftovers, The oven is too low for food more than a few inches, so I was disappointed that I can't heat leftovers like I'm used to with a regular toaster oven. So I compromise for the space and the modern look and lose the oven use.
