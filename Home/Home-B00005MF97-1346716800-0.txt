review/summary: You get what you pay for.review/text: Don't bother trying to save money on this food processor. I used it twice, and as I was trying to make an avocado pasta sauce, it just stopped working. There was nothing in the cup that the blades couldn't process, it just seemed like the motor completely gave out. After two uses. Sad, really. Next time, I'll invest the money into a GOOD food processor that won't just die on me.
