review/summary: Love it! Love it! Love it!review/text: I had an electric skillet years ago and forgot how useful they are. This Presto is very large, easily cooks large meals like a Jambalaya and perfect for cooking pancakes or bacon & eggs. Much better product than the Presto I had 30 years ago. I really like cooking without having to clean my cooktop too!
