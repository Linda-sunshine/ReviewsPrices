review/summary: Read warranty closelyreview/text: Came in kitchen this am, half a pot of joe AND a smell of burning wires or plastic.Called cuisinart, you have to pay shipping BOTH WAYS..... So on top of roughly $80 coffee maker, they are wanting $30-$40 to replace it. Very disappointed and won't buy again.
