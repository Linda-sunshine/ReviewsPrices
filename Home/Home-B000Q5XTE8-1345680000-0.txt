review/summary: A perfect replacement.review/text: I replaced a 10+ year old chair with this Mesh/Fabric chair.1) Easy set up and build.2) Comfortable and perfect sizing.3) Nice strong structure.4) Nice movement and wheeling.5) The functions (arm movement, chair height, leaning) is very nice.For a moderate priced chair for hours* of use I would recommend this chair.* I will put it to the test. I am on vacation and will update soon.
