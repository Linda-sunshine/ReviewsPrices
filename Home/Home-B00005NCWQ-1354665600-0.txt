review/summary: Better than expected...review/text: The pot is heavier than I expected... I half expected it to be a cheap coffee pot, but it's not, it's pretty heavy. Nothing wrong with percolated coffee so long as you don't overcook it or leave it boiling for too long, the longer you "cook" it the stronger it gets. The pot keeps the coffee warm for quite awhile. Remove the basket after it's done to keep grounds from getting in the perked coffee, this a trick my parents did 30+ years ago and my grandfather did long before that.
