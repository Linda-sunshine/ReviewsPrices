review/summary: decent price for the itemreview/text: I bought it @ $16.95 for this set on Amazon. W/ tax it was about $20?the opener is quite tall & large compared to several other ones I've seen in store. about the size of an actual bottle of wine. If you don't mind the size, then I guess it's ok.The chiller is very handy. Since we have a wine chiller @ home already, we just use this little chiller as our ice bucket. Very sleek looking.My friend got one from Costco for about $30, it's black, super compact, & does the exact job. Looks a lot nicer to. I guess you get what you pay for. But for the price, I can't complain @ all. It does the job & doesn't look that bad after all.
