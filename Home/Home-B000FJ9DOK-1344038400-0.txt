review/summary: Thermos Deliversreview/text: I purchased this bottle for long (30-50 mile) bike rides in the Midwest summers. I was shooting for something that would be able to keep ice in the liquid for the last portions of the ride to lower core temp and hey, just wet my whistle. I've been very happy with this product after a couple of months of use. I load it up with ice and drink of choice (usually a sport drink) and use it toward the end of my ride. I've always had ice left in the bottle after 2-3 hours.During my first ride the push button release did not cause the lid to flip up which was a little annoying but i think that had to do with the new rubber o-ring. After that ride, the o-ring got wet and no longer "sticks." Once you press the release button the lid flips up to an open hole accessing the contents. This is pretty easy to use and can definitely be done while cycling but i often just transfer the contents to my squeeze bottle. There is a larger version of this bottle and the additional volume would be nice but this size fits well in a standard bike bottle holder.One thing I've noticed is that my standard Al holder has scratched this bottle up substantially. If you want a bottle that's going to resist getting scratched, this may not be your bag. I kind of like the "used" look so that hasn't been a problem and definitely doesn't impact performance. I can't speak much to the ability to drop it in a dishwasher for cleaning as i just wash it out in the sink, let it dry and go on the next ride. The SS interior makes it a rough environment for microbes so it's not liable to grow anything.Net, this is a well made product that delivers on its promises. Buy with confidence if you're in the market.
