review/summary: Perfect misterreview/text: I love this mister. It's durable and works consistently. When the mist started turning more to a stream, i followed the directions (either in the other reviews or elsewhere... i can't remember...) to clean it... and it worked like new. My last mister was glass so i could see the oil level, but i don't miss that transparency as much as i thought i would. It works well and is durable. These days, that's a 5-star product.
