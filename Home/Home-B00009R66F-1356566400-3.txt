review/summary: my wife is thrilled with the resultsreview/text: i bought this for my wife for Christmas after researching many different makes and models. just a moment ago i finished doing all the rugs in the house. was a bit apprehensive about buying this unit being too cheap but the majority of the reviews convinced me to take a chance. super deal...i paid $106.00 and free shipping! no problems putting this together, but for the life of me can't figure out why they included 3 nuts when only two were required. even the list of parts shows three nuts but only two bolts and makes no mention of one included as an extra. anyhow, i used the hoover platinum collection pro cleaner and it worked as well as a regular rug doctor. as long as you treat this with respect and understand it is "plastic" and not expected to withstand the abuse a commercial unit can, you'll be glad that you bought it. it did a very nice job. i suggest that when you drag the cleaner backwards to suck up the solution, drag it VERY SLOWLY. you'll see through the transparent suction nozzle how much better it sucks up the dirty water.
