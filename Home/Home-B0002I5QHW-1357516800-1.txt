review/summary: Not easy to cleanreview/text: I was excited and after the positive reviews of being easy to clean, stays on your counter top, does not slide - great reviews.It does not stick to my counter top (granite, which is very smooth!), I made pasta (which was delicious) but the pasta dough came out in the front and the back and for cleaning I needed a toothpick to get all the dough out, which is now in the drain... Very painful!
