review/summary: I can cook an entire breakfast on thisreview/text: Not only do I love this griddle, but I love the size of it. I can cook a breakfast for a family of 7 in no time. It cleans easy, is dishwasher safe, and has a easy drain tray. I don't mind cooking but I love cooking with devices that make cooking less of a hassle.
