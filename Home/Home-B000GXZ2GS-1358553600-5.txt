review/summary: Great coffeereview/text: This makes really great coffee, one cup at a time. The one cup at a time means it's easy to adjust the strength to your tastes - from espresso to americano, by just adding hot water. Of course, it is a bit more effort to make multiple cups. We have had to make a couple of adjustments from our previous drip coffee maker, but we feel that the coffee is much better.The first is that you can't just pour water in and turn it on - the Aerobie works more like a French Press in that you add pre-heated water, so our hot water kettle now gets a lot more use. The instructions say that a water temperature of 175F makes the best coffee, so we've got our instant-read thermometer in full use as well.The second is that we started off using a drip grind, but had to use about twice the amount of coffee to get an acceptable strength (we like strong coffee). We found that by decreases the grind size to very fine/turkish, we could use the same amount of grounds as we had previously and get a fantastic cup of joe.
