review/summary: Only lasted 18 monthsreview/text: Loved this little vac when I bought it from Amazon in July 2011. I only used it about once a week to spot clean the carpets and hardwoods. Today (Feb 7, 2013), when I started to use it on the carpet, it broke in half just above the power nozzle. I only paid $49.00 for it, so maybe it's asking too much for it to last more than 18 months, but since I didn't use it daily, it's a bit disappointing that it didn't last any longer than it did. Will have to think about whether or not to purchase another one like it.
