review/summary: Fantastic Juicer!review/text: I am new to juicing and spent time looking at different types of juicers. I'm very happy that I chose this Breville model. I originally purchased it for myself, but my wife is now more exited about juicing that I am. This thing is a tank. All metal components and very sturdy. I've read reviews on other juicers that comment on leaking issues. Non of that with this one. The design is great and very easy to clean.
