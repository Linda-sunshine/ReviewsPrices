review/summary: Don't buy if you haven't tried it in personreview/text: This was my first ever purchase of a furniture item, without sitting in it first. I bought it based on other mixed reviews I read & regret it. You may still buy it but if anyone you know has it, sit in it for a couple minutes before purchasing. The price on amazon was a good deal though compared to other sellers online.Unlike some people, the box came with all the parts, & the material didn't have any foul smell & such. Setting it up is fairly easy & you should have it all setup & ready in 10 mins or so.What I don't like about it, the arm rests aren't really ergonomic. They only move up & down & not really contour to the normal lay or wide enough to feel comfortable if you're resting your arms on 'em.The seat cushion started to sink in where I sit on it after 6/7 months of constant 8/10 hours a day use. I bought a cushion from walmart to sit on now, had to lower the height a bit to adjust for it though.If you can sit with your back in one position for long time, you may like this. Once you set the height, level & back support, it will not budge or give even a little wiggle room to just lean back. It is fixed & feels awkward if you just want to lean back in it, because it won't move back a bit. Guess it will make you get out of the chair, walk around and move a little.
