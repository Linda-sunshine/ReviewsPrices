review/summary: Absolutely love it!review/text: I ordered my Hoover just 4 days ago and I was pleasantly surprised last night when I got it! I dunno about the assembly coz hubby did it:) So I finally got down to cleaning my carpets today and its AMAZINGly gross lol. Drying time is fast, and it cleaned up the visibly dirty sections like a pro.I had to stop for a bit when the suction stopped..turns out I didnt close the dirty water compartment all the way.It's a bit heavy for me (maybe I'm just too small:)) but no biggie, I still had fun using it. It's also very compact, I thought I had to make a huge space for it but I was able to stow it away w/ my other vacuum.I only gave it 4 stars since its my 1st time using it..I'll add another star if it holds up well after a few more runs:)
