review/summary: Cuisinart dcc-1200 brew central coffee makerreview/text: The coffe maker performs fine. The coffee is hot and the macine does what it is supposed to do.It is however a little slow and VERY NOISY. Set the automatic timer and you don't need an alarm clock, the gurgling will wake you up.
