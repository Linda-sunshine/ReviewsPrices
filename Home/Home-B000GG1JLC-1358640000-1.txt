review/summary: Great Inventionreview/text: I bought this for my Husband. He has the guest bedroom closet which has limited space. After I bought the first Twirl-a-Tie I ordered two more for him. He has to wear a tie to work everyday and now he can see them all. They don't take up much room and work great!
