review/summary: a great kettle for the pricereview/text: We are now on our second kettle...because we keep it on our stove top and someone accidentally turned on the stove burner, melting the plastic base on this. But it has worked great and does what it is supposed to. It might be nice if it heated up a little faster, but it is still pretty quick with it boiling water in less than 5 minutes.
