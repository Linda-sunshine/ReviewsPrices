review/summary: Metal gears completely stripped after 6 months of light usereview/text: Bought this in Oct/Nov 2011. My wife has used it for relatively light tasks. About April it totally stopped working. Turns out, the gears are completely stripped. These are the supposedly new, metal gears. She has an old model from 10 years ago that is still trucking. But this one died after 6 months. So sad.
