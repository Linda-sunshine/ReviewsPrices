review/summary: Black and Decker EHC 650 2 speed Food Chopper with 3 cup bowl.review/text: I have had one for years and didn't want to be with out it .My old one didn't seem as sharp as it might be so I decided to see if there was a replacement blade part for it.I called you guys and discovered that yes there was a new part for the old one and it was on warranty yet.They sent me the blade free of charge.and shipping. When it came however the new one doesn't have a stemin the bottom . so this did not work as a replacement. ( I haven't told you about it until now)Any way in the process of you offering and sending me a new blade I asked if I could still buy a new machinejust like the one I liked so much,.Sure enough. You still had one just like my old one. So I ordered a new one. It came in the mail .(the new choppers in the stores are junk I think). the old one has been used over and over dailyfor something. Just put in the blade. - add food - set the top on - push the button and there youhave it. wash it out and ready for the next job,. It doesn't require turning ,pushing or pulling. Justset the top unit on and ready to go to work with pushing the button on the top unit,. It has only the bladethe bottom container, the the top unit. Nothing to get lost or add this or that. Love it.I wish the replacement blade had the stem on the bottom so it could work on the old machine, the old onehad the stem built into the machine. the new Machine has the stem extended from the bottom of the 3 cup bowl.so nothing to hold the blade in place in the replacement blade.this is long,. But thanks I really appreciate having the new machine with a brand new sharp blade. and even theold one is better than anything in the stores even with the used blade,
