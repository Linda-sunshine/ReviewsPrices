review/summary: just what we neededreview/text: We have a waterbed, but other sheets are still cool when we first get into the bed. These sheets are the exception. They are warm and soft and comfortable all the time. We like them so much that we ordered a second set for the winter. These will definitely be our winter sheets from now on.
