review/summary: He Likes It!review/text: Hubby is very picky about the taste of his water, likes it ice cold, and drinks a LOT of it. The cost of high-end bottled waters was getting out of control. This is the perfect solution. He likes the taste of the water, the container is large enough that I don't have to keep refilling it all the time, and it fits perfectly on the shelf of my fridge. I've had no leaks at all.The only thing you should check before you buy it, is will it fit in your sink for filling. It just barely fits in mine. Also, some people might be unhappy with how fast it filters. It will not immediately filter 18 cups of water, but with the large size, if you fill it regularly it shouldn't be a problem.
