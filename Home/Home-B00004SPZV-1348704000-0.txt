review/summary: Best way to sprayreview/text: I've been trying to use olive oil to coat pans and the like ever since I read about what's in those sprays you get at the grocery store, with varying degrees of success.Using a paper towel to wipe the oil on seemed to wipe just as much of it off, leaving things sticking to the pan. Tried a cheap little spray bottle, the kind you can pick up for a buck or so at the drugstore. That leaked all over the counter, and kept getting clogged.Saw the Misto in one of the aisles at the grocery store, and thought "why not?" I filled it up about half-way, as per directions, pumped it up, and voila, a perfect spray of olive oil. I have been extremely pleased at its performance, and it has even improved one of my favorite dishes.I cannot recommend the Misto highly enough, especially if one follows the enclosed directions.
