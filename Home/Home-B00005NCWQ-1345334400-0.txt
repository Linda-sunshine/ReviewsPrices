review/summary: Every coffee drinker's dreamreview/text: Wonderful product! I'm drinking my favorite coffee brewed today in this durable, easy-to-maintain, rugged perculator, which does not even need electricity in a power pinch or on a camp site. Sierra Club members take notice! LOLI chose to replace the plastic perculator top - where the perculating appears - with a glass version because of the heat-on-plastic issue, and Amazon was able to provide a followup link to a glass top which fit perfectly.
