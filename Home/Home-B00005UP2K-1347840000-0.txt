review/summary: Love my KitchenAid Mixer but Wish it Would Live Longerreview/text: I am buying this mixer for the second time because I left it running once and it shimmied off the counter and fell onto the floor, damaging the motor. I would suggest not leaving it on the edge of the counter as it is a very powerful machine that can move around while mixing! It is one of my handiest machines and I use it to make bread dough, batters, icings, and ice creams. It's easy to use and easy to clean. I like the safety function that prevents it from starting to run when it's first plugged in. I also like the plastic safety guard/pour spout, which have saved me a lot of messy cleanups over the years. It is a loud machine but it can handle breads and thick icings with no problem. The size is great too. I can double, sometimes even triple the average recipe because the bowl is so big.I am a retired professional baker so I've use a lot of KitchenAids in commercial kitchens/bakeries. I don't find that these machines hold up well if used regularly, like on a daily basis. In fact the life expectancy of a KitchenAid in a busy commercial kitchen is about 3 years, which means chefs have to replace them often. However I highly recommend this product for home use. With all the attachments (I especially love the ice cream attachment:KitchenAid KICA0WH Ice Cream Maker Attachment), you can do a lot with it.
