review/summary: Best can opener I have ever ownedreview/text: Will open large cans as well as small. Easy to use. Very well made, not flimsy like cheaper models--it is sturdy and stays in place during opening. Quiet. Stops when can is opened. Easy to start the process and holds can in place the way you expect it will. I like that it is taller for bigger cans. Highest recomendation--just buy it.
