review/summary: Worst seller everreview/text: I was away for a long period of time and used this grinder only a few times. On the 3rd use it broke, it just so happened the 3rd time I used it was months later. They refuse to have the heart to refund me. This seller does not care about customers sadly, which explains there very low rating understandably. I am actively seeking legal litigation as I gather more information and evidence. They clearly made it clear in the response email that the attitude was tough luck buddy and we dont give a crap. They will be hearing from me routinely as I will not take no for an answer. Also they are completely disorganized, labeling this same coffee grinder as a hamilton beach in one ad and a proctor sylix in others, they are lying even about what they are selling, I am also forwarding this to amazon in hopes of a sooner resolution. No one should buy or respect this joke of a seller.
