review/summary: Easy assembly and clean-up!review/text: After owning the basic salad shooter for a couple of years the shredder cones cracked and the blades seemed dull. That salad shooter had seen very heavy use during that time, and it was time to replace the cones. While looking for replacements here at amazon.com, where i bought my basic model, I stumbled upon the Pro. I saw it comes with 4 cones, while the basic model comes with 2. I had been using the basic model for salad fixings, such a thin cucumber slices, grated carrots, and at least weekly for hash browns. It also saw quite a bit of use for grated cheddar and mozzarella, grated nuts.I make quite a few meals from scratch with produce bought at the farmers market. If you have the right tools its not difficult preparing fresh food. My lament about the basic shooter has been that it cuts veggies too thinly to use in veggie soup. Enter the pro, which has the attachments for thin slices as well as thicker slices. Problem solved.Once I started using the pro I was amazed how much easier it was to push the food through. This may simply be due to the newer blades, but still, it was a pleasant surprise!Assembly and clean-up is a snap. If you are cutting just veggies, usually all you need to do is rinse your cones and chute with water. After grating cheese and nuts you will have to wash the cones and chute in warm sudsy water or top rack of your dishwasher.If you are trying to decide between the basic and pro models it depends on how much you think you will use either. For heavy use I definitely recommend the Pro. Of course it takes up a bit more space, but to me it's well worth it.
