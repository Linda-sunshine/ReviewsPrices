review/summary: Quick and Easyreview/text: I've had the Keurig B70 for about 8 months now, and love it. It easily accommodates my 32 oz travel mug (when the removable base is set aside) and I love the fact that I can brew my own ground blend (or favorites)! This Brewing Machine comes with everything you need and is a real time saver. When you get one, look at BJ's Wholesale for the 80-pack coffees to stretch your costs (Example: San Francisco Fog Chaser is $27 for 80 cups). Another recommendation is the Santa's White Christmas, by Barnies (Orlando)... Perfect for that cold winter day, make yourself a cup in less than a minute with the device included with the B70! Look for the B70 with the free coffee/tea and chocolate sample packs if you can find it, I bought mine here at Amazon this way. Get it, and enjoy it! .....You won't regret it!
