review/summary: Great Giftreview/text: I bought this item for my son, who lives and breaths coffee because he is poor college student. He loves it and so do I. He made me an espresso and it was smooth and great tasting. No oils or bitter taste. He loved the clean up which was easy. I got hugs and kisses from my boy for this Christmas gift.
