review/summary: Great vacuum..Does its job very well!!review/text: We got it during the black friday deals week for a price nobody can beat and within 2 days of ordering it.As always Amazon rocks!!.. As far as the product is concerned, it is a very good steamvac for the price.It does its job very well.. Cleans up even the toughest dirt. The steam works really well and the carpet dries very fast.I wish I could give it a 5 star, but only complaint was that its capacity is less. A full tank of hot water can clean only half (sometimes 1/4) of an average sized room..Performance wise it is a very good product. I have owned it for about a month now and no issues at all!!
