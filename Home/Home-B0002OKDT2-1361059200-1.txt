review/summary: Works wellreview/text: I have a centrifugal juicer but noticed that when putting in leafy greens like kale, it didn't extract much juice. I read up on masticating juicers and decided on this. It does get more juice from leafy greens, but keep in mind most leafy greens aren't going to give you the volume that other fruits/veggies.It's easy to clean and heavy as crap, so it seems to be very good quality.Only con I have is not really a complaint - just how masticating juicers work.Very slow, and chute is narrow - but this is just the design.Plan to spend at least 5 minutes making one glass of juice, but it works GREAT
