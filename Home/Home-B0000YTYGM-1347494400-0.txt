review/summary: Works!review/text: If you like your coffee hot, this is the one for you. My requirements for a coffee maker are:1. It must have a carafe. I don't like the taste of coffee that has been kept on a burner or warmer.2. It must be programmable. I love waking up to the smell of fresh coffee and not having to wait for it to brew.That said, I don't know why they have to keep making them more and more complicated. For example, this one has an odd lid with a valve contraption. I long for my old Krups that was easy to program and simple to clean. Anyway, as others have mentioned, you have to get the lid on correctly and I can see where it would be easy not to if you are not paying attention.
