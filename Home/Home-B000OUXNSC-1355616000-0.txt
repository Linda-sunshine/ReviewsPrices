review/summary: HORRIBLE!review/text: I received these, unpackaged them, washed them, dried them on LOW heat...and the backs all melted! They are totally useless now to use over the holidays as I had planned, and I will have to go out and replace them immediately. Don't believe the manufacturer who says they can be dried. I suppose if you line dry, (if you have a big enough line), they might survive, but they are not well made AT ALL!
