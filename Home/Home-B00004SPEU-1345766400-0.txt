review/summary: Gets the job donereview/text: We previously had a Black and Decker, which stopped working after almost 10 years. This Krups grinder is about the same as the B&D;: same noise level, same basic design, and same result. It grinds the coffee pretty well, and although it still makes quite a bit of noise when grinding, it isn't too bad. I do like that you don't have to line up the lid with the unit; the lever is on the lid, and once you have the lid on, you can just push the lever down to start grinding.Overall, it's a good grinder, and does the job as well as my old Black and Decker.
