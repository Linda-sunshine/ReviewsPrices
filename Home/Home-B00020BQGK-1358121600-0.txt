review/summary: Great vac but breaks easilyreview/text: I love this little vac. I purchased it to pick up pet hair on hardwood floors - it does a great job with no scratching. It also works well on area rugs. The big drawback is that it breaks easily. It is very unstable when you stand it up and if you are not careful it will fall over and break at the connection to the head. I have purchased two of them and they both broke at the same place. I really need another one but am debating whether or not to go with another brand because of this problem.
