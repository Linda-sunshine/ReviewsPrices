review/summary: A GREAT CUP OF COFFEEreview/text: The coffee made with this percolator is excellent. There are a few things I always do to make great coffee:1) I wet the basket, then add a filter which has 5 holes and is slotted through the top of the basket's rod;2) I use a heaping 1/2 cup of "percolator-ground" (not drip-ground) coffee into the filter, shake it back and forth to even out the coffee in the basket, then wrap the filter around the rod; top it off with the basket cover;3) I add filtered cold water to the pot; then add the rod & basket & covers _**be sure the rod sits in the hole in the bottom of the perc; then plug it in;4) When it's finished perking, I unplug it. When I want coffee later, I just heat it in the microwave and don't get overcooked, sludgy coffee;5) I clean all with a long-handled brush and a little dish detergent which removes oils and residue from the pot and basket.Enjoy this percolator. Have a GREAT cup of coffee.
