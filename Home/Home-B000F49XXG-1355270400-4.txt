review/summary: Best machine for the pricereview/text: Years of experience as a barista to pay for college have made me wary of cheap home espresso machines. It is unfair to compare them to the big industrial models we use in cafes, but it remains disappointing to have trouble making a decent microfoam or pouring a perfect shot.For $100, this machine is ideal. I can make half a dozen lattes -- easily -- on a single tank of water. It does not take long to warm up in the morning, so I can make myself a latte each day before going to work.It pours a nice shot with a nice rich crema.My only gripe is that the machine is quite small. We have a very small milk pitcher suitable for a single latte -- anything larger would not fit under the wand unless the machine is at the edge of a counter. If this is a concern, go inspect the machine in person before ordering.
