review/summary: The perfect vacuum for apartmentsreview/text: After three years, our old vacuum cleaner gave up the ghost in a puff of smoke. Sadly, we took to Amazon in the hopes of finding a new cleaner. We bought this one because the price is beyond right (Under $100 for a vacuum cleaner? Uh, ya. Awesome.), but also because the reviews were really great. We were, of course, skeptical and when we got it we tried it out and it did well. We were impressed for such a little thing. We eventually moved into our current apartment which is 1280 square feet and despite having two dogs, a cat and a baby on the way this thing works so well that the things it gets out of my carpet almost terrifies me. Who knew my dogs shed that much? So here are some pros and cons of the cleaner.Pros:- Picks up dog and cat hair out of carpet like none other.- Cleans really well and quickly, which we found out after taking down our Christmas tree.- Really compact and light. In my ninth month of pregnancy I can easily lift this up and move it around with no trouble.- Easy to assemble and very few moving parts. Less for you to break!- The hose quickly and easily sucks up dog hair that is in the carpet.- Like I've said before it works really really well. Perhaps too well.Cons:- You have to empty it pretty often because it is that good.- You have to remove the filter in order to dump the stuff from the cleaner out.- The extendable hose does not go that far.- The unit is pretty short.All in all, I would say this vacuum cleaner is a great purchase. It's perfect for the price and it does a great job with animal hair. The biggest downside to it is you find out what's in your carpet and that can be pretty gross.
