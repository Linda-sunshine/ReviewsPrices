review/summary: Wonderful coffee maker.review/text: I am very pleased with our Keurig. My husband says, &#34;It's the best thing we've bought since Tivo&#34;. That's saying a lot for my husband. I've wanted one for a long time. I decided to get one for me. After searching and reading reviews, I decided on this one. I wanted the option to choose the size of the serving (which affects the strength of the brew). It's a great hit with company since they can choose what they want and how strong it will be.Happy to join the one coffee (or whatever) at a time. Should have gotten it a long time ago.
