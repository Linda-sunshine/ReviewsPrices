review/summary: Great product for non-knife expertsreview/text: I bought this set of knives for my mother recently to replace the set of knives she's had for probably 25 years. She's not someone who loves to cook - she likes to get in and out of the kitchen as quickly as possible. So it didn't make sense to get an expensive set of knives for her. But her old dull knives were definitely slowing her down and posing a safety risk. Since having the knives she enjoys cooking so much more. This set has everything she'd ever need and then some. She's been using them for two months and she's had no complaints so far. She did say one accidentally cut through a kitchen towel of hers.
