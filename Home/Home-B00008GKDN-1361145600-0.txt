review/summary: this is a great cooking tool!!! one everyone should havereview/text: Just received this in the mail and have already used it to cook several different items. First, started with some home-made quesadillas. My wife made the tortillas from her flour that she grinds herself. Then we used a tortilla press to make them into the perfect shape and onto the griddle they went. Add a little chicken, some cheese and the quesadilla turned out perfect.Then this morning the wife made some pancake batter and so on they went. This griddle comes pre-seasoned..and it was pretty much non stick from the start. I did add a little bit of olive oil onto the griddle before making the tortillas and some butter when making the pancakes, just to add more seasoning. Not going to hurt it by adding more. The pancakes came out perfect...the hashbrowns and sunny side up eggs also came out perfect. Do not know why we waited so long to get one of these. My wife is excited about all the things she can cook with this. Now, she wants more cast iron to cook with.My wife was a little hesitant because we have an electric stove, not a propane one and the griddle works well with this set up.
