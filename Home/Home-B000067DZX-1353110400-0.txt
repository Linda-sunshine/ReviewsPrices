review/summary: This filter is ridiculously slowreview/text: I was happy owner of 18-cup dispenser until I decided to replace filter with CRF-950Z.I noticed clogging issue on day 1 - the water flow was ridiculous right out of the box.After 2 weeks it takes more than 20 hours to filter the upper reservoir.What a shame, PUR!
