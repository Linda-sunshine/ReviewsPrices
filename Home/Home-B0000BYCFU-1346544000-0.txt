review/summary: A good purchasereview/text: I have made many batches of sauce, jam, and various pickled things with this canner now and have been thoroughly pleased. The construction is simple and easy to dismantle and clean. The thickness and weight of the metal is good and heavy, with a flat bottom with which i've seen no warping. Be aware that the interior may get darkened with use, i think this is just a chemical reaction between the aluminum and the acid in the foods i've canned.I don't use this as a pressure cooker or stock pot so i can't attest to it's capabilities in those regards. However, as a pressure canner, it works wonderfully.
