review/summary: It was exactly what I needed.review/text: My ties were all over my closet floor and I didn't want to pay a lot for a tie rack. Some of them were $30-$40 and took up way too much space. I had about 30 ties and 3 belts to keep organized, and I was very pleasantly surprised with this purchase. It takes up a tiny about of room in my closet (I bought 2) and it was exactly what I wanted for a cheap price. It works best when you balance the ties and belts evenly around it, and I will probably buy another just in case for some reason they aren't available in the future.
