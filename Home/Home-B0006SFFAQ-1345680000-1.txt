review/summary: BEWARE of this Coffee Makerreview/text: We purchased this coffee maker after reading many of the reviews, most were positive. We have had the unit one year, about 6 months ago it started turning off during the brewing process. We reported this to the customer service, via e-mail, they advised changing the filter and cleaning the pot with vinegar, which we carried out. The pot worked as it was supposed to for about a month, then started shutting off again. We waited about a month with this occuring on an irregular basis, then on a regular basis, so we cleaned it again, didn't replace the filter because that was not warranted. It worked for about 2 weeks without the shutdown occuring and now it is doing it again on a regular basis. I seems that in order for the unit to work properly, we will need to clean it after each use, doesn't seem worth the effort. The SELF CLEAN indicator is a JOKE.I would suggest that anyone looking at this expensive model, LOOK elsewhere. It replaced a Krups that worked flawlessly for over 10 years and then finally gave in. We are going to donate this one to the recycle bin and go back to a proven brand.OCTOBER SUPRISE, this coffee maker just keeps giving, recently the shutoff valve in the basket has ceased working, when you take the pot out the during brewing the coffee cascades onto the heating element. There is no warranty for this.
