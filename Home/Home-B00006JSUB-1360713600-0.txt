review/summary: Uneven Heatingreview/text: I use an electric range, and the pan never heats evenly. I like to use this pan for pancakes and pot stickers. My hope was that a heavy pan like this would heat evenly allowing me to cook multiple pancakes or a large number of pot stickers all at once. But no such luck. I've dealt with the pancakes by rotating them while cooking. But pot stickers are impossible with the middle ones getting burnt before the ones on the outside have any browning at all.
