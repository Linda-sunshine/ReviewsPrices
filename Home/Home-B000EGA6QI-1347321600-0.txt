review/summary: Easiest smoothie maker I've usedreview/text: I had an immersion blender when I was a freshly sprung 18 y.o. back when they were impossible to clean, but I still liked it so I knew one day I would buy one. I did not think they were appropriate for smoothies though. But for whipping taters, for pureeing soups etc etc.In the meantime for mine and my toddler's "moo-ies" I had been using a Magic Bullet knockoff by Back to Basics. It did a decent job but we got into gazpacho in a big way and those bullet type blenders don't let you stream in the olive oil as you blend (no opening except the base) which you have to do for the magical emulsification moment, so when we got a hand me down B&D; Crush Master we switched over to it for everything.The bullet style and the B&D; did an okay job w/ frozen fruit. There were always some small chunks either way that I would have to pick out so my babe didn't have problems.Well the B&D;'s glass pitcher broke last week so it was time, and I read reviews here that made me re-think smoothie possibilities. Waiting for it to arrive, I have been making do with a Cuisinart mini food processor. That is a nice machine and we know it's not meant for smoothies, but yeah, that was not fun (smoothie running down the sides and into the base).This guy goes to TOWN on those frozen mango chunks. It took like 30 seconds (pressing gently down into the fruit) and it was the most well blended smoothie I can remember making. And yes, cleanup was a breeze.I'm happy with all 3 Cuisinart machines I own, and hopefully this bad boy will last a long healthy life, but even if I have to replace every couple of years, for smoothies, for the price and how well it performs, I would.
