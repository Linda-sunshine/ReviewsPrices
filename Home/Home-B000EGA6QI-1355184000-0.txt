review/summary: Smoothest soup ever!review/text: I had been wanting to get one of these for awhile and with soup season (Fall and winter) on, I decided to go for it. I had made some soup and pureed it in my food processor but it was okay. In the meantime, this came in, so I used this to see if it would make any difference. I really didn't expect to notice any change, but was very pleasantly surprised to find a HUGE difference! my soup was completely smooth and thicker! I've only used it a couple of times so far, but eager to try experiment with more. Easy cleanup, easy to use, very comfortable to hold.
