review/summary: Wish I could give it zero starsreview/text: Was a great hand blender for about 1.5 months. Then the plastic gear stripped just like the picture another reviewer shared. If you want a replacement you have to send $10 shipping. Considering this lasted literally 1.5 months the warranty is useless. Don't buy this model unless you want to lose money for very short usage.
