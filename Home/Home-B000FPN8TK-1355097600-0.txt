review/summary: Used for Gyokuro, easyreview/text: I've been making Gyokuro for a while now using different methods, but this one is the easiest I've tried. Using a separate cup to cool the water, infusion and dispensing with this device is awesome, each infusion is always delicious. I've also made Top Tea Earl Grey, White Tea, and Yerba Mate with success.
