review/summary: easy to use and clean upreview/text: When I first got this I had to test each of the hooks. The Bread dough hook made kneading the bread dough so easy. Mixing cake and cookie batter made the batter smooth. I love the whip especially when making meringue for my lemon meringue pie. My kitchen has an apple motif so getting the red mixer was perfect.
