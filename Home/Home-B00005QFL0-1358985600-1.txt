review/summary: Almost perfectreview/text: A very good bread machine. I've tried about 6 loaves so far and initially I thought that the bread came out a little dry and over browned. The light crust setting would make a loaf that medium / dark crust. After some experimentation I've found that the keep warm function is to blame. If I take the bread out as soon as it's done, the crust is just right. Also if I take out the bread 10 min before, the bread is very moist. The whole wheat setting and the basic settings create very nice loaves with good texture and flavor. I would give the machine 5 stars if I could adjust the bake cycle shorter by 10 min.
