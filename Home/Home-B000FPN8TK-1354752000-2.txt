review/summary: Like it a lot. Better than my Teavana versionreview/text: Used the Teavana equivalent for a year or so until I saw this one. The Adagio is much better constructed - more durable and solidly built. The teavana one allows removal of the filtering screen, which is nice, but frankly since having this one I've realized that doesn't really make any difference if you clean it properly. Either one will work, but I'd have to give the nod to this one if a choice was required. This one also looks better in my opinion.
