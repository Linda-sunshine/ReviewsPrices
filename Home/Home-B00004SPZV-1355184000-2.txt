review/summary: Not perfect, but its what I was looking for.review/text: It does the job. I love that I use less olive oil much more efficiently with the misto. I use it for just about everything now. Baking prep, saute pans, and cooking. The nozzle got clogged a few months after use, but it still works fine. I just need to take better care of it. Fast shipping and a great price.
