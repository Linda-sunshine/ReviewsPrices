review/summary: It gets the job done...review/text: I have had this pitcher for about 3 months now and it still looks just like the day I bought it. This pitcher is not only durable and elegant, but it is also has a water filter all for the low price of $10! Now that is definitely a bargain but how great is it?Capacity: This is the slim version of the Brita pitchers, but if you want to hold more water at one time then I would recommend the larger version of this pitcher.Size: Considering this is the sim version it is compact and slim but it still gets the job done and fits in refrigerators without wasting too much space.Filtering: If you don't mind waiting and are pretty patient then filtering won't be a problem for you. You put water at the top of the pitcher and let it filter its self out into the space where the filtered water is kept, but it does it quite slowly. It isn't instantaneous but even though its a little slow it gets the job done and avoids buying bottled water. I have heard people say that occasionally little black things are in the water, this can be avoided by placing the filter in water for 15 minutes before you install it in the pitcher.Overall this is a nice little pitcher that ultimately gets the job done, looks elegant, and is durable. I rate this product 4 stars out of 5 stars.I hope this review helped you out!
