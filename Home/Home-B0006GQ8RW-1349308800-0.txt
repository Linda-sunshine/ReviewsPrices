review/summary: Great filter for some tastier waterreview/text: I have never had an issue with Brita filters and I have been using the brand for many years now. It makes the water purer and taste better. This is important for me since I often use filtered water for tea, coffee, kombucha, and brewing beer. There are times when it is very important to start with good tasting water and these Brita filters help provide that. After the first few uses you hardly ever get any of the carbon particles in your water, so it is built very tight. It filters the water at a moderately slow rate. It can filter a cup of water in about 30 seconds. I usually use these filters for twice the time that Brita recommends, and I have had no problem. But, if your starting tap water is not as clean, these filters may not last as long as they do for me.
