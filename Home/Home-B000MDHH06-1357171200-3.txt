review/summary: So good! So fun!review/text: I just got this a couple of days ago. We made some apple juice first thing and we were so impressed with how dry the pulp was, and how much juice we got out of just a couple of apples! It is very easy to clean and the brush tool it comes with is so handy. I can't say enough about it, it's just so great.
