review/summary: Bad oder when burningreview/text: The price was right, but the product omits a foul oder. The first night I used it we all got headaches from the smell. Unfortuatly returns are not accepted so stuck with the product. After writing review I realized you need to shake can up before use, this helps the odor problem. Not as good as others I used but not as bad as first thought.
