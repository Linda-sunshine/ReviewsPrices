review/summary: Good design but plagued by issuesreview/text: I have bought two of these clock radios from Amazon, a white one and a black one. I really like the dual-alarms and the interface for setting the alarm. The main issue I had with both clock radios is that the radio would randomly come on by itself at night. Sometimes it was the actual radio, sometimes just a weird static sound. The sound would click on and off occasionally. Sometimes at a really low volume and sometimes at a louder volume. I threw the first one out and bought a second one because I liked the clock itself so much. But the second one started having the same problems after a few months. I will not buy a third!
