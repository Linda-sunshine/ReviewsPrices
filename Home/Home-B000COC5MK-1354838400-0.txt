review/summary: worked one timereview/text: After contacting manufacture sent me a new one and had same problem. Not enough power to work.. Consumer Report recommended as the best electric wine opener after there vigorous testing the wine gave it rave reviews. Not the first time C.R. gave a excellent review on pure junk.
