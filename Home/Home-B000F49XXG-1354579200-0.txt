review/summary: GREAT machine!review/text: I've had this machine for over three years and have never had any problems with it! Use it practically every day & always makes a good cup of espresso (that's usually what I drink) with a good amount of crema & when I make a latte for a friend it always makes it nice & frothy without watering it down (my old machine did that). REALLY a fantastic little machine that is worth VERY reasonable price!
