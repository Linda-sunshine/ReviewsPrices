review/summary: Favorite Knife given the Price!review/text: I've purchased several of these knives over the years, not because they break, but because they make great gifts! After having used many Chef's knives I really enjoy using the Victorinox. Cutting and slicing are a breeze, while the handle is plastic, it's easy to hold and makes the knife very easy to use. I've tried both the 10" and 8" versions, and prefer the 8" as it's more versatile and easier to handle (at least to me). A few strokes on a sharpening steel restores the edge, and the knife is ready to go again. Sure it's not the prettiest knife out there, but it gets the job done. At this price I don't think twice about putting it in the dishwasher or using it to cut big/heavy objects.I've you're a budding chef, or new in the kitchen, I believe this makes one of the best value-driven chef's knives out there!
