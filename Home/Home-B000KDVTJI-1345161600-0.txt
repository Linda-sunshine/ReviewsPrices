review/summary: Leaks Waterreview/text: This kettle leaks if you leave water in it between uses. I bought this kettle for use at work so wanted one with a large enough capacity so that I didn't have to go to the water fountain to refill it every time I want to make a cup of tea. Unfortunately, after a few weeks of use, I have confirmed it leaks. I originally wondered if the leaking was condensation-related, so I filled the kettle about 1/2 way, placed it on a tray, and left it alone over the weekend. On Monday, there was considerable water on the tray, so much so that I couldn't wipe it away and had to carry the tray to a sink.Unfortunately, once I knew the heating mechanism worked properly I threw away the packaging so I can't return it. The kettle heats water just fine but fails when it comes to containing the water properly. I bought this model becuase it seemed a good value for the price but I now regret it. If you do purchase this product, I suggest keeping the packaging for the 30-day return window, just in case.
