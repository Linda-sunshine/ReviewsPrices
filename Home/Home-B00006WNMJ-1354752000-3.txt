review/summary: Happy I Swtchedreview/text: Small size works better in a busy sink, replacement costs of filters much lower than PUR, water tastes fine...replacing filter for the first time was just a bit challenging. You also need to calculate in how many days you will use 200 gallons before you need to replace the filter. Despite the minor inconveniences, much happier than with PUR.
