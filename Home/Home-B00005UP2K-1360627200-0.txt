review/summary: The perfect Christmas gift from my hubby - and now he needs to exercise more!!review/text: A couple years ago my husband gave me this wonderful mixer as a Christmas gift. I have always loved to bake, and his mother is a great cook and we enjoy making things together. Without a mixer like this in our home, we spent a lot of time manually blending, beating and folding... at the time our daughter was in her mid-teen and was not very patient when it came to such 'manual labor'...All that changed once this baby (in white) hit our kitchen countertop and got plugged in!!This mixer makes baking even more fun then it was, and now our almost 19 year old girl rolls up her sleeves and jumps right in to help. From breads, to pies to pizza dough and awesome cookies, this thing just kicks you-know-what!! The added bonus is that it really looks nice and, since we have white cabinets too, looks great in the corner area of our counter.Of course --- nothing is perfect... now we have to listen to my husband grump about the breads and cakes around the house, and the weight he says he has gained because we like to cook so much!!! Yep -- he blames that on us and the mixer... not on the fact the his treadmill is used as a coat rack! Still, when we do have a slow period, who do you think is the first to ask "Hey, have you thought about making a batch of treasure Cookies lately?". Uh, huh.This mixer rocks, and it was (and still is) a great Christmas gift to receive. If you are looking for a mixer that will get the job done, we (me, my mother-in-law, our daughter, and my grumpy husband...) totally recommend this one!Go for it you will not be sorry.
