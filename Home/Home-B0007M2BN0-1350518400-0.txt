review/summary: Nordic Ware Microwave Egg Boiler (Very Satisfied)review/text: This is a good egg boiler. My eggs came out just the way I like them. I cooked the eggs as the instructions and it made good hard boiled eggs. The texture and the taste of the eggs were very good. They tasted better than eggs boiled in a pot of water on a stove-top. I will be purchasing the Nordic Ware Egg Boiler for some of my relatives. I know they are going to like it.I recommend it.Caution: The egg boiler stays hot even when you let it sit for awhile after cooking the eggs. Use caution when removing the egg boiler from the microwave.
