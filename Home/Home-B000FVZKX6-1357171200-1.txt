review/summary: So far so good...excellentreview/text: We've owned flannel sheets for years but recently upgraded to a king bed, so it was time to get more. We were about to purchase from a well known, high end website but noticed the similar thread count and product manufacturing location. In fact, it appeared through similar reviews on that website that the sheets were similar (if not the same) but instead of paying $200 dollars, we bought them on Amazon for $65...and we couldn't be happier. Although we've only been using them two weeks, the sheets are wonderful and appear as high quality as the ones we've owned in the past. We have much warmer sleep nights now and are extremely happy!
