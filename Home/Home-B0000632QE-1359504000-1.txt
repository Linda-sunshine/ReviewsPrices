review/summary: It really works on everything.review/text: Despite some saying the blades were hard to interchange I bought this anyway. Had no problems changing blades. They slide in smoothly & click into place. It is easy to clean, hangs on your kitchen wall or cabinets & is fantastic. I bought a number of different fruits & vegetables to try it out & we both used it to the max in one hour. Wow! Onions just slide out in beautiful slices, peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, cucumbers, zucchini etc. I cored some apples & then sliced them on this in seconds. Added some lemon slices, cinnamon & a tablespoon of sugar over the top of about 3 apples sliced - cooked in the microwave for 4 minutes & apple pie without the crust! I thought I would try oranges. Peeled or unpeeled the slicer made beautiful thin slices that I put on Chinese food. Delicious. Great price & as always fantastic quick shipping through Amazon. I can't find anything wrong with this product. I use it about every other day.
