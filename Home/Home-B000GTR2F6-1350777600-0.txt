review/summary: 2yr old machine still greatreview/text: I purchased my Keurig Elite 2yrs ago. It made perfect coffee from the get go. My husband and I, like so many other reviewers, have different coffee needs and a conventional coffeemaker just wouldn't fit the bill. I like my espresso caffeine jolt and he likes decaf. Couldn't get any more different than than that. I absolutely love this machine and will buy another when this one has called it quits. I am even getting my co-workers to purchase one for our small office because the commercial brand we have turns out dishwater weak, tasteless coffee that no one drinks and it's usually dumped before noon.I could not be happier with this machine. I am waiting for it to stop working and every day that it works is another pat on the back to Keuring for a well made product. I have read hundreds of reviews on this and other models of Keurig and have come to the realization that, like a used car, some get a good one and a few, very few, get lemons. I did not get a lemon. I got a gem that makes great coffee every time!
