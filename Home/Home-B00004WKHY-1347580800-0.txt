review/summary: Update Purchasereview/text: I have owned a Cusinart Food processor since 1988. It still works ok but I was looking for an update. After researching food processors and examining them at stores, I stayed with Cuisinart because they offered a good size for my needs (9 cup) and did not take up more counter space than the previous one. I noticed right away this machine is made in China - the 1988 model was from France. Using this new machine is not difficult. There were several recipes in the booklet included I tried and which worked well. The 9-cup size is not easy to find and Amazon had it hence my purchase. I would recommend this machine for all food processing needs with excdllent resutls and very much like the red color option.
