review/summary: Love this little vacuum!review/text: When my big heavy expensive vacuum gave out, I tried this one. I am very happy. I love that it is so lightweight and easy to use. I have mostly hardwood and tile floors, and it zooms around picking up all the pet hair and debris. It also picks up well on my carpet, and the hose has good suction. The canister is super easy to take off and empty. It's a little smaller and fills up quickly, so it might not be a good vacuum for fully carpeted houses. The size of the vacuum is such that it scoots under and around things easily. When the vacuum was big and clunky, it was a chore to get it out and do the vacuuming. With this small, light vacuum, I can swish it around frequently and my house is tidier and I am happier! .
