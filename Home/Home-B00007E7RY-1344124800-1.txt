review/summary: Does the job!review/text: Purchased this air purifier for a home in a resort area where many basements have significant condensation, with resulting mold. Unit performed as well as the first purifier I ordered (which lasted 8 years before it expired!). Hepa filter makes a huge difference in the air quality; I was able to improve the situation significantly in two rooms (with carpeting). Carpeting filters out the mold from the air, holds it until carpet is shampooed. Apart from removing the carpet, annual cleaning of carpets, walls and furniture, together with use of an air purifier solved my problem. I installed this purifier after the carpet was steam cleaned. The walls and furniture were washed down with a diluted bleach mixture and clean rags. Great for a beach house or any home near the water.This unit is easy to clean; filters do not need to be changed frequently, may be ordered through Amazon. Sturdily built machine, relatively quiet.
