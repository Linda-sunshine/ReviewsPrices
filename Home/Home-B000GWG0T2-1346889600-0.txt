review/summary: Non-stick is great for now, but pan loses shape easilyreview/text: I've bought enough non-stick pans over the years to know to expect the surface to degrade over time so I expect to buy a new one every 18 months or so. Like most non-stick pans, the surface on this one is really great right when its new. However, what I did not expect was how easily the pan would lose its shape. I always wait until my pans have cooled to room temperature before washing them to avoid warping them. I was surprised that after just 2 weeks of use, this pan is no longer flat and circular. I expected the pan to be more durable than it has proven to be. The pan is still usable, but I have purchased others for the same price that have held up better. I will not be buying another one of these when its time to replace this one.
