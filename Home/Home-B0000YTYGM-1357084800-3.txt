review/summary: Too Tall but otherwise GREATreview/text: This just barely fits on the counter beneath our kitchen cabinets so I would definitely prefer a shorter coffee pot. Otherwise, is is perfect. I love the fact that the coffee remains hot in the thermal pot, allowing the heating element to turn off automatically once the coffee is made. Waking in the morning to the smell of coffee that has automatically brewed on schedule is a delight!
