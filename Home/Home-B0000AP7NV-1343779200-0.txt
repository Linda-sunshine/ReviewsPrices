review/summary: Great Tasting Waterreview/text: I've had this picture for a few weeks now and I've had no issues. Super easy and quick to fill up and use and I'm saving money by not buying gallons of water and 24 pack water bottles. Wish I had purchased it sooner. My only complaint is that I wish the filter lasted more than 2 months; 4 would be great. Highly recommend.
