review/summary: Stainless Steel is a Much Better Optionreview/text: After owning this popper, I received a stainless popper for Christmas. I used the Whirley Pop to make lots of kettlecorn with fairly good success. However, I found the thin aluminum pan had hot spots that allowed the corn to burn. I was also concerned that the cheap plastic gears would eventually fail.I now have a stainless steel Great Northern popper. The thick stainless steel pan bottom distributes heat much better. The result is no more burned kettle corn. Carmelized sugar does not stick to the bottom of the stainless like it did to the aluminum and the steel gears feel much more substantial and less likely to break. The Grean Northern popper also has a better paddle design to rotate the corn better.The bottom line is that the Whirley Pop popper works OK. However, you get what you pay for and the thicker stainless pan makes for a much better popper.
