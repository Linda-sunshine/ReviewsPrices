review/summary: ice cream maker reviewreview/text: Bought this machine for a culinary friend of mine as a birthday gift. We were watching Chopped and saw some fun uses. So far he has made two batches of fantastic custard. We did over-fill the machine on the 2nd batch, but caught it in time to prevent the ice cream volcano effect. It cleaned up very easily, very simple to use. The hard part is getting your ingredients right and blended before the machine does it's thing. Great product, would like a spill protector and better than plastic clips for the top and blades. So far they have worked fine.
