review/summary: Difficult to usereview/text: It made a great cup of coffee for about a month but has a lot of problems now. It water starts dripping as soon as the machine is turns on for warming up, before the dial is on brew. The handle needs increasingly more push to the right to get in place. It doesn't stop brewing when it's brewed a cup. The steamer starts by spewing water before steam, watering the drink. The steamer is difficult to clean. The filter holder in the machine is impossible to screw lose and clean, like the manual instructs. I gradually went back to my stove top espresso maker. I wish I had bought a Keurig instead
