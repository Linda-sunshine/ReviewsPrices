review/summary: Great popper, just don't leave it unattended...review/text: Works great. Much better than other poppers we tried, and cheaper too!Got in the habit of running it outside on the porch (all air poppers are very noisy!) but one day I let it run too long & the plastic outlet parts deformed...Still works, just have to keep an eye on it or it backs up.
