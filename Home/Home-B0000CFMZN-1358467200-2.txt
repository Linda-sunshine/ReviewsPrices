review/summary: Sometimes you just need one cupreview/text: I have the 4-cup and 2-cup Pyrex measuring cups and love them, but sometimes I don't want to dirty up one of the bigger measuring cups just to measure a small amount.Plus, this gives a more precise liquid measurement. It's hard to exactly find the meniscus on 3/4 cup, for example, when you're using a 4-cup measure. Only problem is that the Amazon price seems high. Other websites, including Pyrex's own, retail this product for $3.99.
