review/summary: "The Cloud" is still going strong after two yearsreview/text: We have used this topper for two years and we still refer to it as "The Cloud." We got it when I was six months pregnant for my side of our king-size bed. If you are using it for a king-size bed, make sure to get the XL so that it goes all the way to the edge of the mattress. My husband got jealous shortly after it arrived and I catch him taking naps on my side of the bed all the time. I am finally getting him his own for his side of the bed this Christmas.It worked like a dream on the sore hips and general discomforts of late pregnancy. After my husband ran a marathon last month, he slept on it to help relieve his achy hips and back. Others have complained about an odor that comes with it, but while pregnant with a nose like a bloodhound I only noticed a faint chemical smell that went away after a few days.The only drawbacks are: you have to buy a deep fitted sheet otherwise the sheet pops off all the time, if you only use it on half the bed like we do it makes your bed look funny with the big ledge that runs down the middle and finally, it does get hot to sleep on. We live in a desert climate and I frequently sleep without any covers during the hot summer months.Other than those minor drawbacks, this product is well worth the surprisingly low cost and like I said earlier, I am purchasing one for my husband right now for Christmas.
