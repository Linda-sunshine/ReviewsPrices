review/summary: Look elsewhere for a thermometerreview/text: I thought this was a great product at first but changed my mind after a very short while. It stopped working (display read "HI" instead of a temperature) after less than 10 uses. A little reluctant to throw good money after bad, I ordered a replacement probe which, even after careful use (running it thru the rotisserie holes of the grill), crapped out again after less than 10 uses. NOT RECOMMENDED!
