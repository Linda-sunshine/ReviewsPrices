review/summary: Works as advertised, nice solution to vacuum sealing with Mason Jars!review/text: I usually wait a little longer to write product reviews, mainly to see if the product will past the test of time in addition to working out of the box. But at $10, and coupled with how well this has worked, here it is!Bottom line - this jar sealer works as advertised. I have used it probably 30-40 times since buying it, and it worked on the first try every time. (I use it with the V3880 Foodsaver). All of the jars I used it on were years old, but all of them still had a decent seal, and I did clean all the lids seals first to assure they were clean. Not sure I needed to, as the last few times I used it I just picked up the lid, sealed it with no problem.I have read that the version of this jar sealer made for &#34;regular mouth&#34; Mason jars does not work as well, and the reviews for that one are luke warm at best. In fact, if you go to Foodsaver.com as of today, you will see that say &#34;Out of Stock&#34; on the Regular Mouth one, and point you to this one to use! Not sure if they are re-engineering that one, but reviews are pointing to that one has a problem.Five stars for this jar sealer though! Works as advertised and I am impressed! Yesterday I purchased additional Mason jars to use this with other applications.
