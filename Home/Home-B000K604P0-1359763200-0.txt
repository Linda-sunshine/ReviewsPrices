review/summary: Good Thermos with one problem.review/text: I really like this thermos. It does keep my hot water hot for a very long time. The only problem I have with it is that it drips when I drink my beverage. The drips are coming from the area where I twist to close the thermos and I haven't seen anyone say anything about their thermos on the reviews so maybe it is just my thermos with this problem. Good thermos overall but would have gotten five stars if it didn't drip water all over my shirt every time I drank from it.
