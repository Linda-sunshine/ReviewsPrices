review/summary: great multipurpose kitchen toolreview/text: My food processor quit working on me so I thought I would try a hand blender. This one feels well made and is easy to use and clean up, although I do suggest cleaning it immediately after use so that the food particles don't dry and become really hard to clean off.I have used the blending blade to make things like hummus, mashed potatoes, salsa, crepes, and to liquify butternut squash soup on the stove.The food chopper attachment is very nice also. I have used the chopper to make bread crumbs, pulverize dehydrated strawberries and blueberries, and make cilantro chutney.I have not used the whisk.I would buy this again...but hopefully I won't have to for a LONG time.
