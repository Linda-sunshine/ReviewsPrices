review/summary: good little machinereview/text: Bought this as a birthday gift for my icecream loving spouse. We have had it a year now, and used it quite a bit and it has done a great job of making light airy ice cream fast. It's not real quiet, but I would not expect a maker of this style to be. I recommend getting a second bowl as it will take awhile for the bowl to refreeze if you want to make a bigger batch. Comes with a nice recipe book.
