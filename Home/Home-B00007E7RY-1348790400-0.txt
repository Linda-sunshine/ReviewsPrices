review/summary: Great Machine But Some Arrive with Defectsreview/text: Let me start by saying that I ordered 3 of these machines for our home and have been running them for about 2 weeks now. Until now no problem. We run them on high 24-7. Its loud but we like the white noise as it helps the kids sleep and stay sleeping which is always a good thing. :)The problem occurred when I decided to order a 4th machine. It arrived at my office where I turned it on and immediately the room was filled with a fishy plastic type order that was unbearable. After reading a few reviews on Amazon about this problem I decided to return it and requested a replacement. Amazon replaced the machine and the new one arrived today. I set it up in my office turned it on and a slight fishy plastic smell started coming out. I decided to give it a try and left to grab a bite to eat for 20 minutes. When I came back and opened the door I started coughing badly. The room was filled with that smell. 3 other co-workers confirmed the smell as well.I called KAZ the number listed in the packaging materials. They said it was possible that the odor stuck onto some of the machines during manufacturing and they are not sure what it is. He said you can run the machine outdoors for 24-48 hours and it might help clear the smell.I decided to return it a second time and give it one more shot. If a 3rd machine arrives and has the same problem I guess I will have to look for another filter.I only hope that the smell is not toxic as it can affect many people who have compromised immune systems and are trying to breath healthier air. My advise is try and find this machine in store and see if they will match the Amazon price, then before purchasing turn it on and run it inside the store before taking it home.
