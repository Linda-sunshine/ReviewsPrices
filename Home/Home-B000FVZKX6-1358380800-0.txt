review/summary: One of our best &#34;quality-of-life&#34; purchases!review/text: My wife & I only discovered these sheets thanks to Amazon.com reviews, and boy are we glad we did! Over the years I/we have had flannel sheets that quickly became pilly and stretched-out/loose-fitting, even expensive ones (I'm talking about you, L.L. Bean). We have had these for a few months now are *love* them--never thought I'd say that about sheets of all things! These are so cozy and fit perfectly, so they help make our bed such a comfortable place to rest. Well, I'm over my quota for exclamation points now, so I'll just end by saying we can't recommend these enough.
