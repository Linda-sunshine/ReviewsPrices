review/summary: Easy to use and cleanreview/text: This grinder does a good job for a blade grinder.The grinds are consistent in size, but if you grind too long you get a powder.This problem exists for any blade grinder though.This particular grinder is a breeze to use, and has a built in safety so you don't grind your fingers while cleaning.It is also very easy to wipe out with a damp cloth, which makes cleaning very simple.Buy this unless you want to spend big bucks for a really nice grinder.
