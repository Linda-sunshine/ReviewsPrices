review/summary: Fantastic knife for novice or professionalreview/text: I purchased this knife almost about 9 months ago and wanted to really put it through the ringer before I posted a review. In that time I have done hundreds of pounds of chopping, fine dicing, carving, and a variety of different cutting jobs. This knife has held strong through everything and more, even accidental spins through the dishwasher.The product ships very fast and arrives razor ( I literally sliced a part of my nail off) sharp and ready to mow through anything you put in front of it. I have used a variety of knives from cheap (Cuisinart, Chicago) to expensive (Wusthof, Henckels, Misono) and I have to say for this price, nothing beats the value of this knife. A word of advice is to have a steel and home sharpener to really maintain the edge. I should steel more often than I do but it stays true nonetheless. In the time I have had it, I have put it through my sharpener twice--not because it was going dull, but because I was prepping for a lot of cutting. I highly recommend this knife, for the person that cooks daily meals to the at home pro or in restaurant pro for an affordable, quality knife, that you won't be sad about damaging or having stolen. Last point, the fibrox handle is wonderful, grips well even wet and is impossible to chip or damage.Buy this knife, you won't be disappointed.
