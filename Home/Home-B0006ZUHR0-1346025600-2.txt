review/summary: Awesome Iron, you dont need to buy a $200 ironreview/text: Iron is an Iron to a point. Im not saying go out and buy a $10 one. You do need one that has a nice nonstick surface, many dont. Also need one that steams evenly and properly. This one fits the bill and very reasonably priced.
