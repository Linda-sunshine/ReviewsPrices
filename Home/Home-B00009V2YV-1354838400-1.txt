review/summary: Great!review/text: We bought this weather radio for my 88 year old aunt who is hard of hearing and also has vision problems. The radio was easy to set up, has a large screen and letters, and can be VERY loud if need be. It was easy to set to our area and you can even monitor counties all over the US.
