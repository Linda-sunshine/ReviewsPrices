review/summary: Leaks and sensor stopped working 2 months after warranty expiredreview/text: I really liked this trash can at first. It worked well and was kind of cool looking. But two very important things keep me from recommending it.The first is it leaks. If the bag leaks, the trash can certainly does not stop liquid from leaking all over the floor. I don't think it's too much to ask of a kitchen trash can for it not to leak.Second is after owning it for 14 months, two months after the warranty expires, the sensor stopped working. I've tried all the fixes in the top review, and no go. Even if it were still under warranty, paying shipping both ways and being without a trash can for weeks doesn't sound too appealing anyway.I guess I'll get a Simplehuman step can like I wanted in the first place, but dang they are pricey.
