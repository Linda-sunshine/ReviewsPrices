review/summary: Great Dutch Oven, but made in China...review/text: I have several pieces of Lodge cast iron that are all made in the US. Imagine my surprise when I turned the box over to find that it is made in China. C'mon Lodge - what's up with that?? Really though that is my only complaint - that it is not made in the US.This oven sports beautiful enameling inside & out, the lid seals tight and it cooks very well. I bought this to use at our cabin on our wood-burning fireplace insert. The insert - a Lopi Revere - has a small cooking shelf on it to use whenever the power is out which happens frequently during the winter snow storms. This oven barely fits on the shelf. It is larger than I expected it to be - 11&#34; across at the top. But it does fit on there and it is large enough to make a decent size meal, or to even bake bread, cakes, or anything else. Dutch oven cooking is lots of fun and almost limitless as to what you can create with them. We have used it at home so far to make an excellent pot roast starting with searing the meat and carmelizing the veggies right in the pot.Cleaning so far has been a snap! For really hard, baked on stains you can just steam the inside with some water and it should loosen up using a stiff bristle brush or nylon scrubbing pads . Just make sure you don't use metal utensils or cleaning products because you could scratch the enamel (which is actually glass).
