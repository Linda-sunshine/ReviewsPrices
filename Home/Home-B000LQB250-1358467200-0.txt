review/summary: Better sleepreview/text: I have been sleeping on this mattress pad for years. I first bought the twin XL to use while in college over the notoriously cheap and uncomfortable dorm room mattresses. It was wonderful. Not only did I have a better sleep at night with less tossing and turning, I also slept longer. I am a side sleeper and this mattress pad helps keep my spine aligned while I'm sleeping on my side which is great as I am prone to lower back issues. Since getting this mattress pad I never wake up with a sore back.This mattress pad does not have the issue some mattress pads have where they sink in and and the hole formed takes forever to go away when you move. On the contrary, this mattress pad conforms and reconforms to your body right away, which is great as I am someone who moves around a lot in my sleep. I have also never had any issue with this mattress pad getting too hot. The holes in the pad help keep it ventilated.I love this mattress pad so much that when I left college and returned to my Queen size bed I threw the twin XL pad down the middle of it and continued to use it. I have been sleeping on this mattress pad for years and it still works as well as it did the first day I used it. Now I have purchased this pad again in a Queen size because I love it so much. Trust me, this is a good buy.
