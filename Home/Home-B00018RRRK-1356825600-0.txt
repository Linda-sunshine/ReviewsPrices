review/summary: Not impressed.review/text: We were pretty excited to get this grinder, as we liked the features it offered. However, it has been a headache for us. It takes up a lot of counter space, and we almost always end up with an enormous amount of coffee dust on the counter when we transfer the coffee from the reservoir to our coffee maker. The lid tends to gather fine dust in its corners, and that's what tends to fly everywhere, despite our best efforts to contain it. Granted, it's a minor annoyance, but a constant one.Now, for some reason, the beans don't feed down into the grinder without several good shakes while it whirs benignly, even though the bean hopper is full. I've come to the conclusion that Cuisinart should stick to what it does best: food processors. All other Cuisinart products we've had have been pretty disappointing.
