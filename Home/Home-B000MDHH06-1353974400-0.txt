review/summary: Extremely solid for first time juicingreview/text: This juicer is absolutely perfect for a first time juicer. After watching the documentary Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead, I became obsessed with becoming healthy via the juicing model. I knew I didn't eat enough greens, and this seemed like an easy way to incorporate them into my diet. After doing a LOT of internet research, this juicer came up as my number one choice of ease and price point. I wasn't sure if juicing was going to be a phase or what - so I didn't want to spend so much money, just yet.After receiving the juicer I started using it daily. I also ordered "The Juicing Bible" (actual name of the book) and started with the recipes there. Pretty soon I found out a good ratio that suited my palate - two parts green to one part sweet. Example: a bunch of spinach and a bunch of kale to one apple. Or a couple beets and a handful of chard to a small bit of ginger. You should definitely experiment to see what makes you happy.Fast forward 10 months. I still juice about four times a week I find that dinner is the best time for me to juice, since you basically need to drink the juice pretty soon after you make it. I prepare the juice, stick it in the fridge and head to the gym. An hour and a half later, I come back and the juice is perfectly chilled (and better tasting, IMO).But as of late, I'm noticing more and more pulp. It's also wetter. I realize that I should replace the blade, but this gets me thinking. This isn't a phase anymore. I'm hooked on juicing. It has completely changed my diet and my LIFE. I'm down 15 pounds and actually crave juice when I go longer than a week without having it. I'm not going to replace the blade. I'm going to replace the juicer itself.I just ordered an Omega J8006. It's a masticating juicer and I'm pumped for it to arrive.Breville - what a great first time juice machine! I'll miss you.
