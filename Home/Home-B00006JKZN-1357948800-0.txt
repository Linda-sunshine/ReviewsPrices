review/summary: Great crispy waffles!review/text: I put this item on my wish list because I don't care for Belgium waffles. I like the thinner, crispier ones. I received the Cuisinart classic waffle maker for Christmas and couldn't wait to try it out. I was thrilled with the performance and ease of cleanup. It made great waffles, crispy and golden brown.
