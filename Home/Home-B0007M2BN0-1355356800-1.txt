review/summary: FANTASTIC PRODUCTreview/text: For years I've used the &#34;electric&#34; egg cookers which cost $35+. They last a few years and then have to be replaced. This new &#34;microwave&#34; egg cooker is great, although it only does four eggs at the time instead of 7, it cooks in less than 1/2 the time, it cleans up easily, stores easily, and on top of that it's as cute as can be, just think, cooking eggs inside an egg. I would recommend this to anyone who boils eggs, its FANTASTIC.
