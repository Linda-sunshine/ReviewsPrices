review/summary: Too fragilereview/text: While it really does humidify the room, one of the water tanks cracked after I'd only had it three days, the plastic so fragile that it broke as I lifted it out of the bathtub where I'd filled it. Remains to be seen if this company will do the right thing and supply a free replacement tank.
