review/summary: really!review/text: They were junk from the word "go". Unpacked them from a two-pack, and that took about 10 minutes. Then it took about another 10+ minutes to get the glue off (they were glued inside the pack). Just as I got the glue off the first, I opened the container and looked inside. The smell was a strong plastic smell that has to affect the olive oil taste. BPA free? Don't know, because the packaging does not mention that. After reading the other reviews, I am passing on this item and returning it.Misto Gourmet Olive Oil Sprayer, Brushed Aluminum
