review/summary: Great juicer!review/text: This is our first juicer. My wife and I decided to start juicing after she watched the documentary &#34;Hungry for Change&#34; I have to say I was skeptical at first but juicing is great. We're trying different combinations with fruit and vegetables. This juicer is very powerful and does a great job, especially for juicing beginners but really I don&#8217;t see what more you'd need in a juicer. For the price, it's perfect.
