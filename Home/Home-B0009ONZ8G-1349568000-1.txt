review/summary: Do not buy this vacum- Poorly madereview/text: This is not your old American made Hoover upright we all know. This machine is made by the lowest bidder and it shows. I have had nothing but problems with mine. The attachments do not stay on the machine, the vibration is awful, and the worst of it is this loud growling noise from the motor that started a month after we bought it. Hoover defintely cut corners in the manufacturing process in keeping the price down. Mission accomplished! You made a shiney blue piece of junk. Go to your local used vacuum store (if you can find one) and pick up an older refurbished Hoover. You will be way ahead.
