review/summary: A welcomed alternative to the drudgery of mechanical openersreview/text: My parents own this exact opener and I have marvelled at its effectiveness for many years. So it has stood the test of time. Despite them having it for this much time, I have always used a regular hand-twister opener. I finally got tired of the broken corks and cork debris. I finally thought to myself that opening a bottle of wine should not take much stress or effort when one is trying to relax and that is when I decided to buy this for my own home.It took about 2 minutes to open a bottle before but now with the Oster Electric Wine bottle opener I received today, that time is reduced to 15 seconds. And it is such a high quality device that it never causes any cork crumbs or debris. It makes a clean puncture and quickly pulls out the cork. And then the other button releases the cork. The price was great on Amazon. So just pay up and forgo the drudgery of old school devices. You won't regret it.
