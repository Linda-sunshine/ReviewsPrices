review/summary: Works greatreview/text: This is really easy to use, so fun to slice up apple slices, potatoes and I even finely sliced onions to carmelize. The best part was that I accidentally ordered two, I was dreading returning it because I assumed it would be a hassel. I printed the return form with the postage paid, dropped it off at UPS yesterday, and first thing this morning I already received an emails saying the money had been returned. It was so easy. I really appreciate this. Thank you!
