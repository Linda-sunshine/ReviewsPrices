review/summary: Popcorn lovers rejoice!review/text: This thing is seriously awesome. It's so cheap, and works so well, it's unbelievable. The popcorn tastes about a million times better than microwave popcorn (though obviously the popcorn itself has something to do with that too)! I use Eden Organic Yellow Popcorn and nearly every kernel pops. Mine has never burned or scorched the kernels and the popcorn comes out tasty every time! Like others have said, having softened butter is kind of necessary when using the measuring cup to melt butter on top of the machine.
