review/summary: Presto 12-cup Perculatorreview/text: I got tired of buying drip coffee makers only to have them die after a year. I decided to try the perculator type and decided upon a Presto 12-cup model. I have had it for a few weeks and so for my husband and I like it. The only thing I am not sure about is the way the perk tube fits in the perk well. It does not go completely down inside the perk well just sits on top, I tried calling Presto industries but all I got was a recording that played over and over so I gave up. I do like, that if I take out the basket the coffee stays hot all day and does not get super strong(altho my husband will drink coffee even if a spoon will stand up in it). So for I like it but I don't want to jinx the product by bragging too much on it. I plan on buying a stove top model in the near future too, since we are way out in the sticks and the electric does go out more than most places. We have a wood stove to cook on when this happens. At this time I would recommend this product. The one star off the review is for the customer service end, not being able to get a human on the line.
