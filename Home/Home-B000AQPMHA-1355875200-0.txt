review/summary: Excellent customer servicereview/text: I got the B40 as a xmas gift last year. Last week the machine malfunction (pump). Followed the trouble shooting guide to no prevail. Called cutomer service and went thru the trouble shooting guide. No luck. Customer service will be sending me a new unit. WOW! now that's cutomer service. I will be purchasing a machine for a friend for xmas now that I know they back up their product.As for the coffee - it brews a decent cup. I purchase a filter cup that requires paper inserts so I can use my coffee beans and no more over price k-cup. I found grinding to expresso size gets me a strong cup on the large size. I usually brew 2 small size with with the same coffee to fill up my 16 oz mug and get good results.
