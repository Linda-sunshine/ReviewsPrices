review/summary: Powerful, compact juicer for good pricereview/text: This is my first juicer, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money not knowing whether I would 'get into it' or not. I was looking for a juicer that did not require a lot of dismantling to clean and maintain. I was concerned that this 'compact' juicer might not have the horsepower to deal with unpeeled, hard fleshed fruits and veggies, but it does, in spades. It truly is a breeze to clean with the included brush/scraper tool--takes me about a minute, I do it before I drink the juice. Parts come off and reassemble in a snap and fit well. No leakage or problems of any kind with this unit, which I've had for about a year now, and works as well as the day I got it. I highly recommend it to anyone who is a juice beginner, has limited counter space and is juicing for one or two people (the pulp reservoir gets filled producing about 24 fl oz. of juice). Great product for the price.
