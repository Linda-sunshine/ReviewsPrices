review/summary: ball wide mouth plastic screw on lidsreview/text: these are fantastic. when you open a jar and you have to pop the seal. the old way is to put the seal and ring back on. then you reopen the jar and you sometimes have to repop the seal. with these plastic lids that is not a problem any more. just like unscrewing a mayoneese jar. With these plastic caps. you put one on after you open the jar and it keeps the canned product fresh and sealed. and easy to open. if you have alot of canned product at home, (like i do) getting some of these caps and you won't regret it. they make these caps for all the different type of jars that ball makes.
