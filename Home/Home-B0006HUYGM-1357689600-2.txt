review/summary: powerful but LOUDreview/text: very nice and handy little vacuum, but boy, is it LOUDalso, there appears to be some air that comes out from the back end; so when I'm vacuuming, I notice the air from the back is so powerful as well that it blows away the stuff I'm trying to vacuum!be careful what you vacuum as well, I accidentally let it suck in a toothpick and next thing I know the toothpick came sticking out of the middle of the hose! I was afraid the thing would no longer work, so quickly hot-glued the hole caused by the toothpick and it appears fine for now....
