review/summary: You get what you pay for.review/text: I bought this blender to replace a Braun that died after 10 years of service. I use it every weekday morning to mix protein powder in water - not a tough task. It died after using it less than 100 times, but of course after the return period elapsed. I wish I had flushed the money down a toilet instead of buying this blender. At least that would have been a memorable experience.
