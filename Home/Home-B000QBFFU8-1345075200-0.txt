review/summary: The battleship of juicersreview/text: I started my experience with juicers by buying a Sharper Image brand.i used it for 3 months until the main feeder tube had a piece that broke off. It was made of plastic and a chunk totally broke off. After researching other juicers , I decided on this one. I have been using it for over a month now- wow, what a difference. The variable speed motor can be set based on what you are juicing. It goes through the fruits and veggies with very little effort. I can also see that I'm getting more juice and drier remnants.It comes with a metal food tube- that won't break off and has little touches like a metal fin in the tube that stops your fruit and vegetable from flying around and out the tube.There is also no juice leakage like I had with my old juicer. The channel that redirects the juice is larger and can handle much more juice. I must admit I wish the juice pitcher that comes with the machine was bigger but it is still good.Based on my experience so far- this should last a while. Nice job Breville!!!
