review/summary: Kitchenaid Blender really mixes it upreview/text: I bought my Kitchenaid blender over a year ago.I use it almost every day for my protein shakes. It is a wonderful machine. I have had absolutely no problems with it. It does a great job of blending ice smoothly and it makes a creamy protein shake. I've used a friends Ninja, and didn't get as good of results as I have with my Kitchenaid.After a year of use, the engine still has a ton of power and I have noticed no decrease in it's performance at all.It is a heavy duty machine that gets the job done.I love my Kitchenaid blender and I don't see that it will need to be replaced for years. I ordered it in a metallic raspberry pink color that came out to support Breast Cancer Awareness. I love the color!I was initially concerned that the heavy duty plastic canister wouldn't hold up well, but I was wrong. It has held up perfectly. The blender ia also easy to clean.It is a quality product.
