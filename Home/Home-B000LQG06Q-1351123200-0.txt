review/summary: Heavenlyreview/text: Extremely pleased with my purchase. I am only 30 and didn't know why I was having such horrible pain in my back and neck so I decided to buy this mattress topper after reading such great reviews and considering the bargain price! This is a quality mattress topper, I'm in heaven when I sleep in it and my back and neck pains have gone away after just a couple nights...so happy...love bed time now...before I used to dread it! Yes it does have a minty smell but me and my husband love it. No complaints...recommending to everyone
