review/summary: Nothing like cast ironreview/text: I received this item for Christmas and immediately made a large batch of chicken biryani. This was the perfect pot for the dish which starts on top of the stove and ends up in the oven. It was easy to clean also, unlike conventional cast iron. I love cooking with cast iron and this pot is exceptional!
