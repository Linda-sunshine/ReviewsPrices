review/summary: Cosmetic Damage, but Works As Advertisedreview/text: This was sold as being in new condition, but arrived with a cosmetic crack in the yellow plastic piece that holds the cover. Besides the crack, we are happy with this popper. It pops quickly and doesn't burn the popcorn or leave too many unpopped kernels. One annoying feature is that there is no off switch. To turn it on and off you have to plug and unplug it from the electrical outlet. When we do this it creates a small electrical spark - not ideal. The manufacturer should add an on-off switch.We used microwave popcorn bags before getting this air popper and this is much better. There is nothing to throw away, you don't have to listen for when the popping slows down to avoid burning the corn, you can add whatever flavorings you want (or none) and it is cheaper. Plus, our 3 year old son really enjoys watching the popcorn come out of the machine and he can't do that with microwave popcorn.
