review/summary: Powerful Cleaning Power for a Small Packagereview/text: For a 7 amp vacuum, it does above and beyond what would be expected for under $70.The Dirt Devil Dynamite picks up dirt and debris you never knew was there. When I used it for the first time, I had to empty the canister 2 times per room and made several passes. The thinner head makes it easier to get in between furniture where my old vac was just too large. The handle extends and contracts making it a good space saver.As other reviewers have pointed out, the key design flaw is that the exhaust is in front, easily kicking up fine dirt and ash if piles are present. For me, I have not noticed any clouds kicked up from it so I believe that the other reviewers are over exaggerating. Just don't try to clean the fireplace with it, or if you do, just use the extension and not the vacuum itself. Another con is the preventive maintenance. You will have to empty both the canister and clean the filter after every room to get optimum performance. To clean the filter you just take it outside and tap the bottom plastic rim against concrete to shake out the dirt in the ruffles. Even though this machine has enough suction to pick up loose change, they can get wedged where the belt is and damage it. Always play it safe and pick up any coins, paper clips and the like prior to vacuuming.Finally, there is a chance that the vacuum can become clogged, between the intake and the lower plastic hose near the disconnect to use the extension. If you no longer see dirt being picked up check this to see if you have a blockage, lots of hair will do this.All in all, I love this lil beast. It has outperformed $300+ vacs I've had in the past. Take good care of it and it'll take good care of you.
