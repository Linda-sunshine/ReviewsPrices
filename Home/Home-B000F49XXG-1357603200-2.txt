review/summary: Long live this machinereview/text: I have had one of these EC155 machines for 3 years. It has performed beautifully and made my wife and me thousands of cups of cappuccino. The poor thing has started wearing out and is taking longer and longer to steam the milk, so I just ordered another one to replace it! So long, little machine! At eighty dollars, you were a bargain.Other reviewers have noted that the cups this thing brews are unbelievable. There are very few places in the United States that can make a cappuccino like this. We simply have to have our morning and afternoon cups made at home. When I visit Italy, I tell my friends there that I have a DeLonghi at home. They are impressed. We have become cappuccino snobs.Yes, the machine is finicky and takes some getting used to. Remember to turn the steam knob off or you will get burned. But after brewing so many cups, I can do it with my eyes closed. I don't bother with a separate tamper, just use the plastic one that's attached to the machine. You need to hold the tamper down with your thumb while you press the coffee holder upward. And I've found the type of coffee bean doesn't matter as much as getting FRESH GROUND coffee.
