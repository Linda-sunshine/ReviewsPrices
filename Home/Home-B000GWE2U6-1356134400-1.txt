review/summary: Really Cute!review/text: I had the frog version of this for a couple of years, and then the motor would start to scream every time I refilled the water. Eventually, I couldn't take it anymore, so I got the owl, and it is great, quiet, and no screaming, plus it keeps my house better moisturized!
