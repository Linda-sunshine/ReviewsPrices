review/summary: Looks good - runs ok - but has limitationsreview/text: Apparently another product from the drawing board but not put into use before release. Used once to mix pancake batter which it did fairly well but I used a bowl instead of a pan, which would have had a flat bottom. Next thing I noticed was that the cord, because of the way you have to hold the blender, comes out the side of the blender TOWARD YOU. So, if you have to plug it in above your counter top,(the way most cabinets are built), the cord will come across the bowl/pan or the counter you're mixing in or on, come toward you, then it has to make a loop to get to the blender. Also, I attempted to clean the inside of the mixing end with a brush used on dishes - forget that - had to use my finger up behind the blades to get the soft batter out. Blender should come with a brush just for that job. Another important point, the instructions say to limit run time to 50 seconds. But then doesn't say how long to let it rest before using it again.
