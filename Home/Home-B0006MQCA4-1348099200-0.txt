review/summary: A great filter for a decent price.review/text: This is a really great filter pitcher. It fits so easily into our fridge and leaves plenty of room, and it hangs out over the edge of the shelf it is on, so it is really easy to fill cups. It will hold plenty of water for the average person, we just happen to use it A LOT so we fill it up often. That doesn't affect this review in the least, that's our problem, and this is about the performance of this product. It filters in a reasonable amount of time, and the water tastes great. I'm completely comfortable with using it to make our son's bottles with, which is another reason why we use it so much. The only downside, is the refill filters are expensive, but that is a whole different review.
