review/summary: piece of junkreview/text: Do not buy this piece of junk unless you prefer buying a new coffeemaker every 3 years. As soon as ours was past the 3 year warranty the warmer stopped working. Many times it shut off completely in mid-brew. Our kids bought one also and theirs stop working completely as soon as their warranty period was up. It made good coffee when it worked but it should be recalled for defective components.
