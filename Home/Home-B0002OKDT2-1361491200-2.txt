review/summary: No Fluff, Honest reviewreview/text: I ordered the juicer during a time when the price was about $140 with free shipping (prime membership....it pays for itself!). When i got the juicer, unpacked, plugged in and "nothing". It was dead. Looked online for a manual, no reset switch like the manual says...bummer. packed it back up, did the return easy peasy, didn't pay for return shipping and got a replacement juicer is a couple of short days that works like a champ.I love this juicer but here is a no fluff, honest review. No it is not REAL chrome, what is these days? Commercial? I don't think so, but I don't have a commercial kitchen. So far it's a nice fit. I've juiced wheat grass with a manual, hand cranked juicer. It's tiring but the juice is fabulous. With my new Omega juicer it's a snap, copious amounts of juice output and so easy to clean.To wrap this up - if you're looking for a product that is reasonable in cost, this is a great one to look at. Yes, it was a bummer to get the first one delivered and not have it work but s*** happens. The return and replacement was easy. I've tried other juicers, hands down, this one is the best.
