review/summary: An absolutely amazing Juicerreview/text: I bought this juicer over a year ago and it still looks new not to mention functions the same way it did on the very first day. It is pretty simple to assemble and clean up is a breeze. I had a Jack Lalane juicer before I bought this one and in my opinion, this Breville juicer is far superior when it comes to speed and amount. The feeding tube was mistakenly put into the dishwasher which cause it to enlarge. A quick email to Breville customer service and they shipped another one to me at NO cost.
