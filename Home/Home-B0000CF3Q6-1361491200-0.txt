review/summary: Works, but tends to spill at the sides when the water is bubbling upreview/text: My in-laws (who are from Italy) use this particular brand espresso maker, so I didn't hesitate when I bought it for my husband. It works, but water spits out of the sides when boiling up, so it gets a little messy. We do use it too often now because of this.
