review/summary: Fantasticreview/text: I don't think it is as &#34;cool&#34; as advertised but not really complaining as it is very comfortable. Especially since I do not have a &#34;topper&#34; on my mattress this is the perfect compliment and we absolutely notice the difference when not sleeping on it. However, I do think a lot of the reason we love this thing so much is because it compliments our 12&#34; memory foam mattress so well.
