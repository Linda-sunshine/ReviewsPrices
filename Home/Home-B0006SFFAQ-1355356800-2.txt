review/summary: Great Coffee Makerreview/text: I looked into specifically getting this coffee maker because I know of two other people that own this same one. When I was reading the reviews on here, even though the star rating overall was high, I was doubtful as whether or not to purchase it. Boy am I ever glad that I decided to buy it!The coffee maker is as simple as anything to use, even the programmable start, which I have found to be a luxury since my last coffee maker lacked this feature. It's easy to clean the pot and I like that it has the self clean feature.I've read in some other reviews that people don't like the water reserve to be in the back of the maker. I don't believe that this is a problem at all. I have my coffee maker on my counter, under a cabinet. I have pretty low cabinets, so I need to slide out the coffee maker in order to pour the water in. I actually like having to slide out the maker to do this as I can make sure that I don't spill on my counter and if I do, it's easy to clean up.The automatic shut off is a blessing as I always forget to turn off my coffee maker.I like the fact that I can change the heating setting on the machine to keep my carafe temp Hi. There's nothing like a nice, hot cup of coffee.I've been using this coffee maker at least once a day since I received it. I have no complaints and my coffee comes out great.Would I recommend this to a friend or purchase another one if I needed to? Absolutely!
