review/summary: Broke upon First Usereview/text: The reviews sounded great - and I knew I loved my Pampered Chefs cookie scoop - so I gave this scoop as a Christmas gift. Mistake. I've just learned the scoop broke the first time it was used. The weld broke. And, to top it off, I'm past the return window. Frustrating. Embarrassing. Garbage.
