review/summary: MAKES AN AMAZING CUP OF ESPRESSOreview/text: My son turned me on to this amazing espresso maker by browsing on-line, seeing its outstanding ratings and reading up on it, Well I'm here to tell you that it's worth every cent! It takes time and effort to make a cup, but with the combo of the Bialetti Moka Express and the Lavazza Super Crema Espresso and Caf&eacute; La Llave Espresso we bought at the same time...I don't know if there's anything better!! For us, the 6 cup size makes about a 7-8 oz. (?) cup with cream and you're heaven bound. Would definitely buy again if needed. I also bought a spare replacement gasket, so I'll have that on hand.If you love your coffee (espresso), then treat yourself to this little treasure. Do read up on it and view the 'how to' videos to ensure you want to expend the extra effort to own it.
