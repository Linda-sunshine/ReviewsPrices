review/summary: Less mess for spice and herb grindingreview/text: I recently started growing and drying my own stevia (it is very easy as the plant is so hardy). When I tried to grind my dried stevia in my KitchenAid Coffee Grinder, it blew stevia bits everywhere so I decided to try theKRUPS 203-42 Electric Spice and Coffee Grinder with Stainless Steel blades, Blackbecause the top-cap fits INSIDE the bottom rather than AROUND the bottom. I used the same stevia grinds that I had gotten from the Kitchenaid and the Krups 203-42 did not blow stevia anywhere; when I pushed down to grind, all the stevia stayed inside. Upon opening the lid, I was even more pleased to find that the Krups have given me an even finer grind than my KitchenAid. Also, the Krups 203-42 seems well made as well as stylish. Thanks Krups! Thanks Amazon for the great price and delivery!
