review/summary: Slippery Slopereview/text: Ok, this humidifier does humidify...quite well!...but...It has two major problems that make it almost completely ineffective. First, while it is branded &#34;quiet care&#34;, it is anything but quiet! We love white noise, but this is way overboard in the white noise department -- like a fan boat when on high. Second, the tanks (yes, it has two) have no handle for refilling. And they are designed with slippery and sharp angles, which makes them very difficult to fill...so much so that I dropped one and cut my hand trying to catch it. Then, dropped one again a week later and it cracked when it hit the tub. (Clearly, the engineers who designed this were so excited by its sleekness, they never tried filling these tanks themselves.)So now we have no humidifier...no humidity. Just dry air while we search the lists on Amazon for something a bit safer and easier to use...hopefully, still effective when it comes to moving water from tank to air. Seems like this combination of qualities shouldn't be that hard to achieve.
