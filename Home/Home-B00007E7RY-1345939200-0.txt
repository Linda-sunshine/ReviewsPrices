review/summary: Can save your lungsreview/text: I live in a dusty city (Phoenix, AZ) and a couple of years ago experienced a severe respiratory infections that left me very sensitive to environmental irritants. The only way I was able to work was to have one of these little gems in my office and one in my bedroom at home. The unit is relatively quiet while on low but is noticeable at higher settings. I also bought one of these for my two year old grandson who has had issues with respiratory infections in the last couple of months. Cost of ownership acceptable; I vacuum the inner and outer filter every three months. I do not replace the outer charcoal as suggested because all it provides is a reduction in airborne odors. I have had my oldest unit going on 4 years and it runs all night every night.
