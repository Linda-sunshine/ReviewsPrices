review/summary: Presto 06852 - Great kitchen tool!review/text: We are in the process of renovating our kitchen, so there is no access to the traditional cooking appliances. This skillet has saved the day, which is key as my family still expects culinary delights daily from my makeshift kitchen! I have used the skillet for everything from boiling water for rice or noodles to making bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches - cooking all ingredients at the same time. The size is great, as you can space out items you are cooking - and get it done all at the same time.The temperature seems to stay constant, so that is not an issue. The only minor issue is that the legs seem to keep loosening up. I believe this was mentioned by other users in previous reviews. This seems like a minor issue for the manufacturer to resolve.All in all, I am very happy with the product!
