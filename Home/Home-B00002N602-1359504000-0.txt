review/summary: Good constructionreview/text: I like this little cooker. It comes with very good detailed instructions for cooking various foods. The instructions addressed questions we had without having to do further research. I would recommend this. Keep in mind that you do not use the entire 6 QT so buy a larger one if you need to make 6 QT of food. The cooker can only be about half full for some items and two thirds full for other times. I will check those line markers and update if I got it wrong. 20130130.
