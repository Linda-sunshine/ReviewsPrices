review/summary: Not worthy of your moneyreview/text: I bought this scale because I own other Taylor products and generally respect this brand. This stupid scale is a huge letdown. It hasn't been accurate since the day we bought it. You can step on it four times and get four different readings. Move the scale and get another reading. I don't trust it at all. There is nothing more useless than a faulty scale so I would counsel anyone who is in the market to purchase a new bathroom scale to avoid this one. I have a Tanita scale that didn't make the move with me and think I'll just bite the bullet and buy another one. That was one accurate scale.
