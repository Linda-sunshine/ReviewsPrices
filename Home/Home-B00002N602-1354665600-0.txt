review/summary: Cooking under Pressurereview/text: This is a replacement for an earlier version of the same pressure cooker which has done faithful service for about twenty years. The new one is lighter in weight, but still seems sturdy enough. The new pressure gauge, a detachable knob which rocks when the pot comes to pressure, takes a little getting used to, but appears to work well. Only niggle: the instructiion book says don't cook split peas in this pot. Since I used the old one to cook split pea soup I find this unhelpful. Had I known this when I ordered the cooker I might have cancelled the purchase.
