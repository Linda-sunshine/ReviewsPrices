review/summary: Excellent HUGE pan for the pricereview/text: This is a top quality Cast-Iron Skillet. It is huge. On our stove top it encroaches upon the other neighboring burners. You can easily fry 8-10 eggs at a time in it. If you were to cook a meal such as a chicken in sauce dish you could feed 8-10 hungry eaters. You wouldn't use the handle to lift the pan as its a 2 handed process due to its weight. We are a family of 5 and would have probably done better with the smaller skillet that comes with a lid. There are no lids available for this skillet that I could find. I would have given it 5 stars had there been a lid offered. We store it on top of our stove and oil after each use.
