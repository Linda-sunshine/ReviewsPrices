review/summary: amazing product that works!review/text: I had my doubts because of the other negative reviews on amazon; but I'm glad I bought the product because it works!I bought this product for a small bathroom that does not have a window nor a fan.It absorbs a tank of water every 3-4 days on a 24/7 cycle. It definitely works; our towels dry quickly and there is no moisture in the air after a shower. I air-dry clothes in the bathroom and a perk of this dehumidifier is that my clothes dry faster!
