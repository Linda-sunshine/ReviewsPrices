review/summary: Best Price on the Best Filters Anywherereview/text: Now, I admit I haven't looked at Sam's, but the discount price at our local stores is $31 for five filters. Here, you get six for less. We gave up plastic water bottles for sake of the environment and have been using our Brita for years. We use the filtered water to refill sports bottles, thermos bottles, coffeemakers, juicers, blenders, etc. So we go through many of these and this price is excellent. These leave no residue on the clear Keurig container, so it is obvious the filters are working; plus the taste is pure and clean. Excellent value from Amazon and free shipping with Prime.
