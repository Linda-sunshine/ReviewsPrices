review/summary: Chipped inside while washing with soft spongereview/text: Well, I got three uses out of it before it chipped on me when washing it. It was well taken care of and I loved using it. Only non-Metal utensils were used, no banging or bumping when moving it, no scouring pads used, etc. Otherwise a fine product that looked great and cooked great stove or oven. I noticed another area on the bottom where if you press it gently you can see the enamel is not bound to the cast iron and when I pressed it down with my thumb it chipped also. If it chips inside it's not safe for use.Just adding a review to help people evaluate the "chip" risk when making a decision on this otherwise nice product.
