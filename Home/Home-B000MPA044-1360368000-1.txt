review/summary: Design flaw?review/text: Feb 2013 updateI have discovered that my issues below are caused by either too much volume of food in the cooker or too thick a liquid. It seems to work ok if I am careful about what I put in it. Better directions and troubleshooting in the manual would have been helpful. I have upgraded my rating to reflect that the fact that this does work fine for me if I watch these two issues. I do have the small problem that some mention that the little red valve sort of sticks so the pressure does not build quickly enough. My solution is to open and quickly close once there is steam forming. Then the valve pops right up but you have to be quick or the the safety lock won't let you close it.I have tried two of these. Both had an issue reported by many others in that when it is building to high pressure it suddenly beeps as if the timer is done and switches itself to warm. Even if it is unplugged, replugged and then you set high-pressure timer and press start it will immediately beep and switch itself to warm. For several meals I have had to keep unplugging and plugging and restarting to keep it running at something near pressure. But this doubled the cooking time and I ruined a couple of meals this way. This issue seems to be much worse if the cooker is hot/warm before starting the high-pressure mode (and yes, i have let it cool for more than 5 minutes between activities). If you are just pressure cooking something from cold and not using the interruption method, it works most of the time. But if you want to use brown or saute and not wait 30 minutes before pressure cooking, forget it.
