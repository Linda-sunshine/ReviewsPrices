review/summary: Love itreview/text: I love it. Even though it does not need a filter, I had some disc filters (Melitta 628354 Disc Coffeemaker Filters ) and coffee has ver little residue at bottom. I had also purchased additional glass top but so far the plastic one works fine and has not broken. I let the pot cool off though, before removing the cover.
