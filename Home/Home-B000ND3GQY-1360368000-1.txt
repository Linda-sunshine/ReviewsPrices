review/summary: it works... handle is not as comfy as i have read.review/text: not a professional round bottom carbon steel heavy gauge wok, but it seems to be the best option for occasional electric range asian cooking, plus you don't need to worry about seasonig it or rusting. needs more oil than a round bottom wok to prevent sticking but it cooks fine if you keep ingredients moving with a wooden spoon or spatula.... tossing the food is difficult and dangerous due to the size of the wok and the handle not being very comfortable or thick, plus the angle is a bit too horizontal, it should angle up more to make tossing easier, i have to wrap and tie a cloth around it to give me better grip and control when tossing ingredients. i never use the lid so... it hasn't cracked on me. good for the price and what i use it for, but not perfect.
