review/summary: Comfortable, but at what cost?review/text: I chose this mattress because of the number of high ratings received.Now I feel deceived!Having not done my homework I didn't know you should air these things out upon opening, but it didn't matter, because right away the smell was so strong that I put it outside for over 48 hours in the hopes that the smell would be diminished. I also emptied a box of Baking Soda on 1 side, left for 2 hours, vacuumed out, flipped and repeated the process.That probably did something, but not enough. The smell seems more like a perfume than a manufacturing smell, and I wonder what I'd be smelling if the perfume weren't so strong. My son, 6 years old, tells me he loves the smell...of course he doesn't know any better.I used it for one night and had a hard time sleeping, all my sheets clothes smelled of this aroma so I took the mattress off the bed, and let it air out for another week, this time indoors since it is too cold outside. This time I walked back and forth on the mattress with the hope of pushing the aroma out of the foam cells.It still smells!!!I'd return it if I thought packing up a mattress and shipping it would be worth my time...It is comfy though.
