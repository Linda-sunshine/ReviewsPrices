review/summary: Great little Vacreview/text: Great suction with our without the attachment. So nice having the attachment right on board, no more hunting in the linen closet for it. I have a VERY large Maine Coon cat with long shaggy fur and this picks it up with no problem. Great for cleaning up around the litter box too! This is my favorite hand held vac I have ever had and I have tried quite a few. Wouldn't trade it for any of the cordless that always seemed to need a charge when I needed it
