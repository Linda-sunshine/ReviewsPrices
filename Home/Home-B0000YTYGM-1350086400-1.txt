review/summary: Bitterreview/text: I love coffee. One of the great pleasures of my older life. And we know, small physical pleasures are the last refuge of the totally disillusioned. This thing managed to further disillusion me. Cuisinart seems to feel the need to make extremely complicated that which ought to be fairly simple. I cannot get this thing to make coffee that is not bitter. Causes me to verge on tears and/or insanity. Why, why, why, why must they create a pot cover- that cap deal- that is so complicated it cannot be cleaned. I have no dishwasher, and I try shoving Q-Tips into the little openings in the cap, they come out usually pretty black, and I tried gold cone filters and paper filters. I tried different coffees. This chizz is always bitter. I die slowly inside, remembering the vaguely maple-syrupy, walnutty taste of the real thing. I don't know what reviewer #1 is talking about. Must be a sock puppet. I have only had it a few weeks and I can't take it- I'm trying a Bunn even thought they made the ovens in the WWII camps. Desperate. Waste of money.
