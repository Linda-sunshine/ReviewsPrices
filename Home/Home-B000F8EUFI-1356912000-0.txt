review/summary: Freaking fantastic!!!review/text: I was very skeptical about this vacuum when I was looking at it on Amazon. It looked super cheap and crappy and even the reviews still made me skeptical. I was looking around at other vacuums, which all turned out to be extremely expensive for my budget. So, I caved and bought this one. So, let me tell you! I have a 60 lb White German Shepherd who sheds A LOT and also likes to create a lot of messes with his food and chewy sticks as well as tearing up paper and strewing it all over the floor. Also, my husband and I come in and out of our apartment quite a lot, which causes dirt from outside to trail into the carpet, sinking deep down into it. We had a Eureka that someone threw away before moving and we'd been using that one, but it's suction was HORRIBLE, which made me feel as though we were left with a still dirty carpet. After I bought this Dirt Devil vacuum, I tried it out. When I finished using it, I looked in the tank and low and behold, there was all of the dust, hair, and dirt that had collected in and on the carpet. I was incredibly pleased with this purchase! Unfortunately, you have to make sure you do not vacuum up any type of rubber band or string because it causes a horrible odor and causes the motor in the vacuum to weaken quite considerably and it's suction stops working. I've decided to order another one of these vacuums because of how great the price and the performance is!
