review/summary: Much better than my old humidifier!review/text: Cute design and super quiet. My old humidifier was so loud you could hear it from downstairs when it was running in an upstairs bedroom. This one is so quiet you barely know it's on when you are standing right next to it. The on light is not very bright so it doesn't interfere with sleep. The dial allows you to adjust exactly the amount of mist you want. My only complaint is that after you clean it it takes a couple of days to completely dry out. But, maybe all humidifiers are the same way.
