review/summary: Great but have a little need to improvereview/text: This product is cool. It took just 15-20 mins. for the food usually takes me for one or two hours. I love it because it never disappointed me no matter I cook chicken, rib, or beef.If I have to pick... the only draw back is the lid were not connected to the pot. If it was, I wouldn't need to find a place to put the heavy lid every time.The product itself has no problem and hope this can help you for choosing.
