review/summary: Digital Scalereview/text: I purchased this to replace a much more expensive mechaical scale. I knew from many years of working in R&D; that any product using a &#34;Strain Gauge would be suspect as to accuracy/ linearity.It seems that they have found a way to correct the non-linearity of the typical Strain Gauge Assembly!So I have checked it with known weights and it is close enough for household uses.It has a really excellent warranty and has performed well in the 1st year of use.The stlye might not please everyone. But one only sees it when doing a weight check anyway.
