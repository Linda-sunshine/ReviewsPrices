review/summary: Great chairreview/text: This chair is great!For it's price, I suppose it's good.I used to use a $100 synthetic leather chair from Staples that used to be extremely comfortable.However, after about 3 years of use, the leather wore out and the so did the cushioning, making the chair extremely unpleasant to sit on for periods of longer than 30 minutes.So far, this chair has been great to me, it feels nice and I don't notice any discomfort during work or play.
