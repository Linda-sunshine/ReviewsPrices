review/summary: Look Out Belowreview/text: This is the second of these that I have purchased, though the first from Amazon. We have relatives visit throughout the year, after all this is Maine :-). Anyway, the first lasted about 4 months before it tore around a seam and the in-laws headed for the floor. The company that makes these replaced this with a much smaller and cheaper model. We figured the first was a fluke so we ordered this one as it is much larger and seemingly better then the one they sent us. So imagine my surprise when just 4 months later, once again, the thing tears in the exact same place as the first, this time my elderly Aunt headed for the floor screaming in the night!I thought Amazon would make this right, the reason i bought it here to begin, but they tell me I have to deal with the manufacturer again. Not looking forward to fighting with them, being promised an equal replacement and then receiving the lower end model. My advice, stay clear of this model or at least the left side of it.
