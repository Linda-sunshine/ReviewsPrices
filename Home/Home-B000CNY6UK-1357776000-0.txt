review/summary: A must have for any espresso drinkerreview/text: I was first introduced to this type of espresso maker by my Italian aunt and loved how easy it was to make espresso. It's super easy to use and a breeze to clean. If you love espresso as much as I do, you need to have one of these in your kitchen! =D
