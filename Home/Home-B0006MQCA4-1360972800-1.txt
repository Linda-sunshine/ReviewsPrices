review/summary: Works like a dreamreview/text: Three months in and the water still tastes great! I bought extra filters and you should too. Although I saw them on sale at Home Depot for about the same price. But yeah I love the front spout and it's easy to refill and the filtering isn't too slow. I recommend!
