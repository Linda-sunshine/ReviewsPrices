review/summary: Terrific one cup coffee maker!!!review/text: I ordered this coffee maker to replace a simular Black & Decker product that lasted me 25 years.It makes a great cup of coffee in about one minute. You have the option of using either their washable reusable filter or using paper filters. I prefer the paper. Less mess to clean up. Just grab and toss in the trash. You also have the option of using their travel mug or your own. I prefer using my own ceramic coffee mug. I drink my coffee at home.To measure, just fill your mug with water and pour into the machine's container. I use a one cup coffee scoop for proper measurement of the ground coffee.I've had none of the problems mentioned on some of the other negative reviews here. My machine does not turn on by itself and the coffee and/or coffee grinds do not splash all over the counter. To these people, I would say if you don't know how to work a simple coffee maker, maybe you should consider life with the Amish where there is no electricity and no gadgets for you to hassle with.
