review/summary: Great valuereview/text: In the 10 years or so that I've used Amazon, I've maybe written a few reviews. So...for me to do so means that this product has wowed me. For a $10 filter to stay strong for 6 months is amazing IMHO. I installed my filter in July and still don't taste any chlorine...in late January. I changed it as its just past the 6 month mark and figured I should, just because. But its possible this lil guy would keep on trucking for several more months. I'm very impressed and thankful for a good deal like this. Thanks to Culligan.
