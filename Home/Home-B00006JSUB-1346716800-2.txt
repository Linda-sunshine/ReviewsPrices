review/summary: Be patient; you'll be pleasedreview/text: These pans are not super-amazing, professional-grade cookware.I hope you didn't expect that, especially considering the price.But they are just fine, and will perform well, given proper care and regular use.We make pizza in it, and the boys love it.Also great for eggs, tortillas, ground beef, and stir-fried veggies.First of all, disregard the "pre-seasoned" bit in the product name.This is to keep it from rusting, not for making a great cooking surface.When you get the pan, wash it thoroughly, scrubbing the inside with a rough rag or really fine steel wool (like #0000).Then coat it with lard (rendered from bacon), and bake it upside down (with a baking sheet underneath) at 250F for about three hours.This will give you a good start on building a great cooking surface or "season", which is really polymerized lipids.Then just use the pan a lot. Cook lots of really fatty stuff in it. Use a stainless-steel spatula with a smooth edge.Simply wipe out with a paper towel between uses, whenever possible.If it gets really dirty (e.g. has lots of charred black bits in it), use a washcloth and water to clean it up.Never use soap (some people talk about "light" soaps and what not; I say no soap at all).Never leave it wet. I recommend sticking it back on the stove for a few minutes to dry it.Eventually, you'll fill in all the little nooks/crannies/pits with polymerized lipids and have a fantastic pan.Don't give up; it's worth the effort.
