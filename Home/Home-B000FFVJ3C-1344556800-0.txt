review/summary: dehydratorreview/text: Worked outstanding. Dried everything! Even tomato sauce for my camping trip with my son. We ate very well for a week with a just add water menu and the food was very tasty. My second dehydrator. My first one was another brand and this one is head and shoulders better!
