review/summary: He Likes It! She's Not Enthused!review/text: The vacuum is used to tidy up around a pet's litter box in a carpeted room and, I find, it's well-suited to the task. My wife, on the other hand, finds the hand-held Eureka to be heavy, cumbersome, and loud. She would have preferred a battery-operated device, but understands power would, most likely, have been compromised. The result is I seize the opportunity to use the vacuum whenever I can and enjoy it; the weight and cord are not issues for me. It's a "four star" vacuum for this guy and a "two star" unit for my wife---- hence, the three star compromise!
