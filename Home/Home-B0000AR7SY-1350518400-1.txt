review/summary: Super Messy - Hate this one!review/text: I think this grinder grinds just fine. Nothing exceptional - but fine for coffee. I don't make espresso at home, so I can't speak to that.However, this grinder is SO messy. My counter is constantly covered with coffee grounds. I have tried cleaning it well, not cleaning it, running it a bit after the grounds are no longer in the hopper, shaking it a bit after the grinding to reduce static. We have tried light roast, dark roast, beans with more oil, less oil... Nothing works. Without exception, every single time I pull out the little plastic drawer of ground coffee, a cloud of grounds poofs out all over the counter (and all over me if I forget and stand too close). I am so frustrated with this stupid machine that I want to throw it out the window.I wish that I hadn't given it so much time - I kept reading about it a trying something to try to correct things - I should have just returned it right away. After 6 months of use, it is going to Goodwill. I will never buy Capresso again!
