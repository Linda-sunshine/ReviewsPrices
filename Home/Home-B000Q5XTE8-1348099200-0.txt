review/summary: Amazed, though short term, at the Quality and overall productreview/text: I got this chair because I telecommute quite a bit and am at a desk/table at home for quite a bit of time. The repurposed kitchen chair was just not cutting it anymore, with back aches as I sat longer. I looked at the reviews and decided to give it a shot. I am a Prime member, so I opted for the non-rush shipping and got an additional I believe $10 off the price. The strange part was, I got it in a couple of days anyway!Anyway, part of my job is I am on site for setting up new locations for my company, so I see a lot of office furniture. We have been getting the Aeron chair over the last couple of years, which is a great chair.. and about %800. When I started to take this out of the box, I was impressed at the heft and quality of the parts. They were heavy, and solid, not flimsy. Assembly was very easy, just look at the steps and any one will be fine.I have used it for a few weeks now... it is solid when I 'plop' down.. (I am 275, though shrinking).. it rolls easily. There ae not, 'uh oh' sounds when I lean back. The arms are solid when I poush myself out (bad knee). The controls for the seat angle, height and back are easy to adjust and reach.I am just amazed at the quality for the price here at Amazon. Again, it's only a few weeks, but at this point, very happy with the purchase.
