review/summary: Does Exactly What It Saysreview/text: The great reviews are well deserved, especially the one from the Cajun cook, who in my opinion should quit his job and sell these :) Anyway, this knife sharpener does exactly what it's suppose to, seems made out of good quality plastic, and has made my task of chopping onions so much more bearable. All my knives are razor sharp and a pleasure to use again. I no longer dread buying raw meat that I have to trim or cube myself. I really like this product a lot.
