review/summary: handy little steamerreview/text: This steamer worked great on drapes I had recently hung that had creases in them. Brought it to my daughters new apartment so she could get wrinkles out of her new curtains and she liked it so much that she kept it to use for her clothing as well. It holds a decent amount of water and the cord is nice and long. We didn't have any trouble at all with water dripping or spitting.
