review/summary: Excellentreview/text: I'm a pretty serious cook, and this pan has been a very welcome addition to my kitchen. Huge surface, heats very evenly, you can use it to prepare three different things without mixing them it's so big. But to me, the crucial questions are how it holds up with use and especially how impervious the nonstick surface is. In this case, several months of near daily use in, I am very impressed. There is not a single blemish on the nonstick surface yet and the handle is as solid as the day I got it.Highly recommended, very satisfied.
