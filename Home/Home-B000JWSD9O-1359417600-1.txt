review/summary: Nothing what I expected at all! Worst night's sleep ever!review/text: NOTHING soft about these sheets. If you have any sort of pillow top or memory foam topper, order a size larger. These did not fit our bed so I thought since I didn't have a bedskirt that I would at least use these to cover our boxsprings which are smaller as it doesn't have the pillow top or memory foam on it. After one washing in cold water and lowest dryer setting, these didn't even cover the boxsprings. I used the pillow case and flat sheet one night and the non-fitting fitted sheet because that was all I had. That was the worst night's sleep ever....the sheets are loud when turning over like using newspapers as a sheet..... In the middle of the night I finally stripped the bed and slept on my mattress cover and used regular blankets. (My fault I had thrown away the packaging never imagining how uncomfortalbe these are. ) I should have kept all the packaging and returned them. I am still on the hunt for some durable and SOFT, quiet sheets. It may be best to buy sheets in a store. I was going off of the mostly good reviews on these sheets.
