review/summary: Disappointed will not buy another.review/text: I purchased this Keurig B60 Special Edition Brewing System in May 2010. It functioned as expected for the first 12 months. (Only used on weekends about 5 cups per week). After about twelve months of use (using only filtered or bottled water)and following the manufacturer's cleaning maintenance suggestions it started to malfunction. At first it started to regurgitate the water back into the resevoir and would shut itself off or not come on at all. The display would dim and the set-up menu would appear and freeze up. After following the trouble shooting guide and on-line trouble shooting suggestions it's performance did not improve. Needless to say after reviewing many of the negitive comments (which sound a lot like mine) it is obvious, that to this company it is better business to build and promote an inferior product than to invest in research and development to create a longer lived product. So in a nutshell...they want your money not your satisfaction.
