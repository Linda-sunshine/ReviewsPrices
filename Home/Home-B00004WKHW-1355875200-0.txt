review/summary: Working Excellentreview/text: So far, so good. I know a few reviews indicated it did not last too long, but we replaced the same one and it lasted over 8 years. This one seems to be of the same quality, and we use it all the time. For the price, I would be happy to get a couple of years out of it anyway.It is a good size; larger than some of the similar models that compete with it. If volume is important, than this is a good unit.Overall, I have been happy with Cuisinart.
