review/summary: Easy to clean!review/text: We are a family of 5, so the size is ideal for us, but also makes it a challenge to handle - my 13-yr old daughter struggles to move this pan around between uses. The edge of the lid is sharp - won't cut, but really uncomfortable to handle during washes. Otherwise a really good pan, and cooks food well without sticking badly. The base seems to get much hotter, faster than the rest of the pan, so be careful!
