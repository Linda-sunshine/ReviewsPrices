review/summary: works great!review/text: I bought this juicer because it had really good reviews and they were correct. I have been using it for about a month and it works great. It is easy to clean and seems to extract a lot of juice out of what I use. I would recommend this item to anyone who want to start juicing and does not want to spend $100 or more on a juicer. I am very satisfied!
