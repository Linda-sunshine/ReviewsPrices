review/summary: Best Travel Mug Everreview/text: Seriously. It keeps my coffee warm well into the afternoon; it's durable, as I toss it around often; and the snap shut option makes it easy to open and secure. Washing it has been a slight problem, but I think they sell cleaners specifically for this.
