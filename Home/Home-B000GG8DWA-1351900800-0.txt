review/summary: Excellent Unitreview/text: Just unpacked and turned it on. Seems to be an excellent heater that will save me a lot of money over the winter months as I turn down the house heat and just use the Optimus in my computer room. The only gripe (the reason why I removed one star) is that the warranty (with the exception of the Amazon 30-day return window) is somewhat bogus. I mean, after paying the cost of returning a defective unit and then a $15-20 fee for return shipping, I would be paying more than the cost of purchasing a new unit. So, I consider that there is no real warranty after 30 days. It's okay, as I expect it to be a reliable product.
