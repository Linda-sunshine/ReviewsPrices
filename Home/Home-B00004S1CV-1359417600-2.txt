review/summary: Favorite Coffee Thermos!review/text: This thing is awesome. Seriously. I got it for Christmas two years ago and it's still going strong. I use it nearly every day. Keeps my coffee hot literally all day. It's great for loose-leaf tea too. I've never had this thing leak. You can wash the lids in the dish-washer and just handwash the container. I really can't think of a more awesome travel mug. Buy it.
