review/summary: nothing spectacular. kind of disappointed.review/text: heavier than I expected. suction mediocre. blows out dirt out the back side. no brush attachment. kind of cumbersome to lug around. can't really endorse this product. it's okay and price is reasonable, but nothing to write home about.
