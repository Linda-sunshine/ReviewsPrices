review/summary: Terribly designed and frustratingreview/text: I'll make this short and simple. The design is awful and not not well thought out. There's a gap between the reservoir and the handle so you have to be SUPER careful and steady when filling and putting it in the fridge or else faucet water will escape down the HOLLOW handle (again another horrible design) and mix in with the already filtered water. This would happen to me every time I went to go fill it and it would always spill out of the pitcher and all on my floor.I also didn't like the way the water tasted plastic-y. It still had a weird plastic taste even after I washed it.I returned it and got the Bobble water pitcher and like that one MUCH better.
