review/summary: Worth the moneyreview/text: I had the frog crane humidifier for one year before it gave out. I went and purchased an ugly, other brand hoping to get more life out of it. Forget it. Not only was it ugly, but it did not have the functionality of the crane. I returned the other brand and ordered the cow. So cute! I am using softened water hoping to extend its life. The only thing that keeps it from being five star, are the ears. Like another reviewer I would prefer the mist come straight out of the top on the cow like it does the frog. Worth the money, though and I will be a crane next time. Even if it is only a year again.
