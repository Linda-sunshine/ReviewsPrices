review/summary: So far its been greatreview/text: I have the original unitl I purchased about 32 years ago, which still worked great but the plastic bowl which I replaced 10 years ago needed replacing again, the cost of the bowl, flat lid, and metal balde were almost the same price as a new unit, and as the original motor was so old I decided to order the complete set, when you factor in the other lid, dough blade, and shreading/slicing disks, its a much better deal to replace the whole unit. I was going to continue to use the original base unit, but the bowl does not actually fit, that said the new base unit is white and more modern looking and seems as heavy duty as the original. The only complaint I have is that the flat lid will only fit properly with the Cusinart name towards the front of the unit, other wise it binds and is very difficult to remove and re-orient, unfortunately, its not overly obvious when fitting the lid which way it needs to go.
