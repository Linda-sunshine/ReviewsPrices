review/summary: Worked great the 1st time, the 2nd time I tried to used it it wouldn't suck up the water/solutionreview/text: So disappointed in this product. I should have known better from the reviews I read. I have to say the 1st time I used it it was wonderful, then next time, a mere month later, the sucking action did not work. I had pre treated my floors, and was left with trying to dry my carpet with towels after realizing that the sucker wasn't sucking. Tried to figure out the cause, and was left scratching my head. Now I have no idea what to do. Very Upset.
