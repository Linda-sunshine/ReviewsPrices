review/summary: Surprisingly Effective for the Pricereview/text: This inexpensive overflow cover works well for the price. I was skeptical at first because it doesn't create a perfect seal around the overflow drain...then again, I'm not an engineer. It keeps the water away from the overflow drain, even when the water almost reaches the open circle on top of it. At $6, it's a great deal considering the plumbing bills it's preventing.When you first get it, it's best to wet the suction cups, apply it over the overflow drain, and then fill your tub. After that, to regularly maintain it I've been washing it with a bit of dish soap and a toothbrush every week or so to keep it from getting any mineral buildup.
