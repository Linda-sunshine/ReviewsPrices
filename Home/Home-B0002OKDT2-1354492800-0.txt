review/summary: Product Malfunctionreview/text: This juicer produced some amazing juice when it worked...I received this juicer on Wednesday November 28, and immediately I wanted to try it out, so I went out and bought some carrots and apples to try and it produced some amazing crisp tasty and foam free juice..it assembled very easy and the instruction was straight forward.. Cleanup was simple and quick.. Thursday November 29th I decided to try some spinach, kale, beets, pineapples, and apples.. It worked perfectly again.. I was sold!!! Then Friday November 30th my wife and I decided to go on a juice fast for the weekend from Friday to Monday at 12:00 noon, so I go to our grocer and purchased $35 work of organic fruits and vegetables.. We wash and chopped them and at the beginning of juicing the carrots the motor of the juicer started making loud noises.. I turn the machine off and clean the parts and reassembled it.. But it didn't help and I started smelling something burning.. So I hit reverse and disassembled and reassemble again but it didn't help... So I decided to return... I really like this product and will buy another I just hope it work ...
