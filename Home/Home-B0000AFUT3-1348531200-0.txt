review/summary: Wrong Voltagereview/text: Unfortunately it was the wrong voltage for this Country but they very kindly said they would refund the money to me, as the postage to return it was 34.60, more than the light.The light was good but a pity it didn't work in the UK. A shame when you can buy a camera and an I-Pad in the States and only need a plug adapter!
