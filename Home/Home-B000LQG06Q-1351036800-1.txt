review/summary: perfect for college studentsreview/text: college beds are notorious for two things: being terribly uncomfortable and being squeaky as hell. both of those things were true for my bed and after spending one night in my plastic coated cheap spring mattress i knew i needed one of these mattress pads to get through the year. my roommate has the foam one that sort of looks like a squishy egg carton, but i wanted more of a memory foam approach.since buying this, my bed has become quite a popular place among friends because its so comfortable. i've had people refuse to leave my bed at times.before buying it, however, i did a lot of amazon research and decided on this one, mainly because of price (#strugglingcollegestudent) and the relatively good reviews. it arrived in a timely manner and the box for the twin xl was not too big or too heavy to carry from the mailroom to my dorm (which was one of my concerns that was not answered through the reading of other reviews) i was also worried about the smell. i read that this this would smell like mint chocolate straight from the box, and to my surprise that was true, it's not a bad smell and it goes away after a few days so it wasnt a problem for me.this mattress pad also holds heat which for me is a pro because nights here get pretty cold so if you like a cooler bed, this is probably not for you.like some other reviewers said: this is not a replacement for a bad mattress, it probably won't do anything for a bad mattress because it is so squishy. this mattress pad is good for a supportive/ over-firm bed that needs to be a little more comfortable.
