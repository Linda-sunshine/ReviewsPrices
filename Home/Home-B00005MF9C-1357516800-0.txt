review/summary: Perfect one cup coffee potreview/text: This is the fourth one of these I have owned. I wore out the other three. I'm the lone coffee drinker in my house and I only have one cup a day, so this little coffee brewer is perfect for me. It doesn't take up much room on the counter and it doesn'trequire paper filters as it has a permanent one that can be rinsed out after every use. I use refrigerated filtered water for my coffee and this brewer puts out a steaming hot cup almost immediately. Amazing. And the travel mug that comes with it is perfect for traveling and keeps the coffee hot for a long time.
