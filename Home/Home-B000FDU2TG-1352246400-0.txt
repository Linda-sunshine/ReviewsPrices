review/summary: Blender Pitcher leaks -- still!review/text: I have read reviews saying that the leaking issues with the carafe have been solved. Not true. I have owned this blender for under a year and the carafe leaks all over the place. The blender is now un-usable. For $100, I expect any appliance to last well over 12-months.I have contacted customer service (800) 541-6390 and they agreed to send a replacement pitcher. But, there is a two to four week back order, so it will be awhile before I receive it. I use my blender every day, so this is quite a hassle. I don't think I'll be purchasing any more Kitchen Aid products.If you try to contact Kitchen Aid, forget about sending them an email. They won't respond. It's best to use the customer service number.
