review/summary: A great starter piecereview/text: First, if you haven't used any cast iron before, be prepared. This is a very heavy piece. But the heat is very even; it really is the only pan to use for a risotto, yankee pot roast, or any number of soups. I appreciate the quality of Le Creuset, but I just can't stomach the price. This dutch oven is much more attainable and after 5 months of use I am very happy with it.
