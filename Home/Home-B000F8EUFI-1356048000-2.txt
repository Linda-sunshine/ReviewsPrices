review/summary: works greatreview/text: The Dirt Devil Dynamite work's great for me. I have a small apartment with two area rug's 5'x7' and 10'x12', but I also do general dusting with it. 7 amp's really work's well picking up dirt and cat hair (while using less electricity). I must say though, it has much more suction with the "CRUCIAL VACUME"$5.00 washable filter. It's not a paper filter and though they filter well, they don't flow as well as nylon washable does. I'm glad I bought it. Both the vac, and the washable filter.
