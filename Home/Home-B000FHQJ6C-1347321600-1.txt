review/summary: Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Juicerreview/text: I've been using the Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Juicer for about two months now and juicing has helped me to lose weight where other programs have failed. This is an excellent product for the money, particularly for someone who wants an entry level juicer and is not yet ready for a higher end Brevell. I needed to determine if this was going to work for me and whether I could commit long-term to juicing and I wanted to do so without spending a ton of cash up front on a costly juicer. At the same time, I wanted something that worked. Voila! This is the product. Easy clean up, handles most fruits and vegetables, although I don't get as much from softer fruits and vegetables as I would like, and the clean-up is easy. It works great, but just a few things that might be germane to all juicers. You do need to line the refuse/pulp bin. It makes clean up easier. Introducing frozen fruits is not a good idea! It does struggle a tiny bit with really hard stuff like ginger, but I still get all the juice I need from it. I would like a larger juice cup - one of the features of the higher-end Brevell, but I have few complaints. There is a lot of pulp generated from juicing but I've observed that there really isn't any more pulp generated by this machine than others on the market. I'm very happy with my purchase and so are family members that I've encouraged to juice who also bought this product. Oh, and make sure that you buy the version with the metal clasps! That's a must!!!
