review/summary: I love it...review/text: My in-laws have this coffee pot and after Thanksgiving there, our coffee pot soon quit working. (A $20 cheapie) we were reluctant for the price but we loved the coffee there and it's well worth it. We've yet to have any grounds in our coffee as stated in some reviews and maybe the mouth is small where you add water to the reservoir but I don't have a problem with it.
