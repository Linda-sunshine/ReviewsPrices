review/summary: Best tie rack!review/text: I love this tie rack! It's inexpensive, easy to put together, easy to use, and sturdy enough to last a long time in the closet. If it does break, it's only $3 to replace it!! Have over 30 ties and belts and it's so helpful to organize it all instead of throwing ties over a hanger.
