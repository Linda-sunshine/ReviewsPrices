review/summary: proceed with cautionreview/text: Worked flawlessly for 1.5 years, then failed. Seems its a common problem. Cheap build. No customer service. They will ship a new one if you send your old one in and send $45. Check out this link[...] and also check out the reviews with 1 star. Midland is losing its name as a reputable company. I will not buy another midland product.
