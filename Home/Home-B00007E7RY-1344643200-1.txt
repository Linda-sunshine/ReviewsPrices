review/summary: Finallyreview/text: My wife has allergies, quite regularly congested and making a very unattractive snorting/coughing noise, especially first thing in the morning. I shopped around and was amazed at what some specialty stores were trying to get for an air cleaner. I'm a skeptic at heart, for good reason and most of the the products out there that supposedly promote health do little more than to promote your subconscious into believing they work (several readers just got mad right there). My wife was running the vacuum every day, dusting, complaining about carpets and what the dogs dragged in, well quite frankly, driving me nuts. So I've had an air cleaner or two in the past, I fell for those stupid Sharper Image Ionic Breezes when the were priced two for one (seriously my friends, that was a huge clue for a 3 year old....shame, shame, shame....) So a few weeks after getting this air purifier my wife comes to me and says, "I can breath better, I'm not stopped up in the morning like I used to be!" And right at that point it occurred to me that those hacking noises had gone away. I must say, I don't miss those noises, and for $129 bucks that is what I call a bargain. I only have to replace a $7 filter every 3 months and another $50 filter every 3 to 5 years, that just makes the deal sweeter. Oh yeah, I'm really happy! My wife can breath and I don't have to feel like I'm married to my wife's mother!!!!!
