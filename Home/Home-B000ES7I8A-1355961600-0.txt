review/summary: Haven't boiled anything on stove since buying thisreview/text: I am on my second kettle, after using the first one practically every single day for two years (it finally stopped working). I use this to boil water to brew tea or coffee, or when I quickly need some boiling water when cooking. It will boil two cups in 2-3 minutes; if you fill it completely (about 6-8) cups, it will take longer. The kettle can stay plugged in, and there is an easy to use switch to turn it on. When the water boils, it switches itself off. There is a prominent light that tells you when it is on. Pouring out of the kettle is easy.In conclusion, a safe, efficient, and easy-to-use device.
