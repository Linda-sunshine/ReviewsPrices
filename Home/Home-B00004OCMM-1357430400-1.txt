review/summary: Replaced All My Electric Openersreview/text: I finally bought a highly rated, more expensive electric can opener about two years ago to replace the cheap, short-lived electric openers used in the past. Soon, it was not operating properly. Cans had to be carefully guided through the opener and restarted several times. On reading reviews on the OXO opener, I ordered one. After I opened several cans, I threw the electric opener in the garbage. The OXO opener is very easy to use on any can and provides smooth opening. When our daughter-in-law put an electric opener on her Christmas wish list, I ordered an OXO for her. As soon as she used it, she understood why we didn't give her an electric opener. She is as big a fan of the OXO opener as we are.
