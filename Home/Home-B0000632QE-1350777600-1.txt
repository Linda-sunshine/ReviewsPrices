review/summary: I would give it ten stars if I couldreview/text: I originally bought the Boerner slicer unit off an infomercial over twenty years ago. I've never regretted it. I have been using it nearly daily in that time and it's never put away. It is always on the counter, ready to use. I've looked at units that have all the parts/pieces put together and operate with a dial but I just won't give up function for form. The blades of all the pieces are as sharp as the day I bought the unit. I've considered buying the newer unit but the only thing I would gain is the ability to have more thickness choices, which may not be enough of a reason to spend the money. As the old saying goes -- if it ain't broke, don't fix it. As suggested, don't use it without the safety handle. This is the voice of experience speaking.
