review/summary: Does a Really Good Job, and good designreview/text: Over the last 15 years, I have owned two steam cleaning machines (both from Bissell). What I don't like about Bissell is the "bladder" design of the tank. There is a single tank that has a bladder separating the clean from the dirty water. It works OK, but I have never really liked the design, and it is hard to clean out. I liked the 2-tank design of this Hoover model, and since my second Bissell is finally very near death, and it was time for a replacement, I decided to go with this. I just got a couple of puppies, so I needed something. This thing does a good job on all of the "puppy spots," especially the urine and vomit stains. I have a very light-colored carpet and a puppy with digestive issues (including the inability to form solid bowel movements, apparently). Not a good combination. So, since I haven't had this machine for very long, I have already had many opportunities to use it. It does a great job of removing most stains, but there is generally a little residual color from the puppy's runny bowel movement stains. No smell, though. I really like the 2-tank design - a lot easier to fill, dump, and clean the tanks. That's a big plus over the Bissell machines. In terms of cleaning, this machine does as well as my Bissell did, so no complaints there. I feel like this was a good deal, and I am happy with my Hoover SteamVac so far. As far as longevity and durability, we'll see how it holds up. My Bissell machines always held up great, and both would have lasted longer if I hadn't let people borrow them. They both "died" after someone borrowed them and returned them. I'll let people borrow the old Bissell from now on - they aren't getting their hands on my new machine!
