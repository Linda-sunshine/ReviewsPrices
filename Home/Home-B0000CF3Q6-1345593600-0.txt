review/summary: Complete Junkreview/text: The handle broke in under five minutes. The top didn't screw onto the bottom well at all; in fact, it leaked while I was trying to make espresso. The screw itself was rough and could cut you if you ran your finger along it. I never did get any espresso out of it. This item is complete junk.
