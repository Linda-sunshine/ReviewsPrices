review/summary: Very fast, tough to readreview/text: This thing heats water faster than my microwave. The hidden element makes it easy to clean, as does the wide opening. It's good looking and the cord wraps in the base. My beef with this other wise functional and good looking unit is that the marking for maximum fill on the interior of the pot is very difficult to read. Also, the pot is much larger than the actual water it holds, so it's a tad misleading (since you can only fill it about 1/2 full).
