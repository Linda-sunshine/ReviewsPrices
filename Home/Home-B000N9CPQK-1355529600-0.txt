review/summary: It works but it's really loudreview/text: I bought this because we heat our downstairs with a woodstove. Lots of ash floating around the living room. But the unit is too loud to have in the living room so I put it in the dining room. I can hear the unit running all the way upstairs. It seems to work though so we just have to turn the TV up a bit to cover the sound.
