review/summary: Leaks waterreview/text: We purchased this item with the intent of 'finally' owning a 'quality' product.Bunn has been around for a long time and I grew up seeing their product in cafe's and restaurants. I was tired of buying throwaway coffee makers that leaked or died in a year. So, I concluded that even though the price was more you get what you pay for right? Wrong. The product did make it just under 2 years before leaking water like a sieve. Now I have the choice of trying to take it apart and find out why, or throwing the whole thing in the trash and buying a cheap, good for a year, throwaway brand.I am totally disgusted with the inability of a company like BUNN to produce a quality product. I may have got a lemon and their other products may be acceptable. That is the only reason I gave it a two instead of one star rating.
