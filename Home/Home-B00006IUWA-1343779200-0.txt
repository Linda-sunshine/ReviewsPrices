review/summary: A great popper deserves great popcorn.review/text: Bought this to avoid the chemicals that coat all microwave popcorn bags. Like it so much I bought one for my sister. I don't see the need to elaborate on the fact that this is a great popper, as hundreds have written before me. But I will make one recommendation: pair it with a great popcorn. I've tried six different kinds, and the best match for this popper so far is Natural Value 100% Organic White Popcorn (available at Whole Foods and online sellers). Large, fluffy kernels each time. Open to other suggestions, so if you have one, please leave a comment.
