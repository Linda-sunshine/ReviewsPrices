review/summary: healthy oil sprayreview/text: I saw on "DR. Oz" that using olive oil in a mister like this was a good way to limit the fat while cooking. It seems to work; just add the olive oil of your choice. Although I haven't used it for long, I do like it much better than the commercial spray on fats.
