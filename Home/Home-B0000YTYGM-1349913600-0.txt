review/summary: I LOVE the coffeemaker!review/text: This is one of the BEST coffeemakers I have ever owned! It's stylish and it keeps the coffee hot for hours. Some days I have had coffee 12 or more hours after it has brewed and it's still warm! If I had one complaint, it would be that the coffee pot, itself, is difficult to clean. I've tried putting it in the dishwasher, but it still doesn't get the inside bottom of the pot clean. I bought a baby bottle brush and it does work very well to clean all the way to the bottom of the pot, but, the inside bottom is still coffee-stained. I've tried every expert-recommended cleaning solution, but the stains haven't come clean. Other than this issue, I think it's a GREAT coffee maker. It would have been better is the display was backlit, but it's really not that big of an issue for me. The brewing cycle is very fast and the coffee tastes great, even hours later. I would definitely buy this coffee maker again and would recommend it to others!
