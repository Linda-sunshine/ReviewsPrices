review/summary: Great price, good convenience, OK filteringreview/text: I bought this for $10, which was practically a giveaway. It's still at a very good price and deserves five stars for that.The convenience of the pitcher is also indisputable. It's very easy to fill from a tap (preferably to the side of the filter), and the pitcher holders almost enough for one person for one day. However, the size isn't quite as optimum as I would like, and for more than one person it is probably inadequate. Four stars.Filtering is OK. I can taste some difference in the water, but it's not enough to make me jump and shout. Offhand, it's just enough to get me to buy some more filters to try them out for another year. Be forewarned that initial use of a filter will leave black specks in your water. Uou need to take care to flush the filters first.Overall, this is a buy that I like but don't treasure. I would do it again, though.
