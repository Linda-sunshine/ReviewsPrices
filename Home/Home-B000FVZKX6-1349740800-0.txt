review/summary: LOVE THESE SHEETS!review/text: These sheets are everything and more! They are a heavier fannel blend than I thought so i dont know if these will be our summer sheets but they are so soft and cuddlely for the winter. They make it hard to get up put of bed! We also paired it with a down conforter and that makes the bed! Thanks so much for the amazing reviews bc we searched for weeks trying to find the right sheets :)
