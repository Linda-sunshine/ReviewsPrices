review/summary: High Quality, Great Machinereview/text: Two years ago, I asked for an icecream maker for my birthday. My husband researched different brands and thought this machine to be the best...and I agree! I can't imagine a better product. It's so simple to use and you'll never get tired of the icecream possiblities! There is a hole in the lid to add extras the last few minutes of churning, ie crumbled oreos, brownie bits, nuts, fudge, chopped butterfinger, etc. It is a little noisy, so allow time to use it in the kitchen when you're not eating dinner. I always keep the bowl in the freezer. It takes about 6 hours to fully freeze (which you need to do prior to churning) and that way I can make icecream at anytime! I've also made my own adaptations for fat-free, sugar free ice cream! Keep your ingredients on hand, coz it's fun to surprpise your family with fresh sorbet, fro yo, or icecream!ps. I love it so much I just ordered my BFF one for her wedding gift :)
