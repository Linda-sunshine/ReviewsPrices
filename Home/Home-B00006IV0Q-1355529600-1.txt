review/summary: Needs a filter! But you wouldn't know that from the descriptionreview/text: I converted from a Faberware Percolator because the coffee was no longer hot. We love the percolator over the automatic drip because of ease of use and fuller flavor. We were super disappointed to learn that this requires a filter, which is multipart folding project.Pros:Gets your coffee hotLike the ready lightEasy to see the cup lines when filling with water, unlike the FarberwareCons:Absolutely must use filter or you get some grounds in nearly every cup
