review/summary: Three years later, still strong and loved.review/text: My mother is a fitness freak and does a lot of juicing and smoothie-type stuff. I got her this for the times when breaking out a blender would be overkill. To this day, she goes on about how great it is and how much she uses it. I think this may be the top thing I've ever done that pleased her, and I was 42 when I bought it. It's also worth noting that she will push anything motorized to it's limits and beyond, and this thing is still making mincemeat of mangoes. It's one of those things that if you need it at all, you should get it.
