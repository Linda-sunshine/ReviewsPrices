review/summary: So far so good.review/text: Bought this coffee pot after my percolator 4 cup coffee pot broke after 4 years of service. It delivers your coffee very hot. It is a lot quitter than my old one, but Im sure the technology has improved in 4 years. The Stainless steel design always looks fancy and fresh in my kitchen. Would definitely buy again..
