review/summary: Saved My Henckelsreview/text: I was considering the purchase of an electric knife. I had many knives all dull. After reading the many reviews mostly positive I decided to try to save them rather then just to purchase the one electric. All I can say is that it saved every knife and brought them back to a razor edge. Follow the instructions. Also finished them off with a hand ceramic honing tool.
