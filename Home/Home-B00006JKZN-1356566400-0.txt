review/summary: Good on paper, but small in real lifereview/text: I was excited about this waffle maker because I really like the thinner waffles (not belgian style). I'm also a big fan of the square waffles so I was eager to try it out. However, I was really surprised by how small it was! The waffles are tiny and would take much too long to make for hungry cyclists, so I'm returning it. I've learned my lesson and will buy waffle makers in person from now on to see what size it actually is before buying.
