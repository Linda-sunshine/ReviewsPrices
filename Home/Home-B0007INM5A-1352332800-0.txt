review/summary: Doesn't work well as isreview/text: I agree with some of the other reviews I read about this product before I purchased it. The water wants to go around the Eco Pads instead of through them, so the result is very weak coffee. The coffee I have been buying is a pre-ground Starbucks brand, so maybe the beans are ground too fine or course. My husband ended up poking small holes in the mesh portions of the Eco pads, and now they work pretty well.
