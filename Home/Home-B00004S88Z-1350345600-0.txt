review/summary: Pressure Cooker/Cannerreview/text: I'm a newbee to home canning. I initially started growing my own fresh herb and vegetables last year. I did so well with my garden I had more stuff than I could consume so I gave away my produce to family and friends what I didn't use, only to find out most folks, I shared my garden with threw it away. This year I decided to can. I started out with hot bath canning method and found a need to pressure canning merely because it's safer. After my research, I found most folks recommended the All American Brand. I purchased the product through Amazon because of price and known services. My purchase was the correct choice. I love my pressure cooker and might buy another only because I want to double my garden size next year and hope to have double canning opportunities.
