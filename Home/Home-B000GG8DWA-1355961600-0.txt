review/summary: Optimus H-5210 Infraredreview/text: This is a great little heater. I have purchased two other larger infrared heaters so I already know how much money I save on my propane bill. This little heater is great for a small room. It uses VERY LITTLE electricity. Despite a lot of noise to the contrary, electricity usage for 800 watts in an infrared does not equal 800 watts in a standard electric heater. This heater will maintain a very comfortable room temperature. One warning, it does not excel as a stand alone heater, but it will maintain once you have the room at the temp you want. That is why I use infra red as an additional heat source to my propane. My propane furnace does not work nearly as hard. **This is directional heat.** Proper placement in the room is crucial to feel the warmth. Think of it like the sun: standing in the shade you won't feel the sun. But out in the open, you feel the heat. I would not use this heater in a room with small children or pets unless you elevate it.
