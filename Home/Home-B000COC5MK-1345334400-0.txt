review/summary: Not badreview/text: I bought this for my parents for Christmas a couple years ago, and this thing has gotten some use since then! They absolutely love this thing. It's a little loud but you get used to it. It's simple and easy to use, but be sure this thing is completely charged when you open your wine because it has happened before where the battery died halfway through opening a bottle and we had to yank it off! (lol). Pretty good product for the price, would definitely recommend. It has still held up after a couple of years of frequent use.
