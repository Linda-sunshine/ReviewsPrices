review/summary: Great for Most Cookie Doughreview/text: This is the first cookie scoop I've ever purchased. The idea of perfectly portioned cookies was appealing, and if you've ever made hundreds upon hundreds of cookies for gifts, molding them by hand, you know that the task is a little on the tedious (and messy) side.I use this scoop primarily with a peanut butter chocolate chip cookie dough. It's a pretty sturdy cookie dough, so it works well with the scoop. I use one hand to do the scooping, the other to scrape the excess off the scoop so that my cookie dough has a flat bottom. Works great - still messy, but much less messy, and it speeds up the operation a little bit.I have used this scoop with other cookie doughs that weren't as sturdy - I had a recipe for chocolate chip cookies that produce more of a creamy dough. That doesn't work so well with this scoop. It gets messy, and also frustrating. In that situation, using this scoop wasn't much better than just rolling the dough in my hands.The moral of the story: know your dough.This is easy to clean, but make sure you "activate" the scoop to clean under the scooping blade, etc. when washing. I like to soak this for a few minutes before washing to make sure all the dough gets removed.
