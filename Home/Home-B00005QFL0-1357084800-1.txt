review/summary: My first Breadmakerreview/text: I've never owned any other breadmakers so I don't know how this stacks up in comparison to others, but I can tell you this machine meets and exceeds what I was expecting. Every loaf I've made has been perfect and I'd never attempted making bread before. It makes wonderful pizza dough as well. And this is from a guy who has almost no kitchen skills. Trying to think of a negative and about the closest I can get is the cake I made from the recipe in the book was so bad when I threw it in the trash all the other trash tried to jump out of the can. Had to have been something I did wrong though because as I said everything else I've made with this has been perfect. I'm just as happy as can be with this machine. Only had it for less than a month so I can't attest to the durability yet but I can say this seems to be a well built machine, not cheap and flimsy. I highly reccomend this machine. I'm 100% pleased with mine. Also have found some mixes for bread machines at Prepared Pantry which are awesome.
