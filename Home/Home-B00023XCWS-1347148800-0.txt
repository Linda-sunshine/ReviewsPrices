review/summary: Proctor Silex K2070Y 1 Liter Electric Kettlereview/text: This is such a nice little kettle it heats up water very fast,then a few seconds after it starts to boil it shuts of automatically.I bought it to use instead of my stovetop burner,for instant coffee.I would leave the burner on low all day just to have coffee every hour or so,now I can heat it up fast for each cup, and not wear out my stove element,and waste electricity...just love it...
