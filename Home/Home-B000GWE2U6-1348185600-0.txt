review/summary: Should Not Be A Night Lightreview/text: Wanted to test before putting in nursery. The light bulb gives off a pink glow and the green LED 'on' light is very bright. Had to tape over the green light with black tape and removed the main bulb so I don't have a glow throughout the night. Instructions tell me not to place unit on wood, towel, cloth, etc. Legs are quite stubby for proper air intake from the bottom, hence those instructions.
