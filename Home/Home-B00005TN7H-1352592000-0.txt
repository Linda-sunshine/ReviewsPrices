review/summary: awesome food storagereview/text: Perfect storage. Curry, indian chutney etc. Lasts longer when vacuum sealed in a mason jar. Reasonable price compared to expensive canisters sold. The only thing is that it has a very tight seal. Awesome way to keep food from spoiling before it can be completely used.LaCuisine 18 Piece Microwave Cookware Set, (Container and lids)
