review/summary: works greatreview/text: bought this for our grand mother who lives with us in the basement - had a flood and the carpet got soaked and then mouldy causing her to cough constantly....the honeywell put a stop to that within a few hours....we put it in her bedroom and she has no problem sleeping at all - we were afraid she would because it is loud as mentioned in some of the other reviews - but she actually likes the sound of it saying it's like white noise and helps her sleep....would definitely buy this again
