review/summary: So cool.review/text: At first I didnt like this thing. It took a bit to get the right amount of coffee, the right grind of coffee, and the right temp of the water. After that, it was great.Fast, easy, and no bitter. I found if the coffee is ground to finely, its really hard to press the plunger down. Really really hard. I cant explain really how fine to grind them, but its somewhere between course and fine :)So I put a whole scoop of fresh ground coffee, add water about 195degrees (checked with a meat thermometer :) ) up to the number 4, mixed it for about 10 seconds and then pressed it out. It gave me a great cup of coffee with no bitter.I did try hotter and colder water, and it may have been how the coffee was ground, but to hot produced a bitter coffee, and to cold produced a weak coffee. So 195 seemed to be the sweet spot for me and how I ground the coffee.
