review/summary: This is your new grinderreview/text: This Capresso grinder is a great value. It is very well built, grinds nicely, and is priced attractively.I use it daily, and the grinder settings have come in very handy when I need to make adjustments because of a new brewer or a different roast.The Capresso 560 is highly recommended.
