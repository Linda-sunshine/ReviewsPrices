review/summary: Greatest Invention EVER!!review/text: I suffered from not knowing how to organize my ties. I originally just had them all hanging on a nail just like my belts but I felt this was going to affect their integrity.This tie organizer blew my mind. Cheap and Effective. I love the way it rotates! You would think that because its made from plastic it would get weird but it still rotates smoothly. I would definitely recommend these to all my tie-wearing folk.
