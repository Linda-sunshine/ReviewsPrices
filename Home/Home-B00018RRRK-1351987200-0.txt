review/summary: Cuisinart DBM Coffee grinderreview/text: I have had two of these grinders. This first lasted several years and I have to say that was probably due to my lack of reading direction and the San Francisco French Roast coffee I use. The bean I use is very oily! But I love it! So that being said, here was the problem, not cleaning the build up of coffee beneath the burr and shoot. If you do it with every bag of beans then it will last and produce a great flavored coffee, once you determine the grind that works best for the type of coffee maker you use. Between the first and second one, I tried another brand. It was messy and hard to clean which is absolutely necessary with oily bean! I used it one month and then I went back to this model again. I have now had it about 5 years and still happy with it. Yes, there is a little dust. The mess mentioned on the counter, I don't have that unless I have gotten lazy about cleaning it! I also use it to grind coffee for my expresso machine, and French press. The thing that took me a few years to fugure out and reading the book that came with my expresso machine, is you can buy the most expensive equipment out there, but don't expect the first cup of coffee to taste like you get from your favorite barrista. You have to find the grind than works with your coffee equipment and your taste. AND clean your grinder!
