review/summary: Great Coffee Brewerreview/text: This is my second Cuisinart DCC-1200 Coffee maker. The first lasted for 4 years of daily use before it stopped working. It makes great tasting coffee if you have good and/or filtered water. You can set the hotplate for 2, 3, or 4 hours before it shuts off. I like the 3-hour setting. I don't use the timer as I get up at different times in the morning (since I retired anyway). The stainless and black colors match my other large and small kitchen applicances. You can get coffee makers for a third the cost of these, but they will not last near as long. Highly recommend.
