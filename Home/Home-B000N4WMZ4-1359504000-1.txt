review/summary: Comparable to Le Cruset but a fraction of the price!review/text: I was not interested in spending $250 for the Le Cruset dutch oven, knowing that I'd only use it two or three times a year, so I was ecstatic to find the Lodge brand dutch oven at such an affordable price. This is a beautiful dutch oven and it really gets the job done. I have made a couple soups and a roast or two in it so far this winter and everything has come out perfectly. It's great to sear a roast or other meat, then cooks very evenly. I was surprised how easy this is to clean! All in all, it's a great product!
