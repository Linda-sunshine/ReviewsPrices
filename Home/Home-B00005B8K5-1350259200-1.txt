review/summary: Dangerousreview/text: I was washing one of these pieces under some hot water this evening and the container suddenly crumbled in my hand. Luckily, I only had a few cuts, but the dish was in a couple dozen pieces in the sink.I'd give it one star, but it was pretty awesome to see the dish sort of fall apart on top of my hand.
