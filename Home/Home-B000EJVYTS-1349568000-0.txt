review/summary: Totally Overatedreview/text: Yes, the bag doesn't show. But while solving that problem this can falls down on several others:1) The motor stops functioning over time. It starts out with a slower lid lift, but eventually the lid won't fully open - which is kind of essential. There is a way to "fix" this *known* problem on their website, but it won't work. I tried several times. Want a replacement? Customer service won't do it after the 60 day (yes, that's it) warranty is up.2) The battery cover is flimsy. If you force a piece of garbage in, it will eventually break the plastic tabs holding it on.3) It doesn't fully utilize a 13 gallon trash bag and putting new bags in can be a hassle.4) If you hover over the trash can to scrape a plate, you have to do it just right or it will close on you. When this happens you now have to open it again and clean a garbage can lid. Yes, there is an open button, but it's not convenient to use, especially if your hands are full.But the real question should really be why do you want an automated trash can that relies on batteries and a flimsy motor? Putting your foot onto a lever is not inconvenient and solves 3 of 4 problems mentioned above.I have no idea why this thing is so highly rated.
