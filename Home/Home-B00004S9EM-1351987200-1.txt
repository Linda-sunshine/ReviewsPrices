review/summary: No complaints!review/text: I highly recommend this food processor. I got this a few weeks ago and I'm absolutely loving it! It absolutely plows through everything I've put in it thus far! It's also quite easy to clean and it came with a few different blades. I've used the dough blade and the chopping blade and both worked great!I was a bit hesitant to buy this brand again, as my last Cuisinart food processor would leak around the seam where the cover goes on. But no such problems on this one!It's also pretty quiet too! I had to wear ear plugs with my old processor, but this one runs much quieter. Love it!I used it to make a few recipes in this new cookbook --30 Minute Meals Recipes includes Easy Dinner Recipes, Healthy Dinner Ideas and Simple Recipes that can be made in 30 Minutes or Less for Busy Moms, ... Discover 30 minute meals for busy families!Also highly recommended!
