review/summary: Leaky Leaky - Right out of the boxreview/text: This thermos leaks. First (and second) time I used it. Granted, it laid on its side on my drive to work. I understood that was ok. It is not. First time, I thought I didn't screw lid on tight enough. Second time, I knew it was defective. Won't be a third time, b/c I came here and read 1-star reviews (which I should have done when I bought it and didn't) and saw that MANY people have had this problem. Thermos, if it can't be laid horizontally, you should certainly make that clear. I will say this - so far as keeping coffee HOT for a looong period of time, it does GREAT!! I just can't accept spilled coffee in my lunch bag. Return to sender.
