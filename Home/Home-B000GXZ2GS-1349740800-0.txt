review/summary: Simply Perfect Coffeereview/text: Eliminates the variables that destroy the flavor of coffee. Get whole bean coffee and grind.....doesn't even have to be the perfect grind....just grind it. Then heat 6 oz of water and pour over your measured scoop of coffee in the syringe to the '2'. Stir for 10 seconds.....give or take.... and press the plunger down into a cup. Perfect every time...Add the rest of the water to your cup and relax.
