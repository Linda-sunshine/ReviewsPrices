review/summary: So easy to clean carpetsreview/text: After reading recomendation, I bought the Hoove SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge. It worked great! I didn't have the spot remover for pretreatment, but the old spots came out anyway. I followed the excellent direactions in the manuel, but used the dry setting for 4 times instead of the two, and the carpet dried very fast. The machine is also very easy to clean, easy to get ready to use, and easy to put away. When my cat throws up hairballs, it's quick and easy to get the carpet clean again. I think it is well worth the money and highly recomend it.
