review/summary: The lid really is annoying!review/text: When I read the reviews for this product, I was skeptical of the people who criticized the lid. But, it really is annoying to the point that I don't use the pitcher anymore. We figured out how it works - it is tricky because you kind of have to hold the outside ring of the lid in place while you turn the inside. I don't have a problem getting a tight seal (except that it can be hard to push in), but I struggle with getting it open. I still can't figure out if you're supposed to be able to pour with the lid on (obviously after opening the spout part of it) or if the lid has to come completely off in order to pour things. It seems to work differently every time we use it. If you tend to have issues with opening things (like pickle jars), this is definitely not for you. All things considered, while I can make this pitcher work, it really shouldn't be this difficult, so I am going to get rid of it and buy a new pitcher that I like better.
