review/summary: Perculator coffeepotreview/text: This is the third one we've purchased, not because it's perfect, because it isn't, but because there isn't much of a choice in this type of coffeepot. It comes with a one year warranty, but it must have some kind of a timer that makes the coffeepot crash at about 18 mmonths of use. No reason, it just quits brewing. The water boils, but when you pour, you get only clear water and there is nothing to do but throw the unit away. As I said, this is number 3 which is used daily, had it about a year and we won't be surprised when this once goes the way of the others. We'll probably purchase another, but we won't be happy about it.
