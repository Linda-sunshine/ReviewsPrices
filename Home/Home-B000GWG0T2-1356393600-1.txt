review/summary: Induction friendly aluminum! Who woulda thunk it?review/text: Not all &#34;nonstick&#34; frying pans are created equal. When I recently converted to the wonders of induction cooking, I lost my ridiculously expensive omelette pan (Swiss Diamond) because that puppy won't wag its tail on an induction burner! I also have several lovely very old omelette pans from France that make fantastic omelettes on a gas stover, but do nothing but sit there on an induction burner. &#60;sigh&#62; T-Fal to the rescue! How did they make aluminum induction friendly? By slipping in a ferrous metal disk inside the aluminum bottom, of course! This pan makes GREAT omelettes! I'd buy it for that purpose, even if I didn't cook with induction. Good show! And great price!
