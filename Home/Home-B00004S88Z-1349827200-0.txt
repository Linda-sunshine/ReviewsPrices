review/summary: Excellent Quality - Worth the extra moneyreview/text: My husband and I bought this pressure canner about a year ago, and it is very heavy duty and very good quality. We have used this a lot this year for canning, and its the best I've seen. I'm actually thinking of buying a second canner in a bigger size so I can do 14 quarts at a time. I will definitely buy the All American again!
