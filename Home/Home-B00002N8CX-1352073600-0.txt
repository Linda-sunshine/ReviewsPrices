review/summary: So cheap, it's like a child's toyreview/text: This vacuum is ridiculous. My hubby got it for me after reading other reviews. He thought it seemed like a great bargain. It is a prime example of getting what you pay for. Totally useless on carpet and nearly just as useless on hardwood. Tried it out for about 2 minutes and realized that it is the most pathetic vacuum I've ever tried to clean with. Sending it back. Don't waste your time or money. Cheap, lousy product.
