review/summary: Disappointed in productreview/text: I purchased this air popper after mine of 30 years finally started to wear out. Whereas my old popper popped the kernels and there was enough air to force the kernels up and out of the plastic hood, this Presto lacks enough force to keep the popped corn coming up and out of the chute adequately. The popped corn tends to build up in the shaft and I find myself tilting the unit forward to try and encourage the popped kernels to spill out of the chute. I am disappointed in this product and would definitely not recommend it.
