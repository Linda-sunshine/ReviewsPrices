review/summary: Needs some modification to be excellentreview/text: First off, this only works well in a small, not well ventilated area, e.g. a bathroom in a old building in NYC. It does draw an adequate amount of water without costing anything on your energy bill. However, the fan it uses to draw air inside is not of good quality. It's a two-pin 80mm*80mm*25mm regular computer case fan. When new, it works, but gets louder with time. After six months, it's pretty loud and can be heard outside of the bathroom with the door shut. I bought another fan to replace it and it is now practically silent.So, which fan to buy? Most fans you can buy are better than the one it comes with. You need not to worry about the speed or how much air it moves (CFM); they are all good enough. You want a silent one likeEnermax Fan Uc-8Eb Enlobal Magnetic Baraometric Bearing Rohs Retail. This one use a "magnetic" bearing that's really quite. I put quotation marks around magnetic because I don't believe it's like maglev. But it so good that you have to make sure it's on by listening closely.After you get the fan, you need to modify it slightly, because all current computer fans are 3-pin, and the socket on the humidifier's board is 2-in. (The extra pin is for signal that allows the speed to be controlled; without it the fan always runs at full speed.) You can spend some extra dollars to buy a 3-pin to 2-pin adapter. I just simply strip out the wire insulator and fuse the new fan's wire and the old one's plug together, red to red, black to black.After the modification, this is a truly five star product. You would wonder why the manufacturer cannot spend maybe 2 dollar more per unit to get a better fan to begin with. (It's the extra profit and/or cost-cutting they need to stay competitive.)
