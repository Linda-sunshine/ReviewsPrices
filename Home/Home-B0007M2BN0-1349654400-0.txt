review/summary: I would give this ten stars if I could.review/text: This is my favorite random kitchen gadget that I have ever purchased (and for me, that is saying a lot). I use it a TON.It is easy beyond belief. Can make 1 egg just as easily as 4.It takes ~10 minutes total (from getting the boiler out to eating an egg).When I work silly shifts (as I occasionally do), and get home at 10 pm and starving, I can make myself an egg, throw it on some rice (I almost always have left over rice in my fridge), stir in a little cheese and sometimes a little salsa, and I have a complete meal that tastes wonderful and fills me up.I occasionally will boil up a few eggs so that I can take them for lunches. Or make egg salad. Or just have an egg. :) I really do like eggs.If you like eggs, this is something that you should have. I know that it may seem silly, but I truly LOVE this item. And I cook an awful lot, and love cooking. I try to make most meals completely from scratch- and I still love this.Could not recommend this item more.(but if you don't like boiled eggs, this would most likely not be a good purchase for you).
