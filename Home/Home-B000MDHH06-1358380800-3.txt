review/summary: It is okreview/text: it look nice and is much quieter but the pulp is fairly wet and I don't like the container for the pulp. Any other juicer I could put a plastic bag in it before I juiced to catch the pulp but I can't with this one. It also spatters the juice even when using the cup provided
