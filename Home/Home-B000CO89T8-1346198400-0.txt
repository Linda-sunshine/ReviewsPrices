review/summary: Excellent function and qualityreview/text: I bought this Mr Coffee Mug Warmer a few weeks ago and am so pleased with it that I felt I needed to write a review, mostly to complement the people who designed and manufactured it. This product was well thought out and manufactured very well, especially for a product costing only about $10. It has an on/off switch right on the base and a power on light right next to it. I would not want one with an in-line power switch. The unit is sturdy and feels good quality. The power cord is heavy and plenty long, as needed for most desktop situations. I have used it with a number of different cups, all having a small ridge around the bottom, and they all work equally well. The coffee stays at just the right temperature, and the cup doesn't get uncomfortably hot. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good cup warmer. Good job Mr Coffee.
