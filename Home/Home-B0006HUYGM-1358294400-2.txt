review/summary: Cute and perfect little hand vacreview/text: I just got this and I can't say how much I love it! I'm a mom of two little boys under 4 and it has been so tough keeping messes at bay with the traditional push vac. Within a minute I can have this little vac in my hand and already be cleaning up the mess compared to all of the time spent getting my large vacuum out of the closet and dragging it to the mess, etc. Plus its a cute, bright yellow which makes it easy to see wherever you decide to store it. It also has an area at the base of the handle where you wind the cord around to keep everything together and neat. They pretty much thought of everything with this one. If you are in the market for a little hand vac, this is the one you should get.
