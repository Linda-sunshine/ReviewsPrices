review/summary: Should have heeded the poor reviewsreview/text: I read every review on this pot before ordering it. I was put off by all the reviews stating that the screen was not the right size, and that, as a result, an unacceptable volume of grounds made their way into the resulting coffee. But then there were all these positive reviews. Someone mentioned that she just had to be a bit careful in removing the screen from the pot, and she had no problem with refugee grounds. So I bought it.Upon its arrival, I had only to open the top of the pot to see the problem everyone else had mentioned. The screen is indeed too big for the circumference of the carafe, so it bunched, leaving a gap of about 3/4 of a square centimeter. This was before I even touched the screen. The rest of the assembly looked sturdy enough, but the screen was a major problem, so back the carafe went to Amazon. I'm very disappointed. Would it be that hard to make a screen the right size?
