review/summary: Solid and steamyreview/text: Impressed so far! This is a hefty, but not too heavy iron. Heavy enough to avoid manually smashing an iron downward with thick fabric on the ironing board, but light enough so the iron moves with ease. The steam seems more than adequate, and the spray works just fine.If they'd save the money they're wasting on the TEENY pitcher, maybe they could incorporate an automatic cord wind on this baby and I'd give it 5 stars.
