review/summary: Water tastes so much better from this pitcher than from bottles!review/text: I love this Brita Pitcher! The water tastes so much better than from bottles! In fact, we still have a case & a half of bottled water left from before we got this pitcher that I use to take with me when I have a Doctor's appointment or shopping to do. I'm going to buy more Brita Filters next month, but my Mom says I may not go thru them as fast as expected as it is only me that drinks the filtered water! Well worth the price!
