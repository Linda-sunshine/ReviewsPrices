review/summary: Great Coffeereview/text: I was a little hesitant about it at first because I've only used electric coffee makers in the past, but it really does make some amazing espresso. I've worked as a barista in the past, and using this and a milk frother, I can make the same specialty drinks I want without the coffeehouse price.
