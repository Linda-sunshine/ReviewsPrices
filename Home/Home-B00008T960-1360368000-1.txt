review/summary: Silpat Don't Wait!review/text: I love to bake so I don't know why I waited so long to order a Silpat. I saw them on all of the cooking shows but just didn't think that I needed it. Well, for $19.99 (cheaper than anywhere else) What was I waiting for??? This nonstick sheet made my cookies crunchy on the bottom and soft on top. The clean-up was as simple as rinse with warm water and soap! When it arrived at my office, everyone who saw it said &#34;I have one and it's great!&#34;. One of my co-workers said, &#34;I have a few! Wouldn't bake without it!&#34; I got on amazon to order another one and then decided to write this review. Don't wait!
