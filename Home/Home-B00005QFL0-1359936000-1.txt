review/summary: Wonderful bread machine!review/text: I purchased this bread machine after seeing a write up by Caroline McDougall. She raved at how great all of her bread turned out and that she especially liked the fact that the yeast dispenser, which is on the top of the machine, drops the yeast in at just the right time. No worries about your bread not rising any longer. I have owned a bread machine for years and I have had some failures with it that is why I purchased this one. Very happy I did!!
