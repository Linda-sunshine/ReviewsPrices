review/summary: I'm pleasantly surprisedreview/text: I wasn't expecting too much from this, but it actually kept my drink and mug really warm! I decided to give it a good test and I had hot tea in a taller mug and left it for several hours. The tea is still very warm! It's actually a perfect drinking temperature for me. I tend to drink slowly, and my drink always gets cold before I'm done, so I am very pleased with this mug warmer.
