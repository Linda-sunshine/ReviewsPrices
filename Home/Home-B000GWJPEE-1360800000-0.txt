review/summary: Extremely low quality productreview/text: This product went OK for a few weeks and then it was downhill. The components very rapidly went moldy. Both the water bath and the head of penguin constantly grew mold. The vaporizer caused large calcium deposits on the base. Eventually this unit failed after about 9 months. It did an OK job of adding humidity, but the maintenance and overall life of the product really don't make it worth it. I have found numerous other products that are easier to maintain (no mold), last longer and do a better job of humidifying for less money.I would not recommend purchasing this product.
