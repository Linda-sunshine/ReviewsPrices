review/summary: Lid falls off incredibly easilyreview/text: My girlfriend and I loved the aesthetic design of this pitcher, but the functionality was an immediate failure. As the majority of reviews note, the lid falls off when the pitcher is even slightly tilted or jostled. We returned it, and she checked other units at a local store to confirm that we didn't just get a defective unit. One shouldn't have to clamp, tape, or rubber band the lid down to make a pitcher that costs this much usable. I tip my hat to the couple of folks who claim to have figured out the physics of the Brita Grand and are pouring with confidence. We'd rather own a pitcher that doesn't require jerry-rigging or finessing. We're buying theBrita Everyday Pitcherinstead - same large 10-cup capacity and the lid appears to have the simple, secure seating of earlier Brita models like theBrita 42629 Slim Pitcher, which we've poured from for years with no mishaps. Reviewers on Amazon and on Brita's own website particularly laud the snug-fitting lid, so we're hopeful.
