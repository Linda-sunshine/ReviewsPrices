review/summary: Wonderful Juicerreview/text: I love this juicer... I know it may not be the top of the line Juicer, but it serves me well.It juices everything.... Parsley, spinach,kale, leafy greens that you wouldn't expect could be juiced with a lot of yield ,yet it does!It is also very powerful and not at all noisy....as some others I have tried. I have purchased two of these ,one for my Canadian home and one for my Florida home. Did I mention that I LOVE THIS JUICER!
