review/summary: Lasted about a yearreview/text: Worked fine for a year, and then, just like everyone else, stops brewing full cups. Cleaned needles, descaled(has always been used with distilled water) and it dumps water back into the reservoir. Conveniently out of warranty this thing takes a crap. My $30 mr coffee lasted far longer than this thing. What a waste of money. Do NOT pay the high price of convenience. That or buy a different unit
