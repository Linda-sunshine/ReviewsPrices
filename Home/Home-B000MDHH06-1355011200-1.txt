review/summary: sent it backreview/text: We got this to juice the apples and grapes that grow in our yard. It worked perfectly for one session of apples, but when we tried to do a batch of graps a few days later it stoped working, as in it would not turn on and smelt as if the moter had burnt out, I dont think that grapes with tiny seeds should have done that.
