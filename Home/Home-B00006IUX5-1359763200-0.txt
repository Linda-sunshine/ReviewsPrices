review/summary: As a spice grinder, does okreview/text: I generally buy cheap kitchen appliances and use them as long as they last not expecting much, though I've been very pleasantly surprised by several low-end machines.I bought this to replace a Capresso spice grinder that burned out. This grinder comes with a really small capacity cup, and while I was disappointed with the size initially, I realized it was fine for my needs. My earlier grinder was about twice as big and more efficient, despite being in the same price point, though it died in about two years of infrequent use.The most important thing about this is the blade. Now, for roast coffee beans and nuts, a dull blade will pulverize them, but with smaller spices like cumin seeds, I do wish it had a reversible/sharper edge as well. The blade sits weirdly high in the cup, and while it still grinds without leaving big bits, it is not very efficient and takes some time to grind even two teaspoons of spice fully. The high blade does this by creating a vortex that makes the spice fly up, but as I said, not efficient at all. A flat blade lower in the cup would have been better. Using larger quantities of spice did not improve efficiency.The winding cable mechanism is poor! I had the hardest time pulling out the cable twice, so now I don't wind it at all.The only reason I didn't return this is because I bought it for twelve bucks and I had to pay for return shipping, so I thought I'd just keep it as long as my patience held out. If you grind spices a lot or on an everyday basis, I can see this being easily frustrating.
