review/summary: Amazing, reliable little gadgetreview/text: We received this wine bottle opener - this exact model - over five years ago as a wedding gift. It still works like a charm, and we've probably used it an average of 3-4 times a week. It's never failed once, never jammed. It looks great, takes up very little counter space, and is an awesome conversation piece at dinner parties. We wholeheartedly recommend this product to everyone.
