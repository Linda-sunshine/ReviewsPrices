review/summary: I'm absolutely happy with it!review/text: Yes, it smelled very strongly of mint when we first got it; but that smell left after a couple of days. We had bought a bed that ended up being too solid, and it felt like we were sleeping on boards. But this really made that 'too solid' bed just perfect. When we first got it out of the box it was shrink wrapped and didn't look like it would fit our king sized bed. So we unrolled it and laid it across our bed, and within an hour or two it had returned to normal size and fit our bed just fine. We were able to use it the first night we got it, and the smell would only be too strong if we had our faces right next to the bed and off our pillows. If this lasts for at least two years, I have full plans of buying this again. It turned our hard bed into a super comfortable bed, and is a LOT cheaper than buying an actual memory foam mattress.
