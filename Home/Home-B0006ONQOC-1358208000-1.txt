review/summary: Nothing but a waste of my money!!!review/text: I purchased this machine based on the praise I found in the reviews & when it arrived I was so excited to use it, I was literally rushing home... Plugged it in, started it up, it worked well for a little while (I was half way done cleaning up the bowl I mixed the ice cream base in) & BOOM, it stops!!! Tried everything humanly possible with it, nothing... A waste of space & money, that's what it is to me...
