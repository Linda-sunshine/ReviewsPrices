review/summary: Heat is good, quiet, when it decides to workreview/text: I got 2 of these heaters a while back. They seemed cheap and great, and the only obvious problem was you have no idea what the settings on the dial do. They just say 400, 800 alternating all the way around, and switching it will make one or two come on...i don't know. My main problem is they dont have a reset switch or anything on them, but they will just shut off, i guess because they are too hot? They wont come back on when they are cooled off. They just randomly seem to start working again. I tried everything to make them come back on, unplugging, letting them sit, flipping the dials around...etc. Eventually one of them would ONLY work when i had 1 element lit up. Very frustrating to the point it was useless. Which is a shame because it definitely can heat a bedroom when its actually on and working with both elements.
