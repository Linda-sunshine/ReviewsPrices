review/summary: Good valuereview/text: I decided against ordering another OXO mandoline because that design makes long items like zucchini get stuck. This one does not have the same plastic &#34;v&#34; underneath, so it's not a problem. The best part of this unit is that everything stores neatly and safely away. The blade is very sharp, so that is a good thing! Unlike the OXO however, you can't select from range of thicknesses for slicing; just thin and thicker. I think this will work fine for me however. The quality of the plastic seems a bit cheesy as compared to the OXO.
