review/summary: Great Cast Iron Frying Panreview/text: I am converting all of my stainless steel pots to Cast Iron. This was one of the first that I purchased. It holds the heat and cleans up easily. I wasn't too happy with the Lodge Seasoning. I was getting a black residue on my towels whenever I washed and wiped it off. So I removed the lodge seasoning and re seasoned it myself in the oven. This is a high quality pan. And I love that I am supporting the US market of manufacturers .
