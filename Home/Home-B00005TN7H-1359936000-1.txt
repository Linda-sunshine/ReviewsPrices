review/summary: Works perfectlyreview/text: I bought this to vacuum seal wide mouth jars full of lettuce - an odd use, but it works really well with the Foodsaver brand sealer that I got at Costco for $45. I couldn't be happier with it. Easy to use though you do have to flip the lock on the Foodsaver closed in order to make it work, and I have discovered that once the jar is sealed, flipping the lock back open will break the vacuum in the tube making the wide mouth jar sealer easy to remove from the jar in order to do the next one.
