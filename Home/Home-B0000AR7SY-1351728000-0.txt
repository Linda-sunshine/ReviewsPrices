review/summary: Love it! Super quiet!review/text: Was really happy with how quiet this unit was compared with my older grinder.The weight is very nice, and everything went smoothly (I did read the directions)As at least one other reviewer mentioned, the grind receptacle has a big sticker on it that says push, but you may still naturally want to pull it out (Which you can't, so just push it).I'll update if all doesn't go well, but so far it is a very nice consistant grind that is SUPER quiet :-)To fill up aEkobrew Cup,Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers 2-Pack - BROWN $ GREENuse the included scoop with 2 scoops of your favorite coffee beans & set timer to 2 on Fine grit 3rd from left notch (At least that works for me)
