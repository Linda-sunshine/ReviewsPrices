review/summary: This Vacuum Sucks!review/text: And that's a good thing! I've gone through so many versions of vacuums with varying results, and this is the only one that does carpeted stairs fantastically! The little auxiliary hose is great for corners and such, and the adjustable brush cover makes doing vertical surfaces a snap! Amazing suction and light enough to carry for a while, plus the AC cord is long enough I can do the whole staircase without moving the plug. Great product!
