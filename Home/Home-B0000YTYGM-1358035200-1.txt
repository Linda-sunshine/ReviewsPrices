review/summary: I bought it againreview/text: The first one of these I bought from a retailer for 99.00. At the time I thought that to be a lot of money for a coffe pot. I put a date on it when I bought it. It lastd from 11/07to12/12 a little more that 5 years. The timer stopped working and would not start the berwing process. 5years, I would say I got my moneys worth. I chcked a couple of stores and could not find anothr one.I found it on Amazon 5.00 less than I paid 5 years ago.For me this is a great coffe pot. No hot plate to burn coffe. The thermal pot keeps coffe hot for a long period of time.A little pricey but compared to what is being made today in th upscale I thought it to be a good deal having owned one already
