review/summary: Great organizer - Cheaply madereview/text: You have to expect that these arent the best in quality. They really help organize a closet though. I bought one a year ago and just recently I pulled a tie off a little to hard snapping it. If I had to buy one every year or two I would still say that its worth it.
