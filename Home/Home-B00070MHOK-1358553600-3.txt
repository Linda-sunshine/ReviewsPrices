review/summary: Disappointedreview/text: I was really excited at the thought of easily and quickly being able to release wrinkles from my clothes with this steamer. It heats up quickly and makes a lot of steam, but struggles to release wrinkles in fabrics that are any heavier than a very light cotton. It worked semi well on a summer blouse I tried it on, but with the lightweight sweater that I used it on, I didn't really notice any improvement. When using it, you have to be very careful or you will end up steaming new wrinkles into your garment. It also seemed to piddle and drip water quite a bit. For as long as it took to use this to steam clothing into a somewhat acceptable and wearable-in-public condition, I could have done a much better job with a standard iron, probably in less time. This product did not meet my expectations and will be going back.Pros: Heats up quickly, seems to make a lot of steam.Cons: Steam isn't effective on fabrics heavier than light cotton, unit piddles and drips, end up steaming in new wrinkles.
