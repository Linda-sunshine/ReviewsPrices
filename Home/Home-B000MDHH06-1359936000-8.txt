review/summary: Juices really well. So why the one star???review/text: I bought this juicer because the Jack LaLane juicer I own kept overheating (this is my second JL juicer - didn't have the overheating problem w/my first one) and Joe Cross of Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead used a Breville, so thought I'd try it. I does juice really really well. It's quick, relatively quiet. Very easy to assemble, disassemble and clean.So what's the problem? If you use this juicer, you want to be dressed in your hazmat suit. (I WISH I WERE KIDDING!) This juicer makes a terrible terrible mess! I'm trying to make Joe Cross's green juice for my lunch every day, and the recipe includes a bunch of kale. It is impossible to juice kale (or almost anything really) without it blowing back up at you out of the juicer. You can't even get the veggies in the chute and get the plunger in there fast enough to avoid having the veggies blow back up in your face, and forget about trying to make more than one addition to the chute. It is the craziest thing I've ever seen. This was never an issue w/my JLL juicers.So, guess where you can find me juicing? Outside. Ya, I go outside at lunchtime every day now and make my green juice. Not kidding.Note to self: Do a check in front of the bathroom mirror after juicing to make sure I get those little bits of kale out of my hair!
