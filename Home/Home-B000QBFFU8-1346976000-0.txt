review/summary: Well worth it all the way!!!review/text: This is something I was considering for a while but never got around to it till last month. The hang up was to decide to go with the more expensive Breville Juicer. I decided after much reading and researching that $200 was the limit (my wife made this clear to me actually).Got my unit and put it through the paces with fruits for now from Call One (Spokane, WA). I am very impressed and love this machine. Wife and I are using this almost every other night to as our dinner for health/dieting purposes. Money well invested and the multi-speed is a huge plus! Highly recommended over all the other brands plus the clean up is fairly simple. Definitely you will get your nutrients and maximum juice extraction every time. Plus, Jointhereboot.com did it once and for all so enjoy your veggies and fruits at their fullest in a glass. Enjoy!
