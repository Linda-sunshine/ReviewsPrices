review/summary: Love this Steam Vacreview/text: We had a Bissell prior to this and felt that one worked ok but it broke so we needed something new. This time i did a little more research and found reviews that said this was the best for the money and we have found that to be 100% true. You have to go over some of the harder to clean spots more than once but our carpets looked like they had been professionally cleaned after using this. It is easy to assemble and i love the attachments it comes with. Easy to use and works great.
