review/summary: Taste is an issuereview/text: Yes it fits perfectly in my cubicle thanks to its compact size, yes, it is easy to use, yes it makes coffee, but no, the coffee does not taste good. This is my 5th try and for some reason the taste is still strange. I'm using my favorite coffee brand so i can only assume it has something to do with the way it heats the water or who know what else. It's a shame! :(
