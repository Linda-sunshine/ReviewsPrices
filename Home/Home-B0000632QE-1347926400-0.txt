review/summary: Wasted food and stained too easilyreview/text: Like others before me I had the same problem with the mandoline staining after my first use trying to julienne carrots. Also it would not completely julienne the carrots leaving at least a quarter carrot every time. I specifically bought this as a foray into Asian cooking but it's just not that efficient so back it goes.
