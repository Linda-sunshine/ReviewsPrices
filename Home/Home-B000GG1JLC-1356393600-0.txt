review/summary: not bad.review/text: you get what you pay for. It can't really fit a tie on every hook...you gotta go every other hook and then a few back to back here and there, but u cant do it for all of them. it takes up a little room, which is to be expected, but it's not a deal breaker. Overall, i think it's worth it.
