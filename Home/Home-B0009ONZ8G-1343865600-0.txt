review/summary: Cleans well but does leave linesreview/text: I am very glad I purchased this vacuum. The construction is plastic and it feels a little cheap, but the vacuum has great power. This vaccuum cleans very well!I have only two complaints. (1) The cord storage is behind the vacuum tube, so it's kind of blocked. (2) As another reviewer stated, the vacuum does leave line marks on the carpet. I thought maybe it was just lines from the outer edges of the vacuum, but the lines are made by the brush or something underneath. If you don't mind 6 line marks all over the carpet, then this carpet is perfect for it's purpose. Can't beat the value.
