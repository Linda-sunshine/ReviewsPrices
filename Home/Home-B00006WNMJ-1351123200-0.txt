review/summary: Water is Terrificreview/text: The Culligan FM-15RA L3 faucet mount system works great. It swings out of the way with no problems. The attachment was easy to install; no tools necessary and no adjustments needed. The original filter is still being used since August (it's October). Automatic shut-off works well (a fine feature). Setting a timer for two minutes prevents a running off and forget it mishap. Coffee still tastes terrific! The product is white - hard water makes things turn muddy brown over time. Planning to replace with another Culligan on occurance. Affordability and quality is very attractive.
