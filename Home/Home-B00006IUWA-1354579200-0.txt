review/summary: wonderful!review/text: I've been using this for about two weeks daily in my dorm room. It's perfect!At my home, my family makes popcorn on the stove as a snack almost nightly. I began to crave some fresh popcorn, and since I don't have a stove, I purchased this. It works wonderfully! It only takes a minute to warm up before the corn starts popping, and once it does, it's done in another minute. Such a wonderful, healthy, low-calorie snack! I also bought some Pam Butter flavored cooking spray, which I spray on as the popcorn fills up the bowl. I then add salt, give it a shake, and voila, perfectly salted, wonderful tasting popcorn!The machine is extremely simple to use. Just fill up the butter melter with corn and then pour it in the machine, cover, and plug in. It will immediately start running (there's no on/off switch, which is a little inconvenient). It is about as noisy as a hand vacuum. It does expel some heat, but it doesn't melt my plastic bucket, which is nice. It doesn't really ever need cleaning (just make sure you dump our residual kernels before the next batch). It usually only leaves a couple of kernels unpopped.Highly recommended!
