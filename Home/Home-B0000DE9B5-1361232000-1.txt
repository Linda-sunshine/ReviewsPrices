review/summary: Amazing Jarreview/text: This is an amazing jar. I use it to store my juice for my juice fast. Many of the reviews I read on Amazon are not fair to this amazing jar! They confuse the opening and closing process which is very simple: Once placing the top on the Jar you hold the outer part of the top while turning the center piece in the top clock wise toclose and lock the airtight jar, to open ityou do everything the same way except you turn the center piece in the top counter clock wise! It's that simple and because of this little jar I've bought a whole set of Bormioli jars ranging for 2 to 4 liters. Again, a great jar, ignore any review that tells you otherwise.
