review/summary: Great single-cup machinereview/text: Previously used the base model Keurig for quite awhile, finally decided to fill a reservoir instead of measuring out one cup of water for every single cup of tea or coffee. So with this 6-8 cup water reservoir, I at more at ease in my kitchen. Got a good value in performance for the price. Only two of us at home, so making a pot of coffee is not our usual mode any more, this single cup system works great for me. No criticisms on the machine, it does what I have wanted it to do for the past 4 months. Recommend it.
