review/summary: Fantastic Espresso Maker for the money!review/text: This espresso maker is cheap (money-wise), relatively speaking and is very well made. It doesn't take up much space and is very easy to clean. I've been making espresso for about 3 months and they turn out consistently great every time. I know this because I systematically make trips to Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, Tim Hortons, etc. and taste their espresso. I try to emulate that taste and I believe I have done it. Starbucks is the best tasting espresso and I've found that Pike's place roast ground fine (I have a Cuisinart Conical Burr Grinder, set to "2") is the best. Trader Joe's House Blend is pretty fantastic too and when I can't find a deal on Starbucks coffee, it's what I use. Some people say it's noisy, but what can you expect? It's a compressor. The frothing wand isn't the best, but it works well. I make my wife the Starbucks White Chocolate Mocha's daily and she can't taste the difference (Fontana White chocolate sauce - 3 pumps). If your wife loves Starbucks Latte's as much as mine does and you can brew it for her for $1.30 per "grande," you're well on your way to paying this off in about month ($87/month savings for the math inclined). I love espresso and I love this machine; take care of it and it performs consistently well each and every time.
