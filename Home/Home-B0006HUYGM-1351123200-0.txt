review/summary: Powerful and convenient.review/text: After researching several hand-held vacuum cleaners, I decided on this powerful unit. There is ease of use as well as emptying of accumulated debris following clean ups. Further, despite this not being a cordless cleaner, the extensive length of the electrical cord reduces potential interference during use. I'm satisfied with this purchase.
