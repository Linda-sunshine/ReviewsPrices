review/summary: Very nice sheetsreview/text: Purchased these for my teen who graduated to a larger bed to match his growing frame. The color is as depicted and the sheets are very soft and warm. We are noticing a bit of piling after only a few washes which kept me from giving these sheets 5 stars. However, I would definitely purchase these again.
