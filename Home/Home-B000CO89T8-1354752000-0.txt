review/summary: A warmer that worksreview/text: My 88 year old mother loves her coffee but sips it so slowly that it goes cold before she's downed a quarter of a cup. Last year, I bought a cheap no-name cup warmer that just didn't work. when that finally gave up the ghost, I settled on the Mr. Coffee model hoping that they wouldn't lend their reputation to junk. I was right.This cup warmer really works. Three and four hours later, the coffee is hot. Good purchase.
