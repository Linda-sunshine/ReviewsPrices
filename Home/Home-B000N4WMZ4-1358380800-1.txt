review/summary: Purchased as a gift for a friendreview/text: I purchases the Lodge Color Dutch Oven, Island Spice Red, 6-Quart as a gift for a friend who had been bemoaning her lack of a dutch oven. She specifically wanted an cast-iron pot with enamal coating and knew she wanted the Lodge brand, but found it too expensive.I found this on Amazon for a GREAT price and she LOVES IT! She says it cooks beautifully and it looks great in her kitchen.Couldn't be happier!
