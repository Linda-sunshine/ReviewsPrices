review/summary: A solid little heater for small spacesreview/text: This heater doesn't take up a great amount of space and makes no noise at all. It's easy to tell, visibly, which setting you're using (800 or 400W). These are relatively low wattages compared to the energy demands of some space heaters. It is extremely lightweight and has a convenient handle near the top so that it's easy to shove in my closet as soon as I've unplugged it and let it cool. I have recommended it to friends.
