review/summary: Qualityreview/text: This is by far the best can opener I've used. I went through 3 can openers in less than a year. I bought them at various brick-and-mortar stores and they were just very poor quality. This is a quality opener though. It cuts through cans like they are butter and not much force is needed. I'm willing to bet that even elderly people with arthritis can use this can opener. I have owned it for over a year and it still works like new. This is a quality product that I would recommend to anyone.
