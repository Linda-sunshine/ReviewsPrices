review/summary: It pops, it rocks, I'm hungry, I'm happy!review/text: I tried this popcorn popper after I returned the Cuisinart hot-air popper. This popper works much better, it doesn't blow out all the popcorn before it is popped and just works great.The only thing that I liked about the Cuisinart was that it had an on/off switch, which this unit does not have. I'm not really into unplugging stuff all the time, and it is more than just that I'm lazy. The unplugged cord end is sometimes hard to find and my outlet (ok, so my kitchen outlet positioning isn't great) isn't all that accessible. I wound up just using a short extension cord and I unplug it from there.
