review/summary: Way better than WagnerWare because you can actually buy onereview/text: Let's start off with something that is not entirely clear from the description of this Lodge skillet on the Amazon website... the description states that Lodge is an "American-based company" but does not expressly state whether this skillet is made in the United States. It is - the tag on this Lodge skillet states Made in USA. Why does the description dance around that issue? Some copy writer needs a new line of work...Next, some people may be trying to decide between Lodge and the Wagner Ware (WagnerWare - American Culinary Cookware) products. Let me tell you from my personal experience, you may regret it if you decide to order Wagner Ware. Don't get me wrong, the Wagner Ware product is nice. However, the company is terrible to do business with. If your experience is like mine, you will wait and wait and wait for your order to arrive, then try to contact them only to find out that it is impossible to reach somebody when you email or call, and when they finally do respond it will be with excuses about how something you did was not quite right. Avoid the headaches and get the Lodge now. You will soon be cooking on a very fine skillet that, I can attest, does every bit as good a job as the Wagner Ware. Plus, no headaches.
