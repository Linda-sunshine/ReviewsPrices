review/summary: Great little coffee potreview/text: I love this and it is the 4th one I have bought (2 were for gifts). Forget all those $100 one cup pots. This does the same thing for a fraction of the price. Every cup of coffee I drink is fresh, never sits in a pot. And...stays warm in the thermal cup. I hope they never quit making this product. I love Black and Decker!
