review/summary: I Really Like It!!review/text: I didn't know what to expect, but I had read the other reviews on it and made my decision to try it based on the reviews. I really do like it a lot! It is light weight and easy for me to use. I like the fact that the head swivels. I also like that it has a power nozzle for carpets on the last setting. The head swivels clear down for easy access under low areas. It also has a lot of power for such a small vacuum. I would buy it again from Amazon. Good service, good product.
