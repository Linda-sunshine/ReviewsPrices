review/summary: Send it back to Chinareview/text: Disappointing is the first word....after all the 4 and 5 start reviews we read? I have to admit, we were suckered into this purchase. The good reviews must be written by Keurig employees or people who like EVERYTHING!It's a pretty unit, and then you use it. The parts are cheaply made. The unit sucked water from the reservoir and heated it up inside. We put our Kcup filter screen in the holder and locked it in. The "hot" water went through the Kcup and started going straight through the grounds and into the coffee cup, bypassing most of the grounds.The water started coming out around the intended center dispenser and leaked around the sides of the unit, completely missing the cup. It created a mess and had me looking for my receipt. If I didn't want my money back, I would sledge hammer this worthless coffee maker into a million pieces and send it back to the Chinese.Did I mention..DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP?
