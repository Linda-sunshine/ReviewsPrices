review/summary: Does what it shouldreview/text: I like to check the temperature when cooking meat, poultry and fish and this works great. I stick it in the food and THEN turn it on and wait until the number stabilizes then i check again and make sure the food it cooked through. Great product and even better price! A staple in any kitchen... if you cook meat/fish. I would recommend and buy again if needed to in the future!
