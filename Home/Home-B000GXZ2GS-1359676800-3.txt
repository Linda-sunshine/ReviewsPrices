review/summary: Not durablereview/text: I am sorry to report that after using this for a couple of years, the plastic inside where the hot water mixes is crazing. Actually, it looks/feels more like an inner lining of the tube is degrading, while the tube itself seems ok on the outside.This has made delicious coffee for a couple of years, and it wasn't that expensive, but I'm disappointed that it is ready for the trash bin now. I won't be replacing it.There have been a lot of reports about the toxicity of plastics exposed to high heat. I don't know if this is a problem with this particular plastic (especially the inner lining which is visibly deteriorating), but I'm not taking any chances.If it were made in stainless, it would be expensive, and I'd buy one in a heartbeat because it makes such tasty coffee so efficiently. If it were made of glass, I'd still buy it, although you don't want to know how many glass coffee carafes I've broken. If it were made of porcelain, it would be clunky and heavy, but I'd still buy it.But plastic? Don't waste your money.
