review/summary: Great coffee from an inexpensive machinereview/text: This is an excellent entry-level machine. There's a few tricks to getting the best out of it....-- Keep the filters clean (they're not too convenient to clean so its easy to neglect them)-- Use filtered water-- Use not too fine and not too dark coffee (people tend to equate 'expresso' with superfine, really dark coffee)-- Preheat the cups-- Don't expect to make a mug of coffee, expresso shots are only 25-30mlThe steam wand is a little short but for the milk jug that I use it sits at just the right height to make a great froth.What problems and inconveniences you get from the machine stem from it being an expresso machine. If you just want to push the button and go then don't bother -- get a Tassimo, it will give you good results every time with minimal work. The extra work needed to get the best from this machine results in not just good but great coffee. Once you've cracked it there will be no going back -- the only way forward is the way of true coffee junkie with a future dominated by a better machine (from the same manufacturer, of course), more attention to the grind, beans and tamping.
