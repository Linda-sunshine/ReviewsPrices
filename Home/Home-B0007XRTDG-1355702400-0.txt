review/summary: I've stopped using my stove!review/text: It's is a great skillet. I bought it for the size. It is big enough to act as a griddle -- I can make bacon in it and pancakes to feed several people. The temp control is responsive, the glass cover convenient, and clean up is easy.Strongly recommend this brand and this bigger size.
