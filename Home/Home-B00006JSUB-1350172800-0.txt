review/summary: Good, but not as nonstick as hopedreview/text: Bought this iron skillet in hopes of having something nonstick that would last longer than the usual nonstick pan for the same price. Unfortunately it wasn't as nonstick as hoped first out of the box (so pre-seasoned wasn't quite as pre-seasoned as hoped), but it has been getting progressively more nonstick the more we've used it. It is *very* heavy, the upside of which is it could double as a weapon (if you can pick it up), so it's nice to have another person on hand to help get the food out for you. It also takes longer to heat up, and the handles are hot when it does so, but this should all be obvious. It does require a little more attention if you want to keep it/make it more nonstick - no washing with detergent, no scraping with metal. Wash with hot water, dry immediately and rub down with a little oil. Doing this has made it so that even if food burns to the bottom, I can remove it very easily with a scrape of a wooden spatula.
