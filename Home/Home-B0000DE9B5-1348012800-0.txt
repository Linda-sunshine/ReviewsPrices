review/summary: excellent qualityreview/text: I bought this as a water jug for the office. Instead of multiple trips to the water cooler, one fill of this jug and I know I got in a good day's worth of water. The jug has worked wonderfully for this purpose and has remained in great condition. It is made of very heavy, attractive, quality glass!
