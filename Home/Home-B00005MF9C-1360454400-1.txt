review/summary: Great coffee maker but the cups lid leaks.review/text: Been using this coffee maker for 3 months now. The coffee maker works great but the lid for the mug is way too loose. It leaks when you turn the mug up to take a sip. If you don't suck where the lid meets the cup after you take a sip coffee will dribble down your shirt. BAD MUG!UPDATE: There are complaints of the coffee not being filtered properly and coffee grounds overflowing into the fill reservoir as well as other parts of the coffee maker.This usually occurs when the coffee has been ground too fine. I like to try several different types of coffee so I will keep a running list of coffees that will work well with this and ones that wont. If you are considering buying this coffee maker and regularly drink coffees that I have listed as "BAD" you will need to buy whole bean and ground on your own so that you can control how coarse/fine the coffee is ground.Here is what I have so far:Dunkin Donuts: GOODArcher Farms: GOODSeattle's Best: BAD
