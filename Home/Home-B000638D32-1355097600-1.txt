review/summary: I love this knifereview/text: It came sharp enough to shave the hair off my arm. We've had it for a while now and it has not dulled. This is the most useful and practical knife that we have ever owned; and we use it every day.The length, shape, and handle is well thought out. It's a great every day knife. It's not the Ferrari of knives, but it easily is the Honda Civic of knives. Practical and well designed but not expensive.Don't let the price fool you. This is a great knife. I recommend this knife to any one looking for a &#34;better knife&#34;. Purcahse this and then buy a 100$+ knife if you find it lacking. My money is on you keeping this knife and forgetting about purchasing another.And if you don't like it....you'r out...what ...$20 bucks ? (retail is more, but you can find this knife for around there) Even then, I bet you'll probably keep it around for some use. I can't imagine some one not liking this knife.
