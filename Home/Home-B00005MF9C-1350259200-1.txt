review/summary: Simply the best!!!!!!review/text: On my third one. This little machine has the right price and delivers an excellent tasting cup of coffee each time. I saw one reviewer had complaints regarding the grounds getting into the water compartment and brewing head. That is not the fault of the coffee maker but the use of coffee which has been ground too fine. Stick with the pre-ground coffee and this will not occur. The free insulated mug is a bonus too!!
