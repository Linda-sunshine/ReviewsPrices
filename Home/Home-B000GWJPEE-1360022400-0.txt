review/summary: cute and works greatreview/text: I tried many other humidifiers and they always quit in 3 to 4 days, consumer reports said &#34;This was the best&#34; so I ordered it and I agree, The gallon of water does last 24 hours before you have to fill up again. I only use distilled water so it will keep it cleaner than using tap water.
