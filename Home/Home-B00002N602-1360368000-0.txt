review/summary: So many uses!review/text: I love my stainless steel Presto! I use it to heat frozen leftovers as well as cook meals fast. I've been wondering about microwaves for a while now and I just feel better using the pressure cooker for my family. Plus, where a microwave will make things tough, the pressure cooker makes meat more tender!
