review/summary: Like it a lotreview/text: I looked for quite a while to find a waffle iron that wasn't one of those Belgian models. I prefer the thinner, crisper waffles.The only problem was I had trouble finding a good recipe. Finally made up my own using Bisquick and Diet Orange soda, with Splenda and a few other things that work really well.I'd give it 5 stars, but the slider is pretty much useless. I set it in the highest position and just leave it there. But it cleans up easily and for me, it's what I was looking for.Just don't count on really using the temperature setting. I cook my waffles well; leaving the waffle in an extra cycle. Experiment with the thickness of the batter and you'll find what works best for you.
