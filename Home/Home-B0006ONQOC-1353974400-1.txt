review/summary: LOVE this Ice Cream maker!!review/text: We constantly use this machine, and have had nothing but pure enjoyment out of it. Definitely freeze your container, and know that you likely have to freeze your ice cream for another couple of hours (except for the first &#34;softer&#34;, can't wait any longer bowl). The recipes are great and we just love this ice cream maker!
