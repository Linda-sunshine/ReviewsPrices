review/summary: Great for our 5th grader!review/text: We've been using this thermos for about 4 weeks, and so far it's great. I fill it with hot water a few minutes before time to put in the food item, so it's warm when the food goes in. She eats about 4 hours after it has been packed, and to this point, the thermos has kept everything nice and warm.
