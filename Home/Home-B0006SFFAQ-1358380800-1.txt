review/summary: Husband's Xmas presentreview/text: We had an old drip coffee maker, so I decided to get this model for my husband for Xmas.He loves it. And, I love the easy cleanup. The pot, lid, basket filter and filter holder all can go in the dish washer.The timer is easy to program and has a 2-4 cup setting.The only negative thing I can say is that you need to have good aim to fill the water chamber.
