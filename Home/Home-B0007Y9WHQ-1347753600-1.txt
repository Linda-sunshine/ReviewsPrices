review/summary: Love it!review/text: Love the world cuisine tri-blade slicer, so easy to use and even better...it's easy to CLEAN! Tried many veggies on it so far and the harder they are, the easier it is to slice them (so refrig. if they are soft!) Would definitely recommend it to friends...my fav. doing potatoes and sweet potatoes into chips in the oven! YUM
