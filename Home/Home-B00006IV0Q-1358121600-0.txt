review/summary: A reliable, cleanable maker of mediocre coffeereview/text: It's not Presto's fault that percolated coffee, no matter how much you pack into the basket, is watery and flavorless. The water comes through simply too hot because it has to boil. This burns out the oils of the coffee and waters it. We have been wanting to get away from coffee makers that have plastic conduits and containers, because the plastic decays rapidly and the coffee declines. We've often used Chemex because water under boiling temperature drips through and produces incredibly good coffee. But who wants to stand at the counter for 10 minutes, gradually adding water to a Chemex coffee maker? Worse, there is no way to keep Chemex coffee warm. In the meantime, Presto's coffee maker is 1960's technology still of good quality, if you don't really care for coffee; or if you like Starbucks-level bitter, burned robusta coffee.
