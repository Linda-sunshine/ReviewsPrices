review/summary: Cuisinart SmartStickreview/text: I wanted one of the Cuisinart Smartsticks...and once I received it as a gift, decided I needed another one for my winter home in another state. I have several uses for it...milkshakes are a favorite. Also used in making some soups and when making gravy.The plastic measuring cup is an added bonus.
