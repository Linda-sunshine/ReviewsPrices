review/summary: Big hitreview/text: This was a Christmas present for my college student child who isn't a coffee drinker. It is his starter coffee maker. He hasn't had any spills or problems. He decided to use the mug that comes with it strictly as a coffee pot so it doesn't get broken. Uses his own travel mug. The only negative I have seen is that although it has a permanent filter he'd like to still use paper filters because it's easier in the dorm room. I've not found size #1 in stores & it isn't cost effective to buy them online.
