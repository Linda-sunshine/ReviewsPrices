review/summary: Small and powerful, easy to cleanreview/text: One of my favorite kitchen appliances. It is perfect for making pesto or hummus, etc. I love that it comes in so many different colors now. It is also very easy to clean. There's an area on the bottom you can use the wrap the cord around when storing away.
