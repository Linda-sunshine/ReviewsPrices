review/summary: This thing actually works!review/text: My mom has a bad wrist, so I got this for her. I figured it would be easier for her to use than a traditional Rabbit opener and it is. It took me a couple of tries to get the hang of it, but it does work! My only gripe is that it's huge! Also, the red light doesn't seem to go out or change to a different color when charged. I plugged it in for at least 10 hours and it always glowed red. I can't believe that a small item like a wine opener would require more than 10 hours of charging, but there was nothing to indicate that it was fully charged. But the bottom line is that it actually works and comes with a foil cutter and chiller. I got this on a lightning deal for $16 and it was definitely worth that. Would I have spent $24? Not sure.
