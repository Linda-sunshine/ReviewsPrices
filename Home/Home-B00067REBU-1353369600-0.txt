review/summary: Haven't gotten it to make my sourdough recipe yetreview/text: I have used the bread machine 6 times. I keep adjusting the recipe, but so far my sourdough bread is quite dense and heavy. I am not ready to give up yet. I bought the machine to replace having to kneed and roll out the bread. I am sure it would make the white bead recipe very well. The machine has quite a few menu choices. I have tried the ones that allow for extra rising time. Once I get it to make my sourdough bread well, I will give it a higher rating.
