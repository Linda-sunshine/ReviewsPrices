review/summary: Great So Far!!review/text: I have been using this coffee pot for about a month with no complaints. I'm not sure what the hubbub is on the whole lid thing. It is not hard to figure out how to put the lid on and where to line it up. You do need to make sure that it is not cross threaded; however, it won't tighten to where the arrow points to the spout if it is cross threaded. The lid design is ingenious! However, I can see that keeping it somewhat clean is very important. The little channels that contain the balls in the lid design could easily get sticky and even clogged if not rinsed thoroughly. Could that be the problem with some of those that runneth over?The coffee stays quite hot for the length of time that I need in the morning. I've been using the programmable type coffee makers for years and this one works as well as any others I've had. Again, it is not hard to figure out how to program it and set the clock. If you have used a digital watch or alarm clock you have the basic skills needed.With regard to the carafe. This is my first try at an insulated style and I love it. I am a firefighter and it has always made me nervous to leave the house with the coffee pot hotplate still energized. I love that fact that this coffeemaker has no hotplate. It goes through its cycle to make a pot of coffee and shuts off allowing the insulated carafe to do its job.If I get bit by the mysterious "coffee all over the countertop" bug in a month or two I'll be sure and update my review.
