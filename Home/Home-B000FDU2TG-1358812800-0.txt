review/summary: Go Kitchenaid!review/text: I purchased this blender in 2008 and the jar began to leak after two years of moderate use. I had been putting up with it since it was outside the warranty period (didn't want to spend $30+ for a replacement jar).That was until last week when I finally decided to buy a new blender but called the customer service at Kitchenaid before completing the order. I was thrilled to know that I will be getting a redesigned replacement jar for free. I received the shipment today and it works great with no leaks!As far as the performance goes its been awesome ever since, but for the leaking jar which is now fixed. It has everything you need from a $100 blender...robust, quiet, dishwasher safe and of course excellent customer service. (I didn't need to complete my order for the new blender)
