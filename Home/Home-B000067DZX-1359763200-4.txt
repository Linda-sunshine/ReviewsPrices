review/summary: Junk - Will Not Waste Any More Money On This Productreview/text: No more of these for me. They used to last about two months, but now two weeks.I have seen that PUR has weaseled their words and now say two weeks to a max of two months.Never had any issues with this product, but something internally in the filter is not the same as the older ones.
