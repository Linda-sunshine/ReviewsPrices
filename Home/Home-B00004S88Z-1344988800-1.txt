review/summary: All American 921 near professional canning abilityreview/text: I have owned, discarded and become frustrated with many different brands pressure canners over time. The All American 921 is as close to professional a home canner can get. It is pricey but well worth it for many reasons. You don't have to fight to open it after completion of a canning cycle. The capacity is fantastic because it will hold 7 quarts (litres) or 21 pint jars. This is the volume I usually can and if you are not regularly doing this kind of volume it would be more energy efficient to purchase a smaller model in the All American line. The manual is very detailed and simple to understand even for the beginner. It is heavy, so note that you will not be lifting it around when full of jars and water. For this reason it needs to be loaded on the stove but it won't bounce around the stove under heat like some of the cheaper ones I have owned. The pressure dial is first class and petcock valve is of great quality. Its' safety features make me comfortable to use it. It closes with many screws caps around the side of the lid making it much easier to open when compared to some of the twist-on-lid models you need to hit with a rubber mallet to open the top. I have no affiliation with this company but one subtle benefit is that is made in the US and is an etremely high quality product.
