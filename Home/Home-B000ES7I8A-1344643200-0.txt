review/summary: "It's the Best"review/text: This is my third electric kettle. Rather than go into the problems I encountered with others, I will just say after a year this one is the best....no cons worth mentioning! I purchased this kettle here in Canada (not from Amazon) but wanted to comment on other reviews about this kettle not being 8 cup or 64 oz. In the world of drip coffee makers and electric kettles..a cup is 5 oz. This kettle is 1.2 litre (a litre is 34oz.) which is 40 oz. So it is eight cups...but not 64 oz.
