review/summary: Feels Good, (Really Smells)review/text: We had to air this out in the summer sun for two days because it had a very strong odor. However, the smell reminds me of chocolate mint, so that's not all bad. The firmness of the foam is good, and I am glad we bought it to make our air bed more comfortable. I think I will get another.
