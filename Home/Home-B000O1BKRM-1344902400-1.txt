review/summary: Perfect for baby food!review/text: I LOVE these. My daughter is 5 months old and I decided to make my own baby food. I read that silicon ice cube trays are one of the best ways to store the food so I purchased these. They were the best price compared to Walmart, Target, and other trays available on Amazon. I have made several batches of food and these trays make it easy to remove the food once it's frozen and are easy to clean. I rinsed them and then ran them through the dishwasher and they were ready to use again.
