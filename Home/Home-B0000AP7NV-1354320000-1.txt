review/summary: Be careful of the open water container!review/text: Regardless of the performance of the filter itself, I must issue a warning about this particular model. Its permanently open spout, unlike other models, is inherently unsanitary, and it my apartment, it attracted roaches to crawl in there and drown. Our water filter pitcher became a roach graveyard! It's pretty disgusting, and we can't use it anymore. Please make sure that whatever model you buy has a CLOSED SPOUT.
