review/summary: I love this!!! Definitely recommending this to everyonereview/text: Update:Just bought 5 more, and they were delivered timely as usual. I am super happy! Now I have to get smaller ones for my small cabinets ;)I bought it not really expecting to find it useful, but I love it! After filling it with container lids I figure I need more to fit everything else that's awkward in the cabinets! I'm super excited to finally be able to have clutter-free cabinets. I should be a spokesperson ;)Some things it's great for:ziplocs and trash bagscontainer lidspot lidssponges and wipeswashcloths...and more, but I'm too lazy to write them all.
