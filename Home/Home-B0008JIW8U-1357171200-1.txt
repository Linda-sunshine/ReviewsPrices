review/summary: A pretty good replacement for my old onereview/text: After quite a few year, I finally managed to break the carafe on my old KitchenAide 4-cup coffeemaker. I called their 800# and they said the apparatus was no longer being made and they were unable to replace the carafe. So, I bought this one and have to say that it makes just as good coffee. No complaints other than it is a blah black and my old one was bright red!
