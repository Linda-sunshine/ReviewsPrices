review/summary: Awesome pan, 3rd party lidreview/text: Having been given hand me down pans from my parents when going to college and moving in with various people, my parents' already scratched pans have gone through a lot. It was time to find a new one. Knowing I'd be using it a lot for the morning items (eggs, bacon, potatoes), as well as pan frying items, I opted to search for the larger sized pans. I read the reviews on the T-fal as well as seeing it the winner (by far) in America's Test Kitchen. This seemed to be the pan to get. Nonstick, oven safe, dishwasher safe, and (supposedly) can even be used with metal utensils; and at a great price. I had to try it.I got it early in the morning, which was great, because I could test it with breakfast. Bacon and eggs were so easy to make. Our old pan's nonstick surface was worn out in some areas and made cooking anything a challenge. This was such a breeze. It didn't seem to work with any of my other lids so I went on a quest to find one. Supposedly, theFarberware 12-Inch Glass Lidworks well with this pan. I accidentally bought theCalphalon Contemporary 12 Inch Glass Coveras I had it open in another tab. I'm not disappointed. I think it looks much better than the Farberware lid. The only thing is, it doesn't sit completely well on the pan, but I can tell that no steam is escaping. As OCD as I am, and as much as that line bugs me, I still prefer the nicer looking lid.The only really small issue (and it's not even an issue) I have with this pan is that the dot in the middle doesn't seem to change colors for me. I don't care as I wouldn't trust it nor did I ever have it before, but, beware if you're expecting it to magically tell you that it's "hot enough" (whatever that means).
