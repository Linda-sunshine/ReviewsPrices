review/summary: Nice Pitcherreview/text: I got this mainly because I wanted something that could remove the taste of chlorine form tap water and was big enough for 4 people at the dinner table.This does the job perfectly. I have not had any issues with the lid falling off that some other people have experienced. The water tastes great.
