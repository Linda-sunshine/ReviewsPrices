review/summary: Easy to clean means you will actually use itreview/text: I don't do anything exotic with this Juicer - just make a glass of veggie juice every morning. Typically 3 carrots, 3 celery stalks, a cucumber, half a head of romaine, and a golden delish apple. That fills the pitcher right to the top. You don't have to peel the cucumber. You do have to cut the apple into quarters to fit it in. The juicer is VERY quick. So in about 2 minutes you have a pitcher full of juice and then it takes about 2-3 minutes to clean the juicer.I use beets also when the produce market has them. I use the whole beet, top and all. I've tried Kale, people say it's healthy but I didn't get much juice out of it.Tried leeks. Don't do that. Just don't.Anyway highest recommendations for this Juicer, I've been using it every day for about a month now and I'm quite happy with it.
