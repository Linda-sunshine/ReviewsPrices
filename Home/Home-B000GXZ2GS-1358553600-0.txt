review/summary: Toss your Mr. Coffee away foreverreview/text: I'm a huge fan of coffee, but hated french presses and throwing away tons of coffee when I would brew a whole pot (or drinking the whole thing and feeling sick), so the Aeropress is perfect for me. I still prefer to patronise my local coffee shops most of the time, but on the weekends when I just want to relax, this gets me my fix very quickly. It takes very little time to brew and once you master the method (I would follow their instructions to the letter), it takes no time at all. Even coffee that's not too great tastes awesome in the Aeropress, although quality coffee like Sightglass in SF tastes even better.If you like real coffee and don't want to spend time toiling over a Chemex, this is your next best step.
