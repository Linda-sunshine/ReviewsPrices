review/summary: Great chopper!review/text: I wanted something that would chop small portions of veggies, cheese, and herbs for soups and sauces and nuts and chocolate for cooking and baking. This chopper has handled everything I've thrown in it wonderfully. The best part is that it doesn't take up much space on my counter, and I can easily tuck it away in a cupboard which cannot be said for larger food processors.
