review/summary: Brushes don't spin, right out of box.review/text: Right out of the box the brushes didn't spin, possibly due to a broken turbine, which according to customer service could be due to something happening during shipping. Apparently the turbines are 'very fragile'. Because we messed around trying new things rather than immediatly returning it, we missed the 30 day replacement window and so can not return it to amazon. Now the only thing to do is send it to a service center which will take ~4-6 weeks just for 'evaluation' before they even go about fixing it. I should have trusted the unfavorable reviews from folks with similar issues. I read them but hoped i wouldn't be one of the unlucky ones. booo. I'm disappointed.
