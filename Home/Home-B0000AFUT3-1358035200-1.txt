review/summary: Great mirror at a great price!review/text: I'm glad I ignored the negative reviews and chose to purchase the mirror anyway! It's a great mirror, and the lights are plenty bright. I have to say, the negative reviews people have given about dim or flickering lights really annoy me, because the manufacturers took the time to write in the instructions, and in a special product insert, AND on a sticker placed directly on the mirror that if you experience dim or flickering lights when turn it on the first time, all you need to do is turn the switch off and on rapidly several times to get the lights working properly. They even apologize for the &#34;inconvenience&#34; of asking you to flip a switch a few times, and assure the mirror will work fine after that. How people could miss instructions in THREE separate places and then whine that their mirror doesn't work right is beyond me! But this is a terrific mirror, great size, and I love the various setting for indoor and outdoor lighting types. Great purchase!
