review/summary: pretty good, but yes, really smallreview/text: I've had this coffeemaker for a year & it is very effective. Only downside is that it's hard to find the (baby) coffee filters for it! And it really does only make about a grande's worth of black coffee. Also, be careful of placing anything directly in front of it because the front buttons press very easily, and sometimes it turns on accidentally. But hey, for the price, worth it.
