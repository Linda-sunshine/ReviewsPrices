review/summary: Decent Chairreview/text: Arrived broken!on January 8, 2013The package is OK, but the chair itself is broken. There is almost no protection to the heavy parts!I have returned it for replacement. I'll see if this time they will put at least some protection!--UPDATE--The replacement arrived yesterday (Jan 10) and this time they've put some wrapping to the heavy parts so they did not break each other.After I put together the chair, it looks pretty nice. The levers are hard to control, but once adjust properly, I feel very comfortable sitting in it!One other thing about the lever is that for the height-lever, if you do not push it all the way back down, it still locks the height. But after you leave it for a while, the seat will raise to the maximum height.Other than the lever issues, this is a decent chair!
