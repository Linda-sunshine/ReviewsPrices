review/summary: Excellent product.review/text: Reliable. Simple programming. Automatic yeast addition a nice feature. Loaf size options are good, but this machine still makes a &#34;breadmaker&#34; loaf, not the more traditional horizontal loaf. Single impeller seems to do a find job of mixing and kneading. Some reviews recommend double impeller--this unit seems to do fine with a single unit.
