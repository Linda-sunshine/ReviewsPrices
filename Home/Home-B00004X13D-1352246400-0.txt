review/summary: Fabulous waffle baker.review/text: Love this waffle maker. Use nonstick spray and bake waffle for 5 minutes. Comes out perfect everytime. Easy to clean. I fill bottom chambers with water, close lid and let steam while still plugged in. After 1 minute, unplug and pour out water. Be careful water will be hot, but it steam cleans unit. then just wipe.
