review/summary: Awesome!review/text: This mixer is wonderful, it arrived very quickly and compared to my old KitchenAid, the smaller blue one, it rocks. My old one seemed like it was on it's last leg, but I suppose after 20 years of hard duty, it should be. Mixing three loaves of bread dough, really made the poor thing's motor seem like it was toast. When I started smelling it burning, I ordered this new one. The motor doesn't even slow down with those same three loaves of bread dough. Very nice Mixer!
