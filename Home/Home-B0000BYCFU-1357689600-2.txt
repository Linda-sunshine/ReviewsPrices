review/summary: Best purchase I made this year.review/text: Important piece of advice: If you are buying this pressure canner, go now and add the pressure regulatorPresto Pressure Canner Pressure Regulatorand an additional cooking/canning rackPresto Cooking/Canning Rack for Pressure Cannerto your order. This pressure canner is made to handle a double stack of pint jars- just put one rack on the bottom as normal, load some seven pint jars then add another rack and load it with seven pints, too. The adjustable pressure regulator (which really should come with this pressure canner) will save your sanity. I love canning but the constant baby sitting to try to maintain 11 lbs of pressure drove me crazy. Up and down, up and down every 10 to 15 minutes. With the adjuster, just set it up for the 10 lbs pressure and keep an ear tuned. Life saver!
