review/summary: Takes a Beating and Well it keeps on working.review/text: Bought this Juicer back in September so I think its time to let ya know what I think.I use this product every day, sometimes twice a day, mostly for work which is on the average 6 days a week.Like to have enough juice to last my shift, so I prepare approximately 40 ounces of juice daily for work.Most of my juices include some variation of the following:celery, carrots, tomato, cucumber, ginger, apples (either green or red), lemon/lime, strawberries, blueberryWith the amount of daily use I put this to, it really does the job I need it to. Occasionally, after shutting it off, it will sputter while the motor is winding down. But that is not a frequent occurrence,My wife complains that I waste to much because of the unused pulp getting thrown out. I tell her that These juices are all juice, ready to drink and your tastebuds will really wake up to the taste of fresh juice. I have noticed to that my health seems to be improving, for instance my energy levels are way up, skin looks healthier too.And she does admit that these juices do blend well together. Its amazing what you can to with a lemon here or a few strawberries mixed into your drink.
