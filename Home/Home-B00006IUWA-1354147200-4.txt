review/summary: A great little popcorn popperreview/text: I purchased the Presto PopLite (Model 04820) for my wife's birthday this year after the one she'd had for about 10 years finally gave out. It is a solidly constructed machine that does its job well and is compact enough to fit into a small space in a cabinet or under the counter. It is very simple to use. All you have to do is fill the included measuring cup with popcorn kernels, dump it into the popper, place the top onto the base, and plug it in. There is no power switch, no settings to change, and no moving parts outside of the air blower itself. The Presto PopLite uses only hot air to pop popping corn kernels into a light treat.The Presto PopLite does finish popping quickly. I've never had any burnt popcorn using a Presto PopLite, and it leaves very few unpopped kernels. I will admit, my best luck with having the fewest unpopped kernels has been withPop Secret Jumbo Popping Corn.The only downside is that once it gets down to the last bit of popcorn left to pop, the hot air rushing through the machine does cause those last pieces of popcorn to shoot out uncontrolably, which can cause a bit of a mess if you don't have proper bowl or bag for the popper to shoot the popcorn into.
