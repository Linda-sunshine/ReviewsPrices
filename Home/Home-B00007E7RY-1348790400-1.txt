review/summary: air purifierreview/text: This product is in my bedroom, keeping the air feeling very clean and pure. I am on chemotherapy and it is important that I keep bacteria and viruses at bay. This seems to be working fine. It does make noise, but I love that because I sleep better with the sound.
