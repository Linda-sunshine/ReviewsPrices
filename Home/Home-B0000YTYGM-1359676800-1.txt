review/summary: Good for 2 yearsreview/text: I wanted a 12-cup thermal coffee maker because I do a lot of entertaining. This one worked great for awhile, but at about 6 months, it popped open while I was pouring a cup of coffee (black plastic part unsealed from metal thermal part) After cleaning up the mess, I snapped it back together and it worked great again... for awhile. I have continued to use it because the "mess incidents" were infrequent but the last time, it split apart again after only 2 uses. I'm replacing it but will try another brand.
