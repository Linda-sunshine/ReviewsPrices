review/summary: Broken Mechanismreview/text: This blender replaced a still working one from Braun that I had for over 10 years, and couldn't last 6 months. The blade stopped on a piece of frozen spinach and after closer inspection the linkage between the handle and the blade was stripped. Odd that they'd make it out of a tiny piece of plastic and not something beefier. Wish I read the reviews here before getting it, because apparently this is a common problem. This'll be my last Cuisinart product...
