review/summary: Great breakfast skillets!review/text: I purchased two of these skillets to use for breakfast skillets for my wife and I and we love them.They are your standard Lodge Logic skillets but in a smaller size, which is the perfect size for breakfast.We make them, spread the cheese on them and pop them into the toaster oven to melt the cheese. Then we can serve it directly at the table, one skillet for each of one and the heat from the iron keeps the food hot while you eat.We also have larger skillets that we could use and have people serve themselves from it, but the individual skillets make a much better impression.We'll be buying more so that when we have guests, each person still has one.The only complaint that I have with it, which I have about all Lodge Logic skillets, is that the surface is fairly rough, unlike some older (no longer in production) skillets. This roughness allows for food to stick on the skillet more than on those other types of skillets. I'm hoping that, with years of use, the surface will get smoother.
