review/summary: Good performance once you find the right quantity of doughreview/text: I gave this to my daughter and son-in-law for Christmas. They report that they love it and have been making bread every weekend since receiving it. They also say they have been experimenting to find the right amount of batter for optimal performance, but don't mind doing that. The main reason I give this a 4 and not a 5 is that fact plus the reality that my information is second hand.
