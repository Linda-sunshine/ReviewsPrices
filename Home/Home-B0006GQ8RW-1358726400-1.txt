review/summary: They work well!review/text: Bought these, already used up 4 of the 6 in the pack! They work well and I have no issues with them. My kids and I can taste the difference after our tap water is filtered (less chlorine taste)! Saves me the trouble of boiling my water - which is very convenient (you get drinking water straight away) besides being green in saving electricity (to boil the water)!Highly recommended!
