review/summary: Best price, excellent valuereview/text: Filter carts are filter carts and you buy what you need. These PUR seem to offer the best overall value and certainly get the job done. NOTE: Frankly I ignore the suggested life sticker on my PUR and use the filters until they get really slow. Nothing really &#34;wears out&#34; - the filter will keep on filtering till it just can't filter anymore and stop flowing.
