review/summary: How did I live so long without Cast Iron??review/text: I received this Lodge Cast Iron pan for Christmas, and I couldn't be happier! As read in other reviews, it is required that you season your new pan with oil for the first 2-3 uses. It takes a healthy amount of oil those first few test runs, but it is well worth the wait! After my initial oiling, I have been using my pan for months now without having to use a single drop of added oil. My crispy tofu has never been better :). I absolutely recommend this product, and forsee many of their wares in my future kitchen.
