review/summary: Worth Every Penny!review/text: I am not at all handy and if I can get this thing to work properly, anyone can! Just follow the directions perfectly. i also found a couple of 3-minute videos on YouTube that make everything crystal clear. Does a great job cleaning pet accidents. I bought this specifically to take care of my Doug's mistakes and it worked great--even cleaned mystery stains in my son's room that I am sure had been there for months!
