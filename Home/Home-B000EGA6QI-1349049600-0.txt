review/summary: Lasted 6 monthsreview/text: I loved it until it broke.The inner gears of the motor are plastic and eventually they stripped and no longer turned the blade.I do make a lot of soups where I would need the blender to puree potato and pumpkin, so perhaps my use is not typical. I'm hoping to find one with all metal gears as this has happened with other kitchen implements.It was great while it lasted, i liked that it detaches the blade portion for dishwashing.
