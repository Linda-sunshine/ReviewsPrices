review/summary: An Effective Infrared Heater for Petsreview/text: We have a mini long-haired Dachsund who parks himself in front of a hot air heating vent by the corner of the room to get warm during cold weather. Unfortunately, we can't see him when he's there and we want him to be in the middle of the room to be part of the family.So we tried the Optimus H-5210 Infrared Heater to resolve his discomfort and it worked perfectly. He now stretches out in front of the Optimus, placed in the middle of the room, and seems to be enjoying his warm comfort during the winter season. The best part for us is we set the heater at 400 watts which uses only 3.33 amps and supplements our house system for a very consistently warm temperature within the family room.The Optimus H-5210's low profile and silent radiance makes it perfect for pets, and is non-intrusive within our living space.
