review/summary: Soft, creamy, and warmreview/text: They look lovely with my dark brown wood bedframe and ivory headboard.They're soft and warm; VERY soft. Like kittens snuggling you all night as you sleep. Exactly what I was looking for.They're not warm enough for the winter without at least a light comforter, but that's fine for me as I like it a little cooler when I sleep.The fitted sheet stays in place surprisingly well.I definitely recommend these to anything looking for aesthetically pleasing, soft sheets.
