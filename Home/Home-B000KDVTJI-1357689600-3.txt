review/summary: Excellent, fast kettlereview/text: I've owned this kettle for almost a year now and have had no problems. It has travelled to many cubicles and has still worked perfectly.I heat up a standard 12 oz bottle of water and it boils the water faster than I can get up to get my cup and a bag of tea.Be sure when ordering this product. It is pretty, still shiny after all this time, works perfectly even after a year and is fast!
