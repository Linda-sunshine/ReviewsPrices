review/summary: Defective after 5 months - cannot return itreview/text: I loved this clock for the first week, then I started noticing the time would always be either behind or ahead, no matter how often I updated it to sync with any other clock. That did not bother me though because I purchased it mainly for the radio and the sound therapy. Now, 5 months later, the clock goes completely out and it will not turn on at all unless I mess with it for about 20 miniutes. Eventually it will work but it is inconsistent.
