review/summary: Buy Mr. Coffee LMX27 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker insteadreview/text: At first we loved this coffee maker. It is probably the most popular model since it seems everyone has one. The reason I hate it is because you cannot adjust the brew strength and it brewed our coffee extremely weak. We had to change from a medium roast to a dark roast just to get any coffee flavor. It was ridiculous. Buy the Mr. Coffee LMX27 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker instead. Not only is it much cheaper but it is less bulky, you can adjust the brew strength, and it is less expensive. The only thing I don't like is that the clock is not digital but it isn't an issue once you get used to it. Who tells time by their coffee maker anyway?
