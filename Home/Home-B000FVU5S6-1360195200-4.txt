review/summary: Good quality but not for deep mattressesreview/text: Ordered a Queen set of these because reviews seemed pretty good. They advertise it as fitting 18" mattresses. We have a 16" mattress so I figured it should be good to go. When they arrived I checked them even before washing. The pocket seam measures barely 15", nowhere near the 18" they describe. I tried them anyhow figuring maybe the pocket seam doesn't ride up to the top corner of the mattress, thinking maybe this is where they get the 18" fitment from. No luck. I had to wrestle with the fitted sheet even to stretch it over the final corner and then it wouldn't reach to the bottom of the mattress. That's without washing or drying which would make it worse. Ended up returning them. Quality seems good and the material feels nice. It's unfortunate the description isn't right. Sam's Club sells a deep pocket 450ct for forty bucks so I may give them a shot.
