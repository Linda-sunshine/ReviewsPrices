review/summary: Terrible flavour and smellreview/text: It took a while to figure out that it wasn't something in the freezer causing my drinks to taste bad. It was the new ice trays. Truly, every drink with this ice tastes terrible. I've ruined some very good bourbon as a result. They're going back.
