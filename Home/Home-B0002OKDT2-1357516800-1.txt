review/summary: Lots of juice!review/text: Wonderful juicer! Easy to use. Easy to clean. Gets more juice out of produce than my old centrifugal type juicer. It doesn't take up much counter space, either. The weighted end is heavy, so there's no tipping over when you're pushing the produce in. I haven't use it yet to make noodles, but will in the future.
