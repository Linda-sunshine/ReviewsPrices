review/summary: Bialetti is bomb.review/text: I have had the same one of these since sophomore year of high school, and I'm now finishing up sophomore year of college (i.e., I've had it for four years). I should probably order a new rubber ring to go in it soon, but these things are pretty much BIFL (buy it for life) if cared for properly. DON'T MELT OFF THE HANDLE. I had a friend get one and they did this after a few uses. My handle is only slightly warped because I usually remember to leave it off of the heat (also, that only really applies to gas stoves; I recently moved into a house with electric and there isn't really enough radiant heat to melt it badly). It might be the poor man's espresso maker, but I get a a better tasting, creamier espresso with more consistent quality than most of my friends can get from their expensive counter-top models, and it barely costs me anything. Bialetti for life!
