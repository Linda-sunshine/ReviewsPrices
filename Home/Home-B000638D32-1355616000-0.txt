review/summary: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE RICH TO LIVE RICHreview/text: ScottyB has started doing all his own cooking because the 1% have left me nothing. I have stopped eating fast food and started eating DRIED BEANS,ROOT VEGETABLES,SEASONAL PRODUCE. My food costs have plummeted; but, my labor has escalated. The VICTORINOX 8 inch chef knife turned my hours of weekly chopping into A LABOR OF LOVE.This is a KILLER VALUE.CAUTION: HANDLE WITH CARE. UBER SHARP-- will slice you open in a NEW YORK MINUTE FOR ANY MENTAL LAPSE.FINAL ANALYSIS: I got a drawer of dull knives. Was going to do the right thing and order A JAPANESE SHARPENING STONE. BUT- after reading SHARPENING STONE REVIEWS there is a LEARNING CURVE- LOT OF DIFFERENT QUALITIES- A LOT COME BROKEN- THEY ARE BIG AND NEED TO BE STORED- COST EXCEEDS NEW VICTORINOX KNIFE.A VERY FINE KNIFE AT BEGGAR'S PRICE.
