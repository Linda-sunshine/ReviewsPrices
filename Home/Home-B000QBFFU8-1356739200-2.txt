review/summary: Just Average...NOT worth the pricereview/text: The knob on my GE juicer, that I only paid $49, was starting to get stuck two days ago. I have used it daily for over 2 1/2 years however, so I've definitely gotten my money's worth out of it. Since it was dying, I decided to upgrade and try this Breville juicer. My girlfriend has it and recommended it to me. She told me the pulp is dry like sawdust, works amazing, etc. I bought it yesterday, did three separate side by side comparisons w/ my current juicer, and took it back today. It was 4x's the price (w/o a coupon) and in my opinion NOT worth the price difference. The pulp was just as wet as my pulp; not even close to dry like sawdust. The pulp also had many chunks in it. Lots of them. Whereby my pulp had very few chunks, if any. So my juicer is actually grinding up the food better. Plus my juicer blows through the toughest veggies (carrots) w/o a prob. But the Breville was getting stuck trying to juice three at a time, something my current juicer has no problem doing. The Breville had things I really liked, but could live w/o and save $150 (beautiful look to it, came with a fitted juice collection container that eliminated splatters and also separated the froth, and the juice was "thinner" [no thickness at all]. Not that my juicer makes them thick like a smoothy, but certain veggies and fruit add a grainy texture using my juicer that the Breville did not).I bought myself another GE juicer for $49 on the way home from returning this one.
