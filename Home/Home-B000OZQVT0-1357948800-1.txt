review/summary: Warm, crackling firereview/text: I stopped burning wood in my fireplace years ago-- the soot, smoke, ashes, clean up just wasn't worth it. I do like the look of fire, though. I had candles in there for awhile, but that just didn't cut it. I purchased concrete faux rocks from another vendor, and they have a hole in them designed for these cans of gel fuel. The fireplace looks amazing, no mess, and it sounds like a crackling fire. It lasts between 2 and 3 hours. I don't use my fireplace often, or the cost would be prohibitive, but every so often on a chilly night, it is a wonderful treat.
