review/summary: The Best Coffee Maker Ever!!!review/text: This thing rocks! I bought it after having a newborn, my third boy. I now have three kids under 4 and boy do I need my morning coffee. It's so great being able to make a cup of joe as quickly as I can with this coffee maker. I'm not a hot coffee drinker so I make Iced coffee with it. I brew a cup normally then poor it into a cup of ice, let that cool a minute then poor it back into the cup with some more ice and coffee mate creamer, tastes delish! I've even been using it to make Iced Tea. I have to rinse the filter pretty well first otherwise the tea ends up tasting a bit like coffee. I'm looking on amazon to buy another permanent filter, one for coffee and the other for tea. I absolutely love this coffee maker, best one I've ever owned. It's quick, easy, cheap and doesn't take up much space. GET IT!
