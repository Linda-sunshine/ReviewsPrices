review/summary: If I wanted coarse sandpaper, I would have ordered some.review/text: Extremely rough surface, no amount of seasoning could smooth it. Reply to Email to Lodge, stated that finishing the pans would increase cost too much. I don't have a surface grinder, what it needed, so an hour with an orbital sander with mostly coarse emery paper gave me a surface I could season smooth. Cook and egg on it as it arrived and you'd have to clean it with the help of an ant hill. Made me give on cast iron. Bought a set of Wolfgang Puck Stainless that heats more evenly on induction than this pan. Only keeping it in case of a home invasion.
