review/summary: Must be better options for low cost heatersreview/text: Maybe if you live in Florida this would be a good product. I thought I could use this too keep the main heater in check about but it's probably a waste of money. It really only works in 400 watt mode.Highlights: Hot, lower power use than some.Lowlights: No thermostat, so it's either on 400w 800w or off. Overheats easily if on 800w. Mine left on for about 1 hour will shut itself down. You have to wait for it to cool off before it will turn on again. So the more you need it the less it works.
