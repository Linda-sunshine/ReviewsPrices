review/summary: Best and neatest appliance I ever owned!review/text: I've owned many toasters and toaster ovens in my life, but having them together in one unit is a stroke of genius! I use it mainly for toasting English muffins and melting cheese on top of them. The elements heat up very quickly. If you're going to bake with it, I advise using the tray because, as in all toaster ovens, crumbs and food bits will drop through when cooking, and without the tray the bottom will get funky pretty fast. To sum up, I heartily recommend this appliance--it's awesome!Gary Lombardo,Author of "My Friend Jesus"
