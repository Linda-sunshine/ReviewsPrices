review/summary: Glad I bought this one...review/text: I have wanted a Immersion Hand Blender for a long time. And the only reason I haven't bought one is that I couldn't make up my mind as to which would be the best. Well, needless to say I love this brand. I love the stainless steel. It is truly a quick clean up. I have a Blendtec Blender which I love also. But with my smoothies, I will definitely use this rather than have to clean up my Blender. This thing is fast and I bought a 30 oz stainless steel commercial grade cup to blend in. And I just drink from the cup and rinse the cup and the blender and cleanup is a dream come true. I am so glad I bought this. I have no regrets! :-)
