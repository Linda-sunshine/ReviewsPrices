review/summary: Good for hard fruits and veggies but too messy for leafy greensreview/text: Pros: easy to assemble & use; easy to clean; fast; quietCons: messy, frothy juice; wet pulpI had an omega masticating juicer before this centrifugal one. My biggest complaint with this one is the mess. Since it is a centrifugal one and the motor is spinning, each time you put more veggies/fruits down the shoot, air shoots back up and causes fruit and veggie mess to get all over the kitchen. I mean I have to wipe cabinets. When I had the omega masticating one since it runs off an auger that never happened.If you are just juicing fruits and hard veggies it isn't as bad but if you plan to juice lots of leafy greens or broccoli that have small particles, I would not recommend this juicer.
