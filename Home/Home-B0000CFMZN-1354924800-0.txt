review/summary: Super durablereview/text: The two cup size is perfect for most things and pyrex can't be beat for longevity. I've gone through a couple plastic ones that just don't seem to last. The previous plastic one developed some cracks due to frequent dishwasher use. I also like that I can use lime away to remove hard water deposits from boiling the microwave as well. I'd be nervous doing that on plastic.
