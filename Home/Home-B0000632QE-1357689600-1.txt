review/summary: Works great even on thinly slicing Sweet Potatoes!review/text: Wow! Just wow! I bought this for one reason and one reason only; thin slicing sweet potatoes to use for dog treats! This mandolin is one of the best I have ever used and worked like a charm! The price was so low that I was worried it would not work well but I was wrong and it really is a very nice, very sharp and easy to use mandolin. The safety slide piece is perfect to grip the potatoes and the thin slices were perfect to throw right in the dehydrator. There are going to be some very happy dogs tonight with fresh treats!
