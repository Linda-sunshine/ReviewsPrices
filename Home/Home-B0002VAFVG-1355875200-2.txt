review/summary: works as good as all the hype about it.review/text: We love the large chute at the top, you can throw in most apples whole at once. most times you dont have to worry about cutting anything. there are very few parts to clean especially if you put a grocery bag inside the pulp catcher--then you wont have to clean it.
