review/summary: Faithful user for the past yearreview/text: When Green Mountain sold the company I worked for, I sold my Keurig in protest. And yet I needed a surefire way to make coffee per cup every morning. I researched high and low on Amazon and kept coming back to this AeroPress. It just looked too science experiment-esq for me, but due to the high reviews had to try it out.And man oh man, am I a fan! This seriously creates the best tasting single cup out there, in as long of a time as it takes to boil water. I've made converts out of everyone I make coffee for, and have bought multiples of these to give as gifts.The real 5 stars came though, when the plunger part broke last month, after a year of daily use. I reached out to Aerobie asking if I would be able to buy a replacement plunger, and they sent one to me completely free of charge! Amazing service!!I'm buying another one to keep in my overnight bag as my roommate complained when I took ours with me on a business trip. The other coffee makers at home (we own a Mr. Coffee and a French Press) have been sitting and gathering dust while we've had the AeroPress. I won't leave home without it!
