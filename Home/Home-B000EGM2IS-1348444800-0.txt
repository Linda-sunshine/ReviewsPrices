review/summary: Older models are better!review/text: I have an old Hot Shot, model 3211 in white which I LOVE!! I bought a model 6131 to have as a back up, and decided to plug it in, since it was black and went with my kitchen better. Boy was I disappointed. The new model doesn't actually boil the water, it just heats it. Which is ok for tea and hot drinks, but not for instant oatmeal or coffee through the french press. It also leaks water the minute you start pouring it into the reservoir. It also feels much less sturdy. Bring back the older model Sunbeam!!!!
