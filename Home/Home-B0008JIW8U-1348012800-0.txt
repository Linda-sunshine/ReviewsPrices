review/summary: Recommend this.review/text: Pretty good coffee maker, elegant design and it makes good coffee as it is supposed to do. Plus you can set delay so it makes the coffee at the specified time, you can have warm coffee sitting there when you wake up in the morning. There's really nothing you can complain about this product. The only thing you might want to be aware of is that: 4-cup really isnt that much. It is prolly a medium coffee you get from a coffee shop, so this coffee maker is for ONE or TWO person, if you have more people drinking coffee in the morning, get a bigger one.
