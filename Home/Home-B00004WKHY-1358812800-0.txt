review/summary: The bowl broke after several months.review/text: I was so disappointed that the &#34;shatterproof&#34; bowl broke after such a short time. I have been contacting Cuisinart and it's not going to be easy to get a replacement. It is unusable without the bowl and not sure how to get another one, that likely costs the company only several dollars.The bowl chipped where it is to fit into the bottom housing of the machine, therefore it does not stay in place.
