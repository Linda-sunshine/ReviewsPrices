review/summary: It's okayreview/text: I purchased this blender in March 2012. About May, the pitcher started leaking. I wrote to KitchenAid, and they sent me a new pitcher . It's now September, and the new pitcher is leaking. I wrote to KitchenAid again, and they've said they'll send me a new pitcher. I wonder if I'll have to order a new pitcher every three months or so (until the 1 year warranty is expired). It takes about 6 weeks for the pitcher to arrive...in the meantime I try to adjust the nut---sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, which can lead to a huge mess. I use it most days to make smoothies, and it does fine until it starts to leak. I got this to replace a Ninja....not sure that was smart.
