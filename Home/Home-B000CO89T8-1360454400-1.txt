review/summary: It works...generallyreview/text: This is a coffee WARMER, not a coffee &#34;heater&#34;. It will keep your beverage from getting ice cold but not keep your beverage piping hot. My home office is very cold in the winter and this does not do what I had hoped by keeping my beverage hot, but it is better than nothing...I still have to pop my mug in the microwave to re-heat. It may work better in the summer.It does get hot to the touch so I don&#8217;t know why it doesn&#8217;t heat a mug better.Also, you have to remember to TURN IT OFF! I have left this thing on several times...a little scary...and don&#8217;t accidentally sit something on it other than a mug!Good thing it is inexpensive.Good thing it is inexpensive.
