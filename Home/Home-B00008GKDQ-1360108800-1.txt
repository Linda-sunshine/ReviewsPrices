review/summary: Typical Lodge Qualityreview/text: Not Griswald or Wagner quality mind you...but a nice griddle none the less. Will work on any cook surface or camp fire. Can be a bit of a pain to lift off a glass cook top as there is no raised handle. Sits flush on the glass. If you lay it across different size burners you will have uneven heating across the griddle until the heat absorbs evenly throughout the griddle (10 to 20 minutes). Casting is smooth and has the pre-seasoned surface. Nice size if cooking breakfast for a large crew.
