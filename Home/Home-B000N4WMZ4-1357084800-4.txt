review/summary: Owning this gives me a huge happy!review/text: It's true - I love my Lodge Dutch Oven! I have been using and abusing this thing since it arrived in October. I've done everything from bake bread in it to make a 12-hour stew. It cleans up beautifully, and seems ready to serve whatever purpose I put it to.I DID have to return the first one I ordered... the lid just didn't sit properly for some reason. The second one arrived before the first went back, and oddly enough, the lid from the second fit perfectly on the first - but not on the second, and the lid from the first fit perfectly on the second - but not on the first! So really, in my exchange, I only actually exchanged the lids - I kept the first pot and the second lid.I'm still giving the dutch oven five stars, because I understand how difficult it can be to get a perfectly consistent cast in cast iron pots - and that's exactly what this is underneath the enamel. So I don't actually consider that to be a fault - just an expected part of the experience of buying cast iron products. Amazon's excellent return/exchange policy makes this product a good &#34;gamble.&#34;I'm so glad I bought this instead of its considerably more expensive Le Creuset sibling. I can't see paying so much more just to have a &#34;designer&#34; label on my dutch oven. This is a more than suitable alternative.
