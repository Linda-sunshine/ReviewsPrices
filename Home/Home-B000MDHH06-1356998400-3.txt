review/summary: Store bought juice doesn't even compare!review/text: Tried to do the sick and nearly dead challenge last year rather unsuccessfully. The juicer I bought was the much more expensive model and when I realized that a routine juice cleanse probably wasn't going to be a part of my lifestyle, I returned the expensive model. However since returning it I have really missed the fresh fruit juice this makes. So for Christmas this year I decided I wanted another one to be used to juice things I really enjoy. Apple juice freshly juiced is nothing at all like the stuff you buy in the grocery store. Add some strawberries or fresh peaches and it is nectar of the gods. :)
