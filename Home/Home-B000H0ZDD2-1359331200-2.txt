review/summary: Works great!review/text: I bought this for a small 12x12 bedroom that I was having moisture problems with & it works great. My towels wouldn't dry before & in the morning there would be a light mist on top of my blankets. I was worried that this dehumidifier was going to be too small but I also have a bathroom without a vent that I thought I could always use it in if I needed a bigger one for my bedroom. It handles the bedroom fine & I'm going to pick up another for the bathroom. It's amazing the amount of water it pulls out of the air! I have to empty it about every 2 days which is super quick & easy. The automatic shut off when it gets full is nice too.
