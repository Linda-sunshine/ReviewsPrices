review/summary: Stopped working after 6 cups of coffee.review/text: I dont care what argument you have. If it stops working only after brewing 6 cups of coffee theres a design flaw. i followed the instructions on how to clean it with a paper clip. worked for one cup, after that nothing. I dont want to have to clean it every other time I want a cup of coffee. Im returning mine. The best coffee is from a french press, it does take longer, but worth it.
