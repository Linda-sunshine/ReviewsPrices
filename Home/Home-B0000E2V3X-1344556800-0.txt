review/summary: Excellent productreview/text: This product has made pizza a weekly staple for my family. I use this grill pan on the grill. I heat the grill between 500-600 degrees. I let the pan heat for about 10min before I put the pizza on. Then I pull the pan out and spread the dough on the pan. By the time I've gotten the sauce and the toppings on the pizza, it's already kind of pre-baked since the pan is already so hot. I then put it back in the grill (top closed) for about 3-5 min depending on how many toppings are on the pizza.I then pull the pizza off and let it cool on rack. Makes perfect pizza everytime. The best part is that cleanup is is almost nonexistent. I'd give this product more stars if possible.
