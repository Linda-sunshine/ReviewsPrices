review/summary: Poor productreview/text: The Capresso tea kettle is lovely looking. It's value stops there. The first one lasted 6 months, before the 'chrome' started peeling off!! The replacement lasted 14 months, just outside of the warranty, with the chrome again peeling off and the kettle just not working. Would not recommend this, although I love the look of it.
