review/summary: Very attractive, Reasonably Priced, Does What It Saysreview/text: This is my first electric kettle and as efficient as they are I put off buying one for years because the affordable models were ugly. And I need something I use every day to be aesthetically pleasing. This little number is tres chic and it gets the job done quickly and quietly. For under thirty bucks, I couldn't ask for more.
