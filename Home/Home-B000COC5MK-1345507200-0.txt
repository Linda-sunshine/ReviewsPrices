review/summary: Two strikes - You're Outreview/text: I have purchased this item twice. It has broken twice. The first time I bought it at Walmart and they gave me a refund. I re-ordered through Amazon and not 60 days after purchase, the second one broke. I have not bothered to return or request a refund because I don't want to hassle with the shipping, packaging, etc. However, I have returned to the manual openers and will not try this item again. I loved the way it worked, when it worked, but it has a very short life. Recommend that you save your money.
