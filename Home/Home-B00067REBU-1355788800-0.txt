review/summary: Nice little bread machine. :) I wish I still had one!review/text: I bought this for a gift for my boyfriend at the time who was getting into making his own bread and all that jazz. I really liked it. I thought it was a good nice (not super crazy big) and also all the bread that I used to make it turned out well.My ex must have loved it, b/c when we broke up and did the whole returning gifts we never really liked to each other, this was probably the one thing I did not get back. :) I even asked for it. So, I guess that means I'm either a terrible gift giver or this bread machine is awesome. :D
