review/summary: Culligan FM-15RA Level 3 Replacement Cartridgereview/text: Bought the Culligan water filter system for the small design and good ratings. I like it for what it does and because it is not a bulky eyesore on the faucet. The replacement cartridges are easy to install. It would be even better if the water stream it produces could be a little stronger. Takes a little while to draw water through the cartridge.
