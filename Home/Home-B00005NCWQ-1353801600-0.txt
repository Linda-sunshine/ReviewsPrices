review/summary: Pleasantly Surprisedreview/text: I must say that I am pleasantly surprised at how well made this little coffee pot is. I was pretty much expecting something made with very thin easy to ding and break metal but this is pretty thick stuff. I work metal a lot and this is really well made. The only negative would be that plastic perk top but I've ordered a glass replacement. A few have complained about losing the spring but that is easy to remedy. Just "SLIGHTLY" pinch the bottom coil smaller with pliers so that the spring holds itself on by friction to the boiler tube and problem solved. This little gem will be perfect for that occasional electric outage and/or a camping item. I have it mainly because in the past 10 years or so I've managed to kill 3 Cuisinart electric drip coffee makers. All in all it's a good product and I'm a happy camper.
