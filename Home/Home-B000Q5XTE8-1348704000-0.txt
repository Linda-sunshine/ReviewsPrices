review/summary: Perfect Chairreview/text: Absolutely happy with this chair, thanks to a previous review which directed the reader to look for a "constant use" chair vs an occasional chair. I work full time + overtime, so i'm spending a lot of time in this. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a comfortable supportive chair to sit in for hours at a time. Open back for ventilation is also a great feature. The good looks don't hurt, either. Worth every penny.
