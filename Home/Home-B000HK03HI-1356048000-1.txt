review/summary: Easy easy easy!review/text: Bought this can opener during the summer and have had no problems. Very easy to use, and best of all no strain on my wrist or fingers (compared to the old version of can openers) which is a +.My mom still uses the old school can opener where you physically have to use all your body weight to push down and start cranking the opener. Guess who's getting this baby for christmas!Anybody who needs a new can opener should purchase this one!
