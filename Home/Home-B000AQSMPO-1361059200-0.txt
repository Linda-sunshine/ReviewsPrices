review/summary: A fresh brew every time!review/text: I began to get tired of reheating coffee in the microwave that was made hours earlier in the conventional coffee maker, but it seemed wasteful to throw it out, and I thought I would be locked into buying those expensive one-serving sized pre-packaged cups, but once I discovered the reusable filters that you can buy sepatately for the Keurig, I get exactly what I want: my regular coffee made fresh, one cup at a time!
