review/summary: Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge, F5914-900review/text: We simply got tired of renting Rug Doctors to clean out carpet. Also, have you ever looked inside those rental units; enough to turn your stomach; you really don't know what germs you are bringing into your house. So, we decided to buy our own and selected this Hoover model, based on the great reviews. I am still amazed how all of these carpet cleaner manufacturers include the word &#34;steam&#34; in their product names. There is no steam involved whatsoever; instead you fill the tank with hot tap water and go about your business. With that said, this is a very good unit and it did a great job cleaning out carpets. It has two tanks; an upper one for the clean water with cleaner additive and a lower tank to serve as a collection for the spent, dirty liquid. The first time I used it, everything performed perfectly. On the second refill, I noticed the unit was not vacuuming up the liquid on the carpet. After close inspection, I discovered I had not properly seated the lower tank and it prevented the suction from working properly. After correcting my error and properly seating the tank, everything worked great. Overall, this is a very good unit and we have no regrets. As with everything these days, it is composed of a lot of plastic parts, so a little care is needed to insure longevity. After using this unit several times, I would buy it again.
