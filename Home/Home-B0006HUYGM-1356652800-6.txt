review/summary: Very good!review/text: I live in a small apartment (about 450 sq feet) and this is all I have in terms of vacuum cleaners. It is very powerful and sucks up everything in its way (the power is because its corded; the cordless one that I had previously sucked big time - I mean to say that it was a worthless piece of ****). This one is brilliant and picks up everything. I do have to get down on my knees but I'd rather have this instead of some cordless **** that has handles and all that but doesn't work.
