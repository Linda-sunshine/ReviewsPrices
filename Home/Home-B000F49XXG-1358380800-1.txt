review/summary: Great &#34;Back-Up&#34; Machinereview/text: I have a very expensive Expobar that had to be sent to Seattle for repairs (which, by the way, was badly damaged by UPS; always &#34;INSURE&#34;). This got me through the period I had to endure without my beloved Expobar (and will keep it around in the event I need to send my new Expobar for repairs; live in Tulsa and no one repairs espresso machines here). Happy with this machine as a back-up (but my Expobar is what I use on a regular basis; this is &#34;Plan B&#34;). For those not as &#34;picky&#34; as I, great machine for the price.
