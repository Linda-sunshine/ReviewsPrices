review/summary: We love this Juicerreview/text: I researched and worried in vain. This is perfect. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that sometimes the edge to the pulp collector leaks a little when processing very &#34;wet&#34; juices. Otherwise this is a total sell. Get it. You won't be disappointed.
