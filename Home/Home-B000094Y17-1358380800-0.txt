review/summary: I love it.review/text: I have had Brita pitchers for about 20 years. I finally decided I wanted a new one, though I didn't really need a new one. I just wanted the color and a change. (I gave the old one to someone new to the Brita system and she is very happy.) I am enjoying the happy, new color. When I purchased this one, I did read the negative reviews about folks spilling water when pouring. I think people do need take a little time to get used to how long the filter needs before it's ready to pour. Also, I noticed that the new lid is not as heavy as my old one, which seemed to make the new lid less secure when I poured. But I have easily adjusted. I do love that I can flip up the smaller cover to add water instead of having to remove the whole lid. All in all, you can't beat the water and you can't beat the annual cost vs. more expensive filter systems. Albuquerque, NM
