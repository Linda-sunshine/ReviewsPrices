review/summary: Good cheap coffee maker, good for the price.review/text: This product is awesome. I use it every day with the travel mug. I set up the coffee (reusable filter) every night so that when I wake up, all I have to do is click the button. It finishes itself automatically.Pros:-Cheap-Reusable filter-Comes with a mug-Auto shutoffCons:-Doesn't have a burner (wouldn't make sense with the travel mug, anyways)-Hard to figure out how much water to put in for the travel mug (there's no water gauge like in most brewers) , or if you want to use with another mug. Got the sweet spot eventually.
