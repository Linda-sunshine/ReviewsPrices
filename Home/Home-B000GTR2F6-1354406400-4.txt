review/summary: 2nd Keurig that lasts less than a Yearreview/text: I have had 2 Keurig coffee brewers in the last 2 years. Neither one has made it one year. Considering the investment, I would think Keurig could make a brewer that lasts past the warranty period. Just woke up this morning and my 2nd Keurig quit working without any warning. Keurig replaced the first one for the same reason. When they replaced the first coffee brewer under warranty, we were told that they would not replace this one if we had any problems. I will contact them regardless. By the way, I have followed all of the instructions to de-scale (even though it was not time to do so and we don't have hard water) and have cleaned the water resevoir, etc. I only use filtered water anyway. Nothing comes out of the dispenser, not even the vinegar for descaling. Of course as luck would have it, I just bought more K-cups for the holidays!
