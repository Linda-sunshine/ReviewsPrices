review/summary: Every &#34;giftee&#34; loves this product!review/text: I gave one of these food choppers to a dear friend for Father's Day. He and his girlfriend like it so much, they bought two more--one for her home, and one for his summer home in Mexico... I gave one of these food choppers to my niece and her hubby for their anniversary, and they like it so much they bought one for one of their friends... And I gave one of these food choppers as a Secret Santa gift last year (2012)... The giftee likes it so much, she's going to buy one for her mom... The list goes on and on, as do sales of this product. It's a keeper!
