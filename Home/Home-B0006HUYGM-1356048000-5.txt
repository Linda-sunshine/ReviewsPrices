review/summary: GREAT HAND HELD VACreview/text: We wanted something portable to do our carpeted stairs - we have a Dyson that handles the balance of our home nicely. This small yellow Eureka has great suction, is not too heavy and the crevice tool works great. Is a little noisy as others have pointed out, but not an issue for us. I used on our car yesterday & also did great - quick pick-up of dirt, gravel, etc. If you need a portable vac that delivers great suction, buy this- you will NOT be sorry!
