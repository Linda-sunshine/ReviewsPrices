review/summary: It's perfect for brewing my hot teareview/text: I've been brewing hot tea several times a day for many years with a 12-cup Mr. Coffeemaker. After using the machine approximately 25,000 times, it was getting pretty grungy and worn out, so I ordered a new 4-cup Mr. Coffeemaker. It's perfect for brewing a cup (a 20-ounce mug, actually) of hot tea. Using teabags or loose tea, I've got a steaming hot cup in about 5-6 minutes.I've seen tea-makers that cost as much as $250, but the Mr. Coffeemaker was less than $20 and does a great job. When my wife and I take an overnight road trip, the machine is small enough to carry with us. I hate using the coffeemakers in hotel rooms, because you always get some coffee smell and taste. With the small size and portability of the 4-cup Mr. Coffeemaker, I can carry my own machine with me.
