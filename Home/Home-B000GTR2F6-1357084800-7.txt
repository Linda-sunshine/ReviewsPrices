review/summary: Great, but breaks easilyreview/text: I'm sure this isn't the fault of the seller, but this wasn't working when I plugged it in and filled the resivoir. Called Keurig directly and quickly got a human to talk to, who walked me through a troubleshooting process that didn't work out. Had to get a replacement, but Keurig sent it out quickly and the new one works wonderfuly. Sending back the K-cup holder was all they required in return.
