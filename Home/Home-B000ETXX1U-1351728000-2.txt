review/summary: Okay but priceyreview/text: Only lasted for about a couple of months before it sprung a leakWe were using if for guests then lent it to a family member who reported it started leaking the second day they had itDon't know the circumstances or reason but for the price, it would have thought it would have been more ruggedThe leak is in the seam so it is nearly impossible to fix
