review/summary: Love this teapot!review/text: I've always like loose leaf tea, but hated getting bits and pieces of it in my cup, so I tended to stick with bags for clear tea. Then I was given this as a gift - and I have been drinking tea like mad. It makes it so easy, the tea is clear with not a spec of the leaves in it after being strained, and it is so easy to clean. If you like tea, this is a must-have!
