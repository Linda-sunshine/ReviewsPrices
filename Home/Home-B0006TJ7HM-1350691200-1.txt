review/summary: Ginsu? Reallyreview/text: These are pretty sharp knives and for the price, they're actually pretty good. I've had mine for a month now and the only time I've been disappointed is when I noticed a spot of rust on one knife, but hey, I've been putting them in the dishwasher too. Regardless, I've cut tomatoes, chicken, carrots, etc., and have been pleased with them. Every one of these knives are serrated which would have been disappointing, but I already have a good quality chef's knife. But oddly enough, I haven't used that knife in a while, I keep going for the Ginsu knives.
