review/summary: You get what you pay for.review/text: The product came as described, in a new box so nothing to complain there. Know though that the plastic that it's made out of is incredibly cheap...hence the low price. The hook of mine snapped off as soon as I put any pressure on it which was a bit disappointing considering I waited a few weeks for it to arrive (within the estimated time frame though). Overall, if you just need something really cheap and are careful with how you put the two pieces together, you should be fine.
