review/summary: doesn't adhere to plasticreview/text: I live in a 5th wheel and I have the hooks EVERYWHERE. Overall, THOSE work great. Bought the caddy, which in the description on Amazon failed to mention it doesn't stick to "vinyl". So the porous surface in MY shower, it falls off. Thought...hey, I'll stick it to the tub, at least it will keep my bottles organized. NOPE. It says on the packaging it MAY not stick to vinyl, but not on Amazon's description. So I am mentioning it so someone else doesn't waste their money. It would be a great product if I could get it to stick ANYWHERE.
