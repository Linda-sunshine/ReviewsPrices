review/summary: Reasonably Priced Replacement Filters for Culligan's Faucet-Mount Filtration Systemreview/text: This CULLIGAN FM-15RA LEVEL 3 REPLACEMENT CARTRIDGE works with theCulligan FM-15A Level 3 Faucet Filter Mounting Kit. After you buy the basic kit and install the filter system on your kitchen faucet, you only need to replace the filter cartridges (about every two months).The Culligan filtration system is highly effective. My local city reservoir gets occasional algae blooms, and the result is bad-smelling, bad-tasting, discolored--but safe to drink--tap water. The Culligan filters take out the bad smell, taste, and color, so that the tap water is sparkling clean again.The Amazon price for this replacement cartridge is usually lower than the price in my local stores. Also, my local stores usually carry only the faucet mounting kits (not the replacement cartridges alone). If you shop around, you may be able to get a very good price by signing up for one of Amazon's "Subscribe and Save" plans for these filters.
