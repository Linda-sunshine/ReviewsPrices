review/summary: Nice Piece Of Workreview/text: Wonderfully made, tells excellent temp and time.I used it for Turkeys, roast beef, but most importantly - my mother.When we she was recuperating from surgery, we needed a timer to place compresses. She is deaf and legally blind, but was still able to operate this timer, even with the hearing aids out - she could hear when it was beeping.
