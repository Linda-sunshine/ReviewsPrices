review/summary: Solid little alarm clockreview/text: For those of us plebians who don't use our smartphones as alarm clocks, this is an excellent little alarm clock.Pros:-adjustable display brightness-dual alarm function that can either play the radio or make an annoying buzzing sound-daylight savings time feature is interesting-nice, compact size-has battery backup which is useful here in the PacNW where we get a fair number of wind storms that knock out power.Cons:-can't turn off the auto time-set feature, which seems to run 2 minutes faster than my cell phone no matter how many times i try to reset the clock. I'm not sure why there's a clock-setting feature if it won't listen to me.All in all, a good, basic alarm clock option.
