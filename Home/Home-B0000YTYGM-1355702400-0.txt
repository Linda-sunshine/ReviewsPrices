review/summary: Faulty Topreview/text: I have had this coffee maker for 4 months. We have had repeated problems with the top plugging, hot water backing up in the basket and a mess of water and coffee grounds all over the counter.We have tried everything including rinsing water through the top and rinsing the basket prior to each use and the random failures continue. Although the pot functions well otherwise, this one failing makes the unit basically unusable. We are purchasing another coffee maker.
