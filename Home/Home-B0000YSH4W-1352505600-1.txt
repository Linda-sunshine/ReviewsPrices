review/summary: A thoughtful, beautifully written storyreview/text: The Giver is a different variety of dystopian fiction, not action packed and full of violence like much of the current crop. Instead, it's a thoughtful, beautifully written story , almost lyrical.It begins with Jonas and his anticipation of the annual December ceremony, where every birthday for the year is celebrated, another way of assuring "sameness". But this year is special. As a Twelve, this is the year when, after a childhood of evaluation, he will be assigned his role in life by the community elders.The community is not evil or power mad or abusive of its people. Instead, it provides for all of their needs. Everyone is polite and respectful of each other. But something is missing. We follow Jonas as he gradually discovers the flaws in his world and, along with his mentor, The Giver, realizes the need for change.There'll be a tendency to label this YA only or even middle grade, because the main character is twelve. But I think this is a book for all ages. The story is at times touching, tragic, and melancholy, but always told with an understated simplicity that makes what's happening even more moving.The Giver is an emerging classic. I'm surprised I've missed it until now. For lovers of this genre. It won't be the wild ride of The Hunger Games, but it will stay with your long after you're done.
