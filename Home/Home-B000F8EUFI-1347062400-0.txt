review/summary: Love it...works well, good carpet marksreview/text: I had a dirt devil cyclone, but it broke. This one is very similar, except it seems more sturdy and has more suction. The cord is longer too, which is great. It also folds down to be quite compact, which I love since I store it under the stairs. Good purchase, very pleased.
