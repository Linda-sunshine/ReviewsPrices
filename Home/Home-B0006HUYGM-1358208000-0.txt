review/summary: Great for carpeted stairsreview/text: I wanted a vacuum for the newly carpeted stairs of our basement. This was exactly what I was looking for. It is very easy to use. The cord is long enough that I don't need an extension cord to vacuum the stairs. Our basement has bare floors so we use a Swiffer to gather all the dirt and this vacuum is great for picking up the gathered dirt or any bigger pieces of debris. I have used this vacuum on the foam mats we have and it works well on them. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase.
