review/summary: I must've got a good onereview/text: I've had it a year and a half. I use the timer on a daily basis, and the thermometer function every few days. The alarm switch is a little touchy, so I always have to double-check that the alarm indicator on the LCD is on, but besides that, I have zero complaints. I got the model with the silicone sleeve over the probe's wire, and an on/off switch.
