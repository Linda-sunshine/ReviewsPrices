review/summary: Does it's Job Wellreview/text: I bought this to replace an older NOAA radio that began malfunctioning after many years of good service. We live in the Midwest and you don't dare go to bed on a stormy spring evening without one of these radios to wake you in case of a tornado warning.This radio works very well for weather alerts. It is easy to program, but it is rather ugly for use in a master bedroom. I stuck it behind a plant, so now it works fine and I use a standard clock-radio for bedside tunes and alarms. I would recommend this radio to anyone in the South or Midwest; it may save your life someday.
