review/summary: like the productreview/text: like the product, functions as promised...very simple to use....chose this because of previous experience with similar model....used previous one for almost three years before it clogged and no longer functiions despite on line help and direct help by phone with an associate... only reason to dislike this product is if it also becomes non-functioning before expected lifetime or if it cannot be descaled and returned to full functioning..limitations: highest temperature 192 degrees (satisifies my taste, but had complaints from guests), only way to make stronger brew is by using cup size smaller than the largest one...for a single cup of coffee, love the convenience..even though cost per cup using k cups higher than using scooped coffee as in traditiional coffee makers.
