review/summary: Like itreview/text: This is a very good knife, and has an excellent grip and weight. I was hoping to use this for more carving, but it's not quite built for that. It works for this, though, just not as smoothly as I would like. This is does a fantastic job of slicing and anything involving the "rocking" motion. Recommended.
