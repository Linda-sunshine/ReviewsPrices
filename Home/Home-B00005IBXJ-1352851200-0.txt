review/summary: presto pizza ovenreview/text: If you do not have one of these pizzaz pizza ovens,,,,,,,,, BUY ONE! or buy one for someone for a gift! this is the greatest! i have one here in my home in michigan and one in my home in florida!!!! for cooking fast, and easy,,,,,,, throw your pizza on, or poppers, or tacos, or quesidillas,or drummies,,,,, or whatever... people are even entertained watching things cook... a great conversation piece too!! every person that has seen it work at my houses, have bought one!!! the only thing i don't care for, the turntable keeps going around, and the only way to stop it is to unplug it... i guess that is a real good safety option... whatever it is great~~!!!!! super easy to clean!
