review/summary: Excellent Filterreview/text: Just what my Brita pitcher needed. What's nice about the Brita filters, is one size fits all of the pitchers and I don't have to look for a specific size.These work for around 3 months...we have hard water so in addition to our home water filtering system, I like to get more of the hardness out of the water with this filter. Although these do not hold a candle to the Zero Water System, they do an acceptable job.
