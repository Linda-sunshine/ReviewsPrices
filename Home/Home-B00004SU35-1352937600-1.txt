review/summary: Some Fine Tasting Popcornreview/text: I was looking forward to getting this popper. Awhile back I bought the Presto Air Popper. It popped the corn fine but I was not happy with the resulting popcorn. It popped with air directly into a bowl. Problem with that is by the time the bowl fills and you season the popcorn, it's cold already. Another reason was since it popped just with air, the popcorn was really bland tasting. Now I'm all about eating healthy as much as the next guy but I draw the line where it infringes on my taste buds. These are the reasons I wanted to buy the Whirley. I wanted the taste of true old fashioned theater popcorn. This thing delivers! It uses oil in the popper (and you can put in all your seasonings in there too) to pop the corn. Put it on the stove at medium high heat and start cranking. Result is piping hot flavorful popcorn. You can also do a lot of experimenting with what you put in the popper with the popcorn to whatever your taste buds might fancy. Slight knock is my unit did not come with any instructions at all. There was an included premixed package of popcorn and flavoring. I'm going to have to read a bit to find the recommended amount of oil and popcorn for this popper. Anyway this thing is the bomb. Air popper is officially retired, it just can't compete.
