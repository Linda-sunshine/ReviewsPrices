review/summary: My Favorite!review/text: We have a full set of Le Creuset pots that we had bought at a thrift store years ago, yes dreams do come true. Enter the part on where we are hooked. So I was in the market for the a dutch oven that matched the set that we acquired and was willing to bite the bullet and pay the $350 or so for the Le Creuset. Then I saw the Lodge. After reading the reviews I thought what do I have to lose. This Lodge is my FAVORITE in the kitchen for fall and winter cooking. From the start to the end of the meal it all is done in here. Just so you know it is BIG, but we cook BIG. This pot can be used to cook two or three quartered chickens or, two pork butts or, three or four blade roasts, you get the picture. We also use it for soups stews and anything else one might think of cooking in the kitchen. It browns cooks/heats evenly great for braising, and all that other good stuff. The only thing that I don't like about it the top handle. It is pretty, shiny, and sturdy. I can not remember for the life of me that it is also HOT and stays HOT. If you love to cook and have been looking for an enameled dutch oven you will find that this one is a steal.
