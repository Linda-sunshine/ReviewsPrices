review/summary: I LOVE 'LODGE' CAST IRONreview/text: I received this 2 days ago and have been using it like a kid with a new toy. Fried eggs, Pancakes, Bacon and Steaks so far with the as always excellent 'Lodge' performance. I needed a stovetop griddle and LODGE is what I looked for first.. Plus Amazon had it for the lowest price around when you consider sales tax and the price of gas! An EXCELLENT griddle with a flat surface and the reverse being ribbed (for steaks, chops etc.) where you want a nice grill marks and fats to run off.I love using cast iron for it's even heat distribution, natural non-stick properties, durability and overall performance. There's something about Fried Chicken cooked in a cast iron frying pan that sets it way above the best stainless (I recommend theLodge Logic L14SK3 15-Inch Pre-Seasoned Cast-Iron Skilletfor frying chicken).This is an AMERICAN MADE quality product from a company that's been making quality products for well over 100 years. You can buy cheap imported cast iron.. but you really get what you pay for.Lodge cast iron WILL LAST A LIFETIME PLUS! I know this for a fact as I have one Lodge frying pan given to me by my grandfather which was given to him by my great grandfather! You can't buy better at any price!
