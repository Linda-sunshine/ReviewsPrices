review/summary: Handyreview/text: I bought this for a special event so that we could steam clothes and not have to iron them. It works really well and the water heats up super fast. Just be careful operating as the steam will be VERY hot. The only downside was that I wish I could've used it horizontally too (without boiling water spilling out), but I knew that I couldn't before I bought it. Very pleased with the purchase though.
