review/summary: so so air purifierreview/text: I bought two different brand air purifiers and this one is by far inferior. As other reviews indicate, it is very noisy. I have it on upstairs in a bedroom and can hear it downstairs. Also it must be placed 3 feet from anything which pretty much means it is very visible and in the way. These I could live with if it did a better job of purifying the air. There is not much change in the dust and pet fur accumulating on the furniture. I also purchased a Winix WAC9500. More expensive but worth the money. The air is clear with significant reduction in dust and pet fur on the furniture. It can also be placed behind furniture, no 3 foot restriction. The Winix gets a thumbs up.
