review/summary: I'm in lovereview/text: This little moka pot has brightened my mornings. I used to be a French press girl until my buddy made me an espresso-and-soy-milk-latte and BAM! Converted forever. A few things to note...1) make sure you screw the top on REALLY tight, or you'll end up with coffee leaking out the seams and a kitchen that smells like burned coffee2) grind your beans to a little more coarse than espresso or your percolator will clog and you'll end up w/ grinds in your espresso3) don't pack the coffee in to the basket too tightly or the water won't be able to get through to steep4) you know it's done when you can no longer hear the water bubbling in the base. You get the strongest result if you wait until every last drop of water has run through the sieve5) if you're using a gas stove, put it on the smallest burner and watch it the first time...kind of set the pot off to the side or you'll melt the handle. But the heat has to be up pretty high (med-high or high) to get the water to boil hard enough for the thing to work, so watch and listen to make sure it's going strong. The first time you use it it might take 5 min before it starts to come through...I think it has something to do with the metal tempering itself. And don't be afraid to lift the lid to check the progress...it won't boil up into your face unless you're hovering right over the top of it6) DON'T SCRIMP ON THE COFFEE. Buy good stuff. Trust me...you'll thank me
