review/summary: What would I do without this now!review/text: I just started my Paleo diet a month ago and was craving pasta! I use this religiously now to turn my zucchini's into magical pasta! It's SO good and I love that you can do so much with it! Easy to put together, has suction cups on the bottom to keep from moving, and waste is really minimal. I just throw the core in and cook it too! Tastes the same! Now I can have "pasta" anytime and not feel deprived! Great great product and great price!
