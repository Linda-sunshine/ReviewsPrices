review/summary: Makes great coffeereview/text: Coming from a $20 coffee maker, I never realized that it's not just the beans you're using, but the maker itself that determines the quality of coffee. This machine seriously makes coffee taste better. I've had the same machine about 4 years and not a single problem or complaint, its been a great machine.
