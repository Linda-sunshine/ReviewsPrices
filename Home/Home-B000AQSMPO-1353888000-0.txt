review/summary: Good when it worksreview/text: I will start by saying I have had five keurig coffe makers. I only payed for one. All have not lasted over five months. Keurig has been very good about replacing the defective coffee makers. I will say I enjoy the coffee very much. That is why I gave three stars. If the machine was more reliable I would give five stars. I am not alone I have checked on the net and many people report problems with the coffee makers. As far as the coffee goes you can find it on many differant sites on the net. And in walmart. I should tell you my model is the platnium edition. Hope this helps I don't know if I would by one if I new what I know now. One more thing I probally only average two to three cups a day out of this machine. So it's not like I am over useing it.
