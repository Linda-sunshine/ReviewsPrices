review/summary: Totally useless for espresso grindreview/text: I purchased this thinking I can use it for drip, french press as well as espresso.I was wrong.It's partly true that you can use this for espresso. You have to grind then sift, and eventually you'll end up with espresso grind.I believe it is almost fraudulent to claim that this product can produce espresso grind. Going from the coarsest setting to the finest setting, there is very little difference in the consistency of the grind produced. On the finest setting, which you'd normally expect to be espresso grind or the powder-fine grind used for Turkish coffee, about 20% of the grounds come out fine enough.I'm reminded of an old Yiddish joke about a man who gets a badly-fitted suit from his tailor... You can make it work but it's not worth the trouble.Otherwise it's a nice product as I'd expect from Cuisinart, it's just NOT at all designed to produce espresso grind. Spend another $30 and get the Capresso Infinity if you want espresso grind.
