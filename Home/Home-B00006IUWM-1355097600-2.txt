review/summary: Great product, I waited 5 years to reviewreview/text: I have owned this product for five years, I use it regularly and I still love it. Years ago, I worked professionally in a kitchen and am an avid cook. I am a stickler for good quality knives, using primarily Wusthof and Henckles.I purchased this for myself 5 years ago and gave another 4 as Christmas gifts, including one to my sister. I am still using the one I bought five years ago with quality results, and the same knives. My sister came to visit me last month, and saw my presto sharpener on the counter, and said you know that's the best gift you ever gave me, I still use it all the time.I am writing this review now as I purchase one for my son-in-law's mother as a Christmas gift. I highly recommend this product. For those who have had poor results I would say, make sure you have solid quality knives, and use the product as instructed. I do agree with the person who said it is difficult to sharpen a short paring knife,I myself don't put much stock in reviews written shortly after purchasing a product, so I hope this helps someone, and you find the product to be as useful as I have.
