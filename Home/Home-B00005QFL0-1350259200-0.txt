review/summary: Makes delicious bread but kneading process is loudreview/text: I love this bread machine and the bread it makes as well. It comes out great every time!The pizza dough is delicious too and super easy (only takes 45 minutes)The only issue I have is that it makes a high-pitched screeching sound during the kneading process.Other reviews said that this machine is really quite. That's why I assumed that there's something wrong with mine and exchanged it. But the new one has the same issue.Has anybody else experienced that? Does anybody put oil on the moving parts?I really want to fix it and not having to return it again...
