review/summary: Extremely hard to cleanreview/text: I've used iron skillets for years, but this one is particularly hard to clean. The grooves that allow you to get really nice grill marks also serve to keep you from cleaning well. If you use any marinade, such as BBQ sauce, orange juice, or vinegar based sauces, that marinade will eat away part of the seasoning. That happens with any iron skillet or pan, but with the exposed grooves, it's really bad. Also, it's difficult to scrub where the grooves meet the pan, because it's a 90 degree angle. So, if you don't mind scrubbing down to iron and needing to reseason each time you use the griddle, it'll work well.It's a substantial piece of cooking equipment. I have gas burners, and it heats evenly enough to be useful. I like the fact that I can have some cooler sections of the cooking top (cooler, but still very hot). I can see alot of uses for this griddle and maybe the flat top is better to clean. However, the problem cleaning the grill top means it's not useful for me.
