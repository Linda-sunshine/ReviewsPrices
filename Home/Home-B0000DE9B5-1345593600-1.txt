review/summary: Excellent! I just bought more because I have more uses than available jugs (jars)review/text: I love these! I don't even remember where or how I got the one I've been using which is a 78-1/2 oz size. I use it constantly to hold iced tea. I needed two more and looked at the brand name on my old one to make sure I got the right one. Then I looked at the reviews and found that some people have been having difficulty closing and sealing these jugs. I had never had a problem with it, but also never really thought about it.When my new jugs arrived, I read the instructions to make sure I have been doing it correctly all these years. They were clear enough:To Open: Turn counterclockwise the central part of the stopper for about half a turn.To Close: Take a firm hold on the external part of the stopper and turn clockwise the central part of the stopper.Don't exceed on force.It looked a lot harder than it really was.You can actually store food/beverages in these jars in the freezer. What's not to like?! I wish I had more of them.jMy new jugs came very carefully wrapped and protected from breakage. It took a couple of minutes to cut all the bubble-wrap off of them.One thing I use these for is to fill with water and then pour the water into a water filter which is way above my head. I've never had a problem with the jug being too heavy or the handle being too short for the uses I put them through. I tried again with the new ones and found them to be excellent in every way!I just bought 10 more. I'm getting into milling my own flour. I think the pre-milled grains, wheat, spelt, Kamut, rye, millet, rolled oats, etc., will look pretty stored in them. It will be easier to use them having a small jar of them on the shelf. I love these jars!
