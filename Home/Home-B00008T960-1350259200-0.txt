review/summary: Silpat works great as always, but it was folded for shipment and..review/text: Silpat works great as always, and it fits my full sheet pan exactly. That's the good stuff. The bad part is that it was folded for shipment, and my other Silpat products always warned not to fold them. This one arrived folded in quarters with a crease down the middle that never flattened out correctly. After only two months, the sheet has split in the middle right along the fold. This means that it's OK for cookies, but if I want to roast potatoes on it and smear it with olive oil, it's going to leave a mess in my pan.
