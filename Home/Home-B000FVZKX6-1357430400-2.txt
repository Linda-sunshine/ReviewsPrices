review/summary: You will Love these sheetsreview/text: I don't usually write reviews, but these sheets are so awesome I'm making an exception. This is our second set of these sheets! My husband and I agree these are the best sheets we have ever had in our 22 year marriage. They are very soft and do not pill at all even after over a year of daily use. We've used our first set constantly, all year round, washing them weekly and putting them right back on the bed. They breathe so well we even used them in summer ( we live in Southern Calif where nights tend to be cool even in summer). The first set is still in perfect condition, but we decided to buy a second set for convenience. We have a queen bed and the sheets fit perfectly. You will not be dissapointed if you buy these sheets!
