review/summary: Popfectionreview/text: Popcorn is my favorite food... and the Whirley-Pop is my favorite popcorn maker. This thing makes tender, crispy and thoroughly delicious popcorn. You can buy special popping oils and flavoring that will put any movie theater to shame... or you can just use canola oil and a tiny bit of salt for the most pure tasting and wonderful popcorn you can imagine. The best part about the Whirley-Pop (aside from the delicious popcorn) is how cost effective it is. Canola oil and popcorn kernels are cheap (especially if you order online). An investment in the Whirley-Pop means you will be able to snack like a king on even the tightest budget. Buy this and you won't regret it.
