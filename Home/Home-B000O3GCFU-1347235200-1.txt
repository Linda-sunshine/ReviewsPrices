review/summary: Tested it.. worked great for 4 hrs ,,,but hard to openreview/text: Tested it.. worked great for 4 hrs. Placed hot food (a homemade mac/cheese /vege combo) in this pre-heated (hot tap water) thermos. Food is almost hot 4 hrs. later. Now, soup is a different story. You have to seal it tight or it will leak. My daughter, 7, had a hard time opening it. She will have to practice or get some help. I may avoid soup for now.Oct. 5, update by the user: Genevieve,7 years old.It keeps my things warm for four hours, but is hard to open. I have to ask for help, because my dad puts it on to hard,but very pretty and cool. How do you like the container?Put yes or no on review. FROM Genevieve.
