review/summary: Shuts off every 10 minutesreview/text: The first day I used this iron, it was great! Heats up well, lots of steam, thought I found the perfect iron. Well, the second day left me sorely disappointed. It didn't matter if I was actively using it or if it was idle, every 10 minutes it would shut itself off. I tried unplugging it to possibly reset it. Then I tried to keep picking it up & tipping it down every few minutes, as I have done in the past with my other shut off irons to keep it from cycling off, but it didn't matter. 10 minutes. Off. That's all. My only option is to turn it back on with the button every 10 minutes and wait for it to reheat. Don't try to iron before it beeps to the desired temperature, or water spills out everywhere. Saddest part for me is that mistakenly believing it was &#34;the&#34; iron, I threw the box out on the first day, so I can't even send it back now.
