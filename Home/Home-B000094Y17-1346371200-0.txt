review/summary: Incompetently Designedreview/text: The lid to this pitcher doesn't even fit! It falls off when you pour water. It even falls off when you move the pitcher. It's easier to just throw the lid away, because the water is going to slosh out whether there is a lid on it or not. It's almost as if the lid is designed for something other than this product. It's shocking to me how Brita could think that it was okay to put something like this out on the market. Do not buy!
