review/summary: Farberware FCP412review/text: THIS IS THE WORST POT ANYONE COULD BUY! 1ST POT QUIT WORKING AFTER 3 MONTHS! REPLACEMENT POT MADE WEAK COFFEE ON THE FIRST POT I MADE! THIS IS NOTHING BUT "CHINESE TRASH" THAT WE BUY BECAUSE THE USA DOES NOT MAKE COFFEE POTS ANYMORE!! WITH THE PRICE OF COFFEE GOING UP WHY DO I NEED TO BUY A POT THAT CALLS FOR 2 TABLESPOONS OF COFFEE PER 6 OZ. CUP!! BEWARE OF BUYING THIS POT! NOTHING BUT TROUBLE!! THIS IS MONEY THAT I HAVE THROWN AWAY! ANYBODY NEED WRAPAROUND FILTERS THAT I BOUGHT FOR THIS POT? HAVE ALMOST A CASEFULL OF THEM! MORE WASTED MONEY! BlacK & DECKER sent another replacement pot that lasted less than a month! Worked for 2 weeks perking 8 minutes for 8 vcups, then 5 minutes for 8 cups! Hot water only, no coffee taste! IF YOU BUY FARBERWARE OR BLACK & DECKER PRODUCTS YOU ARE THROWING YOUR MONEY IN THE GARBAGE! ALL COFFEEPOTS ARE MADE IN CHINA TO SELL IN USA!WHEN ARE AMERICANS GOING TO REALIZE THAT CHINESE DO NOT MAKE PRODUCTS THAT ARE WORTH OUR AMERICAN DOLLARS! I AM TIRED OF WASTING $$ FOR COFFEE GRINDS, FILTERS IN A POT LIKE THESE! BUYER BEWARE! AMAZON NEEDS TO QUIT SELLING ALL OF THESE CHINESE PRODUCTS! BLACK & DECKER NEEDS TO LEAVE CHINA LIKE THEY LEFT THE USA! READ WHERE PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED PEOPLE! THESE POTS ARE NOT CHEAP!
