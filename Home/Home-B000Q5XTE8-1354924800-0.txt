review/summary: Worth every pennyreview/text: Been using this chair about 2 weeks in my home office, and it is comparable to chairs at 3-4x the price. Great back and butt support, but significantly cheaper than an Aeron or the Steelcase Leap, both of which I have spent months working in. This chair is just as good.
