review/summary: The Little Cooker that "COULD"!review/text: I've been using Pressure Cookers for years, and was under the assumption that "size does matter"... Well, guess what? It DOES!After adapting and adjusting because my pressure cookers were just too big to do the small batch things, I figured I'd give one of these little babies a try.It's amazing just how often I use this little guy. It's quality and performance is wonderful!! I've used this little pressure cooker more in the last two months than I use my big one in a year. Some tools are nice to have for those rare times when you need them, but this one gets used regularly. It's definitely gathering no dust..;~)Excellent Purchase!!!
