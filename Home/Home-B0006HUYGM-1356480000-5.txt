review/summary: To Heavyreview/text: Unit works ok but it is to heavy and awkward to handle. Not balanced. Must twist wrist downward to vac and the heavyest part of the vac is on the back so one is having to apply pressure from with the other hand on the suctions area all the time. I have other uprights of this brand and like them a lot. Good pick up and cleaning but the design on this one is not good. Thumbs down!
