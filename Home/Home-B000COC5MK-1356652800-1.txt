review/summary: Battery life is not safe!review/text: I might be a little overdramatic in the title. But what I mean by the battery life being dangerous is that it is too long! You can open way too many bottles on a single charge! Yes, that is a plus! You will not be disappointed by this product. The look of it and feel is great also. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who doesn't like having to keep charging their products.
