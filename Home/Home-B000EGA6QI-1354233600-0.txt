review/summary: Really holds up.review/text: My boyfriend and I have had this immersion blender for 1+ years and use it all the time for soup and making popover batter. Those are our primary uses for it, as we have a standup mixer as well. Though, we don't have a blender, and this is a great alternative for us.
