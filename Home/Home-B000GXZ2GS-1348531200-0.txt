review/summary: Perfect!review/text: For the price paid, this is a perfect product -- sturdy with nice finish and extremely easy to clean. The product also ships with an adapter in case you don't have a jar or mug that can accommodate the wide base of the AeroPress. The micro-filters that's also provided should keep you enjoying a good cup of coffee every morning and evening for a long time. I woudn't hesitate to recommend this product to any coffee lover!
