review/summary: BE CAREFUL///TOASTER OVENreview/text: This little machine works so fast!!!! And food cooks very even. But, keep in mind, the oven portion is very TINY. You really can only fit &#34;1&#34; slice of pizza. You can not fit 2. Also, Be CAREFUL. This oven draws alot of power from energy source. I had it plugged in in same socket as a water fountain for my pets, and it TRIPPED the circuit braker. This oven works so well that when I use it, I unplug the other appliance. It's worth it. No issues.
