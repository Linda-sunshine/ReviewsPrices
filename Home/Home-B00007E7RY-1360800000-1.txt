review/summary: I changed the vacuum bag _without_ needing my inhaler!review/text: I can't remember being able to vacuum without coughing and dragging on my inhaler multiple times, let alone changing the vacuum bag. No body is going to mistake this thing as an aesthetic component of my living room, but trading the air purifier for an inhaler is definitely helpful!
