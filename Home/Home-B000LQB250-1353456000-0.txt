review/summary: Side Sleeperreview/text: You're a side sleeper. You have a firm mattress. It's too firm - you feel like your spine is broken when you wake up. You're reading tons of reviews and confused. There are the cheap cushion toppers, memory foam, 2 inch, 3 inch ...Stop - this is the one for you, if you're trying to fix the side-sleep / firm mattress problem. You need 3" - yes, it makes a difference. The non memory foam padded toppers are just for fluffiness - they don't add support. This is what you need. I ran around for a month trying and returning different products. I had been feeling so bad, I thought I had Rheumatoid Arthritis. This topper is the one. This is great. It smells like a sort of chocolate lollipop out of the packaging. Good size. Fits the bed really well. It doesn't have a cover, but who care. If you really want one, then keep a fitted sheet over this as it sits on your mattress all the time and use ANOTHER fitted sheet over that.This is great. I love it. And it doesn't sag, which is why having this on a firm mattress is better than getting a plush mattress. Support without the whole mattress being saggy.Go for it. Stop looking. I promise. That search to find the perfect topper really stressed me out. This is the one I FINALLY found.
