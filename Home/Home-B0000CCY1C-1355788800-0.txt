review/summary: After just one year, it fell apart :-(review/text: I've had mine just one year this month. It gets a workout at Christmas and was used a few times other than last Christmas. Went to get it out of my drawer for this year's Christmas baking and it fell apart. Hubby put it back together but it fell apart again and again. Finally gave up and ordered a different brand to replace it. Usually OXO is an excellent purchase, but not this time. Very, VERY disappointed in this cookie scoop.
