review/summary: the best on the marketreview/text: I've had a number of juicers over the years. Some where too difficult to clean, didn't juice well or broke. Then I began to do a lot of research and found that the Breville although more expensive but cheaper than the vitamix which I have, was very highly reviewed. I bought the lower end model and used it so much with such great health results that I decided to upgrade and give my daughter who loved the juice I created the older model. She is using it steadily in its third year of frequent uses without problem.I've been so pleased with this one. I did have it in an outlet with a circuit breaker just because it was what was available in my kitchen. Until I read reviews here I didn't know that was a problem. It has never popped the circuit breaker, works like a dream, is easy to clean and has done much to restore my health after some health problems.Most of all its quality is unparalleled with steel heavy duty parts. It truly extracts the juice leaving nearly dry pulp behind. The ability to adjust the settings according to the hardness of fruit/vegetable does make a difference. I tried the model with out this feature until I realized I was going to be a juicer the rest of my life, it is worth the extra expense to have the feature that adjusts motor speed appropriately insuring you get as much juice as can be extracted of a vegetable.Because I've been so impressed with Brevilles superior quality I hope to eventually replace all my appliances with this brand
