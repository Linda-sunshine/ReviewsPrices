review/summary: Love It!review/text: This is great! It is amazing how much difference that a nice caddy can make in your shower with having all your items easily accessible. I have had this caddy installed for almost 2 weeks without any issues. It is holding two 25+ oz hair products and one 10 oz hair products with some room leftover (but not enough for one more 20 oz hair product). I just ordered the small caddy which should take care of the 20 oz hair product and give me room for more if needed.Product was easy to install. A little cleaning. A little waiting. Apply some water resistant strips. Apply to shower as instructed (there are a couple of steps here but nothing tricky). Wait 24 hours. All done. I did take care to follow instructions closely since I knew that I was going to load this up and I did not want it to come crashing down. I have a tile shower with 4 inch tiles which are smooth but have a slightly uneven glazing pattern. I had no issue finding a suitable spot to hang the caddy without applying command strips to the grout lines.This caddy is holding a pretty good amount of product. I am impressed! Functionally, this product is awesome. Aesthetically, it is not much to look at - nothing wrong but nothing special. It is a plain white plastic basket. If you are looking for a stylish caddy, you might want to pass on this one. If you need a functional caddy that works great, this is a good one for you to consider.
