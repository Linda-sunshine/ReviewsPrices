review/summary: Worked great at first!review/text: I'm kind of disappointed in this Crane humidifier, we bought it last winter to replace another Crane humidifier that we had for almost 2 years and saw constant use. We bought this one around November 2011 and used it all winter in my son's room. I emptied it around April and it sat unused until about 2 weeks ago. I just went to turn it on and it's making a horrible sound as if the motor is gone. Mist will still come out but the sound is awful. I guess this one is going in the trash and I will be hunting down the Crane Drop Shape humidifier asap. I would not recommend this product. I do love Crane humidifiers for the very reason that they don't get moldy unless you don't rinse and empty them when not in use.
