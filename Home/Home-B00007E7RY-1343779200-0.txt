review/summary: good one for a small spacereview/text: I brought it to help clean up the air in the basement where my kids play all the times in summer. It works fine as you can feel the difference from a distance vs near the purifier. Since I have a fairly large basement (800sqft), I feel at least I need put 2 down there... In terms of noise from the fan, it's quite loud when the fan runs at full speed. But definitely not as bad as a HEPA vacuum. When people play or watch movies, you won't feel it much, especially at low speed.
