review/summary: Excellent coffee makerreview/text: Ordered this coffee maker in December 2010 and it is still going strong.Pros:* Excellent coffee. Really, if this isn't there nothing else matters.* Programmable* Alerts you when it needs to be decalcified (cleaned) and has a convienent 'one button press' mode to perform the cleaning. Frankly, I tend to clean it before it alerts me because it is so easy to do.* Gold filter. First coffee machine I have owned which use these and at first I was skeptical. But, it is easy to clean in between brews and not expensive to replace once in a blue moon. I prefer it to standard paper filter which are discarded after each brew.* Steal a cup, allowing you to pull the carafe out mid brew if you just can't wait for that first cup.Cons:* Not much! I suppose it could grind full beans, but that would just increase the cost and add things to break.Prior to this unit we had a somewhat similar unit which used a thermal carafe. Based on my experience with both units I would not go back to a thermal carafe. We very rarely take the carafe from the coffee maker and bring it to the table (or wherever) so having a thermal carafe vs. a glass carafe sitting on a hot plate actually led to our coffee cooling off much quicker in the thermal pot.
