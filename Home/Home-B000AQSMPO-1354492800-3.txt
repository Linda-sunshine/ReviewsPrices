review/summary: Excellent coffee, poor brewer qualityreview/text: We have two of the B60 brewers and one B70 (at work)and all three have failed after about two years of daily use. We always use bottled water in the brewers and make on average two brews per day. They charge a lot for the brewers but their quality is questionable and there is no service path for the brewers, they are considered disposable units.In all three cases, the pumps would not push water through the K-cup. I was able to get the B70 to function again by using compressed air and forcing the air through the plumbing. I never saw a de-scale notice from the brewer. The two B60s are land-fill.Excellent coffee, terrible brewer quality. Any one know of a quality brewer that uses the K-cups?
