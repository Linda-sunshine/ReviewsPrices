review/summary: it's great!review/text: This dehydrator is awesome! After using older ones with no fan and no themostat, this is truly a must if you are doing any amount of drying. The old one took about 30 hours to completely dry 5 trays full of jerky. After filling 5 trays of the Nesco FD-75PR with 3.5lbs of beef it was completely done in roughly 9 hours. I love it because I can fill it before going to work and when I come home it's almost perfect. The instuctions for beef jerky are pretty accurate. I have gotten up to 4lbs of beef in it with just the 5 trays. Even with the fan, it is very quiet. It may be a little pricey but well worth it.
