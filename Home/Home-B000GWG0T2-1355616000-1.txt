review/summary: Great to cook with, easy to clean.review/text: I love this pan, so I bought another in the same line, and then another as a gift to someone.I have been frequently disappointed by "nonstick" cookware whose nonstick coatings rapidly degrade or get scratched, even under careful handling, and require regular seasoning to maintain the "nonstick" properties (essentially, that means it is left to the consumer to regularly replace the coating by baking a pan in the oven with oil on it, because the original coating is no longer doing its job).But then I found this pan.I have owned it for about 2 years, and there is not a single scratch on the surface. I love butter, but I can easily fry an egg on this with no butter or oil, and slide it around on the nonstick surface with ease.Perhaps the best thing about this is how easy it is to clean. I cook for myself every day, and I have yet to have to scrub anything off of the surface of this pan. If you've ever experienced the frustration of food baked into the surface of a pan so strongly that you need to vigorously scrub it off, but you know that you can't, because with a traditional "nonstick" surface, you can't use abrasive scrubbers, then you would really appreciate the ease of cleaning. I cannot underestimate the difference that this makes. Also, since the whole surface (top and bottom) is nonstick, I don't even put this in the drying rack (note: I don't own a dishwasher); I simply wash it, then let all the water slide off the surface, and it is dry!I am extremely pleased with this product, and considering how affordable it is and how long I expect it to last, the pan is an excellent bang for the buck.
