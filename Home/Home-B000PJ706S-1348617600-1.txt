review/summary: Great kettle!review/text: This is my first kettle, and I couldn't be happier. A bunch of us at the office are tea drinkers and have been stuck microwaving water for the past year. We decided to buy one, so i took advantage of my Prime account and bought this. Two days later we're all enjoying the sound of a rolling boil and great tea. Nothing negative at all so far. We'll see how it holds up, we go through 4-6 pots of water a day...
