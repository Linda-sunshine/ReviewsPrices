review/summary: Disappointingreview/text: I bought this item in early July, and loved it when I first used it. Unfortunately, after only about 3 times, I started to feel steam burning my hand as I held it, and all the water leaked out from the join under the handle. It seems to be leaking from the other side too. Since it's too late to return it, I'm now reduced to either trying to find a suitable glue to seal the openings, or throwing it out. It's too bad the reservoir wasn't better made. Maybe I just got a lemon........
