review/summary: Performs as advertised.review/text: I chose to give this Hoover product 5 stars after it performed just as I had hoped. Easy assembly and great results on medium to severely stained tan carpet. I have used the Vac twice on roughly 1000 sq ft with these great results. Have not used the upholstery attachment yet. Waste water does fill up quickly but was not a big deal.
