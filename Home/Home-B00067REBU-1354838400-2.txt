review/summary: Replacedreview/text: The one that was sent to me by Amazon was damaged. The lid will not shut all the way. There was a small gap when you close the cover. Amazon advised me to contact the manufacturer and they replaced the unit fairly quickly and trouble-free. I have been using it a lot and I am loving it. The edges turns out a little too crusty for my taste even with the light setting, but is very minor. Bread still comes out good. I use the dough setting often and love how the dough comes out. I use regular active dry yeast and have not had any problems. I tried both all purpose flour and bread flour but didn't really notice any difference.
