review/summary: Very coolreview/text: I got this for my wife who every other day sets her alarm for different wake up calls and this is very handy with it's dual alarm. It was the exact one she was using previously but has 2 alarms .Easy enough to use and has the features of any basic good quality Sony alarm.
