review/summary: My best friend at workreview/text: This was the perfect solution for making coffee at work -- you only need hot water. Nothing to plug in, cleaning is simple, and the coffee is brewed quickly. I've probably had this for about 3 months, use it on average once a day at work, and it makes delicious coffee. What more could you ask for?
