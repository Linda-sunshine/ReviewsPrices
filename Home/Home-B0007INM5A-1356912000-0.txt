review/summary: Clean up difficultreview/text: I never have more than one cup of coffee because the clean-up is not easy. It is difficult to clean out the filter to wash it. It gives me a good cup of coffee, only with more effort than I would like. I am retired so I have the time, but I would not continue to use this filter if I were still working. The concept of not throwing out the filters and clogging up the environment is one that I support, so I was hopeful that this would work and therefore more people would use them.
