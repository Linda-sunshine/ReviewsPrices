review/summary: Popcornreview/text: The pan itself is light and thin walled, so I thought it would burn the popcorn. Not so. If you keep the heat on half or less, it still pops the corn quickly and does not burn. This is a good product and Whirley-Pop has has a very good product line when it comes to toppings and flavored oils. I highly recommend.
