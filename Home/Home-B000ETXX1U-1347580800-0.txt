review/summary: It is good although not perfect.review/text: The most important fact of the quality for airbed is "Not leak". This airbed does it well.I used 2 aerobeds which are quite good in my opinion. When I received the package and took it out I could feel it lighter than aerobed. After I inflated and lied on it I realized it was not as comfortable as aerobed. But during camping my step-father slept on it for 6 days he didn't complain. This airbed doesn't leak while both aerobeds need re-inflation every a couple of days. The built-in pump is convenient. The $100 price is ok.
