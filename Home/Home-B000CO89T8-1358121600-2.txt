review/summary: Coffee Warmer for My Deskreview/text: I bought this warmer for my desk at work. It arrived on Saturday so I gave it a test run on the weekend. It works great, keeps my tea perfectly warm. One word of warning though, if your mug has a wide base to it, it might not fit on the plate. Other than that it just great. I'm very happy.
