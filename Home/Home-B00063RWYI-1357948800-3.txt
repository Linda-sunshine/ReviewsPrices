review/summary: very big and nicereview/text: LODGE all the way!!! Because it's big, it is heavy, however the base is no larger than my largest skillet, so it fits nice on my stove top, love the handles on both sides, an added bonus is that the lid fits my iron skillet that I have had for years, thank you Lodge for this lovely design!!
