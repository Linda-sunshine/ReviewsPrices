review/summary: Automatic Trashcanreview/text: I mostly needed this so I wouldn't have to touch the trashcan while I'm cooking. It was cheaper than the ones I'd seen other places. I really like the compact size. You have to get used to the sensor; but, once you do, it's no problem opening it. Love it!
