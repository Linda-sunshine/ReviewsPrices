review/summary: Glad I paid up for this model! great engineeringreview/text: I am going to add to the chorus of happy customers. This machine works well for me and is a breeze to clean. I clean it first before I even have my juice and really it consists of rinsing all the parts to remove residue and then using the included brush to clean the screen. I use it daily.The stainless steel is a heavy grade and I expect it to last for a decade at a minimum. The machine is easy to assemble and disassemble. I would estimate I spend 15 minutes a day from prep to final rinse.The machine has great safety features, the feed tube is deep so you would have to try very hard and have long fingers to get near the spinning blade. The machine needs to be fully assembled to operate, again a great safety feature and the included pitcher fits over the spout to minimize any mess. I do use a clothe to catch any final drips after I remove the pitcher.I love the well though out design so much I will be looking a Breville fro future kitchen appliance needs!
