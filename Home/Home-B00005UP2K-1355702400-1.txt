review/summary: I am a guy and I love it!review/text: I am a wannabe kitchen master. This machine handles it all with aplomb and makes me look awesome! Whipping potatos and roasted garlic for a holiday meal for 10 is too easy now. I want to do it too often! Cookie dough is no problem for the Kitchenaid to handle without bogging down and it can even manage shortbread cookies easier than I could have imagined. Controls are easy to use and the speed graduates simply without any jerks or starts. My new toy is a jewel in the kitchen and lets me make others happy without making me exhausted! Thank you to Kitchenaid for a powerful power tool in the kitchen!
