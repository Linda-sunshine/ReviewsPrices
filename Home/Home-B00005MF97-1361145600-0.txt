review/summary: Poorly madereview/text: This thing worked great for the first couple months we owned it. We have not used it a lot, I'd say maybe 2-3 times per month. Now the high speed button does not work, only the low speed. The low speed does a good job but I am wondering when it too will no longer work and this appliance will add to the landfill.
