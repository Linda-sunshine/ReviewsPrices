review/summary: Excellent Personal Coffee Makerreview/text: I haven't been this satisfied with my daily coffee since I studied in Italy.This is by far the best coffee maker I've ever owned, if we are judging strictly by coffee taste. Though limited to four cups at a time, the Aeropress makes such unbelievably delicious coffee! It's a little less concentrated than true espresso, but still makes a great cappuccino, latte, or macchiato when combined with some foam. My friends have all been thoroughly impressed; the taste is only bested by the artisan coffee shops in town. And better than ess-bucks, if you ask me.The "American-style" coffee that is produced by the Aeropress is also amazing. Just add water to the "espresso" that you make for a rich cup of coffee that is barely acidic at all, compared to regular drip coffee.There are really two things that make this simple coffee press great: low temperature brewing and the ability to use fine-ground coffee. Being able to use water at a lower temperature (around 175F is perfect) allows for a brew with a lot less bitterness. The extra fine filter allows for extremely fine grinds to be used in this machine, so you can get really bold taste even without using very hot water.I would recommend this to my friends without a doubt. I'll probably pick up a few of these as Christmas presents too!I mainly recommend this product for PERSONAL use-- four cups at a time is not a whole lot. This is not the product to get your whole crew/family caffeinated as quickly as possible. My coworker and I each have a double-espresso every morning, which takes about 10 minutes; if anyone else joins in on our routine we'll have to do multiple presses.
