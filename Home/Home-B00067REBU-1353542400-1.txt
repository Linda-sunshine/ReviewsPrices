review/summary: 8 monthsreview/text: This bread maker worked great, for 7 and a half months. Then it started knocking, and now it just don't work. We make bread about every other day so that would be about 150 loaves before it died. I am feeling a little let down by how many products are just not designed to be used everyday.
