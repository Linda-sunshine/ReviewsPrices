review/summary: Money Extremely Well Spent!review/text: I am extremely happy that I purchased this dispenser. I enjoy cold water, but I can be kind of lazy when it comes to refilling pitchers, and it seems I am out of cold water in the refrigerator more than I'm not. Since I've purchased this, I haven't run out once. It's large enough where you don't have to refill it constantly (unless you drink a LOT of water).It doesn't take a lot of space in the refrigerator. Also, the water tastes great! The only thing I would mention is that the filter seems to slow down pretty quickly. However, I found that if you take the filter out, soak it in cold water for a few minutes, then run cold water over it for a few more seconds, it speeds back up.This product is very well worth the money!
