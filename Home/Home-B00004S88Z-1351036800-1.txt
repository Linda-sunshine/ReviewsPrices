review/summary: Look No Further!review/text: Was debating on spending the money on this canner, as I am new to this and wasnt sure how it was going to turn out. Searched ALL OVER THE WEB and read reviews from several manufacturers of different canners and ultimately decided on this one...I have the philosophy if your going to do something, do it right the first time...I cant speak highly enough for this canner! I was intimidated at first because it sounded complex compared to some others, but let me assure you, super simple to learn how to use, easily maintained, and ROCK SOLID construction (MADE IN USA!! - china could learn a thing or two...) Anyway if you are reading this and are looking for a canner, just stop, and buy this one. (Also called Wisconsin Foundry FYI if you want to price check, but AMAZON was the cheapest I found for the 921). Word to wise though, make sure you "olive oil" the seal, and pick up a rubber mallet to tap the lid off after done...its amazing how good the metal on metal seal works :)
