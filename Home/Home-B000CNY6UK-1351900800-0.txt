review/summary: I won't disappointed or need to cook my coffee twice in the morningreview/text: I am a coffee-holic. I drank 2 cups a day. I used several coffee maker, some you can bought from Target or Walmart. I used K-cup for 6 months. I also bought many different brands of coffee. Decaf or regular. Whole beans or grounded... Bialetti 6800 Moka is the most economic and efficient coffee maker I've ever had. I have considered to buy a really professional one.. Since I am just a student and cannot carry a huge one, this tiny and easy coffee maker makes me very satisfied about each cup of coffee now. I will definite bring it to wherever I will go. Highly recommend!
