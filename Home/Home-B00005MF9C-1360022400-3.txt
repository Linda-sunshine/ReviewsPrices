review/summary: SPECTACULAR!!! DON'T HESITATE TO BUY IT.review/text: I was getting ready to buy a much more expensive, one cup coffee maker. But my hang up with K-cup coffee makers is that is very difficult to make strong coffee due to the size available for grounds. Also it is of course very expensive. Anyway, I've had this coffee maker for a couple of months now and it is spectacular and a complete no brainer for the price. You can use as many grounds as you want.... the coffee is VERY hot... all the grounds are wetted. It makes the coffee fast enough but not so fast that the brew is not decent. It is PERFECT for a one cup coffee maker to always have a nice, fresh mug of coffee. I use regular size coffee filters as I am just trying to use them up as I have an excess of them... you can squash them into place. I use the filter as it is VERY easy to clean up after use... This is a GREAT little coffee maker and the price REALLY makes it a no brainer!
