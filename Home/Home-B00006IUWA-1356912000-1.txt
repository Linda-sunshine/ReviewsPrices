review/summary: For a tasty, healthy, inexpensive treatreview/text: My husband loves to pull this out after the kids are in bed and make popcorn. He's a gadget guy and trying to loose weight, so it's great that he can adjust the amount of butter. I'm not a gadget person and have only pulled it out once to show my son and his friends how it works. They were impressed, but disappointed with how bland un-seasoned popcorn is. I laughed and added butter and salt. It does make a very tasty snack with fewer calories than the microwave kind. We have found some brands of kernels work better than others, though I can't remember the exact brand, there was a generic that didn't pop as nicely. Even buying the name brands is very inexpensive considering how far it goes. Glad I bought it for him.
