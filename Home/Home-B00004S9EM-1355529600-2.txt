review/summary: Bad machinereview/text: I bought this machine last year. I made dough and a few other things but I only used it no more than 4 times. Well when I pulled it out to make christmas cookies guess what it was dead. I checked the electric I checked the whole machine and I don't know what happened. I didn't use it in a few months. What a bad machine.
