review/summary: Very impressive!review/text: I got this knife sharpener as a gift and I am really impressed by the performance of this knife sharpener. I need by knife razor sharp to prepare very thin sliced meat for Shabu Shabu (an Asian type of fondue using clear broth and thin slices meat). The sharpener did the job just fantastically. It makes sharpening knife so easy, safe and effortless.I agree with some other reviewers because the awesome performance of the sharpener, you don't have to use it very often. So most of the time, the sharpener would just stay on the shelf. However, I figured the way to give the sharpener more use by sharpening knives for friends and family. I really enjoy using the sharpener. It is absolutely a useful addition to my kitchen! Highly recommended!
