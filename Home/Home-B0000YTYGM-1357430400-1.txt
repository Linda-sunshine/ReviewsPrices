review/summary: Best coffee pot everreview/text: My first DTC-975BKN lasted 5 years. Some reviewers complain about the lid to the pot, but as long as you put it on right, there are no problems. When it came time for a replacement, I bought a Cuisinart DCC-1150BK because I thought having the controls on the top would be more convenient, but it was horrible (convoluted controls and lukewarm coffee). I returned that for another one of this model, and I'm looking forward to another 5 years of great coffee.
