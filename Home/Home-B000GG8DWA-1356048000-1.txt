review/summary: GREAT LITTLE HEATERreview/text: I ordered this heater from Amazon and received it in 3 days! It gets warm very quickly, less than 2 minutes. On low power (400 watts) with just the one element working, it is plenty warm enough for me while I sit at my desk. On high power (800 watts) with both elements working, it's like standing in front of a roaring fire, seriously! And it doesn't blow my circuit breaker, which is a good thing with all this computer equipment, lol. My favorite feature is the silence...I can work with this running and not have any background noise during phone conversations with customers. I am very pleased with this heater, it does exactly what I had hoped for.
