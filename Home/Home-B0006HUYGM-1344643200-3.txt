review/summary: Small vac, big powerreview/text: I purchased this to do the stairs. So that I wouldn't have to lug the big vacume up and down the steps with most of it hanging out in space just to get the brush to do a poor job anyway! This unit does the job better than the full sized vacume and is way easier to use. Also, it has a brush visor that can be moved from the front to do the step risers! The only thing you drag around is the power cord and it has a lot of power for a small vac. It's also great for any small job where you hate to drag out the big vac for small mess.
