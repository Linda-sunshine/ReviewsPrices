review/summary: Make SURE this filter fits your pitcherreview/text: I have a PUR pitcher and I change the filter regularly. I bought these filters as a replacement. My "filtered" water tastes like tap because the filter allows water to run around it into the bottom of the pitcher. I called PUR's 1-800# to find out if I had bought the wrong filter. The rep told me they didn't make filters for my pitcher anymore (which was interesting considering I buy and replace the filter regularly because I use the pitcher daily). The rep's response to me, "Sorry, buy a new pitcher." I will be doing my very best to avoid this company in the future.
