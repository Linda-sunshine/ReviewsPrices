review/summary: Perfect at first - DOESN'T LASTreview/text: I was happy with this item and used it frequently (once a week) for about 6 months. The silver parts were discolored after first run through the microwave, but continued to work. In the sixth month of use, the top would pop off after 4 minutes of microwaving. I would put the top back on and restart the cooking. Finally today it popped off twice in 4 minutes. The third time it popped off and then the eggs exploded all over the microwave. It has become unusable.Also note: Very hot! The top, the bottom, and the eggs cannot be handled for at least 10 minutes after hard-boiling.
