review/summary: Yum!!review/text: My husband is the chef in our house, and has been wanting an ice cream maker for several years. I finally ordered this one for him for Christmas, and we have thoroughly enjoyed it! My husband has tried several recipes that he's found online and each one has turned out wonderfully. The ability to add the mix-ins at the top is great! The whole thing is very easy to clean. We have found that you should freeze the bin ahead of time, and some recipes require that you chill the mix beforehand as well. We've also found that some ice creams set up better if you freeze them for a couple hours after preparing them. Therefore, their claim that it can make ice cream in as little as 25 minutes is accurate (because that's how long you run the mix through the machine), however, for better consistency and taste the ice cream can take several hours. With that said, we still love this ice cream machine and would highly recommend it! The 2-quart capacity is just perfect for our family or when we have guests over, and we've impressed many people with the quality of ice cream we've made.
