review/summary: Leaked, but warranty was easily honoredreview/text: Pros:1. Did a fabulous job and removed lots of dirt!2. When I had problems, the warranty was easily honored.Cons:1. Assembly slightly tricky. I still have trouble snapping the attachment hose on the back of the shampooer for strorage. I wouldn't have my mom try to assemble it on her own, but I did okay.2. After a few days of use, it started leaking out the bottom (clean water leak.) Other reviewers had me worried that it was something I did wrong in assembly. I called the 1-800 number and they referred me to a repair shop just a mile away. I printed out my Amazon receipt. They fixed it (it did take them a week) and said that the pump assembly hadn't been put together properly in the factory (nothing I did.) There was no charge to me.I do worry from other comments about leaking that this is a common problem in this product. However, the fix was easily done, and I'm happy with this shampooer.
