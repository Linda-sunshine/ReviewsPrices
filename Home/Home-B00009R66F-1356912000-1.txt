review/summary: Works pretty well, overall.review/text: I like the separate clean water and dirty water reservoirs. The process for attaching and detaching the manual hose is a little awkward. The little tab onto which the end of the hose is supposed to be stored doesn't hold it.There's also a little scrubber attachment that seems to scrub ok, but it's driven by the vacuum in the hose, not by a separate electrical motor, so there isn't much vacuum left to suck the water out of the item being cleaned. So, to get the best results, I find myself scrubbing with the brush and then going back over with the OTHER attachment to get the rest of the water sucked up.Finally, when I removed the dirty water reservoir, I noticed a little metal tab that was supposed to be holding a couple hoses in place. But the tab either was not installed completely or had come off in the process of cleaning a few couch cushions.So, in summary, it cleans pretty well, could be a little more convenient to use, and has a small indication of questionable quality.
