review/summary: Very Pleasedreview/text: I purchased this grinder last week & was very pleased with it's performance. i use it to make my own Deer sausage combining deer meat with Boston Butt Pork Roast. it did the job just fine, however u do have to take your time when grinding. it is not a commercial grinder; however if u cut your meat into 1" chunks or less, u will have no problem. i was almost put off by the Negative review claiming this Grinder did not work but i bought it anyway because of the other Positive reviews. I'm glad i did & i am convinced that the negative review was because of a Defect in the Machine or improper Cutting Blade assembly as i Ground 9 pounds of Sausage with some of the pork pieces having an extreamely high fat content, with no problem at all. i did have to take my time and not OverFeed the machine & use Smooth Slow turns on the Crank. a couple of times i felt a hard piece of Gristle from the Tough Deer Meat Hang in the Cutter Blade but a Slow 1/8 reverse turn and then back to a slow forward turn motion cleared the Hang allowing the Gristle to be Ground and Pass Through. i completed the 9 pounds in about 30 to 45 minutes of grinding with never having to stop & disassenble for Blockage. I Highly reccommend this Product to anyone who has a Little Patience.
