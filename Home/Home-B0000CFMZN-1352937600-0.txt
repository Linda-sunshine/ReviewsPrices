review/summary: Not for larger handsreview/text: I am a 50+ male, just 10 pounds overweight (by my doctor's reckoning). My glove size is medium to large, so I don't think I have overly large hands. But the handle on this product is too short; I feel as if I'm using a child's measuring cup. I agree with other reviewers who have noted that because the cup is unnecessarily wide it results in markings that are too close together. I also agree that the 1-cup measurement marking is a bit shy of 1 cup when compared to other measuring cups, both Pyrex and non-Pyrex. Why manufacture a measuring cup with inordinately greater capacity--unmarked--than the cup was manufactured to measure? I'll keep this cup because occasionally it's a plus to have an additional 1-cup liquid measure at the ready (taking into account the perhaps inaccurate markings), but this product will definitely move to the back of my cabinet.Finally, a comment about the reviews that cited "exploding" cups. READ THE SAFETY DIRECTIONS THAT COME WITH THIS PRODUCT! They clearly state that you should avoid subjecting the product to sudden, extreme, changes in temperature. This is true of all Pyrex products. America's Test Kitchen has for a long time noted this, and has recommended adding a small amount of water to Pyrex dishes before microwaving. I'll keep searching for a good 1-cup, microwavable, heat-resistant measuring cup.
