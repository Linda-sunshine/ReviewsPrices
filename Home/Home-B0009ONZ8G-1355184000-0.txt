review/summary: THE OLD WAY IS STILL BETTERreview/text: My last vacuum was bagless and no good (in my opinion). I was looking for a dependable vacuum that used a bag and didn't cost a small fortune. I've had Hoover cannister vacuums which were great. This model is dependable and gets all the jobs done. It may not turn the corner as slick as a Dyson, but the price is better. I can vacuum the whole house without having to stop and empty the container like a bagless vacuum.
