review/summary: probably better for real icecreamreview/text: I've been on a diet and been craving ice cream. So I found some recipes for fat free ice cream and bought this to give it a try. The machine works fine and seems to do a good job, just not all that happy with the flavor of the fat free ice cream so I don't use it as much as I would like.
