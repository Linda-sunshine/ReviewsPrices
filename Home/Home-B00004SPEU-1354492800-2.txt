review/summary: I use this grinder all the timereview/text: I bought this grinder because I wanted to have fresh ground pepper around my kitchen. I use it for so much though: black pepper, red pepper flakes (really brings out the heat), spices that I've toasted whole, super-fine sugar and salt. The only draw back I've noticed is that to get all the chunks out of your spices you really have to grind them for a while. If the motor runs for more than 5 seconds or so it starts to smell a little funny and I'm afraid I'm going to burn it out. To avoid this, I usually pulse my spices to get them really fine.Tip for getting your spices out: turn the whole grinder upside down, tap the sides to loosen the spices, and let it sit upside down for a minute to let any dust settle (really important if its black or red pepper - not trying to breathe in that dust, ouch). Then remove the cap and its must easier to use what you've ground.
