review/summary: is this thing on?review/text: I received this item a couple of months ago. I had a family emergency and went out of town for a couple of months. Once day, wanted to iron my pants and it just would not turn on. I did make sure that there is nothing wrong with the outlet. Now I don't even know if I want to return it for amazon credit since I will have to spend my $ on returning this semi-heavy iron (probably will cost about $20).
