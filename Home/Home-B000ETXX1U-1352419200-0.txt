review/summary: Buy it Buy it Buy it!review/text: This bed is great! I was a little wary because I see alot of negative reviews on air mattresses. They sink to the bottom the next day, instantly get holes, etc. Not this one! I think I have a slow leak from me pulling on it to move it, but even still I have yet to sink to the floor like other beds say.I refill it every few days to a week just on gp. This takes about 3 to 4 minutes if that. The only negative is the bed is cold. I have a fleece blanket on top of the sheet to lay on because the mattress is cold when laying on it at night. Other than that, a real great deal. Highly recommended!
