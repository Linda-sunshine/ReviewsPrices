review/summary: Love my new 6qt Stand Mixer!review/text: I have had this same mixer for many years! But now that I have been re-doing my kitchen in "ORANGE" and everything Rachael Ray I decided to buy a new KitchenAid 6qt Stand Mixer. I had the Silver one but wanted to give it to my daughter and buy myself the same mixer in Orange - or Tangerine in this case. Since it has arrived I have decided to keep it on my counter top because I love the color and hope that as long as it's on my counter top I hope I will be able to use it more often. I have a bad back and can not lift it without hurting my back after surgery. Being on my counter top makes it much more accessible to use as needed. I absolutely love the color and have always liked having this size so I can make LARGE batches of dough, cakes, mashed potatoes etc. Paying a little extra for their largest size stand mixer makes a lot of sense. And now that I leave it out I can use it much more often! I would definitely recommend this stand mixer to anyone. It is strong, sturdy, and has a lot of extra accessories to go with it. I have the meat grinder, ice cream maker, juicer, sausage maker, and just bought the new pasta extruder too! That is one of the greatest features of this stand mixer - having all the extra accessories that make this stand mixer so much more than just a mixer!I can't wait to try the pasta extruder. I was actually in the market for another pasta machine to make everything from spaghetti to elbow macaroni. I used to have a separate machine to make different pastas but I went through 3 of them - they worked until I wore them out! So hopefully this KitchenAid will last a lot longer when it comes to making pasta. After I try and use the pasta extruder I will go to that item on Amazon and write a separate review.
