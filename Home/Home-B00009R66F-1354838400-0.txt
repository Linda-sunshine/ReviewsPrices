review/summary: Wish I bought a better onereview/text: I wish I would have bought a better cleaner. I just keep repeating those words over and over again in my head. How long do I have to keep this?Things I like:I think it cleans well.It is light and narrow.The price is right.Things I dislike:I had more difficulty learning how to work the system than other, more expensive cleaners I have had in the past. I figured it out but it isn't as easy as others.The cord is shorter than I wish it was.The basin to collect the dirty water is pretty small. I read that in the reviews and thought it would not bother me. But, it does and it is a pain.I wish I wouldn't have been swayed by 2000 reviews that seemed so positive. It is a good cleaner for the price. But, for a little more money, I bet I could have gotten one that I love. I wish I had kept looking.
