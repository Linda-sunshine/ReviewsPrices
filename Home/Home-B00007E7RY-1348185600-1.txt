review/summary: Good for what it does but can't combat my fur babiesreview/text: This thing has been running in my house almost 24/7 since I bought it a few months ago. It's still going strong but its obvious my cats are still winning. It does capture dust, but the amount of pet dander that attaches itself to the inside filter prevents it from doing much good after about two weeks. So every two weeks I pull out the filter, take a lint roller to the outside to capture all the trapped hair and let it do its thing all over again. It's nice to know that its doing it job, however, this little thing wasn't meant to stand up to my cats. Even after brushing them, these abnormal dander monsters will be the death of this thing soon I think.However, I remember the one day I had turned off the machine. My nose was itchy, I was scratching myself and not realizing why. It was because the machine was off so I know that its definitely helping. I never had those itchy problems before so its nice to know this thing is giving me at least a better quality of living. It's loud on the highest setting, but honestly after a while you barely notice the noise anymore.
