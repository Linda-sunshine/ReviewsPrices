review/summary: Economicalreview/text: I bought this coffeemaker to save money after deciding my K-Cup machines was costing us way too much money. What I like about this little guy is that it has an automatic brew, so that when I get up in the morning, the coffee is waiting for me. It's perfect for myself and if my husband wants a cup too. And, it takes up very little space.The only issue I have with it, is that the coffee does not come up real hot, unless it sits there for awhile, but I will just ususally pop it into the microwave for 10-15 seconds.
