review/summary: amazing juicer!!review/text: My husband and I use it everyday and absolutely love it! I was a bit worried because it's a lot cheaper than the other ones but it is just as good! It comes apart easily for clean up and it juices everything perfectly. We usually juice carrots, kale, celery, apples etc. I would definitley recommend this juicer to anyone!
