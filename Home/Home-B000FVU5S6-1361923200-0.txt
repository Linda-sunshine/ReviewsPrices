review/summary: Pinzon Hemstitch 400 TC sheetsreview/text: Love these sheets so much I ordered another set. I've always been confused by thread count since a high count doesn't always mean you'll get great sheets. Took a chance on these and they're sturdy, but soft and generously cut for a Calif King bed.No cons!
