review/summary: Great espresso machine, would recommend.review/text: I was new to espresso machines, wanted a christmas gift for my daughter. I was very impressed and so was she. The espresso and cappuccino that it makes is fantastic, I love the milk frother also. I did reseach on a few machines and am very glad I picked this one, it is just right for the money. Have had no problems at all and also found a cute frothing pitcher to froth milk. I recommend this to everyone that loves espresso and cappuccinos. I use the pods with this machine and love this ideal, fast espressos and easy cleanup, just throw away the pod, rinse and your done.
