review/summary: This vac, "REALLY SUCKS"review/text: We received our Eureka hand-held vacuum, sooner than estimated time, and man were we surprised with it's performance. As soon as we got it out of the box, I began to clean. I had to stand on my throw rug to hold it down and keep it on the floor. It's a bit short on dirt storage, but thats why I got two filters, I'll just switch them out and, keep on going. Maybe I'll order two more. I also ordered an accessory kit to go with it, so there isn't much we can't clean. I think we made a very good choice with this product.Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum, 71B
