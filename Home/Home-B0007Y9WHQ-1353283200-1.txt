review/summary: Plastic Spiral Vegetable Slicerreview/text: I bought this a couple of weeks ago as a present for my son, I tried it out the other day, the idea being, if I love it I will buy one for myself. I am so very disappointed, I couldn't make it work at all & the spiral blade, I can not remove from the holder, the other blade that was under it doesn't even stay in place, it drops out. There is no book of directions with it, just diagram on the box, so you have to keep the box, I would prefer a small booklet of directions. I want my son whom I bought it for to try it fist before I return it, to make sure it isn't something I'm doing wrong. To me it's a useless bit of plastic at the moment. But we'll see what my son says. I will amend this review later if he thinks it will work for him.
