review/summary: Wow, fast, delicious, easy!review/text: We love it!It's easy to use, easy to clean, makes juice quickly. We juice every morning, does all our garden greens wonderfully. So convenient, do not have to cut veggies and fruit small! So glad we bought this and it was not as expensive as the Green Star which takes forever. Highly recommended.
