review/summary: Perfect for keeping hot lunches hotreview/text: I bought this, because I felt bad that my 18-mo daughter only had &#34;cold lunches&#34; to choose from each day. But this keeps her food easily warm enough to make it to lunchtime. The size is great too, more than enough for a toddler size tummy, but it will easily grow with her into pre-school and elementary school. The lid is easy to screw on/off and it washes up nicely. Great buy.
