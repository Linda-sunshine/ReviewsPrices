review/summary: Fantastic Brewreview/text: This is the perfect little personal one cup coffeemaker. I used my coffee measuring scoop to measure the amount indicated in the manual and had no problems with my cup running over or coffee grounds ending up in my brew. I love the fact of being able to easily brew hot water right into a cup for tea instead of waiting for it to boil on the stove. Great buy!!!!
