review/summary: Perfectreview/text: I just love the design of this. I bought the pink pig because it was perfect for the color scheme i have in my baby's nursery. This humidifier works great I see an improvement is my baby's skin and breathing already. The only headache about this product is that it has to be placed on a flat elevated surface.......however you should not put it on wood furniture. All I have is wood or wood's cousin furniture so where do i put it?????? For now it's on my glass computer desk .
