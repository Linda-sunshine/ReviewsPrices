review/summary: Great coffee makerreview/text: This was a replacement Zojirushi maker for one we purchased 6 years ago and which had made, literally, at least 9,000 pots of coffee. (We make anywhere from 4 - 7 pots of coffee per day.) The coffee is always very hot and tasty and the thermal carafe holds the heat very well without altering the taste of the coffee. Recommended both for the flavor of the coffee made and the thermal ability of the pot.
