review/summary: Hard to find deep pocket and they are amazingly soft!!review/text: I bought a King pillowtop mattress and also have a 4&#34; Memory Foam topper over that. My mattress is huge and I have had a hard time finding deep pocket sheet sets at a reasonable price. I can LOOK NO FURTHER! These fit so much better than other sheets I've tried and the flannel is the softest flannel I've encountered. Cotton Velvet is a good description of the silky-soft feel. Love em and getting more.
