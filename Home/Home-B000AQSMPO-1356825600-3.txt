review/summary: Good Productreview/text: I got the B60 for Christmas and so far really enjoy it. The K-cups are easy to find, most grocery stores carry them, Wal-Mart and even a few appliance stores at the mall carry the different flavors. It's quick and I have really enjoyed all the flavors.The only three things I don't like about the machine:1. Cost per cup can be a little more expensive.2. Have to use multiple K-cups to fill my large travel mug.3. If you have a party and want to serve lots of coffee or want to use at work for lots of cups in short time, this isn't the product for you. Though it is quick in making a good cup of coffee it is not designed for mass production.
