review/summary: Don't buy this productreview/text: "Fool me once, fool me twice, fool me three times?"Yes, we bought our THIRD Cuisinart coffee burr mill after the first two failed because it was the only burr mill available at our local Bed Bath and Beyond. That was November 4, and here it is December 29 and it has failed. It simply won't start.There is only one word to describe this product: "Junk"
