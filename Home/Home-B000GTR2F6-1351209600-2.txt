review/summary: Love this coffee makerreview/text: We have not had a good cup of coffee for years. I had gotten to the point I didn't drink coffee at home anymore. No matter what we did, changed coffee pots, coffee, filtered water, distilled water....nothing helped...until I decided just one more time to buy another coffee machine. I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE with my Keurig. We drink more coffee now than we ever have, because this is the best coffee that my husband and I have ever had. Finally.
