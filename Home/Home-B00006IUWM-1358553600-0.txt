review/summary: Cheap and pretty effectivereview/text: This is a pretty solid, easy to use kitchen appliance. It does a good job of bringing dull knives back to life. I won't say that it is amazing. It is very good though. Itself is a fairly quiet machine. Sharpening knives is a bit louder. You can expect to see some smoke and maybe a spark or two when sharpening. It made some dull knives useful again. I was using a &#34;As seen on TV&#34; sharpener that was kind of doing the trick, but that was all. This has made cutting steaks, chicken, veggies really easy again. My friends are now happy to help out with cooking and enjoy helping sharpen the blades, even if it's just for fun. It will make blades sharp, but not razor sharp. It may require some more time, but I have only done some quick sharpening so far, and I can say that I am very happy. I wasn't willing to spend $130 on more expensive sharpeners, nor $30 per blade at a local store. The Presto has made trimming fat off of meat easy and quick. I would recommend it to any one who wants sharp knives in the kitchen. I will update this with info on hunting and camping knives later. And how a good sharpening works.
