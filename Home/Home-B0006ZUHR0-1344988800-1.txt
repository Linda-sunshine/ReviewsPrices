review/summary: super iron, didn't know what I was missingreview/text: After reading the reviews here I bought this iron to replace a Rowenta iron that had a ton of issues. The digital display is great, its so easy to use the correct setting now. I like how it tell me when it needs a cleaning, and that it cleans itself. I never realized I had to clean irons before, maybe this one will last longer. I also am amazed that there are no leaks with this iron!
