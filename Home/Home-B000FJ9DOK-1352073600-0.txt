review/summary: Fantastic.review/text: This is the best water bottle I've ever owned. I believe it says on the package that it keeps cold things cold for up to 12 hours...but my experience is closer to 48 hours. I can put ice water in here and two days later there's still little ice chunks clinking around inside! An extremely well made bottle, to say the least! I love it!
