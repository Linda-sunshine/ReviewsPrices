review/summary: really nice soft sheets for the moneyreview/text: quality of sheets exceeds expectations. however the color was more easter yellow, so i got rit dye color remover (two packages) put it into my laundry tub (utility sink) filled with water and soaked each piece individually for 15 minutes. now the sheets are creamy white, which is what i wanted in the first place!
