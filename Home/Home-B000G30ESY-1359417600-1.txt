review/summary: Customer Service is awfulreview/text: The rice cooker works fine until a month later I found there were steaming waters and foggy at the clock display area. I called their customer service dept and they told it needed to be repaired because computer chips could be damaged. So I asked them if it was under warranty since I only had for a month, they said no. They said it is not a manufacturing default. I asked them I cooked the rice according to the instruction, if it is not a manufacturing default, then what could that be? She said she had no answer, however she insisted on that was not the manufacturer's fault. I really don't understand her and don't understand her logic. I asked to talk to the manager, but only got the voice mail. I asked them to call me back but they never did. It is a very expensive product in terms of rice cooker. But they treat their customer like..... you are a sucker!
