review/summary: No More Ironing.. Huzzah!review/text: I hate ironing. I hate that my boyfriend won't iron his own work shirts and I end up ironing them just so I'm not the girl whose boyfriend is a wrinkly mess. I've always been bad at ironing. I iron one side and I manage to wrinkle the other.I decided I needed a steamer and began the hunt. I didn't want to spend a couple hundred on a big professional garment steamer. I ended up coming across a hand-held steamer and boy am I glad I picked it up. It heats up extremely quickly (under a minute). I can steam about 3 shirts on one filling. The wrinkles just melt away and I'm actually more willing to wear blouses/shirts to work because it's such a breeze to get rid of the wrinkles.It's still too big for me to consider bring while traveling, but it's perfect for getting out of the house on time in the morning. I've used it on crepe wool suits and silky shirts and both have worked well.
