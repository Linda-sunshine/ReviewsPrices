review/summary: Unreal!!!!!review/text: We first purchased the carpet cleaner thats "one up" from this one and it broke down after over a year. We have three dogs, two of which use the house as a bathroom often (one being a puppy one being elderly) and we constantly have to clean our carpets. If you could see the picture of the carpet after TWO SWIPES from this cleaner, it is literally out of a commercial, those ones you can't imagine are real with the white vs tan carpet after cleaning!!!!! This shampooer is so easy, simple, and completely worth every penny. Do not buy any other Hoover shampooer!! this one is perfect for deep gnarly pee/wine/mud/"doggy accident"/ vomit stains that have sat there for MONTHS! they literally disappeared!!! feel free to email me for a photo! southworth.n@live.com
