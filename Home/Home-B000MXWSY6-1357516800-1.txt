review/summary: Excellent Productreview/text: In a compact size this clock radio with dual alarm does everything with ease of use. The dual alarm is great for me since I have to take pills at midnight and again at 6:30 am. If I don't want to get up at 6:30, it has great options on the snooze button to put it off! The alarm times are easy to set and easy to change--no clicking around the clock, simply move the dial for time a or b. The alarm starts off pleasantly, then is more insistent but always with a pleasant tone--probably can be louder, but I don't need it. The radio is clear and also easy to adjust. I have an old Dream Machine and was amazed at the improvements. Can't think of anything con!
