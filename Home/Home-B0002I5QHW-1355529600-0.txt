review/summary: Almost unusable productreview/text: I attempted to use the grinder for over two hours, trying to grind up some chicken breast. I could not manage to get the grinder to sit still on the counter while turning the handle, and it also did not force the chicken through at all well. I finally gave up and threw the whole mess into the trash. Not a product I can recommend to anyone.
