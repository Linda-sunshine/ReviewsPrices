review/summary: Best Electric Frying Pan Everreview/text: I bought this Persto 16in. Electric frying Pan to put in our 5th wheel. I use it outside to cook things like Bacon, Sausage, fried potatoes and eggs. We have owned several electric frying pans over the years and this is by far THE BEST we have ever owned. I read the review and saw the picture someone did about a plastic smell in the office, and can say that we didn't experience anything like that. Of course before we used it we washed it thoroughly with soap and water to get any manufacturing residue off as we would with anything that comes in contact with food. I removed it from the camper last week and brought it in the house for the winter and My wife used it in the kitchen a couple of days ago to cook pancakes. Big mistake, now I will have to purchase another one for the camper. She says she likes it a lot better than her griddle because it is just as big and a lot more versital.
