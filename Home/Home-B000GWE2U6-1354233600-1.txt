review/summary: Easiest to clean that I've ever ownedreview/text: Pros: This humidifier is super cute, runs pretty quietly and is the easiest humidifier to clean that I have ever owned.Cons: Out of the box I couldn't get it running. I would turn it on and nothing would happen. I was getting really frustrated with it. Then my husband came home and I complained how I couldn't get it running. He went into the room and turned it on and it worked right away... just fine. (Which frustrated me even more) Since then we have only had a couple of times when we'd try to turn it on and it wouldn't work or would stop running for no reason. (and it's happened now for him too, not just me) I'm not sure if this is just a flaw in this individual product or overall, but it hasn't been a major issue and is usually remedied by repeatedly turning off and on until it works. The only other thing I wish it had was a built-in humidistat like some have, but since our air stays pretty dry through the winter anyway and I use it for white noise in my son's room, it's not really a problem to just leave it running whenever he's sleeping.
