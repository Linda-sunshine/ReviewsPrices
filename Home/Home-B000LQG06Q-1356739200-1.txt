review/summary: Decent quality at a very good pricereview/text: I purchased this foam mattress topper to use as a pet bed for my 2 dogs. Got the twin size, fold it in half to double up the thickness and covered it with a blanket. Wish I had gotten the Queen size though.The quality is far more superior than the $100 dollar so-called "foam" pet beds you'll find in specialty pet stores. I want to give my dogs the highest level of comfort with what I would use for myself.It took longer than I thought for the "new" foam smell to disappear (maybe 2-3 weeks but that might be because it is folded up in half). Otherwise, I am very pleased with the price and quality of this topper! I love how my dogs have a comfy bed just like mine now.
