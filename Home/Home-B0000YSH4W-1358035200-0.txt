review/summary: Thought Provokingreview/text: I know why this book was chosen for a Newberry Medal. It is extremely well-written and is thought-provoking, I found it to be almost terrifying in that, are we not careful, we might have the imagined world Lowry creates in her book as a reality for our future world. I would hope that we would guard against allowing our families, as we know them, to be taken from us. The world of Jonas is one without any true happiness and lacks love and color. I was somewhat hopeful throughout the book that Jonas, the hero of the story, and his young charge, might find a better world. I suppose the message for all is to be aware. Sameness has been tried and found wanting in the world's history. I enjoyed the book as an adult. I would not have liked it as a young teen (the intended audience) because I would have found the parallels between the attempts of Germany to create such a world during World War II, where my father and uncles fought, and the world of the Giver too harsh for my tender young heart.
