review/summary: Rocky Startreview/text: There is a story here. We ordered this ice cream maker with no problem, but UPS delivered it to the wrong address. This was discovered when we checked for an update on the delivery and discovered it had already been delivered, but not to us. So, we filed a report with UPS, who said it could take up to eight business days to have an answer, but usually could be resolved within four to five days. Three days later the ice cream maker showed up at our door. Once opened it was not the one we ordered. We ordered the all stainless look and received the stainless trimmed in black look. I contacted the seller and received an apologetic answer almost immediately, saying they would send out a prepaid return label right away. After what we went through to get it, we decided to keep the one we were sent, as it did not affect the outcome of the ice cream. WE LOVE IT! We have used it four times so far and haven't had one person say they didn't love the ice cream. It is so easy to use and easy to clean.
