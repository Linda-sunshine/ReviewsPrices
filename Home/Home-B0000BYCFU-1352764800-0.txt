review/summary: Presto, changoreview/text: I have to write 20 words or more, so this will be longer than needed.This is the second one I have purchased, the first one still works just fine, but I wanted to be able to do 32 pints at a time. My stock pots are 20, 20, 32 and 40 quart. That is a lot of stock. It is simple, the gauge and instructions are if anything simpler than the older one, the gauge and seal are easy to remove if needed.It arrived just before Sandy hit, I lost power 46 hours and spent that time making and canning stock. I had full intentions on moving on to the the rest of the freezer, not just the stock bin (about 20% of the freezer).
