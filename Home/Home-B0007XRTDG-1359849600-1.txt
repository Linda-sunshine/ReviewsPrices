review/summary: Great productreview/text: I have always used this particular brand and size if skillet. The non stick surface usually wears off in 5 to 7 years depending on frequency of use. I just replace the skillet when this happens since the product is so reasonably priced. When Presto had a plant with a store here in Jackson, MS they would replace the bottom section of the skillet for free. Since they have closed that facility I now just replace the item as neccesary.
