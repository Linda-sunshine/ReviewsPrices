review/summary: Great for the officereview/text: I purchased this as a second coffee machine that I could leave in my office at work so that I could easily have that caffeine pick-me-up I seem to need in the mid-afternoon. It's the perfect size to fit in the corner of my desk unobtrusively, and having the &#34;forever filter&#34; means I don't need to keep paper filters at the office too. I also like that it came with a mug, so I can just rinse it out each evening and have it all ready to go the next day. My only wish is that the power cord were a bit longer (I think it's maybe 2ft long) since I was limited to places that were basically right next to the outlet. Otherwise, though, this coffee maker is just about perfect.
