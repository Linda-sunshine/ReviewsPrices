review/summary: Quick coffee for people on the go, but only lasted for 2 years.review/text: Lets just say I've enjoyed this coffeemaker for about two years, but now unfortunately it's not working the same as it was. We've randomnly had issues where the coffeemaker would make a weird vibrating noise and then it wouldn't produce any coffee. It was as if it sucked all the water into the coffeemaker, but it didn't brew it out. All you have to do is turn it off and then turn it back on to reset it. Normally that works, but then right at our two year mark it stopped making a full cup of coffee. My husband cleaned it out with the vinegar and water (a recommendation by Keurig) and it still barely produces enough coffee. Sometimes it will fill your cup and other times it will give you a shot. I really enjoyed this coffee maker because it was extremely fast and I didn't want to deal with making coffee in the morning. You have a lot of K cup options, it's easy to refill and clean, plus the coffee tasted really good! I would give this coffeemaker a 5 star for the time it worked, but now it's only 3 stars because of the coffee brewing inconsistency at the 2 year mark.
