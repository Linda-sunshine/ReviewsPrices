review/summary: KRUPS electric coffee and spice grinderreview/text: This was my first purchase of a Coffee and spice Grinder so I really can't do a comparison of different brands. I really do like this appliance though. I usually only grind a small amount of coffee at a time to keep the freshly ground taste for a few days. Whether you like your coffee finely or coarsely ground this grinder does great on either.
