review/summary: Worked great but only for 5 weeksreview/text: I was thrilled with how easily and quickly this allowed me to make baby food and then it died yesterday just as I was blending cooked pears, leaving a burning smell in my kitchen and metal filings in my baby's food. I called Cuisinart customer service and was told they would replace it promptly for a $10 charge plus I had to pay to ship the original back to AZ. Not only am I annoyed I will have to pay 2/3 the cost or more ($10 plus AZ shipping costs) of what I already paid, but I am also a busy working mom...I do not have time to stand in line at the post office for this, especially during the busy holiday season. Not to mention the more than a week I have to wait for its arrival...I rely on this daily to feed my little guy. If you asked me 3 days ago, I would have raved about this product but to have it only function for 5 weeks is just unacceptable.
