review/summary: A sad disappointmentreview/text: After a lot of research my wife and I decided to go for the Pro Series Kitchen Aid mixer expecting it to be a good long term kitchen appliance. We read about the shortcomings of the mixer like the fact that the gears strip if you operate it at too great a speed with thick mixtures like bread dough and we were careful to use it appropriately. In general we used the mixer once or twice a week for normal home use food prep until it failed within weeks of the warranty expiring. The failure was in the electronics and was in no way associated with misuse or abuse, it is a cheap and poorly made control board design when compared to its' predecessor.The bottom line is that like many other manufacturers Kitchen Aid which was once a great name has so cheapened its' product that it no longer has any quality to it. My advice would be to save some money and buy an older used Kitchen Aid. The old design will last forever and wear items like the motor brushes are easily replaceable. If you are set on buying a larger new mixer spend a little more money and buy a true commercial mixer from a company like Hobart.
