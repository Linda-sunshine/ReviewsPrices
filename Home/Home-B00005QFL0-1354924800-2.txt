review/summary: Every loaf comes out perfectreview/text: This bread maker is truly amazing. While the directions to make bread may sound challenging this machine makes it almost impossible to screw it up. Every single loaf comes out perfectly. The only drawback is the amount of time it takes to make bread. You need to think ahead 4-6 hours. The end result is well worth it. You'll find yourself wanting to make bread much more often. Controls are straightforward and easy to use. Timer feature is great so that you can have it start automatically and be ready for dinner when you get home. Makes the house smell amazing!
