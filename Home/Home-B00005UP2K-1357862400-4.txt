review/summary: I love this mixer and love love love the color.review/text: I love just seeing this mixer sitting on my countertop, much less how much I love it when I use it. It always reminds me of my grandmother. She was sooo proud of her KitchenAid mixer and I'm just as proud of mine. It mixes great, has a tilt head so it's really easy to remove the mixer blades. I can't wait to try out some of the more exotic attachments.
