review/summary: Works like a charm every timereview/text: I purchased this can opener several years ago, and have opened quite a few cans since. Worked great from day one, and has never let me down. It solidly locks on to the can, the handle is perfect to get a good grip and with a quick couple turns the can top is free. Design wise it might be possible to improve (you might feel it looks dated), but for basic function this product is flawless.
