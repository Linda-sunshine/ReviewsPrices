review/summary: No competition...review/text: This mixer replaces one that was, I believe, over 30 years old! That in itself is a testament to the quality of the machine in general. While the bowl and beaters included with the new machine seem less substantial, the function of the mixer is certainly not compromised. An investigation of all the new competitive mixers was done prior to this purchase. In retrospect, this was a futile exercise. The decision to purchase KitchenAid was a given.
