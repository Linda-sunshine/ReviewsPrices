review/summary: No Frills but more than functional (update)review/text: In the past three years we've owned a dyson, a dirt devil and a shark. Our children broke two of them and I short circuited the last one.We waited two months before getting a replacement and settled on this one. The Mighty Mite does work wonderfully on wood floors and couches... this thing will NOT do carpets to save its life. Its a no frills connection, nothing to clip in place and nothing for the kids to break... I vacuumed under our couch and had to reconnect the floor brush three times.This is light weight going up and down the stairs but the plug is so short, you have to unplug/replug on a standard stair case.The attachments stay securely on the vacuum and the hose is adequately long enough to do ceilings and walls.Very basic vacuum but it does a good job.UPDATE-The vacuum DIED on Day three. Wouldn't turn on, wouldn't budge.
