review/summary: Great for dry ingredients, terrible for liquidsreview/text: These are pretty good for storing things like sugar, rice and other dry goods. The are not good for liquids at all. Since I wanted the lids to take beverages with me as well as storing my dry baking goods these are only half as useful as I wanted them to be. I was going to buy more and buy some wide mouth but I think the old lid used for canning will do just as well and costs me nothing. Nice idea. Not so much on execution. I hope there is a liquid tight option out there somewhere.
