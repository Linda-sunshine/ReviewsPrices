review/summary: Great budget espresso machinereview/text: I just received the machine the other day and got right on trying it out. I have to say the machine is a little flimsy. When it's brewing, you litterely have to hold the cup in place because of the shaking. Second, just like other users have said in their reviews, we could use a little bit more space for the cup. Other than that, the machine is super great for its money. For such a small compact machine, it sure does give a lot, and I mean a lot of crema. The frother works super great too. I used blue bottle coffee so with that combined, I got the best cappucino, seriously just as good as any coffee houses. This is my first time making espresso so the experience was so pleasant, thanks to this great little machine. Definitely a good buy!
