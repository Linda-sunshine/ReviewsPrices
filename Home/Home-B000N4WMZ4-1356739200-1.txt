review/summary: Great product and great price!review/text: This was very well made it was a gift, and the person who recieved it absolutely loved it. It was for a man, and I thought the 70's brown color would be perfect and it was. Really does give it a retro look. Dutch ovens can be very expensive, so for the price I was a little nervous that it would look cheap, but it was the opposite, it looked as though it was a high priced dutch oven. There were no flaws in the enamel. I can't tell you how it cooks since it was a gift, but visually, it's beautiful!
