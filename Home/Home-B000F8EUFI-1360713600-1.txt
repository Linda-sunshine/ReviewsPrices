review/summary: Pretty goodreview/text: Con: It's a little hard to move around on my thick carpet. It's very noisy. It sometimes blows the things away you're trying to pick up.Pros: Small and compact for easy mobility and storage. Low price. Long power chord. Pretty good cleanup. Nice that it's bagless.
