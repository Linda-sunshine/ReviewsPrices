review/summary: Best Small Space Appliance!review/text: This is my second most used and most beloved kitchen appliance (after my Kitchenaid Stand Mixer). When you live in a small space, it is critical to buy high quality products that are versatile and don't take up room on your counters or in cabinets. This little mixer has exceeded all my expectations in quality, power, durability, and smallness. I use it 2-4 times per week and it has performed like a champ. I regularly use it to make smoothies; hence, I have no need for a large bulky blender.
