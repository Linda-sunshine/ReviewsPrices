review/summary: Great to get the dog hair!review/text: My wife wanted a hand held vac to pick up out labs hair. He has got into a habit of sneaking on the couch at night. This little unit cleans the hair up like no bodies business. it also gets the hair of the comforter on our bed. it is a little bit heavy but not too bad. Cordless would have been the bizz but this it just plain great!
