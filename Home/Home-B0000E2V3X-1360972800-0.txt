review/summary: Great versatile panreview/text: This thing is a beast! Very heavy. I was looking for something I could use on my gas range top to heat up flour tortillas for burritos. I was looking at another item on Amazon but the reviews were terrible. Then I saw this item & for just a few more dollars, I have something that is VERY high quality, is made in America, and will last a lifetime.Also, Lodge refers to this as their &#34;Pizza Pan&#34;. I haven't tried it for that yet, but it's certainly big enough for that. This will also get some use as a stove top griddle at some point I'm sure.
