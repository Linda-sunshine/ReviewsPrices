review/summary: Works very wellreview/text: I previously owned the comparable Mr. Coffee espresso maker, which sells at about the same price. It broke down on me after four years, but I partly blame myself for not keeping it as clean and clear as I should have. The Mr. Coffee version of this machine worked great, but I decided to try basically the same machine, only now from De'Longhi. This is just as good, only I plan to keep this one clean so it lasts more than four years. It's less than $100 and makes a great cup of espresso. I drink a lot of espresso, and the stuff I make at home with this little machine equals anything I drink in coffee shops. It's also just as good as my parents' Nespresso machine. My parents pay 60 cents for their pods (not fair trade) while I pay about 10 cents a cup using fair-trade espresso in this machine. I saw that Starbucks is selling their espresso pods for their new espresso machine for about $1 a pod. So all around this De'Longhi machine is a great value and makes an espresso that's hard to beat... Also, I suggest buying a cheap tamper. I have a little plastic one....
