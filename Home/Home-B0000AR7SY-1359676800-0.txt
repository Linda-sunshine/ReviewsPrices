review/summary: Surpisingly consistent coarse grind for the price!review/text: All of the coffe shops and officianados out there would like you to believe you need to spend twice this amount to get a consistent, even and adequate coarse / press / drip grind, but this grinder is proof that you do not. The burrs on this grinder rival anything that grinders twice the price or more (like Baratza) can compare to, and this grinder makes the case that for a coarse grind that "you could spend more, but why?"Now, although this grinder supposedly can be used for espresso - I am not sure this is this grinders strong point. Although it can do a fine grind, if you have a high end (or even a medium duty, entry level machine like a Gaggia Classic or Rancilio Silivia) than you should consider spending more - this grinder may be over-matched for that level of espresso making.And finally, this grinder claims it can do Turkish grind - that may be even more of a stretch, I would not use it for that purpose.Overall - Four Stars! For the price, it is a capable, adequate, high quality grinder for coarse to medium grinds for many press and drip applications. I knocked a star off for the marketing exaggeration this can be used just as well for Espresso and Turkish grinds.... while OK for espresso, it is far from ideal for that and there are better grinders for that purpose!
