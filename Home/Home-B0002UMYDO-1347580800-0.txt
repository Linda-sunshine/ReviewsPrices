review/summary: it's too late to return...review/text: I wish I didn't move... so that I could return this can opener.I bought this over a month ago but moving from east coast to the west took a long time and I was unable to try it out until recently (over 1 month later)I had another electric can opener that started to lose power and was not charging properly which is why I ended up buying a new one.This electric can opener is pretty powerful as expected and has nifty features like bottle opener and the ability to take out the can opener part which I have not tried yet.What I did try was putting the can... or at least attempting to put the can on it to start opening it....It took me about 2 minutes to get the can on it so that it was stable and ready for opening. That is not acceptable. If I wanted to fiddle with the can opener, I might as well have gotten the manual one and done it myself.Once the can is on it properly, the can opener works fine.Overall: this one is OverPriced, Over Embellished and not at all worth the time and money to buy.If I could return it, I would and instead get the one my in law has by Hamilton like this oneHamilton Beach 76606Z Smooth Touch Can Opener, Black and Chromethat opens the can from the side. It is much cheaper and works easier.
