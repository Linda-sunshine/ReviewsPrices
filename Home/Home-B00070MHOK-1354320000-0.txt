review/summary: Perfectreview/text: I've owned two full sized steamers over the years, and ended up never using them because of the inconvenience. But this little steamer is perfect to pull out on a rushed morning and take out a crease or two. It is well made, and has a nice long cord. It heats up quickly and does a good job of taking out wrinkles. I keep it in my laundry room but it is small enough to throw into your suitcase. They recommend using distilled water to prevent mineral build up. A good buy!
