review/summary: Not Soft, Cheap Feeling, And Received Sheets with Large Hole in the Middle Of Sheetsreview/text: The title says it all in a concise manner. Sateen sheets are intended to be soft to the touch and are very dissimilar to the sateen sheets my friend purchased in a bedding store. After feeling the coarse rough-feeling nature I quickly noticed a large 3cm x 3cm (large) hole in the middle of the main bedding sheet through it's folded portion - meaning numerous large holes in different areas.Although there are many products I purchase on Amazon that are worth their price, these are no more impressive than most of the 400-thread cotton sheets I considered purchasing in the store. Perhaps, these sheets are vastly more comfortable to the touch after washing, but they certainly are not a bargain for the quality upon initial opinion.I hope your purchase experience was/is better.
