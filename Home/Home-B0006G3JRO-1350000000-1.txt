review/summary: Absolute crap!review/text: I bought this blender because Cuisinart used to be synonymous with good quality but this product was anything but quality. To begin, the attachment chopper broke the VERY FIRST TIME I used it. I didn't return it because I was more interested in the blender part. I used it perhaps 6 times when the plastic teeth which form the gears which make the blade turn STRIPPED and MELTED. Seeing as how the blade is pretty key to say, BLENDING, this left me with a very pretty chrome hunk of rubbish. I would not only not recommend this product, I will now not buy any other Cuisinart product!
