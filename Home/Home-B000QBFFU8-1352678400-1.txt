review/summary: Fabulous!review/text: There are a lot of reviews of this juicer online. And there are a lot of juicing advocates. But what everyone should be saying is just try it - because you will ADORE the taste of anything you juice. It should be sold for the taste alone, forget about trying to talk people into juicing for their health - just give them a taste!Like most, the documentary, "Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead", convinced me to try juicing. But if anyone would have let me taste it, I would have been doing it all along.This juicer is great. It's easy to use and easy to clean. It was a bit intimidating at first, like the first time you use a food processor. But once you figure out how to set it up (which is easy), you are good to go. Clean it right after you use it. You can put everything in the dish washer, but the little sieve/basket deal cleans best by hand using the hard bristle brush that comes with. That takes a couple seconds. I put the big piece in the dish washer and was everything else by hand. You can put the pulp in your composter where it will compost so quickly!Really, try it for the taste!
