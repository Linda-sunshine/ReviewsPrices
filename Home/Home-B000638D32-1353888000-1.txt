review/summary: Great bang for your buck!review/text: This is a great knife for the price.If you don't want to shell out a lot of money but still want a great, sharp cutting knife this is your best bet.The size and weight of the knife is perfect for cutting most items.I recommend theVictorinox Cutlery BladeSafe for 8-Inch to 10-Inch Knife Bladesto go with it!It keeps your blade safe from your fingers and from getting beat up by other blades in your drawer.Highly Recommended for those looking for the best bang for your buck.
