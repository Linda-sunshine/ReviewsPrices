review/summary: Pyrex is awesomereview/text: I got my first pyrex set as a gift from my mom when I moved into my first apartment in a new city after college. I have been in love ever since. Pyrex is perfect for a busy single lady on the go. I would go from fridge to microwave or stove on those busy days, sometimes just grab a container of leftovers for my lunch on my way out the door. Perfect for the all nighters when you need to pop something in the oven and work while it cooks. Pyrex is just so convenient not to mention safer than plastic when using the microwave (I use a wet paper towel instead of the plastic top). One thing to note when using pyrex in the stove: do not heat above 450 or use on broil, the glass could possibly break. I have never had this happen to me. I still have the set from my mom which was 7 years ago, the whole set with no missing pieces or broken ones. I just like to buy more for variety of shapes and sizes.
