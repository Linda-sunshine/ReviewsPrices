review/summary: Good value for the money.review/text: After 3 years of use, I can conclude that these knives offer a good value for the money. The pros and cons listed here by other reviewers is adequate. They are good knives out of the box, and served me well for the past few years. But.. the blades don't make it easy to sharpen, and my knives rusted near the handles. I am getting rid of them now , and upgrading to a more pro line of knives: Wusthoff Classic knives. Obviously, there is a difference in spending $30 on a knife set and $400 on a knife set, but after watching these knives fade over the years, I would like to have a set that will last, and that can be easily maintained and honed.
