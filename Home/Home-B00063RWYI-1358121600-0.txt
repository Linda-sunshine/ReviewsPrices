review/summary: Perfect for Breadreview/text: We followed others' suggestions to scrub off the factory pre seasoning, and we used SOS pads, very fast and efficient. Baked on 2 coatings of unsalted butter, then 1 of vegetable shortening, cooling to room temp. in between; back to shiny black, hard surface. We didn't want to muck up our expensive enamel-coated cast iron pots baking bread. Made our very first loaf of no-knead bread--wow! I've been baking bread for a lot of years, and this is hands down the very finest loaf I've ever made. We used parchment paper, but next time I'm going to be brave and try cornmeal. This was for my husband, but I'm going to try some gluten-free bread for me in it next. Delighted with the purchase, the quality, the size, the fast shipping, and especially the price.
