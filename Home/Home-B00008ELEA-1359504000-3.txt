review/summary: Lasts about 2 yearsreview/text: These are lasting from 2 to 3 years for me and then dying - it's not good value. The first one I bought at a garage sale lasted about 10 years. All the new ones are cheap. How hard is it to make a decent product?So the latest one's going bad this week (peculiar ozone smell that presages failure) I'm finally going to look for something else.
