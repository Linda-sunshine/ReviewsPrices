review/summary: Excellent purchasereview/text: I was hesitant to purchase this product without seeing it and was especially concerned about the dimensions/size since it appeared to be smaller than our old trashcan... possibly too small?Turns out this is a nearly perfect product. The "squarish" dimensions actually allow the most amount of trash for this size trashbag.. better than any other trashcan we've had. I'd say this is the optimal dimension of a trashcan.We also got a second one for recycling. They sit side by side, take up the same amount of room as just our old trashcan took just for trash and they work great. The kids love playing with the automatic openers as well (although that lasted only a couple of days which is a bonus for battery life!).The only downside is that the lip of the top cap should be longer so as to extend down low enough to hide the trash bag that you fold around the upper edge of the main canister. It would make for a neater appearance in our kitchen with this correction. This was a design miss unfortunately but is not a show stopper. I suspect they'll correct this in a future design but we can live with it.Overall we're very happy with this purchase.
