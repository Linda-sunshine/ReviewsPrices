review/summary: Great for greens.review/text: I am coming from owning the Breville BJE200XL Compact Juice Fountain 700-Watt Juice Extractor. That thing was a nightmare. I don't juice much fruit, so it really never fit my needs. Plus it was incredibly loud, wake the neighbors loud.So after a lot of looking I decided on this juicer. I juice every morning, wheat grass and if I have time vegetable juice, which is most mornings. Wheat gass comes out pretty wet. I have to run it through 3 or 4 times. Not a really big deal. I does leafy greens wonderfully. Dry pulp, all the juice goes into the juice container, the pulp into the pulp one. I usually use cucumbers, which don't go so well. it just kind of mushes them up, and some of the mush comes out into the juice. I tried juicing with the screen on, and the mush would coat the screen so heavily that the juice couldn't get through. I believe this is why they say not to juice with the screen on. Once i found a method that worked for me, that was no big deal. Tomato's, lemons, anything soft just turns to mush. hard, leafy, all great. All around I really like this juicer. Yes, it takes some time. But the juice I get is so much better.On a side note, while not related to this juicer, my suggestion to anyone wanting to juice primarily fruit, and in the market for a centrifugal juicer, buy one that is pulp ejecting. It is more pleasant than digging around the barrel for the pulp.
