review/summary: It Works!review/text: I read the other reviews and was skeptical to purchase. But I have none of the problems as the others mentioned. Easy to put together. Works great. The only drawback is the need to attach and detach the hose for the attachment usage. Hope it last longer than the other well known manufacturer's shampooer.
