review/summary: The bomb diggity!review/text: This is actually my second purchase of this iron. The first one took it's own life in a flying leap from my ironing board. It was a sad day. I'm excited to be able to repurchase the same one though, because this iron ROCKS!!! I'm pretty low maintenance as far as clothing goes. It either survives the washer and dryer or it doesn't. So.... by the time something makes it to my ironing board, it REALLY needs it. This iron puts out plenty of steam with the option of steam blast and spritzing. I usually turn the heat setting one up from the recommended (in keeping with my survival of the fittest philosophy) and pour on the steam. You are free to adjust the steam and heat to whatever your situation requires, no inadequate presets here.
