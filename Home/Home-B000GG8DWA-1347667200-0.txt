review/summary: Worked.... 5 minutesreview/text: Bought this for an emergency backup awhile ago. Tested it for a few minutes, seemed ok...put it on the shelf... sadly when needed, it worked 5 minutes, than unit wouldn't change between the 2 settings. After turning it off..and on again, nothing worked..Amazon's return policy is great, but, if you get one as a back up, and don't plan to use it unless needed, don't just test run it for a few minutes. Give it a good try out so you can return it within the allowed timeframe, should it fail.
