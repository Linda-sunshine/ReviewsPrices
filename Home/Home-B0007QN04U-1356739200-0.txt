review/summary: Amazing mixer...for large batchesreview/text: First of all, my subtraction of a star doesn't indicate disdain for the product. I actually love this mixer and, if it were to break down the line, I'm certain that I would get another. I purchased the Professional 6-Quart mixer over the Artisan series solely because, during the holidays, I bake large batches of cookies for cookie trays and, during the summer, I like to bake lots of desserts that feed a ton of people for barbeques, so I thought this would better suit my needs so as not to have to mix batch after batch in a smaller mixer. Let me say that this does that like a champ. Six dozen cookies? No problem. Filling for four pumpkin pies? Yep, got you covered.I am, however, a little disappointed in its small-batch productivity. When baking a single batch of cookies or cupcakes or making a cake, the mixer is not the &#34;dump your stuff in and let it do the job for you&#34; miracle worker that you see on the Food Network. Often times, there is flour stuck to the bottom or sides that the mixer is just not going to pick up on its own because the bowl is so large. It does get the job done though if you babysit it and wiggle the bowl around (yes, you can manipulate the bowl with the handle while the mixer is operational). At times, you'll need to shut it off and use a rubber spatula to move the flour into the center to get it to work.The above issue is really just a small hiccup in what is, otherwise, a flawless product. Add to this that there are endless attachment possibilities and you really have a solid product that is built to stand the test of time (I know people that have their mother's twenty year old KitchenAid and it still looks just as awesome and still works just as flawlessly as mine does). However, if you mainly do small-batch baking, the Artisan series will probably be more than adequate, as well as save you some money.
