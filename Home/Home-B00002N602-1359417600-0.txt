review/summary: good productreview/text: It's a good pressure cooker that works well for most of my cooking. The only drawback is the pressure is fixed at 15 psi (my old pressure cooker had 3 different weight rings that you used individually or in combination to vary the cooking pressure). However, unlike my old one, this one works on my induction plate which makes it much more economical to cook by using so much less electricity.
