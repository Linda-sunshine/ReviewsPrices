review/summary: Broke-down at second usereview/text: It broke-down at second use. It seems that the body of the machine is nice and sturdy, the motor's strong and the blades do the job nicely, the drive shaft is connected with a REALLY CHEAP PLASTIC piece. And this DID strip, and now the blades are not turning even the machine works fine.
