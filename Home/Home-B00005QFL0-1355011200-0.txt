review/summary: Ten years later it still rules!review/text: Was thinking of changing up to a fancier kind of machine until I started reading reviews. We make bread all the time in the winter and I have been able to vary recipes with few failures. It is easy to program, though I'll admit I have never done the timer. It is just a workhorse that keeps going. If I ever need a new one, it will be just like this one
