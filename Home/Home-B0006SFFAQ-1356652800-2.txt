review/summary: Best home brewed coffee ever madereview/text: First time buyer to a upscale coffee maker like this. The brewed coffee is smooth not bitter. It is truely the best coffee I have ever brewed at home. I like having a 1-4 setting vs all or nothing. I do have a few suggestions for improvments. 1st the digital display is very hard to see. A brighter maybe even blue color display would be great. 2nd - a exterior view window to help see how much water you add would be a welcome addition.
