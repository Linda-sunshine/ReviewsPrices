review/summary: Absolutely the best coffeemakerreview/text: We have had several and the Zojirushi is absolutely the best. The price is reasonable. It makes good coffee. It is very easy to operate first thing in the morning, thereby avoiding the dreaded "coffee incidents" where user malfunction coupled with complicated setup leave coffee on the counter rather than in the pot. It is easy enough to clean. The thermal carafe keeps the brew piping hot avoiding the stewed, burned taste of the ones with pot warmers. Our original ceased to work after several days of power surges/outages from our beloved power company (not the Zoji's fault). We now have a brand new one that is a real pleasure after having to use our backup retired Melitta until the new Zoji arrived.
