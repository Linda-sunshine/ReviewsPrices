review/summary: Can't Complainreview/text: My husband and I really needed an air mattress that would last at least a month with daily use (in the middle to moving to Germany). I have lower back and hip problems and I can say that I can sleep soundly on it. The built in pump is great. We have to fill it up a little every day before we use it and it makes small popping sounds when getting off of it; but other than that it is great. We have been using it for about two weeks and have not had any leaks! It looks like it will go the distance.
