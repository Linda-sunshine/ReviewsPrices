review/summary: Way better than my noisy alarm clock!review/text: I am particular about what my alarm clock sounds like. I'm a light sleeper so I don't need some blaring loud buzzing to wake me up...my last alarm clock did that and I was so grumpy getting up in the mornings. I got this to have the choice of waking up to sounds which I really like. You can control the volume however you can't change the sound that it plays for alarm...it just plays the standard sound which is OK by me. Haven't tried the beep alarm yet so I can't comment on that. I also love that it's blue light and not red. It's a little larger than I expected but thats ok too (I say it looks UFO-y). Overall excellent choice for me...I dig it.
