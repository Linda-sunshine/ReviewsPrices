review/summary: Not Enoughreview/text: I have a relatively small bathroom that was built without a vent. I live in a relatively cold area that requires me to take relatively hot showers. As such, I found myself with moisture on my walls, which lead to some mold.I did some research and decided to try this out, and it has not helped much.I must start by saying the thing really is quiet. I am at the end of the hall now from the bathroom and I could not tell you if it is on or off. Seriously.Now the bad. This thing is so small and weak that it does not seem to be doing much for my problem. I have it on the back of the toilet and when I come out, the mirror directly above the unit is fog free in about a five inch radius. The rest of the mirror is foggy and the walls are still damp to the touch. The thing is simply not strong enough for my purpose, which is too bad because it is small and silent and would have been perfect.
