review/summary: my new kitchen must-havereview/text: I use the misto sprayer daily for evenly coating pans, baking dishes, and on my cast iron after cleaning. I like having the option of using whichever oil I'd like with the bonus of not having to purchase/throw away aerosol cans. I've followed advice from other reviews and untwist the cap to release air after each use. Haven't bothered cleaning it and it seems to spray as good as new. The only reason I didn't give this a 5-star rating is because the cap tends to leak a very thin layer of oil on the sides, and the aluminum bottom leaves stains on my counter-top. Regardless, I'd recommend this product.
