review/summary: Optimus Infrared Quart Heaterreview/text: Rather inexpensive but does a wonderful job. Pretty powerful for a small appliance. I live in Flotida and when it gets a bit chilly and I use it in my bathroom. I have a very large bathroom and it gives an even radiant warmth. No blower neededSeller was great and so far I am very pleased with this heater.It is better than my DeLonghi, which was quite expensive. Do not hesitate to purchasehase
