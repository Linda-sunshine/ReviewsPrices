review/summary: good qulaity, but needs maintenancereview/text: I've been using this humdifier for a year now and it works pretty good. It's amazing that it can humidify the entire house. My wife is a very light sleeper and it doesnt keep her awake at night.One suggestion is to change the filter frequently as it gets moldy quickly.Overall, this works, but needs some maintenance.
