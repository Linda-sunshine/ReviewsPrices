review/summary: Good product for the moneyreview/text: I wore the first one out after years of use, now on my second one. Love this machine. First one wore out because of a plastic part in the grinding mechanism. The company needs to stop using plastic in there, but then it would last too long, right?It does a good job, has many grind settings, holds a good amount of beans in the hopper.
