review/summary: Nice grillreview/text: I wanted to have an indoor grill for bad weather. We purchased this grill/griddle because it claimed it was pre-seasoned. I like it well enough, but no matter how much oil I use, things just stick to this. I've wasted quite a bit of good salmon and chicken on it from the sticking issues.
