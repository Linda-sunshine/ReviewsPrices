review/summary: A must for good coffee lovers!review/text: I read a lot of reviews on this coffee maker before I purchased it. The good reviews outweighed the bad by a great margin. The main issue seemed to be the proper installation of the lid for brewing. It is actually very easy and should not be a concern.It does, indeed, hold the 12 cup capacity it boasts. The tall coffee mugs are no longer a problem to fill as they are from a &#34;brewing station&#34;.It is very well made and attractive. Does not take up a lot of counter space and is easy to set up for brewing. The pot itself does not get hot on the outside, but keeps the coffee hot for many hours. I use a 1/2 gallon plastic pitcher to pour the water in the well and it takes it all.I also use it to brew tea to make iced tea. It makes an entire 1/2 gallon which I cool down and chill. This way I control the amount of sugar and lemon that goes into my favorite beverage.The only downside to this pot is it's weight. It is quite heavy when filled after brewing and you do have to tip it quite far over to pour. The upside of that is that the pot is cool to the touch and you can use two hands.The coffee tastes fresh even hours after the initial brewing. I would recommend this coffeemaker to anyone looking to purchase a new pot or to replace a brewing station.
