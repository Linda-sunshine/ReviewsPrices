review/summary: The sheets came off the elastic!review/text: I washed the sheets a second time and the sheets came off the elastic!I can not believe how these sheets are made! They were certainly expensive enough and they are even quite comfy and warm; I was quite pleased with them, but now I'm left with the job of sewing the sheets back over the elastic! I don't have time for this and I hate to sew! I didn't know I was applying for a job when I ordered the sheets. Unreal.This never happened to any other sheets I've dryed. There is nothing wrong with the dryer. I want another pair of sheets to replace these. I'm really quite annoyed (in case you couldn't tell!)
