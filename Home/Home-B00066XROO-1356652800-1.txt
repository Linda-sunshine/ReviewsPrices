review/summary: Good valuereview/text: I bought this cause it was highly rated. Some people complained it didn't heat evenly. I preheat while I mix up my pancake batter so like 10 min and have had no issues making up to plate sized pancakes. Great value and I can now fix a quadruple batch faster than the old single batch
