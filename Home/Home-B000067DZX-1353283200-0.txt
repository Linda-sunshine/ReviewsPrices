review/summary: Filter performance changedreview/text: When I first began using the filters, they would last 2-3 months. Now, they only last 2 weeks. They completely clog in about 3 weeks to where they won't even filter the water anymore and it remains stuck in the top basin. I would like a replacement for my purchase (I ordered 2 boxes of 3 filters each. Lot #21284333D1). If the problem persists, I have no other choice but to change to another water filtration system, because it is no longer cost effective to have filters that only last 2 weeks.
