review/summary: The Reviews Are Right On- My Amazon Deal of 2012review/text: I bought this as, a. It was an item I had on juicers list to checkb. when it was offered on a Gold Box deal,and scanned reviews, it went into my cart in minutesAs I picked up the box and unpacked it, I thought this is like commercial quality. When I washed the parts I saw the quality it may look plastic, but highly durable.I have used it only twice and already I am glad I bought it , even the instructions are simple, easy and practical.This is my Amazon Deal of the Year for 2012, and I guess it was the holiday and the fact I have PRIME I got it in my hands in about 36 hrs. Makes up for some of that irked me through the course of year.PLEASE NOTE; warranty card with mine said 15 years , not ten... thats even betterLets put it this way it is the first product from Korea, I am impressd.
