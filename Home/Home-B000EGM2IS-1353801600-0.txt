review/summary: Pleased!review/text: In summer 2011 I visited my parents across the country and was introduced to the Hot Shot. My step-mom had been using one for years to heat her water for tea. I was impressed and when I returned home, decided to order my own. I have been using it almost daily, usually several times a day to heat water for tea and miso soup. It heats water to boiling in about a minute. I love this thing and it has made my tea making so easy!
