review/summary: Very Disappointedreview/text: We were looking forward to these flannel sheets made in Portugal because during our research we found that 190 gram sheets were higher quality than the lower gram products. After washing them and sleeping on the sheets for a month, we have found a lot of pilling on both the top and fitted sheets. These bits and pieces get on everything and on my carpet as well. I don't know what causes this problem but I plan on returning them.
