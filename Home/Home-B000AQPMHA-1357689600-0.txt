review/summary: This tiny machine can take a LOT of abuse.review/text: I work at a Police Department in dispatch. As a team, we all pitched in a few bucks and purchased this exact model for our dispatch center, and bring our own K cups up to use in it. BEST idea anyone ever had in this department! We are a 14 person team that all abuse the coffee drink, myself personally drinking sometimes 3-4 cups a night. We've had it in our department for almost a year now taking our daily abuse, along with several police officers coming in and bumming off of it too. I'm pretty sure the filter has only been changed once, and trust me, it otherwise doesn't get cleaned properly being the community property that it is. Oh well! For the price of this, I can honestly say it is durable and well worth what you pay and get out of it. The water tank is easy to change, it has a mode that automatically turns itself off if you forget to (energy saver!), and just looks plain sleek and sophisticated sitting on the counter. Go for this purchase if you are contemplating!
