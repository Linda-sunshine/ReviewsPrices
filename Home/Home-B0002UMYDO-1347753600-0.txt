review/summary: West bend 77203review/text: Best can opener ever. Opens every can so far on first attempt. Does not leave metal strands from lid. Have tried four other brands/types three of which are sitting waiting to be returned. (not from Amazon) the West Bend 77203 is from Amazon. Love the metallic finish.
