review/summary: Won't turn on and Amazon won't exchange!!review/text: I purchased this juicer during Amazon's &#34;cyber Monday daily deals&#34; for a great price. The product arrived very quickly in an undamaged box. I carefully unwrapped all of the parts from the layers of bubble wrap and read the directions on how to assemble the unit for juicing. After assembling the unit I quickly cut up some apples and carrots so I could produce my first round of juice. Unfortunately, the machine would not turn on. I tried reassembling the parts, assuming that I hadn't locked something all the way into place. Still nothing. I tried pushing the &#34;rev&#34; button, for some reason that works, leading me to believe that there is not a problem with the outlet but with the juicer itself. After taking a deep breath I return online to start the return/exchange process with amazon, all the while dreading the idea of spending time at the post office this time of year. After typing in the problem with the product I am presented with the option of returning the item for a refund or receiving a credit for an item in my shopping cart, the option for an exchange is grayed out stating that the product is not available. Low and behold the item is still available online but at more than $100 than I paid through the &#34;daily deals&#34;. Now I am stuck with a nonfunctional product and no way to replace it without spending a significant amount of extra money. Seriously disappointed....
