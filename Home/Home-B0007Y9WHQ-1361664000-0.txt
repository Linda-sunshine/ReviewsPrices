review/summary: Excellent spiralizerreview/text: Love zucchini pasta and this makes it possible in no time. Quite like the variety of blades AND the fact that it can be held steadfast to the counter by the little suction cups affixed to its feet.One word of caution though: when nearing the end of the vegetable while spiraling, try to stop a little earlier. Or the the protruding metal portion that holds the veggies might break some of the pointed plastic protrusions on the other end of the handle - the one that moves towards the fixed end as the veggies get spiraled.
