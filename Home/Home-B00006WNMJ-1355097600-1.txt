review/summary: Perfect Easy to use water filtration system - Easy to installreview/text: I could not be more pleased with this water filter and the replacements. The unit attached easily to the sink faucet. The replacement cartridges easily screw in and out. The water tastes good and the price is right. The filters feel weighted and solid as does the unit itself. This is a very well made product.
