review/summary: Bought for husband as giftreview/text: My husband had wanted such a stand for many years. We had just remodeled our kitchen and now had the space for it. As it is one of the larger KitchenAids, I knew it would be on the counter most of its life (it is heavy) and thus chose the color to go with our new stainless steel appliances which it does well. We have had it for over a year and we have used it several times to make bread and pizza dough, and cookie and cake dough. Over time I have been buying him accessories for it. It has worked well and we have had no problems. It was an investment but my hope is it will last for a very long time.
