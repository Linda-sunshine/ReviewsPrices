review/summary: Just what I needed for pet hairreview/text: All of the great reviews are true. Well designed and powerful. I've read some other reviews having the experience of the exhaust being on the sides where it interferes with the pick up of debris. This model does not have this problem. The exhaust is at the back of the machine. I use this for cleaning dog hair off my white couch and my car upholstery.
