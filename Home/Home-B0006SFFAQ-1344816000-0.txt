review/summary: Warning-this is plastic, not metalreview/text: We ordered this as a replacement for a beloved 10 year old version of the same coffee maker, which finally died. As we unpacked it, we were disappointed to find that the "brushed metal" exterior was actually silver colored plastic (except for the back which is black plastic). Looks cheap even from a distance. This seems to be the same model as the stainless steel version. Went to Macy's which had a stainless steel one on display, but the plastic versions were inside all the boxes there too. Makes me suspect that this was a recent price cutting switch to this model which isn't yet reflected in the descriptions. For the price, you can get a coffee maker that works as well and looks a lot better. We're returning it.
