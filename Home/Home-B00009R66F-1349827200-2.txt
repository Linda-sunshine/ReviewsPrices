review/summary: Leaves streaks, But quick dry.review/text: For the price it does a good job. Small tank means you need to refill often. Great suction makes for quick dry. It did leave streaks on carpet though when cleaning, had to go over a week later to remove, and it was still just O.K. looking. I have 2 dogs who are in and out of the house all day, so Lot's of dirt is tracked in, so the carpets were extra dirty. I knew going into cleaning that they were not going to be perfect. For the price and ease of use it's a good little machine. It is not a big cleaner, nor does it preform like one. It does seam like it will last a few years.
