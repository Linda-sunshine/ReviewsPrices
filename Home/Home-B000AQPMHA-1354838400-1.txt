review/summary: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!review/text: I've had mine for three days. THREE days! Already, the brewer handle won't close. It's now an expensive paperweight. (Don't lecture me about improper usage--I've had it 3 days & made 3 cups of coffee. There's nothing I've done wrong.) Called customer service & they ask a jillion completely irrelevant questions (name, e-mail, address, zip, etc.--seriously Keurig, can't you build a list of names to sell when we're NOT trying to get an answer for something?). No help at all. I'm going to return it & think long & hard about whether to replace it. A quick web search shows that this may be a fairly common problem with this unit. What a complete waste of money!
