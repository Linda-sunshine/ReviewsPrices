review/summary: Wootreview/text: For a simple skillet this one rocks. Worth the money and makes my food taste delicious :) To take care of it I rub oil on the inside when not in use. Don't scrub with a lot of soap and water. It's best to clean with a rag under warm water. Be sure to dry off completely of water.
