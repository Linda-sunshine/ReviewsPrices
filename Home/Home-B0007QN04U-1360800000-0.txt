review/summary: You get what you are willing to pay forreview/text: I'm a regular guy, meaning I might be considered dangerous in a kitchen. My domain lies solely with the BBQ. Thought I should start this review with this honest disclaimer.All I can say regarding the KitchenAid 600 is a happy wife brings a happy life! She loves the extra power provided in the 600 Series. She makes some wonderful stuff that calls for some pretty heavy dough. I've noted that the mixer is remarkably quiet given its size and power.I strongly recommend you also purchase the Side Swipe mixing paddle. The steel mixing paddle that comes with the mixer is needed for very heavy mixes but it does not work nearly as well as the Side Swipe paddle on lighter mixes. The main advantage of the Side Swipe paddle is that it skims the side of the mixing bowl, you never have to stop the mixer to push any accumulations normally stuck on the bowl walls during the mixing process as you do need to do using the standard steel paddle that comes with the machine. The kitchen foreman told me she really appreciates this addition to the whole package.One last tip...keep the box the mixer comes in. The mixer is so large it's not something that most people would keep on the counter and the size does not lend itself to placement in most kitchen cabinets I'm familiar with. You'll appreciate having the original, sturdy box it comes in for storage when it's not in actual use.Sorry I can't offer more information than what I've provided here...my kitchen VISA is fairly limited by she who must be obeyed. All I know with certainty is that&#34;she&#34; absolutely loves her new mixer.
