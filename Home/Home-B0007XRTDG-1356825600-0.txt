review/summary: Great!review/text: I have it a 5/5 because it has worked perfect for me since I received it a few weeks ago. No complaints here. We had a older range top/stove top at our house and it pretty much only had 3 temperature setting (obviously very annoying to cook on). So I invested in this electric skillet to have some sort of temperature control when cooking foods. And like I said, it performs fantastically!
