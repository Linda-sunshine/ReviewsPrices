review/summary: If only it could lastreview/text: This was the second time buying this little vacuum. The first one broke off right at the neck when I was not home. I just thought someone may have mishandled it so I bought another one. Too bad same thing happened to the second one after 7 months of usage. I now believe its a product defect. It is such a wonderful little vacuum when using it. great on both hardwood and area rug. I love that I only use one item for clean ups. I have 2 toddlers and that guarantees the house is messy almost all the time. With this little vac, I was able to do quick clean ups. Its got great suction. After a month of so of using a dust mop and my big vacuum am back on Amazon shopping for another one. Hope the next one lasts.
