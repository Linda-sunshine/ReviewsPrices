review/summary: quiet and compactreview/text: Have been using this dehydrator almost exclusively on my bumper crop of tomatoes this past month. It is very quiet, I can keep it on my kitchen counter while its running and it takes somewhere between 8 and 12 hours to dry slices and halves or quarters depending on size of tomatoes. When I fill up the five trays, I get a full pint bag of dehydrated tomato slices :) Easy to clean (I don't have a dishwasher) and comes with everything you need. For less than $60 with free shipping, this costs as much as the inferior dehydrators sold at discount stores.
