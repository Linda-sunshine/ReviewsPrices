review/summary: Excellent Productreview/text: The tap water tastes awful where I live close to the Ocean. I bought this pitcher 4 months ago to see if it would work. Well it fits nicely in the fridge and the water taste great. The replacement filters are not too epensive either. Each filter lasts about 2 months with daily use.
