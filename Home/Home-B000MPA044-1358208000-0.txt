review/summary: This thing is amazing!!!review/text: Steak, chicken, pork chops, beef stew, chicken and dumplings.......it is so easy and tastes amazing! I made beef stew in about 40 with prep and all and the meat just fell apart! I don't even cook and I made BEEF STEW???? We have cooked several whole chickens and they just fall aprt when you pick it up. I had to fish some of the bones out of the chicken broth. I have a family of five and we all love this thing. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my wife and it was not even something she asked for.....SHE LOVES IT!!!!!!
