review/summary: AH-MAZING!!!review/text: I detest soft water and I think that's what I have at this apartment. I can barely rinse after brushing my teeth the water tastes so awful. I had zero expectations that this pitcher/filter would have any effect, but was I ever surprised. I can now drink water at home!!!! I was seriously contemplating taking empty water bottles with me to work to fill them up, but this pitcher saved me. The water tastes great! THANK YOU, BRITA!!!!
