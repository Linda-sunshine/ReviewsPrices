review/summary: Better than the restreview/text: We got this after going through multiple other blenders. We use immersion blenders a lot to blend baby food, soups etc. Looks like finally we found something that works and lasts. It's been half a year of frequent use, and it's going strong so far. We never disassemble it, so I'm not worried about plastic gears, no problems with them so far.
