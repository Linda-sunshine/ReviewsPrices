review/summary: Retro Perfectionreview/text: First, there are no Cons. I wanted a coffee maker that made excellent coffee. I didn't want bells and whistles. It's programmable and that was the only thing I cared about. It's sleek, doesn't take up much space and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a serviceable coffee maker.
