review/summary: Pre Seasoned way to go!!review/text: had a few cast iron pans - Lodge is the way to go and preseasoned makes your life a lot easier - I like this one - can't say i will use it for everything - but it is the way to sear and cook a steak if you want it brown on outside and rare on inside - i like this one
