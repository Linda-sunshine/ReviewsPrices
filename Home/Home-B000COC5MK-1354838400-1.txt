review/summary: from excellent to awful.review/text: I purchased this wine opener a little over a year ago and for the price I have been amazed at how well it has worked. Then, while opening a bottle of wine, the cork came out which left it up inside the chamber......and died. So I called Oster customer service for advice on how I might get the cork out. First, there was about a ten minute discussion about what kind of cork it was. She could not grasp that a cork cork is made of, guess what, CORK and anything else is an artificial cork. Once we got over that hurdle the best she could offer was a replacement at a "discounted" price which with shipping came to more than I had paid through Amazon. SO, I would rate the operation of the Oster 5 stars up to the date that it died; Osters' customer service would rate about a -3 and will now give me an apportunity to try the Emerson which Consumers Report says is also excellent and maybe they even have a better customer service department.
