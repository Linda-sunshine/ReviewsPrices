review/summary: Excellent quality!review/text: This is a well-made cast iron Dutch Oven of excellent quality! Lodge Logic has a great reputation and is well-known for making great cast iron products. I am very pleased with this item, it is nice and heavy and should last a 100 years if I treat it right. Even if pre-seasoned, you should season it some more as suggested. Never let it dry on its own or just towel dry it, you need to heat it up a little, either on a stove burner for a couple minutes or in a heated oven, to keep it from rusting. Rubbing a little cooking oil into the finish will help to season it and keep it from rusting, also. Take good care of it and it will take care of your cooking needs very well. These items are made to last forever and pass down to your descendants. It is a great price for it, too. It was packaged well and received with no problems. I can highly recommend it.
