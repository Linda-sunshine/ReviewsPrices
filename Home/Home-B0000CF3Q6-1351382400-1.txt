review/summary: love this espresso makerreview/text: My only regret is that I didn't buy the bigger one. Great espresso and so easy. Much better, in my opinion, than a machine. I had one of those and it didn't make the best coffee. Plus this little pot doesn't take up much counter space. I wish I would have bought one years ago.
