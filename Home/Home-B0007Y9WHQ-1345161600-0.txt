review/summary: AMAZING LITTLE GADGET!review/text: I just received and used this gadget for the first time last night. It was fun and easy to use, easy to clean, and I couldn't be happier! I made zucchini "spaghetti" which I then soaked in hot water to soften a bit, before serving with homeade spaghetti sauce, meatballs and mozzarella cheese. I found the zucchini "pasta" delicious and more filling than regular pasta, so I was done after a bowl full, and felt completely satisfied. This surprised me since I expected it to be less filling, like a salad. Nope! I can't wait to try some other veggies, and I will definitely continue to use zucchini as an alternative to pasta, since I'm trying to follow the Primal Blueprint diet which has me avoiding processed foods, flour, sugar and grains. I was skeptical about this product, but after using it once, I was truly thrilled. Definitely worth $35.
