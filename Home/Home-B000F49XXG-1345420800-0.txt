review/summary: Strictly espressoreview/text: This machine makes an excellent cup of espresso. A 15 bar machine that costs under $100, it is an excellent value. This is the fourth EC155 that I have bought. The first 3 lasted 2-3 years each before developing leaks that made them unusable. Since the machine takes up a minimum of counter space and produces espresso at an acceptable speed it suits me well. Due to the limited height of the space for a cup, I cannot use my regular espresso cups (think Capt. Picard of Star Trek cups). I use two short cups and if I want a less intense cup, I use a long draw. I make about 20-25 cups a week.The machine maintenance is a bit tricky and time consuming. There is a hidden screen above the filter assempby that needs to be cleaned every 150-300 cups. It requires a short screw driver to get the screen out. The filter assembly screen needs to be cleaned every 25-50 cups and a spring valve in the filter assembly should be checked weekly to make sure it is free moving. A decalcifier should be used according to the manufacturers directions. Even with all of this, my prior machines started to leak and became unusable after 2 plus years. Since the machine is relatively inexpensive and makes an excellent cup of espresso, I have resigned myself to replacing the machine periodically. I have also contacted DeLonghi for help when the machine stopped working and found their technical people knowledgeable and helpful, even when the machine was out of warranty.
