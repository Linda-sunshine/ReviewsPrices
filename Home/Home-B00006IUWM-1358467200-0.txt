review/summary: Valuable Great Toolreview/text: I've used the Presto a couple of times. Very good product. I don't understand those who say the motor is under-powered. If anything, you need to be careful, as others have noted, about not over-sharpening, and thereby taking off too much. Since the wheels are recessed, you can't see the blade as you draw it across. Follow the instructions and don't sharpen too often and your knives should be fine. It's important to hone knives on a sharpening steel in between electric sharpening.
