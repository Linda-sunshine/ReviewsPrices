review/summary: Good for thinner liquidsreview/text: This thing is pretty great. Very easy to clean. No complicated parts. It is very powerful. I used it to make a bean dip in 5 min and had no extra dishes to clean up. The only problem I have found with it is it will get very hot after prolonged use. I was worried when I began to smell plastic! It still works great and now I know to be more careful when using it for a longer period of time.
