review/summary: Junk Crap Garbage - Did I mention JUNK???review/text: More disappointed than I can say. I NEEDED this tool for a very expensive chestnut soup - $22 for the chestnuts alone. Used it TWICE when that GD plastic piece stripped out having hung up on some some piece of something or another. Whatever it was, it was vegetable and had simmered for hours. It died in a second. The design of this product is really strange - substantial shaft and blade, good beefy motor and then this CRAPPY PIECE OF SSSSS plastic Connector?? It makes no sense at all. Why would a company willingly sabotage their own product? Everything else in the machine seems well-built and made to last.I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like crying - my well thought out project is destroyed because I trusted an appliance made by a company whose name has been synonymous with quality for all of my adult life. The motor is still sound as is the blade and shaft, but the appliance is dead as dead can be. I said I felt like crying - but I AM crying from frustration and from feeling like a total tool for trusting Cuisinart to live up to its name. I've been HAD - be warned.
