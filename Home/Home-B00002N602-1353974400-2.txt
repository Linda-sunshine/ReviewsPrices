review/summary: Well crafted modelreview/text: I love pressure cookers. This one is stainless steel, had to replace my old one to work on my new induction range. I cook alot and a pressure cooker saves energy. I use for beans, potatoes, and artichokes and it takes so much less time. It is easy on the wrists ; easier to lift, easy to seal and vent may be tipped away from me to relase pressure instead of dousing with water.Nice model.
