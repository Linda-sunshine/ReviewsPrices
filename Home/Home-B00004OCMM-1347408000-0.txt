review/summary: It opens cans. What else do you want?review/text: I had a "Clean-edge" can opener that work for its first 90 days, then couldn't open a can of soup without going around it three times and then prying it up with a butter knife.So, I replaced it with this, the OXO Steel Can Opener. It opens cans. Every time, on the first pass around the rim, it opens the can. That's the first requirement for a can opener, after all, isn't it? If something feels like heaven in the palm of your hand and is scented like fresh roses, but won't open a can, then it's a failure as a can opener.This one is not.It is also better than the average can opener, because it does have a more comfortable grip and a wider turn-knob for opening. Now, I don't open a dozen cans a day. I open one or two a day, so I'm not really stressed about how this would feel after hours of use. I do know that there is no dread after working with other things of "Oh, bother, that can opener hurts." Ergonomics-wise, it's a plus.Appearance? I chose not to frame my can opener to keep it on display, because it just wasn't beautiful enough for that. I keep it in a drawer, instead. Not because it's ugly but because it's a utensil and I just do not care if a guest who is present while I'm opening a can has nothing better to say than "Ooh, pretty can opener!" We bought a nice-looking mixer because it's out all the time. The can opener's not ugly, but I can't bring myself to care about that either way.It's a good can opener.
