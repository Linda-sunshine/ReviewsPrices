review/summary: Please, has any reviewer actually used this product?review/text: I cannot believe anyone who uses this product would find it suitable for anything, let alone its intended purpose.As far as I can tell, it fails miserably in all the things it claims to be and do:- It is FRACKING IMPOSSIBLE to clean. You're likely to scatter crap all over your counter and floor no matter how carefully you try, before you actually succeed in cleaning any single one of the parts. Some of the parts and surfaces are simply unreachable.- The grinder heats up the beans you grind A LOT. I know because the most important moving parts on the burrs are soft, meltable plastic and after just a couple of uses, they started to melt.- It does not seem to be able to do anything more than a coarse grind. It just doesn't do fine. Even on coarse, after a few of the beans get ground, it gums up and just stirs the beans, and nothing more comes out.- It is FREAKISHLY LOUD. I'm sorry, but if anyone thinks this grinder is quiet, they may be in need of a hearing aid.- Did I mention it is slow?- To run the grinder, you have to set a short fixed little timer, and if you need to stop it for any reason you must pull the plug and wait for the timer to run out.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE save yourself the trouble and look for a different device. This is by far the WORST value in a product I've EVER purchased on Amazon.
