review/summary: Mildew Collectorreview/text: I empty and refill this humidifier once per day when I use it if my son is ill. It works great except that little black dots of mold/mildew are a guarantee and the only way to get rid of it is with bleach because you cannot physically scrub away the mildew in the tank since the opening is so small. Plus, mildew accumulates around the little handle on top, and even with a toothpick it is impossible to completely remove. I plan to buy a humidifier that I can scrub since I do not like to use such harsh cleaners in my home. The mildew problem is not helped by the fact that the humidifier is nearly impossible to get completely dry. I let it sit for days before putting it away in storage to give it a chance to dry, which is annoying because it is just sitting on the counter looking like clutter.
