review/summary: No more plasticreview/text: Plastics aren't always good for us. Some plastics release toxins when they are heated up. My coffee maker broke and I decided to try going a little more primitive. I need to take the complication out of life and I decided to start with my morning coffee.Its all stainless steel, which I like a lot. It comes with a plastic top but I bought the glass top alternative. I think it makes 8 cups. I need to play with it and see how much actually grounds need to be used, since this doesn't obviously operate like a coffee maker.Its got a nice outward look to it too.
