review/summary: Lodge is the very best!review/text: Lodge is the best for cast iron products. This round griddle is more versatile than first appears, at least to us. Consistent heat, and the Lodge method of curing the cast iron means easy care and lifetimes of use. Great for pancakes, tortillas, even sunny side up eggs! The low sides makes it easy to get the spatula under the food to turn it and the sides are just high enough to cook bacon easily and consistently. We have had Lodge cast iron cookware, including their excellent Wok, for many years. Our grand-kids will be cooking on it for many of their years.Last but not least; one of the greatest health advantages of cast iron cookware is the lack of the plastics (Teflon) that are finally being revealed as health hazards in our society today. Well maintained cast iron produces nothing but great taste and longevity!
