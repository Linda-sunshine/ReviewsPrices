review/summary: Perfection at last!review/text: I've been searching for a really nice set of sheets for years. I've purchased many sets, usually spending around $40, and have always wound up a little disappointed. This time, after reading all the rave reviews, I decided to splurge on a $65 set up Pinzon Signature 190-Gram queen sheet set. I couldn't have made a better purchase! They are super soft, yet feel well made, and have a nice weight to them. The Chamois color is very nice, and compliments my taupe duvet set and curtains. My girlfriend and I love these sheets, and will definitely be purchasing a second set. I've stayed at a number of 5-star hotels, but we both agree they are the nicest sheets we've ever slept on. Highly recommended!
