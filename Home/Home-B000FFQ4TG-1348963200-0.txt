review/summary: Good coffee but---review/text: I agree with other reviews, Bunn does give a delicious cup of coffee, the down side is the coffee potThere just is no way to pour coffee without spilling it all over the counter. I have tried a fast pour and a slow pour and stillGet a mess. Maybe the design guys could go back to the drawing board and come up with a better design, I would buyA replacement pot that does not leave a coffee mess around my cupSharon
