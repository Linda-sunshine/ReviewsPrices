review/summary: All lids do not fit snugglyreview/text: On one of the pieces there is NOT an airtight seal. The lid is way too big.On two of the pieces the lid fits but it's not very secure. If I put this container in my bag I'd be worried the cover would pop off and the contents would spill out.On the other pieces the lid fits tightly.I am going to contact the company about getting new covers.
