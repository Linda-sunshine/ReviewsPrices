review/summary: incredible suction...review/text: I've had this canister vac for seven months now and I love it. My upright's attachments weren't cutting it when it came to pet hair but this gem has amazing suction power. I love it and highly recommend it. And my two cents.... any issues with the hose (as I've read in reviews here) seems to point towards a usage issue. If you use it properly and don't let the hose twist excessively, it's a non-issue in my opinion. I've used this vac daily for seven months.
