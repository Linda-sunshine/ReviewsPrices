review/summary: Great product, incredible price.review/text: I've owned this cleaner for over a year. I've used it many times and it has always been very effective for routine cleaning of carpets and upholstery. All its functions have been very easy to use but I have occasionally needed the manual when making mode changes. Overall, a great product.
