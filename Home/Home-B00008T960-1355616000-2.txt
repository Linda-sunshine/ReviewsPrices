review/summary: Silpat Non-Stick Matreview/text: I bought 2 and I'm going to buy 2 more. These are the best! I just wipe with a damp cloth and put away. The cookie sheet I just wipe with a damp cloth and put away. I wish I had these years ago. Would of made my baking sooo easy. I can honestly say you will not be sorry if you buy at least 1. You will be as happy as I was. So easy to use. I sure hope this helps.
