review/summary: SAFETY HAZARD!review/text: Sadly almost 1 year after purchasing this coffee maker it burnt up, thankfully I was home and unplugged it before it caught the house on fire. I have always been very careful to turn it off after each use(even though it has auto shut off). Until today I loved this coffee maker, it makes great coffee and it looks really nice on the counter. The lid snaps on which is both a blessing and curse because it doesn't spill down the sides when pouring a cup of coffee but to clean and fill the pot you have to take the lid off completely. It's nearly impossible to see how much water is inside once poured in but that didn't matter to me because I made the same amount every time. I am almost tempted to get the replacement pot from cuisinart since it's still under warranty but as nice of a coffee maker as it was I don't think its worth it to risk losing my house. Unless you want to babysit your coffee maker and only leave it plugged in while watching it brew I wouldn't recommend this pot. After this happened today I found all kinds of reports of cuisinart coffee makers catching fire, just search it on google, I can't believe they haven't fixed this major problem yet!
