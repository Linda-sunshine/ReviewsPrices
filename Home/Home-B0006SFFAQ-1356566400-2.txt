review/summary: Nice, until it stops workingreview/text: I have now had two of these machines, each for about a year, and then they just stop working. They are great while they last, but I think a one year lifespan is too short for the price. Also, i'd prefer a window to show the water level; looking into a black reservoir to see how much water you're pouring is not ideal.
