review/summary: Currently occupying the rear of the junk drawerreview/text: Ordered this thermometer to take advantage of more precise digital temps, but overall found that a standard old fashioned thermometer is better at this price point.There are two major cons with this unit in my opinion.1. Takes a fair amount of time to register the temperature. My understanding is you can buy more expensive digital units which register the meat temp very quickly, this is not one of those.2. Breaks or runs out of battery juice fairly quickly. This should draw little power and I would expect to last years and years on a battery. But mine died within a year.So, since this is no faster at registering temp than an old fashioned thermometer and is more likely to fail, I don't see a reason to use this over one.
