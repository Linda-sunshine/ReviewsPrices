review/summary: Love this Hello Kitty humidifier!review/text: I'm a big Hello Kitty fan so when it was time to get a humidifier, I immediately thought of the adorable Hello Kitty one I had seen in the past. Now that I have it, I love it. It works great and is very easy to use. I love the little nightlight on it too. We have a little one who gets up to nurse during the night so it's nice to have that little bit of glow to be able to see. Would definitely recommend this to any Hello Kitty fan in need of a humidifier!
