review/summary: Juice Founatinreview/text: I bought this juicer Dec 2011 and used it sporadically. At the beginning it worked really well and it seemed like a great deal for the price paid. I tried to use it few days ago and found out that it leaves big chunks of fruit and vegetable unprocessed. Since then we tried to switch between soft and hard vegetables/fruit, clean thoroughly all pieces, but that did not make any difference. All together we used this juicer between 15-20 times and it already does not work as it should. I am very disappointed and would not buy this product again. I'll try to contact the manufacturer.Breville BJE200XL Compact Juice Fountain 700-Watt Juice ExtractorI am updating this review with my experience with Breville. Since my juicer was under warranty I contacted customer service and explained the problem. They asked for the pictures of the filter and asked that I soak filter in vinegar for 10 min and clean thoroughly. I did not believe that filter was clogged but I followed their instructions and then tested juicer again. It did not make any difference so I sent them pictures of leftover unprocessed pieces of fruits and vegetables. They asked then that I soak it in cascade solution at which point I declared that my filter was clean and if they really believed that I did not know how to clean filter well I was willing to try a completely new filter.They sent a new filter; I tested it and got same results, took pictures and sent them back to them. They agreed to replace the juicer, but it was unclear why the new filter with the new blade did not make any difference. Week ago we got a new juicer, same model, and all I can tell is we still have few pieces of unprocessed fruit, but much less than we had with the 9 month old juicer. How long this will last I do not know, but as I concluded before, I would not recommend this model to anyone.
