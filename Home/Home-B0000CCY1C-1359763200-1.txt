review/summary: Finally found itreview/text: I have the larger scoop and always wanted a smaller one. Every time I found one it was the same size I had which is perfect for filling up cupcakes or super size cookies. I wanted a smaller one because I also have the mini cupcake machine and thought it would be just the right fill (Don't have the machine, you should get it.). Never thought I would get so excited over a scoop. It is very well made and love the handle grips
