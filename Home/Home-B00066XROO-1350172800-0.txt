review/summary: great griddlereview/text: Works Great, I can cook pancakes, eggs, and sausage for 5 people in less time than it takes me to mix the pancake batter.It cleans up easily. Only minor complaint, because it is so large, it makes storing it a little difficult. Over all very glad I bought it.
