review/summary: Much better than expectedreview/text: This is my first time ever writing a product review but I felt compelled to do one for this juicer because I have been so impressed by it. I am new to juicing and wanted something that was affordable, easy-to-use, and quick to clean. I have had it for a few weeks now and have used it almost every day. It takes less than 15 minutes for me to prep my veggies, make my juice, and clean up the juicer. What a great way to get more fruits and veggies into my diet!
