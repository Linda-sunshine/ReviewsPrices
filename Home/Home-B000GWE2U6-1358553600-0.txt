review/summary: Headless Penguin Okreview/text: I really liked the design, and the Crane seemed rated well, but when the penguin head is attached it's hard to see any vapor coming out even at full blast. Take the head off, and it works fine. Not sure if the other 'heads' have the same issue. Fortunately this one looks fine without the head on.
