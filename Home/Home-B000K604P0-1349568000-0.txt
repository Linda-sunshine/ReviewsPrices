review/summary: Wonderful Tumbler for travelreview/text: Tossed around in my backpack on various trips and have never had a spill. My only complaint is that it keeps contents so hot i typically burn my mouth. Definitely one of the best complaints I could have for a tumbler. I'm very happy after trying out numerous thermoses from REI (not stating anything about REI thermoses) and returning them all for leaking. I'm very particular and store my computer in my back pack so leaking coffee cannot happen.
