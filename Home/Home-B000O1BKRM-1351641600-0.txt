review/summary: not crazy about themreview/text: The problem with these trays is that it's harder to get the ice cubes out of them compared to conventional trays, and since the cubes are the same size, there really isn't a benefit. Well, it is easier to get one cube out at a time, where with regular trays you have to dump them all out at once. I prefer the larger cubes that Tovolo offers.
