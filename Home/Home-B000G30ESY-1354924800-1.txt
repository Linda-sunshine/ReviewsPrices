review/summary: Confusing but goodreview/text: This cooker works well after you decipher the instructions, which is not a trivial task. One would hope that operating a rice cooker would not require a doctorate in rocket science, but alas, this is not the case. The displays and buttons do begin to make sense after a while, but be prepared for some confusion before enjoying mounds of delicious rice. One nice feature is that you can set it up in the morning to be ready when you arrive home for dinner.
