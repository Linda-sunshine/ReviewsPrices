review/summary: Farberware's replacementreview/text: After many years of using the Farberware electric percolators, I ran into the problem of age -- when they grow old, they seem to stop brewing long enough, and replacing the thermostats didn't work. Rather than pursuing ever-more garage-sale percolators, I got this Presto, expecting the light, flimsy "imitation Farberware" coffee makers I remembered.The Presto is, though, surprisingly hefty, with apparently high quality stainless steel. The mesh coffee holder itself is light aluminum, as is the internal lid, but the main housing is a good steel as is the cap. The tube/tray support is heavy stainless steel. The cable appears to be Farberware-standard and the coffee is good and strong, which is really the important thing.The pot comes with a bunch of filters, which seems odd; they are completely unnecessary unless you want every last drop to be completely free of grounds.Overall, this coffee maker was a serious happy surprise.
