review/summary: Incredible!!review/text: I got this hand-held vacuum Christmas (2012) as a present off of my Wish List. I had requested it as I am a more petite woman who has issues trying to lug a large vacuum up the stairs, attempting to sweep stairs as I walk it up. I needed something that could handle pet hair, as we have light cream carpets and a medium-haired black dog who sheds a good amount. I also needed something that wasn't super heavy to hold while using it.I can say that I am INCREDIBLY HAPPY with this gift! This is, no doubt, the best hand-held vacuum I have ever used before. It's not too heavy to carry, is easy to clean out and is pretty easy to adjust the bar position to sweep the back of the stairs. As far as suction and actual vacuuming go, this little hand-hand rivals even my larger (and much more expensive) stand-up sweeper. I've taken to using it, versus my main sweeper, in my areas that need a little extra attention. As a side note, all of my stand-up sweeper extensions (a non-Eureka sweeper) also work on this hand-held, which makes it even better!This Eureka Hand-Held is a GREAT vacuum. And for the price that Amazon.com offers it, it's a no-brainer for anyone who is looking for a supplemental vacuum.Pros:- Incredible, Powerful Suction- Not too Heavy- Easy to Clean Out (Bagless)Cons:- NONE!This Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum is ideal for:- Stair sweeping- Smaller spaces- Areas that need more attention- Furniture- Garages
