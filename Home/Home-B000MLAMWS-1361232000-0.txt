review/summary: Very good mixerreview/text: Bought this for my daughter for Christmas, however, the beater, no matter how much it is cleaned, continues to make her dishrag and towel grey. Wish they had the one that came with my mixer I bought 30 years ago. No problem with mine, but the brand new one ... bummer.
