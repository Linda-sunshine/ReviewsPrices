review/summary: WORKS GREAT! GREAT VALUE! LOW-TECH! BUY IT!review/text: This slicer is the first thing that comes out when the veggies start coming in the door. My husband went to Publix a week ago and found 3 zuchinni for $2.99...SO, I received 4 boxes of veggies from the local farmer's market to process for this fall and winter's food requirements. We love soups of every kind so I dehydrate a lot of veggies, package them in vacuum seal-a-meals and put them in the freezer. i have a cuisiniart DC-10 that is a fossil but has 10 slicer discs with it and I STILL get this thing out for a quick work on a couple of dehydrator trays. I rinse the thing off and heck, this is my third season of use! What more can you ask? Well, it has a couple of different slicers with it, but more would be useful. Also it is low on the counter and could have used a little higher legs so the slices won't pile up underneath and you can slice more at one whack... that said, its a 9-1/2 out of a 10 in my book.I hope this helps.
