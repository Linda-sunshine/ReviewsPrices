review/summary: Sucks wellreview/text: This dirt devil first gave me a bad first impression. For the cost and for the size I figured what possibly can this do? But I'm financially limited and the carpet area isn't large. So I went with it. Boy does it suck well. It couldn't do a better job if it was a 10 year veteran lady of the night with a dust mite fetish. It's got the power to succeed in life and take it's graduate careers to vortex success. 5/5 Stars
