review/summary: Very Happyreview/text: I've had this brewer for about a month now and wonder how I did without it.The coffee tastes so fresh my husband is even raving about it. All I can say is if you try one you'll never go back to drip again.I use distilled water [ours is too hard] haven't had any problems. Thank Keurig,wish it didn't take me so long to find you.
