review/summary: Why did I just discover this?!review/text: I need more of these. This is the greatest invention of all time. Thank you Amazon for suggesting it. I am known to forget to spray a pan before baking thereby causing the pan to become mutilated--well no more of that! This is so easy to drop onto a pan and nothing sticks. I use it for baking all sorts of things--chicken, fries, cookies. I highly recommend it for people who love to bake.
