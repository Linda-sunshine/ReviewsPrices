review/summary: Great for any system that uses standard Folgers coffee podsreview/text: I bought this for my CV1 single cup maker & they fit perfectly. It also fits in the Cuisinart single cup brew basket just fine. Based on the size, if you use any of the coffee makers that use the round Folgers coffee pods or similar round pods, these should work just fine.
