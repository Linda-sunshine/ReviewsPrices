review/summary: Excellent, reliable, no-nonsense unitreview/text: I'm not a big fan of frou-frou, of over-engineered products, adding unnecssary complications, features, and cost. This coffee grinder, for me, represents the ideal: It works perfectly, reliably for a long time, looks great, is simple to use, and inexpensive.
