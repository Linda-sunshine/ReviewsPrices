review/summary: Love this little machine!review/text: This is the best product we have purchased for our kitchen in years! It's so easy to make homemade ice cream in less than 45 mintues from beginning to eating. We add fresh fruit such as diced peaches or strawberries to the simple vanilla recipe which is included with the ice cream maker. My husband no longer wants store bought ice cream. As long as we have whole milk, cream, sugar and pure vanilla extract on hand, delicious ice cream is just 45 minutes away. Clean up is so easy and the machine is small enough to store away until the next time. I would definitly recommend this product to anyone who loves home made ice cream.
