review/summary: GOOD SLICERreview/text: I broke two bones in right hand which is recovering very good due to my orthopedist,myself and homeopathy. I love salads and raw suerkraut. I have been watching my girlfriend use this salad shooter for a while. Finally I was able to use it with 1 1/2 hands and it is amazing. So easy to use . I did carrots, onions, apple, cucumber,cabbage with it so easy to with my handicapped status. I feel like they should put this with my ashes when I die. I am truly impressed. My girlfriends mother gave it to her kids and grand kids long time ago. Only if I knew about it earlier in my life. I hope it lasts for long time. A worthwhile gadget to have.
