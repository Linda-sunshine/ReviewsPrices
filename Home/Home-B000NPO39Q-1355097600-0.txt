review/summary: Willow Tree Nativityreview/text: My husband purchased the creche and the starter nativity set for me for Christmas and told me I could go ahead and get the other pieces on line because the local merchant didn't have the extra pieces. I have just received the three wiseman and I am awaiting the arrival of two stars, the shepherd and animals and the song of life angel. I marvel everytime I add a piece to my set. I look at it and my heart is filled with joy at the birth of our Savior and Lord, Jesus Christ. I am anxious to get the other pieces to complete my set. I will leave this out all year long as a reminder of what Christmas, and everyday, is really all about, and because I just love looking at it!
