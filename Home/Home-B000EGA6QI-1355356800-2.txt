review/summary: Great for soupreview/text: Love this thing. Easy to use, easy to clean. I bought it with the intention of using it for my favorite winter sweet potato soup. Our stock pot barely fit all the ingredients, and I hated, with a passion, having to dip out the veggies and pour them in the blender. Miserable. Made the soup this winter, and in less than 5 minutes I had perfectly pureed deliciousness.It also does double duty when I make homemade laundry soap. After the soap sets overnight, I pour it into a plastic water dispenser and use the blender to smooth it out so it dispenses properly. The blades clean easily, so I'm not worried about soap residue.
