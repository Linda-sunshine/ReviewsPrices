review/summary: Terrific without the higher cost of a food processorreview/text: While visiting my daughter I noticed she was using this product and liked it. I use to have a food processor, but used it mostly for pre work. This mini-prep works just as well and is less expensive.I would recommend this to any cook / chef!
