review/summary: So glad I picked this teapot!review/text: I recently switched to loose leaf herbal teas and the tea ball method just wasn't working for me. I agonized about what to get and I'm so glad I picked this teapot. It really is everything it's cracked up to be. It makes perfectly clear tea and works with any size cup or pitcher. I got the 32 oz teapot, by the way, and I'm glad I did. Because I make iced herbal tea in the summer, this teapot will allow me to make a few servings at a time. You don't have to fill it all the way up if you don't want that much. Plus, at the time I bought it, the 32 oz was actually cheaper than the 16 oz.I couldn't justify dropping a star but I do have two tiny quibbles: 1. I wish it were made of glass. The plastic is BPA-free so I was willing to make an exception, but in general I don't prefer to put hot food in plastic. 2. The comment someone else made about not being able to see how full your mug is getting (unless it's glass) is true and it's not ideal. However, if you use the same size mug every time you could figure out how much water to put in and even mark it on the side of the teapot so that it is the right amount for your mug. Then you wouldn't have to check mid-stream. It's not a big deal, though...really, it isn't.
