review/summary: Love this item!review/text: Fell in love with thermos while visiting family in Florida during holidays. My niece gave me her thermos one morning filled with juice and ice cubes at 10am before we headed out on errands for the day. After dinner that early evening, the thermos still had ice cubes! I immediately ordered one for me to take to/fro work. It keeps my coffee or tea hot all day. Love it though found it to be pricey so only can rate it 4 stars.
