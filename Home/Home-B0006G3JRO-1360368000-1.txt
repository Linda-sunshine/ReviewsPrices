review/summary: Not long lastingreview/text: I have had this blender for a few years and only used it once in awhile. The gears that hold the attachments have stripped out and the blender no longer works properly. I suspect that the chopper is what did it in. I'm giving it two stars because while it was working it was fine for blending things like soup. I contacted Cuisinart and learned that it's not repairable. If I purchase another stick blender I'll probably just get the blender and skip the attachments.
