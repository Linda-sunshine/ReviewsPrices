review/summary: Awesome! Easy to use and to clean!review/text: This is my first juicer ever...after trying some fresh vegetable juice at a friend's place awhile back it has always been on my 'to buy list', however never quite pulled the trigger so to speak until recently. I bought this juicer based on the overwhelming number of positive reviews it received in comparison to the many others on the market. I have absolutely no regrets with this baby. This juicer is very easy to operate, I never looked at the instructions even once and used my common sense to assemble, use, and clean....very simple. This thing really does a good job extracting the juice from the fruits and veggies. My only minor complaint about this item is the little 'funnel' (I guess I'll call it) that pours from the juicer into the container it comes with is a bit short. It would be nice if the funnel was about another quarter to half inch bigger just so that if the juicer moves a bit while your grinding your fruits and veggies you'll know it cause the juice will start running on your counter and you'll have to quickly push it back in. This happened to me the first couple times I used it until I learned to keep it in place a little better as I'm adding my ingredients. Like I said, minor flaw in my opinion easy fix if you just pay attention to what your doing or if your creative maybe you can even rig something up to extend the funnel.
