review/summary: Nordic Ware Microwave Egg Bolierreview/text: I just gave it three stars because I found the top hard to get off and gets too hot to mess with. I really wouldn't recommend buying one. I had rather boil my eggs on the stove as always. I'm giving one to my girlfriend for Christmas anyway, she might have better luck with hers than I did mine. I just thought it would be a faster way for her to boil eggs to take to work.
