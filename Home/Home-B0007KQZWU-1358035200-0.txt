review/summary: wonderful !!!!review/text: These are by far the BEST pans I have ever bought.!!! I don't get too excited about writing reviews but had to do this one. These are such good quality and easy to cook with. Stainless steel has to be used differently than teflon coated pans and as long as you are aware of that you will love these. Oil is needed of course but these will last forever and cook so evenly. I got them at a good price and they are worth every penny!!!
