review/summary: A great kitchen applicancereview/text: I lived in the UK for 7 years, and evey home had one of these kettles. They are great for making tea or instant coffee. I use them to boil water as they are much quicker than using the stove. This kettle looks nice, but seems to take a bit longer to boil than normal. This is because the heating element is not located directly with the water. The con is that it takes longer to boil. The pro is that you don't have the element in direct contact with the water which can cause a scaley buildup on the coil. This one is much easier to clean. I am happy with the purchase.
