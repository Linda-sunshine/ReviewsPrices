review/summary: Worked great!review/text: I wanted a shower caddy that didn't rust. I was going to get a stainless caddy, and pay the extra cost, but saw this plastic caddy, and the great reviews. I liked the smaller size, because I didn't want the soap dish. The only downside, is that it doesn't fit the extra large bottles. Plus the bottles that have odd shapes don't fit in well. I would save the smaller bottles, and fill them.Another reviewer suggested using a soft scrub sponge, and cleaning the shower wall carefully to get rid of all soap scum. Let it dry, use the rubbing alcohol pad and let that dry. The wall needs to be totally dry for the strips to stick. I have a vinyl wall, that is textured, and this tip worked great. The holders have been up for a week so far, with no trouble.Great product, better than the chrome, cheaper than stainless, and you can put as many as you need in the shower, so everyone can have their own caddy.
