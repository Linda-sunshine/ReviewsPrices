review/summary: Red Flame Gel Fuel..review/text: If you want a clean burn, no odor, little heat, nice sound, and looks good, then you want these for your portable fire place. It looks good burning, sounds crispy like a real wood fire, actually puts off a little heat, so nice and warming standing next to it.. We love REal Flame Gel Fuel, been using it for years, and always order it off of Amazon.com with our Prime subscription.
