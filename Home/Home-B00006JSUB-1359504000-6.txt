review/summary: The best way to cookreview/text: Over the past 5 years I have really gotten into cast iron cookware. It takes some getting used to, like needing to preheat, but a well seasoned skillet like this one should provide a great non stick surface for basically forever. Never wash it with soap, and always let them dry completely and put a light layer of oil for storing them. I rinse mine in the sink and scrape the big chunks of food off, then I place them on the stovetop on high to dry them thoroughly, then using a paper towel I put a very thin layer of bacon grease over the surface.
