review/summary: Best Christmas Giftsreview/text: We purchased several of these as Christmas gifts and everyone LOVES THEM!! Our parents have a hard time manually opening a bottle with a corkscrew so that was a selling feature for us. And my brother drinks a lot of wine, so the ease was a selling point for him. The Chiller was an added bonus for the price - amazing. Overall everyone seems to LOVE THEM.
