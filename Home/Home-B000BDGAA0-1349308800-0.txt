review/summary: firm...how about like a brick!review/text: I am sure, based on some reviews, that this product works for some,but not me. This "pillow" (I hesitate to call it a pillow) is extremely hard and not malleable at all. It gave me a sore neck and was uncomfortable beyond any other pillow I have tried.I will try taking out about half of the microbeads but I doubt it will matter.The worst product I have purchased through Amazon.Not recommended at all.
