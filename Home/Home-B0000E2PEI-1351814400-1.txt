review/summary: beautiful, sturdy, acuratereview/text: I gained 10 pounds the day I got this scale... not exactly happy news but at least I finally have an accurate weight....the glass is very thick, completely clear with a green polished edge...You do not have to do anything to activate the scale, just get on... it weighs the same each time from the first... also it holds the final weight for a little bit after you get off so if you need to weigh something that covers that number you'll still be able to see it...I would recommend this scale to anyone.... My mom has a different Taylor scale, we have had similar success with it. I would say this is a superior scale brand.
