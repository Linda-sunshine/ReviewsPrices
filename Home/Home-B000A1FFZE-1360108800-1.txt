review/summary: 5 years and still works like a proreview/text: I got this for my little apt with no counter space and Im so glad I did. It holds up and toasts really nice I still use it almost every other day. I just wish it came with an extra deeper tray I dont have the heart to get rid of it. I love this toaster my mini bagel buddy I call it
