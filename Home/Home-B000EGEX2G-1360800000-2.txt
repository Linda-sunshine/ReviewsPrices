review/summary: Cracked Frame in original AND replacementreview/text: For the 2 times I was able to use this glider, it was comfy and smooth. Then the frame cracked. Amazon quickly and easily replaced the glider. When I opened the box of the replacement, the frame was cracked in the same exact spot!
