review/summary: broke after using it three times!review/text: So I know this wasn't too much money, but I did expect to get more than 3 uses out of it. I personally don't drink coffee, so I bought this along with a french press for when I have coffee drinking company. Imagine my embarrassment when not only did it stop working, but also sent out quite a large spark when it did work! I nearly electrocuted my boyfriend! So I would not recommend this product at all, spend the few extra dollars it takes to buy a quality grinder. Or buy it for someone that you really don't like and want to give a jolt to.
