review/summary: Flat from day two.review/text: Got the bed. Cool concept. Used one night and couldn't keep air in It. I am 6' 200 lbs. No wild nights either. Only reason I won't return it is the hassle that outweighs the price. Bought a $35 inter from Target. While not as cool and requires out side air pump it held the air.
