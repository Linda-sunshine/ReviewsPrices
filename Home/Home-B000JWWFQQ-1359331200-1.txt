review/summary: 600 ct Sheetsreview/text: The quality of the material was very good, but the packaging, which had a zipper top, did not have a handle for the zipper, so I had to destroy the package to open it. Also, after the first washing, which I do before even using them,some sewing was already coming out of the bottom seam. So, the actual weave of the sheets is of a very good quality, which is comfortable to the skin, but the devil is in the details.
