review/summary: Great Can Openerreview/text: This is another great product from Cuis-nart. The only thing I would've liked better is if the outer shell were metal instead of plastic...it still looks metallic and I guess the plastic makes it lighter in weight...but I really would have preferred the durability of acutal stainless steel. Other than that, it works perfectly and is stylish enough to leave out on your counter and not hidden away in the cabinet.
