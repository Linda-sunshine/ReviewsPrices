review/summary: Easy to usereview/text: We purchased this coffee maker when our old faithful saw it's last day.Out of the box it was easy to set up and use. After running a couple of cycles with just water we put it to the test.The coffee stays hot in the carafe for quite a long time. The only complaint we had at first was that the lid was very difficult to take off (to pour the coffee), but we just don't put it on tight and it's fine. Overall it's a great coffee maker.
