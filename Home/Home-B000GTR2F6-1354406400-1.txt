review/summary: A "Prime" Disasterreview/text: I bought the Keurig B70 Platinum system about 6 weeks ago. Right out of the box, I had problems with the machine refilling after brewing. The "Prime" light would go on and then the "Add Water" light. At first, it would happen about every 5 brews and now it's every time I brew. I have to constantly remove the reservoir and put it back on 2 or three times before it will pull water to refill. Now what bugs me most is that it pulls water DURING the brew cycle every time, just not afterwards.I have contacted Kuerig and I have to say their customer service is outstanding. After a few troubleshooting tries (and failures), they immediately sent out another brewer. All I have to do is send back the K-cup holder,which is a small plastic piece that pops right out (just push from the bottom), to show the brewer is no longer in service. I have not received the new brewer yet as I just ordered it 2 days ago but after reading the reviews here, I'm not expecting any better results. We will see...On the plus side, it brews really delicious coffee (when it works) and is very easy to keep clean.
