review/summary: Mrs homemakerreview/text: I've been so pleased with my new DLC-2011CHB Prep 11 Plus 11-Cup Cuisinart, food processor! It replaced a smaller older version. All my former blades fit this new machine. It's larger size is a huge improvement. Foods chop quickly and evenly. I am aware that a puff of flour dust is given off when the blades start, so perhaps the seal could be tighter..but a non issue. Thanks!
