review/summary: Mind the Gapreview/text: As a designer and an owner of both a Bodum press and this Nissan one, I'd like to add a detail which may have not made it into most reviews.First, let me say I've had no problems with either of these, and I believe they are crafted with about the same amount of care, and materials are equivalent for price.The thing I suspect has led to so many complaints is misassembling the plunger after cleaning.The plate with the spring around the edge, meant to support the screen,can be put in upside down without difficulty.Unfortunately this causes a lack of proper support for the screen and makes it very difficult to push up or down.It also will bend and ruin the screen if used this way more than a few times.Nissan would be well advised to point this out in the product literature, but, as we see, so many things are sold without such detailed information now.As for having hot coffee ,this is a great revelation.But if the coffee is left for too long after pressing - say a half our by my taste-it will still be hot enough but very strong
