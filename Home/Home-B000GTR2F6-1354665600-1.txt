review/summary: Initial Impressions after 2 weeksreview/text: I was a bit concerned about poping for one of these after all the bad reviews I read about it online, however, so far, I am happy with my B70. So much so infact, that after making appx 60 cups with mineI purchased another for my son and his wife for Christmas. It has been flawless at making perfect cups of coffee with both K-cups and my own grinds (store ground and self ground)in the included adapter.I'm a very picky coffee drinker and have always used my own conical burr grinder and gourmet whole beans with a french press and 200 degree filtered water. The brews I get from the Keurig at 192 degrees and my favorite home ground whole beans are evry bit as good as I get from my french press. So far, I haven't had the slightest hint of any clogging as others have reported. I'll update my review if anything changes or after a year or so when I have an idea of the reliability. At 30 twelve oz cups a week on average, a year will be a good test for this machine.
