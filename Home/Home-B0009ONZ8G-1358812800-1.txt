review/summary: Cheap but effectivereview/text: I have owned it nine months. Family of five, including little kids and a dog, and a huge old house. It sucks up really well. The hose IS short and annoying, the brushes DO keep spinning, and it IS noisy. But it out cleans any other vacuum I have had except for my beloved Oreck, which I cannot afford to replace right now. This Hoover hoovers up everything but your cash.
