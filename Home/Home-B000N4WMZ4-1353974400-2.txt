review/summary: Happy purchasereview/text: Dutch oven arrived promptly, about 5 days. Was very happy to see that the knob on the lid was metal, not the black plastic. The metal knob will withstand higher oven temperatures than the plastic. No chips in lid or pot. Have not used it yet, but look forward to doing so.
