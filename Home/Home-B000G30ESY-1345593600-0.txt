review/summary: Our best cookware purchase so farreview/text: This product is great for us (2 adults + one toddler) because we can prepare healthier foods while we do other things around the house because the Micom technology prevents the food from burning.We have cooked all types of rice, steel cut oats, quinoa, barley, wheat berries, freekeh wheat with great results.If you are into Sushi this makes a perfect sushi rice.Nowadays for breakfast we put steel cut oats and water the night before and set the timer so it is cooked by 6 AM. It is nice to wake up and have a bowl of warm steel cut oaks with maple syrup and walnuts.The cup included in the box is about 3/4 of a regular cup. I have used normal cups (240 Ml) with the same water level settings and get the same results so nothing to worry if you lose that cup.
