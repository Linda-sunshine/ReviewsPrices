review/summary: Great Bread Machinereview/text: We use it to make different types of bread and buns and do it very often - every week or more. The product is great but finding parts through their site or telephone to Customer Service is difficult to unknown. E.g., on an older maching I wanted to replace the belt which is easy once you can find out how to remove the bottom - I found out how on a blog - but getting a new belt or finding out the part number is close to impossible from Sunbeam even if you can make it through the horrible telephone maze of misinformation to "Parts". Seems the only part they want to sell to you is the Bread Pan. The Parts person passed me off to another telephone number after saying she did not have the belt part number. Parts? Doesn't know?? Good thing that the machine is very good at making breads!
