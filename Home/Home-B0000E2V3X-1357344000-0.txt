review/summary: Love Made in the U.S.A.review/text: Thanks Lodge, for staying in America.You will learn how to season cast iron if you want to love this pan. Bacon, period. Lodge could do a better job addressing the problems with storage of cast iron. This is a large, heavy pan that now lives on the bottom rack of our oven, even when other things bake. Hope it's OK, but there is no other option. It makes the BEST pizza crust.
