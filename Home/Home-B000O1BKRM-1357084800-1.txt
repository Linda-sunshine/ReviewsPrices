review/summary: Great alternative to old fashion ice cube trays.review/text: They are easy to use and there is no worry about them breaking or shattering. They stack nicely in the freezer, taking up less space than traditional trays. They release easy from the tray after running them upside down under warm water. Not that this is a big selling point for me, but they come in several fun colors as well. In the world of automatic ice dispensers - this is a very nice alternative to repairing one that has broken down.
