review/summary: Awesomereview/text: After getting one for Christmas, and trying it out, I realized I needed a second one immediately. This is far better than the Pampered Chef pizza stone we used to use. Throw it in the oven while the oven pre-heats (500 deg), then add dough, sauce, cheese & toppings and cook 8-10 minutes. Perfect pizza every time. Crust has a nice brown bottom and the top is cooked perfectly. If you like making homemade pizza, this is the way to go. Now I just need a better method for transferring the dough to the hot pan and I'm all set.
