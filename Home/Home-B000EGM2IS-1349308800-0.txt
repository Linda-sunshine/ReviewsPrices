review/summary: Great Product, Long-Lastingreview/text: I bought an earlier model of the Sunbeam Hot Shot about TEN years ago, and it STILL works Great. I've used it at least 500 times a year since then.Use it if you need between Four and Ten Ounces of boiling hot water. It's ready in about 30 to 45 seconds.I don't know whether the current Sunbeam Hot Shots are the same quality. But my 10-year-old version is fantastic !
