review/summary: Great size for fridge, tight sealing lid as promisedreview/text: I bought this so I could cold brew coffee and so far I love it. It did take me a couple of uses to figure out the lid, but now that I get it, it's easy. Push down just a little on the edges and turn the middle for a hermetic seal. The size and shape ensures this jug fits nicely in my fridge. Wanted two of them, but waited to be sure. Now I can order the 2nd jug.
