review/summary: best shower holderreview/text: After trying two kinds of suction cup style holders that did not work and not being able to find a wire rack that fit our shower I finally tried this after reading the reviews. It has been the best. Easy to follow instructions; let it sit for 24 hours and it was good to go. Holds everything we need it to hold and shows no signs of slipping, sagging, or otherwise coming loose. I also got the soap dish and have since put a 2nd one of these in as well. Plenty of storage, great hold; highly recommended.
