review/summary: Can't Handle Smoothiesreview/text: The motor has the amps to grind frozen fruit into smoothies, which is more than you can say for 98% of the consumer blenders out there. But the carafe is not up to the task. The blade assembly fails where it passes through the base, leading to leaks at first and complete failure later. I've been through two carafes in two years (expensive replacement!), and now will have to move on to some other brand.This one will run forever if you're making baby food, but forget it if you grind frozen things.
