review/summary: There are likely better purifiers out therereview/text: I chose this model from the thousands of choices based on Amazon reviews and my own price range. I live in an apt furnished by my job, and we noticed mold on the ceiling of our bedroom. Add to that a Doberman and a Persian cat, and we were constantly suffering from runny noses and sneezing. Initially, we were excited to receive this, and felt that it did improve the air quality. After having it for several months now, it doesn't seem to be doing as good of a job. We decided just to leave it off one night and realized that we were breathing better the next morning than we had been breathing with it running all night long. I'm not sure why that is. Maybe it needs a new filter?Either way, I deducted 2 stars because of the size, the noise, and the fact that it has to be 3 feet away from everything.
