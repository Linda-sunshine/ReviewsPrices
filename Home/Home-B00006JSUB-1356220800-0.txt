review/summary: A very heavy duty panreview/text: I love cooking with cast iron. Now I've cooked with cast iron a long time, and one thing I have discovered is that it is best to have a pan for cooking strong tasting meats like fish or cajun dishes. I use this pan for pretty much all other meats, and it works extremely well.The one extremely important property that needs to be added is simply the fact that you will want a metal spatula to go with your cast iron cookware. Usually, a small scraping action is enough to separate the food from the skillet, but a plastic spatula just won't cut it in that regard. Also, a plastic spatula will likely melt given how well cast iron retains heat.
