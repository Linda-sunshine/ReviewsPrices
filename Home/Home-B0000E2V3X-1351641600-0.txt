review/summary: Perfectreview/text: This is heavy and made of good quality. It does exactly what we want it to-- bake pizza, bread, scones, cookies, tortillas, naan, pancakes, and more. (Shameless self-promotion, you can see all the ways I use it on my blog beantherebonethat.blogspot.com.)Used according to manufacturer's instructions, we have had no problems with it and use it almost every day. I'm so glad we got this and don't have a bad thing to say about it. We use it in the oven, on the stove, and on the grill.
