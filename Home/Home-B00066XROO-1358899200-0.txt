review/summary: Good pancakes but difficult to washreview/text: Admittedly, I have only used this griddle once so far. I was pleased with the cooking process and everyone was happy with the pancakes. (This replaced a griddle I loved but gave to my son.) But it is too large to be able to wash easily. I have a double sink where one side is larger than the other and deeper. But it was still a challenge to wash and rinse this griddle without soaking myself and the rest of the kitchen.
