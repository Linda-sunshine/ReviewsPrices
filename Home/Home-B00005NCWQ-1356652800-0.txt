review/summary: Exactly what I wantedreview/text: Altho' we use an ELECTRIC &#34;Farbarware coffeepot&#34;, every day....it happens, infrequently, that we lose power, that renders theELECTRIC pot, USELESS! THIS &#34;Percolator&#34;, is the PERFECT&#34;ALTERNATIVE&#34; for those times - and the coffee is every bit asdelicious! I would CERTAINLY RECOMMEND - that EVERYFAMILY have one of THESE.....if NOT for EVERYDAY...forthose &#34;TRYING TIMES&#34;, when electricity is not available...andthe NEED for a GOOD CUP OF COFFEE - is DOUBLY DESIRABLE!
