review/summary: BREAKS after minimal usereview/text: I loved this coffee maker when it was working fine, but after minimal use, it became stuck in a "cleaning" mode and took up to an hour to make a full pot. I should have bought a warranty, but I never considered CUISINART would make such a crappy product, especially considering their prices. After reading other reviews of people who experienced the same thing, I would not buy a Cuisinart maker again. Thanks for REVIEWS! (should have read them!)
