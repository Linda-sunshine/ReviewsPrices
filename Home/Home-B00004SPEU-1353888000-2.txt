review/summary: Ideal first grinder!review/text: I recently started grinding my own coffee, and this is what I got! This grinder is amazing for single cup brews. It's easy to clean and use. The compact design of the grinder makes it easy for me to store, since I have a small kitchen, and the sound levels are also very low, waking up someone at 6am isn't an issue.
