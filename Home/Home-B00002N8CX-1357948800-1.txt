review/summary: Very pleasedreview/text: Absolutely love my Eureka 3670G Mighty Mite Canister Vacuum!The suction is great, unbelievable. Now I remember why I loved canister vacs more than uprights.The plastic hose got kinked once and didn't crack.I give it 5 stars but I just wish they made them with the old style cloth hoses. Plastic ones make my nervous.
