review/summary: Out of this world!!review/text: So I decided to splurge and ordered these sheets based on others customer ratings and was not disappointed at all. These sheets are such a high quality I'm shocked at the price. They are by far the nicest sheets I've ever, ever owned. The only problem is, I was going back and forth on color and then used my &#34;one click purchase&#34; and didn't realize that it defaults to &#34;king&#34; size and I ended up ordering the wrong size, should have ordered Queen. But...they are SO nice I decided to keep them even though I don't have a King size bed in my house. I will for SURE order at least one set if not two. HIGHLY recommended. They are thick, but not hot.
