review/summary: Good for the pricereview/text: We will be upgrading to a coffee maker with a built-in grinder because we're sick of the mess of transferring ground coffee. But, I will be happy to keep this on hand for grinding other foods/spices and the occasional coarse grind for the camping percolator. It's fast and easy to use. I think clean-up is about as easy as it can be when dealing with loose coffee grounds.
