review/summary: Pretty decent grinderreview/text: This grinder gets the job done very well. Its fast speed and uniquely-shaped bowl allow for as even a grind as you'll get for a portable hand-pulsed grinder. The grounds tend to stick to the bottom, but this is a problem I haven't seen one portable grinder overcome. In spite of its simplicity, it has a rather attractive look that will accent any kitchen.
