review/summary: It's a love/hate relationshipreview/text: For years we've been using cheap plastic garbage cans. They often don't look too bad, but they do nothing for odor control. So, the husband convinced me to try this one. Well, the pro is that it really does seem to hold in odors - until you open it of course. At least I can't seem to smell the garbage at all when it's closed. Plus it is a nice looking can for the kitchen. We already had an adapter from some other gadget that worked perfectly, so we didn't need batteries. We keep it plugged in all the time.Ok, here's the con - The sensor to open it needs improvement. It takes way too long to stand over it waiting for it to open the lid. Sometimes it's 1 second, but others it's like 5 or 10 seconds. Sometimes not at all until you give it a compliment or press the open button. Then at the most inappropriate moments it opens, like when you walk by it and don't need it. It likes to play with you mentally and you can never predict how it's going to act. This may seem nitpicking, but with a foot pedastal you've got the can open the moment your body arrives in front of it. When you are in the middle of sensitive cooking adventures you need the lid open as fast as possible and consistently.So, if there were a better sensor or method for opening/closing the can I'd give this item 5 stars. Like I said, it's a love/hate relationship. Some days it behaves itself and I'm happy...others not so much.
