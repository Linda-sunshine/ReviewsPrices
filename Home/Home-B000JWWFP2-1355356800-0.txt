review/summary: Not what was expected!review/text: Sorry, but at 600 thread count, I was expecting a soft sheet, something that kinda felt like satin. Boy was I wrong! They washed up nicely, but the softness I expected wasn't there. Felt more like a cheap sheet I'd buy from a discount store!!I'd send them back, but it's more of a hassel then I want to deal with at this time.Sondra
