review/summary: Perfect for my needsreview/text: I think that when judging the overall quality of this teapot the cover seems a little flimsy to me. I don't plan on dropping it, but if I did, I think the cover would probably break off. Because I don't put this in the microwave and I hand wash (It is super easy to wash!), I haven't had any problems with it. It steeps great tea and when placing over my cup, it works just as they say it will. No leaks. Everything considered, I am glad that I purchased this. It is very similar to ones I have seen in the "tea" stores, but much more reasonable.
