review/summary: The Agony and the Ecsasy - in reverse!review/text: It used to be that newlyweds would receive a Farberware percolator coffee pot as a wedding gift and could be assured of two things: 1) there would be at least one delicious thing coming out of the kitchen and 2) it was so well made that the life of the coffee pot would probably outlast the life of the typical American marriage. But alas, no more. I don't know what has happened at Farbarware - except that maybe a company named APPLICA seems to be making their products now and slapping the Farberware name on the side! Have the bean counters and the marketeers gotten together and decided that a coffee pot with a short life is a good ROI?Farberware's motto is: Founded over 100 years ago, the Farberwarename has stood for value, quality and durability. This commitment to the customer continues to this day.Hmmm, I think not.As the other reviewers noted, this percolator produces a superb cup of coffee - good straight ahead American coffee. Unfortunately, my pot worked for ---- one year - and a day!I will not buy another Farberware percolator until the companies realign their priorities. Off, now, for a sad cup of tea - as my percolator sits, cold - and dead.
