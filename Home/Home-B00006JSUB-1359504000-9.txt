review/summary: much better than newer skilletsreview/text: I just started getting into cast iron cooking and it is much better than anything else I have used. I only have one old cast iron skillet and it is much smoother than these but I assume over time these will get much much better. Don't try cooking an egg as your first test lol. I cooked a lot of bacon in mine before I attempted any eggs.
