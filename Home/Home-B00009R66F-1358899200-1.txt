review/summary: Beyond Awesome!!!!!review/text: Carpet is the most disgusting thing on the planet!!! That is my thought every time I'm emptying the &#34;dirty water&#34; tank on this machine. I needed to get my carpets shampooed so I called around to local business and I was SHOCKED at how much people charge to clean a small three bedroom home. After that I started researching carpet cleaning machines and I came across this one. It had amazing reviews and was extremely reasonable in price (much cheaper than hiring it done) so I took the plunge and bought it. I'm so glad I did!!! This machine is incredibly easy to use. I feel like it saturates the carpet enough to clean it and it has great suction so you don't feel like your carpet is just soaked with dirty water. I can't recommend this machine enough!!! Do yourself a favor and buy this machine!!! With a small investment upfront and a few hours out of your day you will have clean beautiful carpet. Totally worth the money and then some!!!!!
