review/summary: Fabulous Machine!review/text: I do HEAVY INDIAN cooking! I use this machine to grind all sorts of wet chutneys and spice pastes. Cleaning is very easy, rinse container and blade assembly under the tap and use a wet paper towel to clean the underside of the lid that comes in contact with the ground mixture. My unit is slightly broken at the place where the chopper spindle goes in but the chopper goes on and on without any problems. I also use this to chop Onions and Spinach. You need to chop the onions into medium size pieces first and use the slow speed otherwise you will get mushy watery onion mash.
