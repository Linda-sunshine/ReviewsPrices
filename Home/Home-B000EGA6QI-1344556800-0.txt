review/summary: Amazing multi purpose kitchen gadgetreview/text: I read all the rave reviews about this product before I bought it and they certainly lived up to my expectations. I've had this for three weeks and I've used it in some form or another every day. It's been amazing making smoothies, pureeing my home made spaghetti sauce and salsas. I don't dirty any other appliance and have to take it apart to clean it. I just push the detach button and boom -- clean it in one step. I can't say enough about the thing. It's so awesome if you like to make stuff for your family at home.
