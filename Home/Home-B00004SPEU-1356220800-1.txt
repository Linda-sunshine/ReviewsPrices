review/summary: Does what I want it to doreview/text: I usually grind my ground coffee.Yep! I grind my ground coffee. The finer grains of coffee allow the hot water to come into contact with more of the grains of the coffee. I think I get better flavor that way.The Krups grinder is easy to clean. I use a large size artist's paint brush to dust out the remnants of coffee when I'm done with grinding.
