review/summary: Electric Kettlereview/text: Absolutely love this product! Was looking for something to use at work to save myself 4+ trips a day around to the microwave to warm water for tea. What I love the most about this kettle is how quickly the water comes to a boil! I can have my cup of tea in no time at all. It takes up very little space in the office and extremely easy to clean, just wipe down with a damp cloth and make sure you don't leave the water in it (if you are only having one cup of tea, pour off the rest of the water when you're done). Overall, very pleased with this product as I really wasn't expecting it to be that great. Highly recommend this product for use in the office or at home even!
