review/summary: What? You mean my carpet is really green?review/text: I'm infatuated with this device. We live on a farm, have two dogs and a lot of aquariums that have been known to leak occasionally (and disastrously). My carpets haven't been wet cleaned... well.... ever. So when I tell you that my carpet looked bad, do not underestimate my words. I held out little hope for it, especially around the doorway. I opened the box, put it together in about 15 minutes, and took at test run at the area in front of my door. I made a couple of passes and it was like I could hear angels singing in the background. The brown watercolor painting I call a carpet was now turning a uniform light blue/green. Brown carpet to green! This miracle comes in right below Jesus turning water into wine! Ok, maybe that is a little exaggeration. The reservoir is large enough to do about half a room, the the waste water bin holds almost the whole clean tank. I've used it on bare floors, and it works, but leaves them pretty wet. But not so wet they won't dry in a few minutes. The little scrubber attachment is dandy, great for removing stains from the couch. A word of warning, do not let the waste water sit in the tank for very long. That stuff is very dirty (at least at my house), and it will foul quickly. I also could have used a slickly longer cord, but that is a minor complaint. I really couldn't be happier.
