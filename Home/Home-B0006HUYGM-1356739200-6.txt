review/summary: Little, but Powerfulreview/text: I keep this vacuum right beside me in my craft room. It's great for picking up the paper scraps, glitter, etc. that are a part of crafting. I find that it is quite powerful. The cord is long enough to do the entire carpeted area. It's easy to empty, too. This would be great for steps if I had them. You won't be sorry with this purchase.
