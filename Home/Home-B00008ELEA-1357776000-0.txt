review/summary: I'm so happy to have found another one of these percolators I love themreview/text: I have an old percolator of the same type & model that I purchased at a yard sale. It makes the very best coffee, strong but not bitter. It was getting older plus I travel to my father's place so often I thought if I could find another I would leave one at his place and have one at home. The reviews about the newer models worried me but since the first one only cost 50 cents I figured even if I was unhappy it was worth the risk. I am very happy to say the reviews were wrong, it works as well as my original one and I use them every sisngle morning.
