review/summary: Another good waffle maker, but, ...C'mon Cuisinart!review/text: I bought this as a gift for my mother (she asked for a waffle maker). I have a different model cuisinart waffle maker, and since they don't make that model anymore, I chose this one. She was very pleased with it. The reason I didn't give it five stars is that there was a black smudge on the lid. I'm not sure what it was. Soap and water wouldn't get it off, but rubbing alcohol did the trick. I checked the griddle plates and the rest of the waffle maker and there were no additional anomalies. I have several other cuisinart appliances and enjoy them all. I highly recommend this brand. Just an odd experience with this one. C'mon cuisinart, give some refresher training to your final inspection personnel.
