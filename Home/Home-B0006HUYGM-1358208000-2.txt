review/summary: Good buy!review/text: I actually bought a similar upright lightweight vacuum (optima 431F) from Target, and after 4 years it's still working great. It's all a matter of washing the filter and emptying the dust. So I figure this smaller version of the optima 431F would work the same way. So far, it's also working great for vacuuming the car. I don't recommend using the brushroll to vacuum certain tight or unleveled surfaces in the car. The brushroll has trouble touching those spots. But it has the hose option to get into tight spots and the convenient design is perfect for carrying around. It weighs about 5lbs which is as much as my laptop - not too heavy. It collects a lot of the dust particles, dirt, and whateverI didn't know was in my car.The one thing I really love about this vaccuum is not just its amazing suction power for a small handheld but the dust filter is washable, which helps me save a lot of money since I vacuum often. Traditional vacuum bags cost quite a bit over time.I absolutely love the portability of this, and I do recommend this to a friend. I have a petite build, so I'm not very strong and tire easily if I have to lug a big vacuum all the time. I'm not exactly sure about the durability of this vacuum but if you vacuum and clean often, you'll definitely get your money's worth.
