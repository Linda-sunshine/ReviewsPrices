review/summary: a former barista's reviewreview/text: I think I have a bit of an advantage in that I have previous barista experience on a manual espresso machine, so I already knew going into this how to tamp the grinds etc., and the art of pulling a shot. I do agree that a lot of these negative reviews come from a place of inexperience and simply not understanding how to to pack the grinds.Saying that, I think before anyone purchases an espresso machine that's never pulled a shot before, be sure to read up on it and watch youtube videos so that you can get the best out of this wonderful machine. The way you pack the grinds will definitely effect the outcome of the shot.Back to my review. I got my machine in yesterday, and after that I began reading the instructions (which seem to be awkwardly translated, i think) watching videos on the use of the machine itself, and reading fellow reviews. I also practiced without grinds on the machine. This morning i woke up & set the machine to steam and 10 minutes or so later, steamed my milk first (per suggestion). I then set it to the "make coffee" setting and pulled a beautiful shot and did NOT have a soupy mess afterwards- oh and also, i tightly packed my grinds with the recommended tamp. No problems.When you fill the container with water in the back, make sure it's suctioning to that thing at the bottom (you'll see bubbles rise) because i noticed i hadn't done that and the water wasn't heating. It's simple things like this that need to be checked.Overall, like many others, this is a great little machine. Hopefully it lasts me a good while!
