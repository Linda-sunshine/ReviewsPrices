review/summary: Breville Juicer is greatreview/text: For the price, this is the best juicer you will find. I've been using it about a year now about every day juicing with carrots and apples and it is still going strong. The only con I can think of is that if you don't empty out and clean the pulp fairly quickly it tends to stain the plastic over time. But it is a very good quality and reliable juicer. (helped me lose about 25 lbs :))
