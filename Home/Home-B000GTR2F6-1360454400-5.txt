review/summary: Wife Loves thisreview/text: Fufu gift, shipped as advertized, recived one day earler that advertized. The Brewer works great, thier are lots of different flavors of coffee, tea, hot chocolet drinks you can enjoy (try). The biggest brawback is the cost of single serving is any were from 33 cents to 1.15 dollars. Little more costly than a pot of Foldgers. The wife loves it, she thinks shes has her own coffee shop...
