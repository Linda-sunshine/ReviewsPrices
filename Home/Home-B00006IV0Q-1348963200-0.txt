review/summary: morning saviorreview/text: Bought this small percolator to bring on trips....love to have a coffee first thing in the morning and didn't like the thought of walking half a mile for it. This is perfect, makes a wonderful cup of coffee and is so compact...fits into luggage without a problem. It's sturdy design and materials are exceptional....nice enough to place on a dinner table at home. People can't believe I use a 'percolator' like their mom use to until they taste the coffee. Experiment a little to get it the way you want it but so great when you get it just right. I'll probably get the bigger version one day soon.
