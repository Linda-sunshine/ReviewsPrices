review/summary: Catches dust but is very noisyreview/text: The unit has been doing a good job of circulating a high volume of air and catching dust but it is very noisy. The plastic centrifugal blower doesn't seem to be too well balanced so the noise is not only high frequency air turbulence but also some low frequency rumble that travels through any floor it sits on. I wouldn't buy another.
