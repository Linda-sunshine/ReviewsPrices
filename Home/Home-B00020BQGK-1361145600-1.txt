review/summary: Finereview/text: It works fine however the first and only use so far was in a camper and it completely stopped before finishing maybe a 8ft. by 10ft. area. I started looking and it states it will shut down if it over heats to let it off for about 30 minutes, it did start again but if it over heated that quick on such a small area I don't know if I could it's worth the money. As stated only tried it once and it is in the camper parked in the country so won't be using it again for a few weeks but if there are any changes I'll update my opinion......
