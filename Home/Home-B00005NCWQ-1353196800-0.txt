review/summary: Nice potreview/text: I read the reviews before buying and noted the concern regarding the plastic cap, Yes, the cap is plastic, but that hasn't been a problem for me, though I've only used the pot a handfull of times. If the plastic cap ever breaks I'll replace it with a glass cap. For the price I think this pot is a bargain, even with the plastic cap.
