review/summary: Stopped working after 3 monthsreview/text: The coffee machine was doing good (not great) for three months. One morning, the water stopped flowing: it took 15 minutes to fill a small cup. I changed coffee, cleaned the filter, cleaned the machine with a special product but it never worked again. I think the pump must be broken. Now it's sitting useless on the counter. I don't know how to return it.Update: I called delonghi and they told me that they won't fix it or refund me. They want me to cut the cord and send it to them along with a 15$ payment so that they can ship an new machine! This is absolutely ridiculous. What do I do with a defective, cordless espresso machine?
