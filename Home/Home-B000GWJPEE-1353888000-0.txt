review/summary: Fantastic Humidifierreview/text: I have been running this in the kids room for a few days again, (we are on year two of having it) and I thought I would mention that if you are looking for a humidifier, this is the one to get. Yes, you need to elevate it, and yes, you need to put a towel down underneath it because it's going to get things damp. Also you may need to tilt it slightly (elevate the side with the knob) for maximal dispersal, and give it 2 minutes to get going.Then again that's pretty much any humidifier.This one has the added bonus of being adorable, running for over 15 hours, automatically shutting off, not using an uncleanable nasty moldy sponge, and being highly effective. It's easy to clean, load, and store.And the testimony: my son has croup and stays up at night coughing, but turning this on does the trick, allowing him to sleep the night in peace. A must have, I mean seriously, just look at that price!
