review/summary: Pinzon Flannel 'Calfornia' King Sheet setreview/text: I bought this set based on the many reviews with plenty of people indicating they bought the &#34;California King&#34; size. They said it didn't shrink when washed, didn't pill and fit 'nicely'. I've owned a Calif King since the 80's and the top sheet in this set IS NOT a Calif King - it is a King! It is not long enough to tuck in at the bottom. Buyer beware.
