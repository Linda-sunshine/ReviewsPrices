review/summary: well made sharpenerreview/text: I have used this knife sharpener on about 30 knives. One set owned by my mother could NEVER be sharpened to my liking. All the knives in 3 households are now sharp. It is easy to use, just don't put too much down pressure, let the weight of the knife do the work.
