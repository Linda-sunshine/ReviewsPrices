review/summary: Not too pleased.....review/text: The main reason that I am not happy with this machine is because the basket handle does not move all the way to the front of the machine. It is locked in place but the position of the handle makes me very nervous every time I use the machine. It's just not right. I'm considering this machine my &#34;backup&#34; in case something goes wrong with my Gaggia. I miss my very simple, effective and very long lasting espresso machines from BRIEL. I have had three great experiences with that brand. Looks like they are just not making them anymore. They were great! I still have my original one from over 10 years ago! I would not buy another product by DeLonghi. The coffee always tastes burned.
