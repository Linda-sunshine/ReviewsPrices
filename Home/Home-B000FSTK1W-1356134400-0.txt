review/summary: Works well and holds almost as much as the large versionreview/text: Bought this for my mom's shower and she is able to hold full size bottles of shampoo and conditioner in it. So far it has held up well and hasn't fallen down. Its easy to slide off of the strips and that makes cleaning it very easy. It holds more than we thought and when we compared it to the large cady the only main difference was that it doesn't have a soap holder. The shaver holder is a nice touch as well!
