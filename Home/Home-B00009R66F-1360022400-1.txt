review/summary: A MUST HAVE ITEM!!!! VERY PLEASED!!!review/text: I have a 1 year old Terrer, and she has been lighting up the house with her gifts! I had been renting the carpet cleaners from the grocery store and the home depot to refresh my carpets periodically, but after renting the machine 5 times last year I decided It would be more cost efficient to own my own. I did my research and found this little beauty to be the best value for the money. I was going to order it here online, but shipping was way too high, so I decided to check the HOMEDEPOT for it, and sure enough there it was for $129 to boot! I bought it, and I must say it works every bit as well as the Machines for rent, and I believe a little better because it's lighter, more flexible in tight spaces and can be used like a vacumm cleaner. My carpet looks great, and I know this was an investment well worth the money. THIS PRODUCT IS A MUST HAVE!!!!
