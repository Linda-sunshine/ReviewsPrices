review/summary: Never worked properlyreview/text: I received this as a gift in November. On paper, it looks like a great weather radio. Had all the features you need. However, mine just wouldn't work right. When I first got it, none of the buttons would do anything; I'd hit menu and no menu screens would appear. I couldn't get a lock on a signal, no matter where I placed it. After an hour or so it suddenly worked. Great! So I programmed it etc. and waited for the radio to notify me when it received alerts. The problem was, it never alerted me. Then the weather radio stopped working. So I moved it downstairs, thinking it was a reception issue. Nope. same deal - buttons were unresponsive, wouldn't pick up the NOAA signal. Fed up, my wife returned it (thankfully we just made the extended holiday return window). Bought the Sangean CL-100. Night and day. Better build quality, better sound, better reception, oh and it works!Maybe I got a dud with the Midland but based on the other reviews, it seems like they have quality and reliability issues. I am much happier with the Sangean.
