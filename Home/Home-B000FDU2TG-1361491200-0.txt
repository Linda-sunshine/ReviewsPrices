review/summary: Great so far.review/text: I bought my KSB560ER locally on sale for about $20 less than the going rate (Purchased February 2013) to replace a 40 oz Osterizer which leaked, made unhappy noises and occasional burning smells. Absolutely love it so far. Plenty of power and heft. Love the large, easy to clean jar. Handles hot soups as well as frozen drinks. Turns ice cubes into a snowy powder in seconds without any scary noises or burning odors!I like the electronic motor controls, and expect that feature should protect the motor against overloading and overheating.If I have problems in the future, I'll try to update the review.
