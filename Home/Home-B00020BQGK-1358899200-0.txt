review/summary: Works Great! Won't do &#34;shag&#34; bathroom rugs, but worth the $$review/text: Just did a test clean in my house and it worked great, mostly...The power head won't do my &#34;shag&#34; bathroom rugs --the motor binds... But I can do a decent job by not using the power head and dragging the vacuum over the rug while holding the far edge of the rug down with my foot. I'll shake out my bathroom rugs outside, or wash them in the washer, when I wan them really clean...After 10 minutes, I was AMAZED of how much dirt was picked up! And DO clean the the filter OUTSIDE as there IS a lot of dust that flies when you shake and brush off the filter.And BE gentle with the vacuum! It's plastic and it's $50... It's not a $400 commercial unit but does a GREAT JOB around the house.I have a 20 yr old $400 Sears canister that's a work-horse, but is clunky for quick once-overs... I like the maneuverability of this stick vac!And if I get 2 years out of this vacuum, it's well worth it!
