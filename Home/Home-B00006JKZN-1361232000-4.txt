review/summary: Not as great as the reviews...review/text: I bought this because of the great reviews and especially because several people said the waffles were crispy, well, they are....for about 30 seconds and then they get soft....unless you put them in the toaster....which isn't very convenient if you're wanting to eat them. It does seem to be well built and store nicely though.
