review/summary: Perhaps Ignorance is Bliss, but all these five star reviews are wack.review/text: It might be that having used a professional ice cream maker has spoiled me, but the fact that this ice cream maker cannot even freeze the recipes included with the device leads me to believe that I should have shelled out another eighty bucks for an ice cream maker with its own cooling element.When making any standard ice cream, this appliance only makes the most crystaline, grainy, and "milk-ice" flavored products.When making anything with a lot fruit puree in it (like sorbet or a simple strawberry ice cream), the pectin seems to over-come the under-freezing of the machine.The problem, as far as I can tell, is not with the freezable core, which seems to hold enough cold for the length of time needed, it is with the overall design of the machine. A flimsy plastic insert is meant to scrap down the sides of the core while it rotates, both agitating the liquid and preventing frozen build-up from insulating the rest of the liquid. But because it is so flimsy, this insert simply flexes inward allowing that build-up to occur.I have tried using a metal spoon on the sides as it rotates to help the process but this merely stalls the rather weak motor in the machine.I don't know why this ice-cream maker is a third more expensive than the other cuisinarts on Amazon. Maybe its just the premium for the snazzy brushed-aluminum finish, but it cannot be because it is any better at producing high-quality ice cream. I guess I'll just stick with Hagen Daz for now.
