review/summary: SMELL is a big problemreview/text: The biggest problem with this pillow was the smell - it was extremely strong. I tried several different things to get rid of it, I even washed it in my front loading washer, but nothing worked. It took several weeks and almost daily pillow case changes before the smell was tolerable to sleep with. Even after all that, I really wanted this pillow to help my neck pain, but it made it worse. This is basically a large version of the travel pillows with the beads in them that you buy at the airport. It may work for some people, but for me it was too hard and uncomfortable, and the ordeal of getting rid of the smell was not worth it.
