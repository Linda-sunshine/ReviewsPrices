review/summary: Very good but not perfectreview/text: After hours of reading reviews I made my decision. I have also had a krups food processor that has worked flawless for over ten years so I felt pretty confident in the quality. I was right. Though I will not be using this for spices, etc. as I use a mortar and pestle, the coffee grinding is more than sufficient in terms of outcome. Other reviews have stated that you can only get a fine grind with this unit. Not true at all! They simply are not using it correctly. I can grind course, medium or fine after just a little practice. The only reason I left one star out is because when using fresh beans (which are oily) it takes one more step to clean it out so that your next grind doesn't include some stale coffee. Not being fully submersible makes this one more step I wish I didnt have to take. They should include a small brush to clean after each grind. Other than that, it has worked as good as I wanted it to and being a krups product I know I will never have an issue with customer service as they are accomodating even after warrantees have expired. The company itself really stands behind their products and I beleive it is because they have very few problems to deal with.
