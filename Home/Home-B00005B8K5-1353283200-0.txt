review/summary: Help...How do you get the lids on?review/text: Just purchased the 5 pc. pyrex storage set but what is the point of glass vs. plastic if I can't get the lid on? I put lids in dishwasher on top rack..now trying to put lid on...feel like an alligator wrestler. Glad this is just a test otherwise all contents would be spilled out and I still don't have the lid on, have tried all 5 pieces and they are all the same..I need a pyrex pry bar to get them on..will probably send them back if I don't find a solution. Maybe I have to put soap on the edges. or butter, that would at least taste better? Any ideas?
