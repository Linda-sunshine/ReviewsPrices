review/summary: Wanted to love this chair but.....review/text: This is a super comfortable and sturdy chair, and I really wanted to give it five stars, but the fabric with the espresso wood is not beige. It is is very very white. Also, if you plan on breastfeeding with a Boppy pillow in this chair, think again. The Boppy pillow won't fit around you in the chair unless you are super skinny. Other than that, it is a good rocker, especially for the price. It is just not as functional as I had hoped.
