review/summary: A nice powerful hand held vacuum.review/text: I got this vacuum to help clean the stairs. It does a wonderful job at that. Now I don't need to drag out my heavy floor vac and try to maneuver it around the stair cases. This one has a nice rotating brush you can optionally turn on or off. The removable hose is very useful for crevices. I look forward to finding more uses for this around the house.
