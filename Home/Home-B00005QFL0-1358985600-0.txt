review/summary: As dummy-proof as you getreview/text: I love this bread maker. I was worried about buying one as bread can be a challenge, but this turned out to be pretty dummy proof. It comes with easy recipes and as long as you follow the portions and tips, the bread comes out delicious. I've been making bread every few days on this thing.
