review/summary: very efficient and reliablereview/text: I have had this electric kettle (Proctor Silex K2070Y 1 Liter Electric Kettle) for over a year and it really does the job reliably and with very few complaints. It boils pretty quickly and always shuts off as it starts boils and if there is not enough water to boil. I like the detachable cord so filling the kettle is easy without a cord dangling. Bottom line, my experience has been that the kettle is safe, simple and reliable. I take one star off because I am pretty sure it is not BPA free. So, I have patiently been waiting for this one to break down so I can get an electric kettle with a healthier material but this one just keeps working : )
