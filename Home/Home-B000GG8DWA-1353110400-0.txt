review/summary: Loving it so far.review/text: I've had this for about a month now and it's working exactly how I expected it too. My bedroom stays very cold even with the central heat or the wood stove running, which both can keep the rest of the house nice and toasty if they are running by themselves. I tried using a typical 1500W fan forced space heater but it just didn't work out. It used a lot of electricity and didn't do much to the room's temperature. My room is too drafty and cold for typical forced-air heating to work, so I decided to go with a radiant heater. After much searching, I got this one. I keep it right next to me when I use it, running on low mode (400 watts, almost 1/4 the electricity consumed compared to the previous heater!) and it keeps me nice and toasty. This heater is NOT meant to heat a room - it's meant to heat solids and liquids that it is pointed at, and it works. High mode is useful if you're outside doing something such as working on the house. Because this does not heat air, it will keep you warm even if you're outside in below-freezing temperatures, provided it's pointed at you. If you're inside, 400 watts will suffice. It doesn't have to be right next to you for you to feel the heat. You can keep it a few feet away from you and while you won't feel the hotness directly, you will gradually start to feel warmer and warmer. It's very relaxing, almost like sitting next to a hot fire, especially on high mode (800 watts). Did I mention this thing is completely silent, unlike forced-air heaters? It has a little bit of a buzz when you first turn it on but it's very quiet. The buzz goes away when it heats up completely which takes about a minute.Overall, I'm very happy and I would recommend this heater to anyone. I'll give an update after the winter is over or if this thing breaks. For now, it gets 5 stars from me.
