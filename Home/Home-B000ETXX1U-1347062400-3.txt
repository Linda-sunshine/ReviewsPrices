review/summary: Difficult to sleep on after the center chambers separatereview/text: Over the past year and 5 months we have used the Insta bed approximately 5 times. Today we began filling it up for another use and as we did, the center chambers separated creating a large bulge in the middle of the bed. I would have thought that it would be useable for more times than this. I was surprised to find that the warranty was for only 1 year. The previous inflatable bed we had served us well for well over 5 years and many more uses than this one. Now I know not to consider Wenzel when I replace this bed.
