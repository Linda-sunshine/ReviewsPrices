review/summary: I like this pan. . .review/text: I like this pan - while I have not actually tried it yet, I understand it will go from stove top to oven up to 450 degrees which is what I wanted. I have used it almost every day since I purchased it and have had not problems with anything sticking - eggs, pancakes, pork chops, chicken, whatever, it cleans up easily and it was not expensive. I decided on this particular pan because it was one recommended by Cook's Illustrated. The purchase was smooth and shipment quick which pleased me. I did not give it a 5 rating because I haven't had it long enough to really give it a workout yet.
