review/summary: Compact but inefficientreview/text: Pros:takes up little roomheats fastworks great on 100% cottoneasily portablelong cordCons:poor quality (it BROKE)no control over steam (I didn't realize how beneficial this would have been until after using the product)does not work well on men's shirtstakes several extra passes to get the wrinkles outspits water onto clothesthe cord needs a wrap clip for storagesmall water reserve (keep this in mind when considering how much you steam)Only use distilled water with this unit.I used this steamer only a handful of times on mostly women's shirts after it proved inefficient on men's.Like other reviewers my steamer BROKE after limited use. THE HOSE BROKE AT THE CONNECTION TO THE STEAM DISPENSER inside the unit to where it could not be fixed. I tried to contact customer service but had NO LUCK in reaching them easily.It worked well enough on women's clothes but if you break down the price point comparative to the garments treated and time spent on each, THIS UNIT IS INEFFICIENT and overpriced.
