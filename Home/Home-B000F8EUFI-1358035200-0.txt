review/summary: Does a great job at a great pricereview/text: This product is easy to handle, light, it's not any more noisy than any other vacuum, and works very well.Some people complained about it spitting air from the front or sides; I find that the air flow helps lift dirt from the corners and tight places, and then it's all easily picked up by the devil.After a 4 months of more than reasonable use (mid size apartment, 2 bedrooms and large living room, all carpets, and two hyperactive kids) it keeps working nicely, and hasn't broken down.You do have to empty the container and clean/change the filter often for it to keep working, but then, if the tank keeps getting full, it's showing that the vacuum is doing its job pretty well.
