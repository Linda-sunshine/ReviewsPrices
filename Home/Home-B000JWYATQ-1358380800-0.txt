review/summary: It's not worth the $review/text: Sorry but I bought these sheets on Amazon a few months ago and hesitated writing a review initially because I wanted to give them a &#34;break-in&#34; period and be fair.I have had smoother more Sateen feeling sheets from Sam's club than these. Save your money and buy something else, these are rough, and don't feel Sateen at all, (they would make decent curtains though).
