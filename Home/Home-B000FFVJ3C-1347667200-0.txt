review/summary: Great so farreview/text: I've had this about a month. I bought it initially because we have had an overbundance of figs this summer, and I hate to waste anything. Also, we love jerky, but don't like the level of salt and sugar in commercial products.I like that the dehydrator has a selection of various temperatures for various products. Meat jerky takes only 2 to 3 hours, and we can formulate the marinade to fit our tastes. It doesn't last long (gets eaten fairly quicly) so long-term storage isn't a big issue for us - thus salt and sugar aren't as important for preservation. It works as advertized, no complaints.The large size of the trays make washing in our kitchen sink difficult. However, you can stack them up in the dishwasher easily enough. I bought the round model rather than the square because of the extra acessories that were provided, but I haven't used them.
