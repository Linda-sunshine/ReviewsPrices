review/summary: These things are a lifesaver.review/text: I LOVE these saladshooters! This is the 3rd one I've purchased in the last 15 years or so. I have a cabage soup recipe where I have to grate a whole head of cabbage. With hand grater it's brutal. But with the salad shooter it takes just a few min. The service was great. It only took a couple of days til delivery. Shooter was sold like new; and it was. Still in box with packing. I will purchase from this seller again!
