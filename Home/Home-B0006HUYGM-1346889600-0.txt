review/summary: Fabulous!review/text: I spent $500 for a beautiful Dyson canister...a real work of art. But then I had to move into a very small one bedroom in NYC...about 650sf. I have two small round carpets, maybe 4 or 5 feet wide. The ratio of floor area to molding is very low, so I found myself spending a lot of time and effort trying to keep the molding clean, especially because the Dyson wand is very heavy. Then I bought this little charmer. I use it for the whole house! All 650 sf. It works great on the carpets, I use it on the sofa and it is super for molding and the like. You do need to buy a separate brush for the end, although it comes with a nice crevice tool (that's what she said) for getting in to those crevices.It's a little yucky cleaning the dust collector, but considering the capacity you don't want to be changing bags a lot either.I have even bought this as a house warming gift!
