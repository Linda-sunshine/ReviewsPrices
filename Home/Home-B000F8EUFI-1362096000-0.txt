review/summary: Sucksreview/text: My house has gone unvacuumed for a matter of months due to my crappy little bissel and its inability to suck anything up. I had more luck cleaning my carpet with a broom and dustpan. That is.. until my ONLY FIFTY DOLLAR!?!? dirt devil arrived.I admit that I am highly cheap, especially when it comes to household appliances, as I would rather spend my money on things that are fun. I wasn't expecting much from a fifty dollar vacuum, but I must say I am blown away.The suction on this thing is POWERFUL. As you can imagine, my floor was pretty dirty, having gone unvacuumed for so long, but this thing sucked up every little particle of dirt in its path. I also have a cat, and was amazed at the amount of cat hair this sucked up that I couldn't even tell was there.Also, cleaning out the dirt devil was quick and easy. Didn't even need the directions.Only thing that I don't like about this vacuum is that it is extremely loud, but I will live with that for the great suction. Also, I read reviews for this product that say the cord is short; I don't know what length of cord these consumers are used to, but I found the cord almost too long. I vacuumed my bedroom while plugged in in my kitchen, although I do have a smallish apartment, so maybe the cord would be short for bigger houses? I don't know, but I didn't see that as a problem.Overall, as far as my experience with vacuum cleaners go, this is a great one for the money. My aforementioned crappy bissell cost me 25 dollars, and I wish I had just gotten over my frugality back then and sprung for this one initially.
