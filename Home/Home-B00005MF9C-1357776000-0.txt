review/summary: So far so good.review/text: I have a keurig for work but love this for a quick brew on the weekends. It heats up very quickly and so far the coffee is great. For those of you unfamiliar with the product you don't even have to use mug it comes with. It also includes a permanent filter. Sometimes I use melita cone filters to improve taste.
