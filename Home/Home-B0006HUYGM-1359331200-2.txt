review/summary: NOT BAD FOR THE MONEYreview/text: I have been looking for one of these portable vacuums for a while now. I previously had a Black and Decker that I could no longer use because I could not find bags for it. It still worked great!I mainly use this vacuum for cleaning stairs. It has plenty of power and the cord is long enough to reach to the top/bottom of the stairs without having to find another outlet to complete the job. The hose is detachable for getting in tighter areas but the unit does not come with any attachments. Some of the attachments of your floor vacuum may fit on the end of the hose though (mine did).The container that collects the dirt will most likely need to be emptied after each use and the filter will need to be cleaned. I don't believe the filter will last for very long so you may want to purchase a spare if you decide to purchase the vacuum. Also, the filter does not catch the smallest dust particles and will exhaust them out of the back of the unit.The cord conveniently wraps around the back of the vacuum for storage.The front brush guard flips up/down allowing you to clean not only the steps but the risers as well.As I mentioned before, I use it for cleaning my carpeted stairs and the vacuum works pretty well. I would recommend it for this use.
