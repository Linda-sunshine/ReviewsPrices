review/summary: Perfect Gift for a Coffee Loverreview/text: This was a gift from my hubby. I love the varieties of coffee products and the fact I can have a different kind of coffee each day of the week without having to opening new bags of coffee losing the freshness and flavors. This was bought last Christmas and it still runs just as the day I got it. You need to make sure you do not use tap water or you need to purchase filters for the machine. I love the different sizes on this one, I use the travel cup size for going to work and the 12 oz coffee mug for home. I would strongly recommend this for the coffee lover in your life.
