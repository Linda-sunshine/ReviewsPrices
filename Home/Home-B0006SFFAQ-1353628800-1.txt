review/summary: Owned for several years, used daily!review/text: I honestly have to say, this coffee maker is very reliable, we brew coffee every morning and leave the warmer on throughout the day, for many years this has worked flawlessly. I will buy another one of these prior to it being discontinued so I can have a fine piece of coffee making equipment for at least the next 10 years.
