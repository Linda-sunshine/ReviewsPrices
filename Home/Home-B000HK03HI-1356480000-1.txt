review/summary: Best can opener ever!review/text: We had an under-cabinet spacesaver can opener for years, but it was wearing out. Decided to try a manual opener instead, and ordered the Zyliss from Amazon. I have found it to be extremely easy and efficient, opening any size can without problems. Some posters have mentioned not liking the lock, but I find it very simple to operate. I particularly like that it opens completely for ease of cleaning. A great product for the price!
