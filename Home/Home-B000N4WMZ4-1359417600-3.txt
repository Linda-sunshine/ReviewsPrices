review/summary: LID DOES NOT FIT!review/text: The product arrived sooner than expected and I was anxious to use it that evening for dinner. I discovered my lid has three raised bumps approximately 1/4&#34; in size at three triangulated points on the lid lip. The one flaw that I was a bit nervous about when ordering. I'm going to go out on a limb her and guess that some slave labor Chinese factory worker failed to grind the bumps off of the lid after it came out of the press. As a result the lid did not make contact all the way around the lip of the base and was horribly wobbly. I sent an e-mail to Lodge customer service and promptly received the following responses:From: Janice Patterson [mailto:jpatterson@lodgemfg.com]Sent: Tuesday, January 29, 2013 3:52 PMTo: ************Subject: ***********It does not fit tight but if it looks like it will wobble to much I would recommend returning it to Amazon.Thank you,Janice PattersonCustomer ServiceLodge Manufacturing__________________________I then asked ,&#34; Are there supposed to be three raised spots on the lip of the lid like in the attached photo? &#34;( I attached a CLEAR photo of the offending part)RESPONSE:From: Janice Patterson [mailto:jpatterson@lodgemfg.com]Sent: Tuesday, January 29, 2013 4:11 PMTo: **********Subject: RE: *********Hard to tell from picture. The black on the lid is a black matte enamel and it should be somewhat smooth. Hope this helps.Thank you,Janice PattersonCustomer ServiceLodge Manufacturing_____________________________Ummmmm, no Janice. This does not help. Hard to tell from the picture my A$$! Now I have to re-pack this 16lb behemoth and return it to Amazon via the local UPS store. Thanks for the errand. I can't wait to see what it costs to send it back.Also it is MADE IN CHINA. Hard to believe after once visiting and making purchases at the Lodge store and MFG in Tennessee a few years back. Do not take a chance and hope you will get one with a proper fitting lid. I did and I'm sorry for taking the risk that mine would be different.
