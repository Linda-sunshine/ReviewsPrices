review/summary: Cuisinart 7 cup Food Processorreview/text: I have never used a food processor because I didn't want to clutter up my kitchen with another appliance. But, after forty years of managing with my kitchen knives, Amazon came up with a sales offer too good to pass up. Now I'm sorry that I waited so long. Although I mostly cook only for one or two people, I use the processor all the time and bought a cook book just for more recipes. It works far better and far more easily than I had expected and clean-up is not a problem. I have made gazpacho, all kinds of shredded veggies for salads, a couple of great dips. Also almond butter. I'm looking forward to baking for the holidays. My new toy makes me happy.P.S. It took me a while to figure out how to put it together, but the CD provided all the instructions that I needed when I finally decided to watch it.
