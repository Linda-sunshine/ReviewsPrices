review/summary: Lunch Box Must-havereview/text: Purchased three of these jars about a year ago and they are still going strong. I preheat with boiled water before loading up with homemade soups or pasta or drop a few ice cubes in with milk for PBJ days. Works like a charm. My 5,6 and 12 year olds have yet to destroy and can easily manage. Never fill to the top, however, with hot, steamy foods or the lids will pop open and make a mess. I leave a centimeter gap.
