review/summary: PILLOW WAS PERFECT FOR MY NEEDSreview/text: I NEEDED A PILLOW FOR MY BACK AND I GOT JUST WHAT I NEEDED. IT'S FIRM , BUT COMFORTABLE AND IT FIT EXACTLY WHERE I WANTED IT ON MY RECLINER. MOST OTHERS WERE TOO STIFF.I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE NEEDING A GOOD SOURCE OF SUPPORT FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME.
