review/summary: Limited usefulnessreview/text: I have only used this twice now, and both times I filled it with water below the maximum line. Unless you only put about half the water in that is indicated by the maximum line, it spews water badly. I was careful to hold it horizontally as the instructions suggest. Because you can only put in such a limited amount of water, you have very little functional time. For that short time, it works okay, but you better work quickly. I am disappointed in this product.
