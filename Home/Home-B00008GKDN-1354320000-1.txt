review/summary: Great Swedish pancake pan - (some call them crepes)review/text: Great size and depth. I has to buff down and re-season to my expectations, and it works great. I love Lodge products - Made in the USA - and priced right. I have numerous lodge pots and pans, all re-seasoned by me with grapesead oil and I ust them extensively.
