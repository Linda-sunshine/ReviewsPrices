review/summary: Truly feels like velvet!!review/text: These are the best flannel sheets we've ever had, generously sized to fit a deeper mattress, wash and dry beautifully, warm and so soft, excellent quality at a very fair price. Many of the flannels in stores now are poor quality, lots of pilling and shrinkage, but these Pinzon sheets are just excellent!!
