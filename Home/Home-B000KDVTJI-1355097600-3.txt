review/summary: Great kettle.review/text: I've had this for a year now and it still works great. I usely drink tea at least once a day so it hasn't been an easy year for it. my only complaint and the reason i didn't give it 5 stars is that it is starting to get little dots of rust inside the kettle. they don't effect taste at all but they are still there.
