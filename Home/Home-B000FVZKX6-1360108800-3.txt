review/summary: Comfortable, no pillingreview/text: The sheets' color matches the picture (maybe they're a bit lighter grey, but not by much). I've washed them a few times and they haven't pilled yet (look up how to wash flannel sheets on google), and they're warm and soft. I'm very happy with them.
