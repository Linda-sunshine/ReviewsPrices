review/summary: Cast Iron ...the ONLY way to cookreview/text: I love Lodge products...they last for eternity and will survive the next nuclear war. This griddle is a great price. Lodge is preseasoned, but I always put coconut oil on them to season them a bit more to avoid any unneccessary sticking. This griddle is perfect for small meals and flapjacks and clean up is a breeze (just don't use soap on cast iron).
