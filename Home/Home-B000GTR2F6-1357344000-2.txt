review/summary: Fast & Convenient!review/text: I had a Mr. Coffee single cup brewer for over 2 years and I had no issues with it. I received this as a Christmas gift this year and I must say, I don't miss my Mr. Coffee one bit.I love the water reservoir and cup sizing brew options on this unit (the bottom slides out easily for bigger travel mugs). It also let's you select the temperature of your coffee and makes brews for iced drinks as well. The brew time is also super fast, within 10 seconds! It's a great machine so far and hopefully I won't have any big issues as I have read with the heating element and such.I have a regular coffee pot but I can't remember the last time I used it. It must be over 5 years! I would recommend this to anyone who loves coffee and not everyone in the household wants some of those wasted 12-cups as we had grown up with.
