review/summary: It lasts!review/text: I bought this little chopper about five years ago, half expecting that the blades would dull and I'd soon regret it. Not so. It still works well after several years of use. It mostly gets used for veggies in my kitchen. I especially like to use it for chopping onions and garlic, to spare myself the tears and to prevent my hands from getting smelly.
