review/summary: Just like my old one....so farreview/text: I read many reviews before ordering this. Like many others I had an old (at least 20 years old) Pyrex measuring cup and it broke the other day. You could barely read the measurements on my old one so I wasn't too upset. I received my new one today and compared it to the old one, visually at least. It is almost identical in height and width. I did measurements and both measured liquids exactly the same. Several people had complained about the spout dripping so I tested that with several liquids. I had no dripping, it poured great. Someone stated that it was made in China and therefore not as good a product. Well unless they are lying to me, mine states made in the USA on the side. The only difference I can see visually is that when looking down on it the glass appears bluish rather than clear whitish. The thickness of the cup is identical too, several had stated that their new one was thinner, mine was not any different for the old one. The only other MAJOR complaint was that the new measuring cups shattered in the microwave. I have not had the chance to find this out for myself. I did buy it to boil water and melt butter in the microwave so it won't be long before I test for this problem. If it does shatter, I will be posting a follow-up. I sure hope it lasts as long as the first one.
