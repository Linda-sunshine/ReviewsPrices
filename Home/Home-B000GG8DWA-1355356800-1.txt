review/summary: Perfect Little SpaceHeaterreview/text: This little heater really does the trick. Keeps my 8x8x8 room a comfortalbe 70 degrees on the low setting. Light weight and easy to use. Safety features work well with small pets (or Children). Well worth the money and the money saved on my power bill is going to be very nice as well.
