review/summary: Cheap Hosereview/text: I wanted a vacuum that was lightweight and was powerful enough to pick up pet hair and dirt. It is powerful and lightweight- exactly what I thought I wanted but....the hose is flimsy and constantly gets twisted. Even though it cleans well and is lightweight what good is it if the hose does not work properly. I wish I could find a replacement hose that is well made and fits this model.
