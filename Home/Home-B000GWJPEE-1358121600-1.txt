review/summary: Love Itreview/text: It is great for the price alone, but even better if you like penguins like myself. There is no lights on it, so nothing will light up the room if you have it on at night which is nice. It's easy to fill as you just take off the head, pick it up by the handle, fill it up and return. It has a dial so you can adjust how much mist is released which is very nice. Would be great for kids room.
