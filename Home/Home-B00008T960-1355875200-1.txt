review/summary: Pretty good!review/text: A much better alternative to using parchment paper or just the straight pan but this item is sort of difficult to clean (stays very oily) and mine got a small tear in it after a few months of light use. But it helps cooks things evenly, etc, etc. Pretty OK but I think there's a better one out there, somewhere.
