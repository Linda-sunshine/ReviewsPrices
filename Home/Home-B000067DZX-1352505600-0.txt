review/summary: waterreview/text: if you are not presently filtering your tap water, you should be. Used in conjunction with the Brita water pitcher it is a great product, if you are not sure you need this, draw a glass of water from your tap and let it sit for an hour or so, you may be unpleasantly surprised, as was I. Now we no longer see sediment or cloudy water and perhaps it's psychological but we believe it tastes better.
