review/summary: Very Impressedreview/text: I'll be honest, I bought this for the price, and expected to get something pretty poor in quality.I was pleasantly surprised to get a chair just as nice as the higher priced chairs found in my local furniture store.My wife loves it, it's very quiet, and it even fits my larger frame.I don't think you can get a nicer glider chair for the money.
