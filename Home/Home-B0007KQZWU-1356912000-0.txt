review/summary: Mediocrereview/text: I've been using them for less than one month and I regret this purchase. They look amazing when first opened, but loose their luster and stain on the first use. They cook evenly over low fire and so far are not sticky, even though all the pans are permanently stained now. I've followed the directions the company provides for cleaning (i.e. boil soapy water and then simmer for 15 minutes; allow to cool and then wipe clean. Use wooden spoon on tough stains), but it does not work. I've used other cuisart pots and pans before and had never been this disapointed.
