review/summary: 10 cup coffee makerreview/text: It is supposed to be a 12 cup coffee maker but after spilling several cups of coffee all over the counter and floor, I realized that the special patented lid prevents the carafe from filling all the way. So don't fill the coffee maker to the 12 cup mark, keep the max at 10 cups and you'll be ok. It does a good job making those 10 cups of coffee though. The spilled coffee did a great job leaving stains on the wall from spilling over the sides of the counter. I've never had a coffee maker overfill by bad design; of course, we only bought Mr. Coffee brand makers before. Cuisenart needs to wake up and fix this issue before someone sues them for property damage. Just make it a 10 cup coffee maker and everything else is fine.
