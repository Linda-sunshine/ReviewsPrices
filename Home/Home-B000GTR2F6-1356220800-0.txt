review/summary: Outstandingreview/text: Everything I expected and wanted in a Keurig: Knowing I'll have a perfectly brewed cup of tea in mere seconds gets me out of bed in the morning. Setting up was incredibly easy, and it has worked perfectly from the first cup. The reservoir holds just the right amount for me for a whole day, and I love the option of choosing from 5 cup sizes. A perfect fit every time!
