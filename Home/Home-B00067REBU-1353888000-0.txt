review/summary: Works very well!review/text: I have held off on writing my review for a few months to see how I felt about this machine, and I just have to say that I love it! I make bread once or twice a week and have not had a bad loaf yet! I did not use the recipes in the booklet however so I can not be a judge of them. I have started using a 2-pound loaf express-bake recipe and it is awesome! I have a loaf of bread in under an hour that turns out perfect every time. I will update in the future on how long it holds up.
