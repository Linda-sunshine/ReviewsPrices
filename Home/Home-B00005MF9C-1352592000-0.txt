review/summary: Not very good.review/text: I bought this based on the reviews, and am really not happy with it. The coffee smells awful when you're making it, which is a pretty good indication of how it's going to taste. And it tastes pretty bad. I purchased this coffee maker because I thought it was convenient that it comes with a cup and it brews right into it, and the permanent filter is a great idea. Unfortunately the filter lets coffee grounds through (I buy ground coffee, maybe if I made a coarser grind myself it would be different, but why bother). Just to make sure it wasn't a bad batch, or that I wasn't using the right amounts of things, I bought 3 different brands of coffee and tried different amounts from 2 tbsp up to 6. It just comes out rancid every time.I ended up buying the Mr Coffee 4-cup coffee maker for the same price and it's a thousand times better. I'll be returning this one.
