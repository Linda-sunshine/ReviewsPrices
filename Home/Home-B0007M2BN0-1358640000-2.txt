review/summary: I think this thing is great!review/text: I have been using this for a few weeks now, and it always works perfectly- ever time! I am still reluctant because some of the reviews say it explodes in the microwave, but I don't want to give up on this yet. This is so easy and carefree.I have found the design to be completely dangerous! There are no handles and the lid does not screw on. The whole thing gets really hot! My solution is to put it in a baking dish with handles and leave it in the microwave at least 30 minutes before trying to get the eggs out. They always taste great and peel easily.
