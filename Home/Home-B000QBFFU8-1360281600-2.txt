review/summary: Amazingreview/text: I have only seen juicers at juice bars and was skeptical about buying one but this thing is awesome. I put it to the test by making a combination juice of carrots, apples, hard pears, spinach and parsley by only adjusting the speed appropriately rather than shutting it down. It was leak free and gave me almost saw dust for the pulp and amazing pulp free juice on the other end. I am blown away with this product!
