review/summary: Quick-n-easy!!review/text: I bought this pressure cooker almost 2 years ago and I use it on average two or three times/week. Once you familiarize yourself with the cooker by reading the owners manual, you will love it! A whole chicken (4-5 lbs) is done in 26 minutes (compared to 1.5 hrs in 350 degree oven)! My absolute favorite is baby back ribs - I can pressure cook an entire rack (cut up in 2-3 bone sections) in 25 minutes, take them out, baste with BBQ sauce, and finish them up on the grill x 8-10 minutes (on low) - you would think that they've been in a cooker all day - so tender, they fall off the bone! I've also cooked lots of vegetables and am very happy with the results. It takes approximately 8 minutes for the cooker to come up to full pressure, so add that on to cook time(s) you find in the book. I would buy this product again in a heartbeat!
