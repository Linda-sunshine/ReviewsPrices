review/summary: Great Gadget!review/text: So far, I've only used it for zuc's and it does a GREAT job on making them into "veggie noodles". This is a fun way to liven up my daily salads, too. All I've had to do to clean it is rinse under running warm water.My husband is already asking for fried potato noodles...aka/ hashbrowns!The blades are VERY sharp, so be careful!!
