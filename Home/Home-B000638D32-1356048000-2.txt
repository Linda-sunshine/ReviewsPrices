review/summary: A great knifereview/text: Not that this knife needs another 5 star review, but it's a good chef's knife. I'm not a chef or anything, but I believe that you don't need huge knife sets -- just a good chef's knife and a good paring knife and you can cook the vast majority of things. This knife definitely fits the bill. It feels good in the hand, is very sturdy, and it's a good size for chopping and dicing. I've been using it for over a year now and I have had to sharpen one or two times since it gets so much use.
