review/summary: didn't last a monthreview/text: Made descent coffee, carafe is nice, nice looking and work fine till it died. Got to replace Bunn HG that I need to send back every two or three months because they keep dieing. Well time to pull the Bunn out of the box again and look for something else before this one gives up the ghost and I have to send it back to Bunn for the forth time.
