review/summary: Great skilletreview/text: This is an amazing price for a great skillet that will outlive me. In fact I think I'll add it to my will!With occasional re-seasoning, this pan lasts and lasts. It cooks so evenly and easily and is a cinch to clean. Eggs, chicken, steak, vegetables, PIZZA (yes - I used this recipe and it blew my mind: [...]/cast-iron-pizza/ ), anything you can cook can be cooked better in this skillet.The 10 1/4 is a good size. I think I'd have a lot of trouble lifting anything larger, but it accommodates a good amount of food. I cooked four chicken thighs in it the other night and there was plenty of room.Bonus points for extra iron content in your food, ladies!
