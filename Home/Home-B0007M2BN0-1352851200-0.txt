review/summary: Less Mess Than Standard Methodsreview/text: Perfect for those who multi-task. I can place the boiler in the microwave and leave for 10 minutes (8 to hard boil-2 to sit). Take out and run under cold water for a few seconds. Then peel and eat. Bought 3 of these as gifts since my initial purchase several months ago.
