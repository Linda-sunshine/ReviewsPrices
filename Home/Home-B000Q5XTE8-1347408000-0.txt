review/summary: Ok--will update after I have had it awhilereview/text: First the shipping was very fast..once I saw the box and how it was shipped I could see why. The box was mangled and it looked like an entire roll of tape was used to keep what was in from coming out. Inside the box just as bad. Looked like parts had been dumped loose into the box and everything was dusty. The chair itself was fine for the most part. Some of the plastic was scratched up but nothing major. The chair was easy to assemble even without having included instructions. There were two little screws that were missing that attched by the plastic cover where the back joined the seat. I had plenty of screws that fit the bill. The chair seems sturdy and comfortable will update after I have had it awhile. It is not pretty and looks cheap but is still sturdy and comfortable.
