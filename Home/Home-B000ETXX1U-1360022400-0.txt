review/summary: Awesome - inlfate AND deflatereview/text: This bed covers everything I was looking for - even coverage, nice carry bag, deflate option, decent height, quality construction.The deflate option is extremely convenient and well worth spending the money on. To put this away all you do is click the two pumps over to deflate and let it go for five minutes. When it's done you can roll it up with NO HASSLE, and the case is sized so that you aren't struggling to get it back in there.Great buy, I recommend this to others.
