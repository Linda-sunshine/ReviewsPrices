review/summary: Krups Grinder 203-42review/text: Have purchased two, the first lasted about 5 seconds and stopped working, it had a loose wire that shorted the unit. Amazon replaced it, the new unit lasted 5 seconds before it stopped working and filled the house with acrid burn wire smell. It has been returned and I will source a better product.
