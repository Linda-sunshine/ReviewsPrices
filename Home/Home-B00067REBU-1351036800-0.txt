review/summary: Love love love it!!review/text: Not only is it super easy to use but I have a friend who has the same exact model that is ten years old..looks the exact same...we both agree when it ain't broke...don't change it!!! I tried her bread machine first and fell in love with it...hoping that the model was similar to the ten year old model, I bought the same machine...I am so happy I did!!! The bread bakes evenly, comes out super easy, and the machine itself is super easy to handle! I really can't say enough about this machine. If you are a novice or really experienced, this machine works great for any and all levels. I promote my machine to anyone who is interested in a bread maker!!Thanks!
