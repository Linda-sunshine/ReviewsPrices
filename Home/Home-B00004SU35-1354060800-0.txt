review/summary: Great popperreview/text: I've been using this for a while now and prefer popcorn out of this beyond any air popper. I've found that adding a bit more oil than recommended seems to work best for me to have the popped kernels lightly coated for better flavor and salt stickiness. Also have an exceptionally low number of unpopped kernels compared to any other method. Quality of parts seems to have held up well so far, including the little plastic gear on the top.I've found that regardless of the amount of oil I use, some of it does fly out of the little gaps when cooking so I've begun to wear a kitchen mitt when using it so I don't get hit on the hand by the hot oil.
