review/summary: Once you're used it, you'll never go backreview/text: I was chatting with some fellow tea-drinkers on Twitter this morning and came to get the link to this mug-warmer. As others have noted, it may not rewarm a mug whose contents have gone cold, but if you put the mug on the warmer right after filling it, the contents will stay nice and hot for as long as it takes you to drink them. (It's always a little disorienting to be in Starbucks and take a lukewarm swig of whatever I've been sitting there with for the last hour.)If this puppy ever dies, I'll immediately buy a new one -- but after two and a half years of daily use, it keeps chugging along. Best $10 I ever spent.
