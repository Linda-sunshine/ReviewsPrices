review/summary: Excellent so farreview/text: We were struggling with our big knife. We knew we needed a replacement but were undecided. I remembered the Ginsu commercials: never needs sharpening, excellent steel. So I ordered it. We are not disappointed. The big knife cuts our loaves of bread nicely, the presentation is standard, I mean, not beyond expectations but that's what all these knife sets offer today. I am sorry I cannot say anything yet about durability but the price was right too.
