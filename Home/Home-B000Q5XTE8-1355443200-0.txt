review/summary: Very comfortable, amazing customer service from manufacturerreview/text: The chair is VERY comfortable and the adjustments on it make it even better. Unfortunately, my chair arrived with one of the adjustment levers completely shattered. I contacted the manufacturer through email about the lever and asked if I could receive another -- within 2 days a new lever was in my mailbox, amazing. I swapped the lever out and the chair is now brand new again! Between the comfort of the chair and the quality of the manufacturer, I will definitely purchase items from them in the future.
