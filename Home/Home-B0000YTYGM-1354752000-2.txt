review/summary: Biggest piece of crap.review/text: I had my last coffee maker for 10 YEARS. This one broke in less than 5 months. It's nice that the carafe keeps the coffee warm, but the rest is chintzy. There is a hole in the back leaks water if you even try and make a full pot, so it doesnt make as much coffee as it advertises. On top of that it is very easy to end up with a kitchen full of grounds and muddy water, if the lid is the slightest bid off or not in proper alignment. While all of that sucks, I was willing to put up with it until my coffee maker stopped telling me how much water i had put in. This is kind of important if you are making CUPS of coffee. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.Now, I do understand things break, but their customer service was just as chintzy as their product.
