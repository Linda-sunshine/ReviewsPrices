review/summary: WOWreview/text: I am giving a 5 star rating because this machine is a total powerhouse juicer. Compared to a much earlier Hamilton Beach juice extractor I had, the pulp is practically dry. My old juicer, the pulp was pretty mushy.I am pleased with the simplicity of the on/off switch and single speed. This machine runs at 1.1 horsepower/800Watts, so it is not quiet, which I don't mind at all.Amazingly enough, because of the intense speed, the juice yield is about a 25% more than the old 400+ Watt (forget exact amount) juicer.Anyhow, I recommend this machine to those who cannot afford the rather pricy juice extractors with similar speeds.
