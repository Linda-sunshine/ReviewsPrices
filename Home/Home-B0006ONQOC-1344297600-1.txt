review/summary: Cuisinart ICE-30BC Pure Indulgence Frozen Dessert Makerreview/text: Excellent product. Sturdy, easy to use and consistent perfect results. I am using it to make tasty, non-fat yogurt creations and it has been working out better than I had hoped. Make sure to read the instructions to avoid any confusion. The recipes included are good for beginners but don't be afraid get experimental. It is nice to know that you can have quality frozen treats and be secure that you know exactly what ingredients have been used. It is an excellent kitchen tool for special or restrictive diets.
