review/summary: Panasonic Bread Makerreview/text: So easy to use. Just toss in all ingredients, press a few buttons, and presto - delicious, homemade breads. Easy-to-follow instructions. Well worth the price. I've always been a big fan of Panasonic products and this bread machine is no exception. I would highly recommend it to everyone.
