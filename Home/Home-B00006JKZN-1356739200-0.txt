review/summary: Wonderful Waffles!!review/text: Excellent old-fashioned waffles like we made in the 60's. But then it is a Cuisinart product so it has to be great. Many Cuisinart appliances were beyond my budget when we were a young family back then, but Amazon offered such a great price on this waffle iron, I was able to gift my daughter with this. Works great right out of package and is so much better than the thick Belgian waffles everyone seems to be making nowadays.
