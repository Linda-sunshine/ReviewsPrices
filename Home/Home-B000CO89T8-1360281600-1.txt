review/summary: Not as good as expected from Mr. Coffeereview/text: I had an &#34;off the wall brand&#34; coffee cup warmer sitting on my desk at work for years. LOVED IT! At times, my hot tea would be too hot, but I was ok with it. But, after many years of use, it died. I couldn't find another one like it. So, I researched the internet, found & read reviews on the different coffee cup warmers. They all had positive & negative feedback. But, Mr. Coffee had the least negativity. The main complaint was that it didn't get very hot, and barely kept your beverage warm. I gave it a chance anyway because of the brand. Well, it DOESN'T keep my hot tea hot like my old warmer. At best, it keeps my tea &#34;luke warm&#34;. My tea doesn't get totally cold as it would without a warmer. But, I do find that sometimes, I still get up & pop my tea in the microwave to make it hot, and then I put it back on my warmer. I guess I am spoiled by the old warmer I had. It's better than nothing.
