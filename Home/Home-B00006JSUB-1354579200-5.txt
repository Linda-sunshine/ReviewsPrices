review/summary: What can you cook in this?review/text: Too small for cooking anything at all. The sides are only about 1.5&#34; tall, so any splatters of grease go everywhere. It is about the correct size for cooking one egg, but that sticks like glue! Do not buy this skillet. Choose something larger if you intend to use it for anything except an ash tray.
