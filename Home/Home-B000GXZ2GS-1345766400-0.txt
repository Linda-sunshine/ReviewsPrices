review/summary: One for home -- and one for the roadreview/text: The AeroPress makes wonderful coffee. Not only do I keep one in the kitchen, but I also keep one in my suitcase along with all my other travel supplies (I travel a bunch). Traveling used to mean lousy coffee first thing in the morning. Not anymore. I think AeroPress coffee is easily comparable to -- or better than -- Starbucks' Clover machine coffee, which is also terrific.
