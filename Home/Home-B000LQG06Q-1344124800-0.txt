review/summary: Overprice non-memory foam mattress topperreview/text: I was very disappointed in this mattress topper. I was so excited to get this. I tried it for one week but my sleep was so terrible that I decided to return it. Like the other reviewers said, it's not very memory-foam-ish. It doesn't spring back up when you put your hand on it. It's just a bit denser than a regular egg-carton foam topper. I wanted some extra padding on my futon mattress because I was starting to feel a hint of the metal bars on my bed frame. However, I could still feel the metal bars even after I put the topper on! I was better off just buying a quilt on sale for less money but provided better padding than the topper. I was fine with the minty smell - it made me think of mint chocolate chip ice cream which I bought later that week.ps - I do not weigh that much and my futon mattress is not the thin cheapy Walmart/Target type so my bed issues were not like I had a total crap problem and expected the product to work miracles.
