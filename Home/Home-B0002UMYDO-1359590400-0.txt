review/summary: This Cat Lady is in love with this can opener!review/text: I kept having to lift the can opener then restart it when it would jam. This was the case with many different can openers. It became easier for me to use a manual can opener. I then started the search for an &#34;Industrial Can Opener&#34; that would work for me, instead of me working for it! I couldn't be happier. I hope I stay this happy after time and the blade bends or dulls. Many can opener companies force you to throw away the whole can opener instead of being able to replace the bent or dull blade.
