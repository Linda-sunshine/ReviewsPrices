review/summary: Cuisinart still doing it.review/text: We had an older version of this unit that my wife loved and used and used and used. She used it so much that eventually some of the plastic components wore out. When we went looking for replacement parts, we foound it was almost as inexpensive to buy the whole unit, so that's just what we did. It's almost exactly the same as the old one - just a few cosmetic changes.
