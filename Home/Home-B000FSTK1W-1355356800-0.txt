review/summary: Perfectionreview/text: This thing is amazing. I may buy a million more and toss the metal shower organizers for good. I'm sick of those stupid things rusting all over. This is fully plastic, but solid well made plastic. It's really on the wall, with some decently heavy stuff in it. You wouldn't think it would hold 3-4 bottles plus razors and poofy things, but it really does. This is the answer to your prayers, I promise. If you're sick of rust and an unorganized shower, I don't see a single reason why you wouldn't like this. It's not even expensive. I would literally pay twice as much for this because I'm certainly sunk more into those rusting shelves over the years.
