review/summary: The Best Popper Ever!review/text: I bought this popper several years ago to replace the popcorn I popped in the microwave. No regrets & since I followed the instructions to a t, I've never had a problem. My niece got a kick out of constantly cranking & not burning the corn, I got one for her, too. She makes popcorn when her friends have sleepovers. A fun gadget to use & maintenance is minimal. Just make sure you don't drop the pan; it dents easily.
