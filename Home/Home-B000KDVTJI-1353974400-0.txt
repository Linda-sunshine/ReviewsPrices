review/summary: Love my Kettlereview/text: I purchased this kettle a month or so ago and love it. It looks beautiful, and works a charm. I don't make my tea in the pot, but instead use it to heat water to steep tea in my cup or teapot. It holds more than enough for the teapot or to make several cups of tea at once. Some of the viewers have mentioned it's loud, but I have to wonder just how quiet they want their kitchen? It's no louder than myBUNN coffee pot, and it looks nicer. :o) Glad I bought it.
