review/summary: Better than a $100 Home Espresso Machinereview/text: I have had a Delonghi Bar 32 home espresso machine for a few months. Then this morning I couldn't find all the parts. In desperation, I dusted off the old Aeropress and made a cup.Yeah, it's a better cup than the Delonghi machine. Much better. Few home machines can really get the strong bitterness of real espresso right, and they cost hundreds. This one is less than $50.Really simple, probably the best bang for the buck coffee you can buy.
