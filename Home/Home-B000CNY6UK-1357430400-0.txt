review/summary: Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Makerreview/text: First, I have to say, this is my first Moka Maker (I've only started drinking coffee recently). My plan was to get a traditional Moka Pot and good finely ground coffee appropriate for this machine. Bialetti is a traditional Italian company and I decided to get the aluminium pot (although some people recommended stainless steel pots).Although this is the big Moka Maker (6-cup), the cup is the Italian measure and even if you make it full, the amount of coffee is worth of 2-3 people. The positive site is the simple manipulation, prepare and cleaning of the device. However, I am little disappointed with the fact that the coffee I bought (Italian coffee specifically made for Moka pots) drops through the filter and gets to the lower container (which should not happen). It's either because of the coffee grind or the holes in the filter are too big. I will try coffee with coarser grind (not the espresso grind).
