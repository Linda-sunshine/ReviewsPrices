review/summary: This is not a Commercial Juicer.review/text: I bought this because it was a great price. On sale for $150. I have other Omega products and LOVE them. This one is probably great too. The problem is....It's not a COMMERCIAL juicer, like it says. We bought this to use in our business. When we opened the box there is a large sticker which says....For Home use only. This makes the product useless for me. Now saying that, I love the Omega Juicers. Highly recommend them for anyone looking for a great, home juicer. This is just poorly advertised. I sent it back before using it.
