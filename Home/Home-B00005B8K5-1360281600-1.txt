review/summary: Classic pyrex.review/text: Not much to say as it appears to be the same pyrex it has always been. Great seal and gets the job done. My only issue with the pyrex would be the lids. We just recently ordered the lids only from the distributor b/c, although they were several years old, the lids themselves did crack on the edges. That said, we still ordered more and like pyrex more than any other brand we have found.
