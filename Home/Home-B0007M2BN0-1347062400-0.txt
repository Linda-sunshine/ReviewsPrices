review/summary: Greatreview/text: I had one of these before & dropped it so it split but every pet owner should own one of these. I don't use it in the car since I have 2 Bullmastiff's so they need more water than this holds so have a Pet Galley (unfortunately no longer made) but this unit I can bungie to my bike rack so when exercise dogs on bike they have water. Also do 2 miles at extended walk with my power chair & use a big hook to hang from the back so when stop for a rest again they have water. Only negative is its hard to clean even with a bottle brush so never leave water in it but if empty after each use corners don't discolor. Water never spills, wouldn't even in a car so if you have small pets this would be plenty of water till next stop traveling. Highly recommend!
