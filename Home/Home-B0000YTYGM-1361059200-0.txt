review/summary: Good coffeereview/text: The only reasons for four stars is the top to the coffee maker - does not pour well without lining it up precisely with the 'pour' mark that disappears after first couple of uses (its is a tiny black line on a black lid and you cannot find it). More of a daily annoyance than something that makes the coffeemaker nonfunctional. I really, really miss my old Krups, but it is not made anymore.
