review/summary: Okay for small spaces as long as your expectations are realisticreview/text: Bought this for a 6' X 12' walk in storage closet. I leave it plugged in 24/7 during the summer months, and it does work, but it's not fast....and I definitely wouldn't expect it to do the job in an area much larger than this closet. Would be great if you could set the desired humidity level so it would turn off and on automatically, but for the price, that's probably a bit much to expect. It is SUPER QUIET, hard to even tell it's running. I've only used it one summer so can't say how long it will last, but for a small unit with a reasonable price, I have found it to be adequate for what I needed in this closet. (It also has a long cord, which I find to be very helpful and somewhat surprising on such a small appliance.)
