review/summary: Memory Foam Mattress Topperreview/text: I was happy to find a mattress topper for a king bed that wasn't outrageously expensive. This topper is only 2' thick, but made our bed SO much more comfortable! It does smell a little minty right now, but that should fade over time. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.
