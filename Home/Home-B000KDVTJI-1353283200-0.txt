review/summary: faulty auto shut offreview/text: This would be a great deal, it is quick to boil and large capacity, but the auto-shutoff doesn't work. Additionally I have a feeling that while I have only owned it for a week or two, it will rust. I am led to that belief based on imperfections in the surface.
