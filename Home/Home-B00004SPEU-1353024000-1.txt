review/summary: Short change equals short-changedreview/text: These grinders are indestructible. They do a great job and last forever. Why only 1 star? Krups has recently shortened the electrical cord on this appliance by 23 INCHES. Unbelievable, but true. Did they think we wouldn't notice? Did they try it out for themselves in a regular kitchen that doesn't have electrical outlets every 12" on the counters and/or backsplash?Just how much money did they save themselves by eliminating that extra 23" of cording? Did the customer's experience factor into the decision? The use of the grinder is severely limited when there's not enough electrical cord to reach a convenient outlet.
