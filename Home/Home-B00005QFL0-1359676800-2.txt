review/summary: Great product!review/text: This was my first bread machine ever. I've always hand made my own bread, but don't always have the time to wait for the various stages, so my husband bought this for me for Christmas. I love it! You put the ingredients in, select the various bake and loaf options, and walk away. It's so easy, and makes terrific bread. I've adapted my grandmother's recipe that I've always used so now I can make her bread in the machine, too.After seeing how easy it is to use, my mother bought one for herself. She's not at all technologically or mechanically savvy and managed to ruin the first loaf of bread she made because she didn't put the inner pan in properly (you put it in at an angle and then turn it to &#34;lock&#34; it into place--she didn't turn it). Since then, though, she's been doing fine with it.The machine is fairly quiet--you hear sounds out of it, but it's very subtle. It does tend to &#34;walk&#34; on the counter just a bit during the kneading process, but as long as you allow extra space for it, it shouldn't be an issue. It doesn't walk far; maybe an inch or two.I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to make homemade bread easily!
