review/summary: Didn't fit my Delonghi EC155 basketreview/text: After reading all the reviews of people recommending this tamper for the Delonghi EC155, I was excited. I love finding good deals. However, I was disappointed when I first used it. The small side was too small and the large side was too large.I'm beginning to think I received a different tamper than everyone else, due to all the positive reviews. The EC155 needs a tamper that is 52mm. This one is only 50mm. I would not recommend this tamper for the Delonghi EC155.As for the tamper itself, it's a great value buy. Yeah, it's cheap feeling and tricky to use, but you are not gonna find a better deal on a tamper anywhere else. Just make sure it fits your machine!
