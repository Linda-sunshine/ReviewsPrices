review/summary: extremely happy I purchasedreview/text: I read reviews on several Thermal coffee makers, there were over 300 good reviews on this particular maker, and over 100 poor reviews. I believe there are probably over a hundred people you could not please even with perfection. I love this Coffee maker and it meets all expectations I had. My wife and I decided we wanted a thermal maker after visiting her mother in Germany. Her mother had a thermal pot we fell in love with, and it was not availible in U.S. 110 volt.we wanted one that was equal in quality. after reading reviews on several makers we decided on Cuisinart DTC-975BKN, Reason 1: it is 12 Cup, Others were mostly 8 and 10 cup. Reason 2: we finally have a Carafe that does not drip when pouring. Reason 3: Keeps our coffee hot for up to 4 hours, without losing the fine coffee aroma and taste. Reason 4: the valve in the top that seals for vacuum is a one of a kind design, and the engineer that came up with deserves a healthy Bonus from Cruisinart, it's fantastic. Reason 5: the removeable ground basket is great for cleaning and rinsing out. Reason 6: this maker is not an eye sore sitting on our kitchen counter, and it has quality workmanship. I would reccommend this maker to any consumer looking for a Thermal coffeemaker, if you are one of those hundred or so that can't be pleased don't buy it, because you'll just write a negitive review on a great product, and besides you need to leave more of them for the consumer that will appreciate them.
