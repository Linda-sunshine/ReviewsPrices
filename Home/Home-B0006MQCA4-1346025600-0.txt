review/summary: Fewer refills and great tasting water!review/text: I bought this to replace my old Brita pitcher. I liked the slim design which fits off to one side in the fridge very nicely. I was also pleased that it held more water so I am not continually refilling it. We still need to refill about once every day or so, but if it were any bigger it would be too heavy to carry back and forth from the sink. As it is, it is no problem and has easy handle spots to grab when transporting. The water tastes great and I had read it removes even more junk from the water than my old pitcher. Maybe it's psychological, but I honestly think it tastes a bit better too. Very happy with this pitcher and would recommend it to anyone. We have had it for maybe a month or two, and so far no problems and delightful water!
