review/summary: just OKreview/text: Was going to buy a Food processor then went with this because it has different blades sizes. Don't think it is worth its price. Blades are not that sharp, so may not slice tomatoes or mushy items. Also have a hard time slicing onions of you don't take out a couple of outer layers. Thin slices way too thin. Just an ok product
