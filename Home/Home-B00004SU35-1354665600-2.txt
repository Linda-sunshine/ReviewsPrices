review/summary: Love my Whirley-Popreview/text: This is my second Whirley-Pop in 10 years, only because I accidently crushed my old on while moving (hint: don't put it in a box at the bottom of the stack). The one complaint I had about my old one is that old had gotten up into the turning mechanism and would splatter out burning me a little. However, I think that may have been because I didn't think to clean that part after use early on. Otherwise - it worked like a dream and I am so happy to have another after trying to be without a Whirley-pop for a year.
