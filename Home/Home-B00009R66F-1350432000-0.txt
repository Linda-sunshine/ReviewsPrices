review/summary: Two separate water chambers are a must!review/text: I bought this to replace my Bissle carpet cleaner and I am so glad to have made the switch to the Hoover. I have a very active home with two large dogs and two boys running constantly and so when my Bissel bit the dust so to speak, I had to have a replacement. So far I have used this on 3 rooms and so far I have been very pleased. The number one reason I would recommend the Hoover over a Bissel is the fact that it has two separate water chambers. If for no other reason, use the Hoover as this makes discarding the dirty water and filling the clean water so much easier and less messy because of the two separate chambers. The only reason I gave it a 4 star review is because it does not have a rince option because you mix the detergent directly into the clean water resevour. You still can preform a rinse by adding only clean water and leaving out your detergent, but it is not an option while you are cleaning.
