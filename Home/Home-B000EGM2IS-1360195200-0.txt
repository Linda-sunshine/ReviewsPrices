review/summary: A super successful purchasereview/text: I have had one of these for years and cannot imagine not having one. Over the years I have given many of them for gifts. They are great in the home and my daughter keeps one at her work for quick cups of tea or cider or hot chocolate on her break, or cup of noodles for lunch and oatmeal for breakfast. I rarely use my kettle anymore as this is so fast and convenient. This particular one I purchase for a 94-year old friend who is starting to have weakness in her wrist. Because of this weakness her stove-top kettle was getting a bit difficult to handle. With the ease of this unit she is back in business for her cups of tea and she is completely happy with it. Oh, as an after note. I have purchased one of these for each of my kids as they went off to college and they said it was invaluable in the dorms. One of my &#34;favorite things&#34;. I'm not Oprah, but still.
