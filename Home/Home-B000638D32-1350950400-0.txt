review/summary: Love this knife!review/text: We got this knife last year, and it is still my favorite knife! I use it for meat, veg, and anything that doesn't require serrated edge (ie. bread). It is sharp and durable. I hone it every few weeks, to ensure that it stays sharp. For $25, I can't think of a better knife. I love it more than any kitchen knives I've used. Definitely recommend. You won't regret it.
