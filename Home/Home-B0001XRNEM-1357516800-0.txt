review/summary: Unhappy Customerreview/text: I received the Espresso Tamper wrapped in a plastic bag then in a paper bubble wrap envelope. The product is marred on the large end and scratched up. It is a new Tamper and I feel for the money paid and especially the cost of shipping I should have received a quality tamper.Unhappy Customer!
