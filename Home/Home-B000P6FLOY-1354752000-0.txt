review/summary: Good thermometerreview/text: Bought this to use during my Thanksgiving turkey cooking, and I am very pleased. I love the digital readout, the timer, and the fact that you can set it to go off at a selected temperature. That makes the chance of wandering off and forgetting about dinner less likely!
