review/summary: EXCELLENT SKILLET & **MADE IN THE USA**review/text: You will enjoy this skillet, a lot! The Lodge company manufactures cookware which is non-stick, NO chemical coating, pre-seasoned, *MADE IN THE USA*. Couldn't find a 15" Lodge lid, but I had another manufacturer's lid which happened to fit. Easy to clean...hot water (no soap), plastic brush & dry very well. Oil it occasionally. Use oven mitts. Store it in the oven, as you will use it frequently. This 15" skillet easily fit 12 chicken thighs, browned and then baked with lots of vegetables and sauce. Plan to gradually transition to all Lodge cookware, for reasons of excellent quality & value, safe & healthy cooking...and buying American-Made.
