review/summary: OK alarm clock, poor radioreview/text: This clock radio has a good display, and the controls are easy to use. The alarm functions are sufficient or better than my requirements. These have been discussed in detail in other reviews. The radio function is very important to me, and this clock radio did not meet my requirements. The information found in other reviews did not provide enough information to warn me away from this clock radio. The radio will not be a problem for many users. If you listen to a strong station and don't live in a fringe reception area, you may find the radio perfectly fine for you. Details follow.The radio has poor sensitivity and terrible selectivity. In common terms, this radio will not pick up many weak stations and it will not separate one station from another. You can not tune in a weak station that happens to be by a strong station. FM radios have a characteristic called the capture effect -- once a station is tuned, the radio sort of hangs on to it, even if the radio is tuned slightly off frequency. This is a useful function, if you can tune the stations you want. At my house, the local public radio station is not strong, but my old clock radio and all the others in the house can tune it. The new Sony ICF-C-318 would not even detect this station -- not even noisy reception. Instead, it picked up a single strong station at the low end of the band and locked on to it over 20% of the tuning range. Across the remainder of the FM band, there were a few stations that could capture the receiver. Therefore, this radio is only suitable for receiving strong stations or stations that are nowhere near a strong station's frequency.
