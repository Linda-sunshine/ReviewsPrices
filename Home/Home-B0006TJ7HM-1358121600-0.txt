review/summary: You get what you pay for!review/text: I purchased this set for my wife for Christmas. Knowing that Ginsu is suppose to be one of the best cutlery sets you can buy for a decent price. They are suppose to never need sharpening and to be honest they are indeed very sharp. The knife block is nice and looks great up on the counter in the kitchen and there is a knife for most occasions. The issue is that they rust. We have only had the set out for about 3 weeks and already the blades are rusting. We use them and immediate hand wash and dry our dishes thoroughly. There is no reason to have rust appearing on the blades in my opinion. So if you want a cheap set that will get the job done, you should get these, however be ready to deal with rusting issues a month after you purchase them! I am very displeased in the product simply for this reason.
