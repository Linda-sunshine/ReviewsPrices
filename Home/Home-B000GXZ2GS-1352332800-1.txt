review/summary: Good, easy & quick: My daily morning coffee maker.review/text: Over the years I've made coffee in most of the known devices. Most of them now decorate the top of our kitchen cabinets. The two which have earned their counter space are a French Press (for crowds) and the Aerobie AeroPress, which has become my daily morning coffee maker.Here is why:I am the only coffee drinker, so I don't need but one cup (so long as that one cup is first rate).It is easy to use. Here is my drill:A) Fill the heating pot and turn it on.B) Measure freshly roasted beans into the grinder and turn it on.C) Put a filter in the AeroPress and place it on my mug.D) Pour the ground coffee into the AeroPress.E) Pour the water (which is almost, but not quite to boiling) onto the coffee.F) Wait ten seconds.G) Stir ten seconds.H) Press ten seconds.I) Remove the AeroPress and top up the coffee with more hot water.The coffee is excellent, and so satisfying that I don't feel the need for more than the one cup.The whole procedure takes less time than making a slice of toast, which can be done simultaneously.After several years of daily use, the rubber seal on the plunger wore down to the point that not all of the liquid was getting pushed through the coffee grounds. I called Aerobie Customer Support and was pleasantly surprised to find that the part sells for $3.00, shipped! So, exclusive of the energy to heat water, the annual cost of use is three or four dollars for filters and a dollar fifty for the seal, assuming yours will last about two years, as mine did.
