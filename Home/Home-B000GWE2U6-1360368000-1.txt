review/summary: Not the one they used to make .... sighreview/text: It looks the same in the picture - however, do not be deceived. This is a sub-standard re-boot of Crane's adorable, high quality products.I was forced to replace ribitt, my 3 year old Crane froggy humidifier after my adult daughter accidentally slaughtered him with the pull down attic stairs.We had lovingly cared for ribitt all these years. Occasionally washing him with white vinegar, a drop of bleach here and there. I mean he was just a pristine specimen of moisture giving goodness.However, upon receiving this imposter, it was quickly clear it was not the driods I was looking for ...The construction is far more thin, and frail. The froggy eye cap, barely rests on the top of the reservoir. The slightest bump, sends it reeling. The screw cap for the reservoir is very very cheaply made. On ribitt - a quick spin, and the cap would go free-wheeling down to a completely sealed and seated position.Finally, performance. Lets talk brass tack here. As previously mentioned - ribitt could absolutely kick it on the moisture front, CHURCH! This new guy, barely a spit. Ribitt could empty his reservoir overnight on the high setting. This guy on high - still has 75% left.Overall, disappointed. This was my fourth (and last) Crane product in this family. The previous 3, were all of the highest quality. It is a shame to see them cheapening up their product because they are getting greedy.
