review/summary: WOW!review/text: Just received my Capresso. kettle....it's very attractive. I made myself a cup of tea and heated water for an instant soup. The water heats much hotter than on my stove so my tea stayed hot much longer. Since electricity is cheaper than the propane I have to use I will save $ using this kettle. I use the French Press for making coffee and this will make it faster and it will stay hotter longer. Very, very satisfied..and did I mention how pretty it is!?.
