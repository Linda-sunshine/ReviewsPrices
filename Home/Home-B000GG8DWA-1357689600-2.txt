review/summary: Small, very lightweight, silent and effective, but build quality is suspectreview/text: First the good news: It works! It's dead quiet and very lightweight. About 3.7 lbs.Courtesy of my Amazon reward points, I paid under 2 bucks for it.Although it does look just the picture that currently depicts it (Jan 2013) it's very cheesy looking in person. The quality of materials and construction is really low, but I guess this is what you get for a ~$20 item of this type.Two settings; 400W and 800W. One bar is energized for the 400W setting, two for the 800W setting.I see no sign of UL certification but this is not surprising given what I see as a potentially very dangerous device. I would not leave this unit unattended with pets or small children. It can burn and ignite flammable materials easily.There is a safety tip-over switch which is good, the mesh screen over the heating elements cools very quickly when the unit is off, which is also good. Not good: The control dial on the right side of the unit has no visible markings when viewed from the front of the unit. Instead, you have to view the unit from the right side to see the settings. This is simply dumb industrial design and also dangerous. I would advise the manufacturer to mark the control dial so it's able to be seen from the front.The back and sides of the unit remain cool while on, although the top gets hot enough to burn flesh. There is an integrated handle on the back and cord wrap prongs.I'm using it to warm me in my very cold workspace. It's about 3-feet away and the warming is excellent. Not sure how it would work as a room-warming device, but that's for other folks to comment on.I am concerned about the super cheap build quality, but I'm pleased with the silent and (mostly) odorless heat. How long it will last due to the cheap construction and how safe it is remain open questions -- at least in my mind.I'll update with any new info.
