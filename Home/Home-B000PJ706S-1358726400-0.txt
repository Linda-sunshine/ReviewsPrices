review/summary: Shoddy quality - coming apart after 15 monthsreview/text: Well it was too good to be true. A product that looked really cool and would work well for years.So 15 months after buying it I have to write a review to serve as a warning to other buyers. It still works but a 1/4 inch gap has developed between the top of the handle and where the handle attaches to the glass. it has not broken yet but it will some time soon and in the mean time whenever it is used steam shoots out the gap. Shame really because it still looks kind of cool :(
