review/summary: Honeywell HHT-011 Air Filterreview/text: the one thing I do not like about Honeywell HHT-011 is it's loud and I have to turn up TV to hear. Other then that it does cut down on the smell of cigarettes, but only if you use the ionizer feature. I would not have purchased them (2) if I had known about noise. I previously had sharper image which were noise free, I only replaced them because they were old and worn out (they lasted 12 years!). Would have bought them, but the cost is very high.
