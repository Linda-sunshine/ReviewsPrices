review/summary: LOVE my new Jerdon Lighted Make-Up Mirror!review/text: I recently purchased the Jerdon lighted make-up mirror and am very pleased with it. The bulbs do not give off heat- which I love. Also, the 5X magnification is great for tweezing your brows (you can see EVERY little hair) and applying your eye make-up. I switch to that side after the rest of my make-up is put on. I would recommend this mirror; you won't be sorry.
