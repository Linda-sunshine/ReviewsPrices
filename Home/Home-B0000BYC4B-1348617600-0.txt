review/summary: leaksreview/text: I primarily used these on jars storing dry ingredients and thought they were great. I just tried it on a jar with wet ingredients last night and noticed severe leaking. The lid is a bit too flexible and didn't seal right. I am making a vanilla infusion where I have to shake the mixture every week until it is done. First time I shook it, I got liquid all over the outside of the jar. I ended up using the lid with some saran wrap to seal but I'm sure it's not a wonderful seal. The point of my review is that obviously these jar lids do not seal well.
