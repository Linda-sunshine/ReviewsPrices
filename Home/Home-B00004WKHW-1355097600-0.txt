review/summary: Fantastic product!review/text: This mini processor was the perfect item for me and my wife. We needed it for small amounts of food and making our own baby food. It works great, doesn't take up a ton of space and is easy to clean. If you don't need the capacity or just don't have the space for a larger model, this one is excellent.
