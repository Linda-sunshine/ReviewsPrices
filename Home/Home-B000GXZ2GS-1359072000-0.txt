review/summary: BEST COFFEE MAKER EVER!!review/text: All of the people that reviewed this with one stars are not using 175 f water. if you do not do this because of the way this works you will always get bitter coffee.Now to my review. I LOVE THIS COFFEE MAKER!!! its the best cup of coffee you will get outside of a starbucks or high end coffee house unless you want to spend 1000s on a maker. short and sweet review.
