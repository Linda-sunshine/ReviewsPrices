review/summary: Great alarm clock!review/text: This is a great alarm clock! Out of the box easy to set and use. Love the two alarms. One for the work week, one for the weekend! Nice compact size. Alarm buzzer is loud, radio easy to adjust. Adjusts for the time change for daylight savings time automatically. Great features! Battery back up too!! Does not take up alot of space on the nightstand. For me it was just as Goldilocks said "just right."
