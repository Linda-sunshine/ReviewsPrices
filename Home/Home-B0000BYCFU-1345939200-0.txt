review/summary: Great Productreview/text: I've been canning for a number of years using the hot water bath method. The Presto 23 Qt. Pressure/Canner cut my time in half. I find it very easy and safe to use. I also use the 8 Qt. pressure cooker for cooking, just had to get used to the pressure gauge on the 23 qt. verses the rocker on the 8 qt. Great Product, Ken
