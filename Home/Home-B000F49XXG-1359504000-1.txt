review/summary: So you're ready to move up from that old drip machinereview/text: If you're shopping for this espresso machine, you're probably a newbie. No problem. The good news: this machine is perfect for you. It's easy, small, simple, and makes very good espresso.Here's what you'll need to go with it. First, you'll need some small espresso/cappuccino cups because this machine pours your espresso straight into a serving cup. Whatever you pick, they have to be low because there isn't much room under the spigot. 7 ounce cups are perfect.You may read reviews that tell you that you need a "tamper," a small tool for pressing the espresso down into the machine. I'm sure it wouldn't hurt, but you don't really need it. The machine has one built in that will do the trick. You shouldn't be mashing your ground coffee down anyway because then the steam can't get through the brick you've made.Next, if you plan on steaming milk - and you should - then you're going to need a steaming pitcher. This one is perfect: http://www.amazon.com/Update-International-EP-12-Stainless-Frothing/dp/B000MR6I9I/ref=pd_sim_k_2. The price is right and this one is suitably tiny, because there isn't much room under the steaming wand. Get this one and it won't be a problem.If you're going to grind your own coffee - and again, you should - then you'll also need a grinder. Yes, you can go cheap on this one. But believe it or not, your grinder is as important as the machine. Cheap grinders spin fast and that speed burns your beans. You want a slow grinder. This one is great: http://www.amazon.com/Bodum-Bistro-Electric-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B0043095WW/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1359610978&sr;=1-1&keywords;=bodum+coffee+grinder. Wait! What kind of crazy person spends more on the grinder than the coffee machine? The kind of person who wants a good cup of coffee.Speaking of coffee, you need beans. Any beans will do, but you're better off with an espresso roast with this machine. Here is a great espresso roast: http://www.amazon.com/Coffee-Bean-Direct-Italian-Espresso/dp/B002GWFA1Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1359611478&sr;=8-1&keywords;=coffee+beans+direct.Finally, don't be intimidated, but you're going to need to read the directions. It's simple, but there are a few steps involved. For example, yes, the machine needs to pre-heat for 15 minutes. No sweat.When you're ready to go, there are two trays for the grounds. The big one is for a double (two cups being filled at the same time) and the small one is for a single. You'll need to hold the cups while the machine is working because of some minor vibrations. The complaints about the vibrations in some reviews are way overblown; it's no big deal.For a cappuccino, you fill half your cup(s) with espresso. Then you rotate the dial to activate the frother. Wait until the light turns green, then release the steam and heat a few ounces of milk in your new pitcher for less than a minute. The lower the fat in the milk, the easier it froths. Then you pour your milk and spoon the foam into the cup(s). Easy and rather fun.Don't be intimidated. If you've gotten far enough to start shopping for espresso machines, it's totally worth taking these additional steps. You are going to be amazed by how good the coffee will be. It's a little more work than I am usually up for on a crazy work/school morning, but it is one of my favorite parts of the weekend routine.
