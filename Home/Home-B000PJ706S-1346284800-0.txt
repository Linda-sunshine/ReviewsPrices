review/summary: Cheapreview/text: When opening this, I realized, that it was very cheap. It was very lightweight. It used the type of plastic that you just know isn't goint to last. Also, it doesn't look nearly as impressive as the photos. It looks cheap too. Kudos to the product photographer for making it look elegant. I did not notice any odors like other reviewers, but it didn't matter.There isn't any temperature guages, selections. You have one temperature which is activated by a sliding a piece of cheap plastic using your thumb.Lastly, I cannot speak to performance, since the unit did not work. I would avoid this even though it looks nice in the picture.
