review/summary: Great for pancakes!review/text: I'm so excited to use the new griddle. After having to replace all of my electric griddles, I decided to look for something that would last and not need replacing as often. This griddle is perfect. Fits great on our gas stove and is great quality. Can't go wrong with cast iron.
