review/summary: What a wonderful steam cleanerreview/text: I purchased this steam cleaner for an apartment where the carpets had not been cleaned in 10 years. Lets just say walking on this carpet with no shoes on, was something that did not happen.We started using this steam cleaner as soon as we put it together. It took us a little while to get the hang of it, but once we did, we just could not stop using it! The, what used to be, dingy, nasty severely stained carpet, came out looking almost new. The clean surge is fantastic for areas that are so caked in and just worn in dirt.We have had some issues with leaking when trying to dry. We found that removing the clean water tank solved the problem.All in all, this machine works great. We are so thrilled we purchased it.
