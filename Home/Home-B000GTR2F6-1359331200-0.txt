review/summary: Keurig B70 Platinum Brewing Systemreview/text: I purchased this coffee maker from Amazon. I have had it about 2 weeks and it brewed coffee excellent. There were no leaks or any problems. This morning I put a cup in and turned it to brew and nothing happened. It tried to pump and then shut off. I fooled around with it for about 1/2 hour, but finally declared that it had died. I really liked it and will order another as soon as I get a refund on this one. I hope I can give it a better review than I did this one.
