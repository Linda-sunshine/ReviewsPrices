review/summary: a great tumblerreview/text: so, by nights on weekends i rock n roll ([...]) and being the frontman, it's important to protect the "voice"....so instead of cigs and jack daniels, I go for tea. problem is, most bars n clubs don't keep tea on hand. Sure you can get a cup of hot, nasty tap water but when I got this here thermos, my suffering ended. it keeps the tea hot for hours, literally hours. so, if you rock n roll like me and you use tea to warm up your chords vocale, then look no further. and, if you're an average everyday (or other day) person who likes tea...you can hardly go wrong here with this thermos.
