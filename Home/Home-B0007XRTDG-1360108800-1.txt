review/summary: Be carefulreview/text: I love this skillet with one exception. The feet of this skillet are very slick. There is no traction. In turning the Salisbury steak the other night it took off on me and the next thing I knew it was dangling off the counter by the cord and dinner was on the floor. All it would have taken would be manufacturer flattening the foot portion of the leg a little or applying some sort of no slip/rubber foot. I will be sitting the skillet on my silpat for all future use as, in my opinion, this presents a serious safety hazard.
