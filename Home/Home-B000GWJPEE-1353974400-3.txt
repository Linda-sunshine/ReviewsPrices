review/summary: super quiet frogreview/text: i bought it for my son he has constant cough. this frog is SO quiet and has tons of &#34;steam&#34; i believe it has helped him a ton to be able to sleep without caughing all night. I would definately recommend it. After a couple of weeks of use i have noticed i have to buy the filter to demineralize the water i guess water in AZ is too hard.
