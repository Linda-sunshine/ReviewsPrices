review/summary: Spills when pouringreview/text: I liked the design of this kettle and it does boil quickly, however, it leaks almost every time I pour water from the kettle. This is a major flaw, as it means that I need to wipe the counter each time I pour, but it also unsafe as the hot water that spills can also flow off the counter and cause burns.
