review/summary: Used once then gave it awayreview/text: I was excited to try a new way of cooking after using Teflon and Stainless Steel pans for years. I'm health conscious, but a little lazy, and after reading many reviews thought this pan would solve the problem of eating off of potentially hazardous Teflon or sticky Stainless Steel. I used the pan to cook eggs and ham. I used coconut oil to cook with. The eggs stuck worse than my stainless steel pans. I know eggs are tough but I make them often so that is the test. The pan is pre-seasoned but that didn't seam to make a difference. It also seemed to me that some of the seasoning came off into my food. I hope it was safe. I cleaned with water and salt and it looked like the seasoning was coming off as the bottom of the pan was getting lighter than the rest of the pan.I searched the internet on the topic of cast iron and after reading many articles came to the conclusion that the problem with this pan is that it has a rough surface. I learned that the iron pans from the past and some current manufacturers use a different manufacturing process that produces a smooth surface which is much easier to clean and the food actually does slide out after proper seasoning. If you want a cheap pan it works but in my opinion is not worth the work to season and clean it if the food is going to stick anyway.
