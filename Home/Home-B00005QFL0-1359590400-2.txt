review/summary: Great bread makerreview/text: This is my first bread maker and I've made loaf after loaf of delicious breads. The reason for the 4 stars is because some of the recipes did not work for me. The Milk Bread didn't rise and the only other complaint is that the recipes use fractions that are not on my measurement cup. For instance 4 7/16 cups of flour (WTH?!) lol we did have a laugh on that one. But if you can figure out the math, you get delicious bread.
