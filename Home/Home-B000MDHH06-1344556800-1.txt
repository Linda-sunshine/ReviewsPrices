review/summary: So far so good for my first juicer.review/text: I've been using for two weeks straight everyday about, and its run like a champ. I've read all these reviews before purchase and took the necessary step that you must clean after usage. Cleaning takes about 3-5 minutes, easy.One warning following recipes, EASY ON THE GINGER!!! Goodness that stuff blew my mind when i used root, burned my eyes when juicing as well.Overall i'm satisfied with the product.Also it really doesn't splash around like everyone says, just hold the plunger above the hole at all times even when inserting food. Kale seems to cause the most mess, but thats from me trying to place alot in the hole, and pieces breaking off. Not the machines fault.Health review - i've been drinking it for either breakfast, snack, or after dinner. I've lost about 4 pounds so far, i haven't even started working out (injury). Your body will adjust a bit, your #2 time may be off schedule.I'll try to update, but one never knows when to update.
