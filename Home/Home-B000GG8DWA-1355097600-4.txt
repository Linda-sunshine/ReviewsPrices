review/summary: Love this light weight heater - works great!!review/text: This heater works very well. I was warm at 400w , and the heater warms up very very quickly, it is light weight and easy to move around the house. I use it to keep my feet warm on those really cold days. it is very quiet and what a great price!!! I am going to get two more -- another one as a spare ...and one for a friend of mine who keeps trying to take it when she visits me ... good buy & works well.
