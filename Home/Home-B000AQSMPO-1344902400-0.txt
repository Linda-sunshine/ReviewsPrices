review/summary: DO NOT BUY! ZERO STARS!review/text: Got the first Keurig B60 in May. In July it started to give us a message that it needed to be primed. This is in the troubleshooting chapter of the manual so I followed the directions of cleaning the reservoir, etc every day for 5 days. I finally called Keurig and was told that this is a known problem with a sensor and they would be happy to replace the machine. They did and the new one arrived quickly. I had to return the cup holder from the original machine to prove to them that it was no longer in use. The return was at my own expense and inconvenience. How difficult is it for them to send a prepaid label? The replacement machine worked for about two weeks. We make one cup a day 5-6 days per week so we have not made even 14 cups of coffee. The machine will brew a half cup and then pump water back into the reservoir. Apparently this is another known problem of this unit. How can this machine have so many flaws? I will have to call Keurig again and really don't want a replacement. I am very disappointed. This is not a cheap coffee maker and should not have so many issues. What a waste.
