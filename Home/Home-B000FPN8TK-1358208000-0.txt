review/summary: Works Great, and Ascetically Pleasingreview/text: I purchased this teapot, if you want to call it that, to use at work. It brews individual cups of loose leaf tea efficiently and mess free. My coworkers always ask to borrow it and love the tea it makes. Cleaning it is easy, and it is even dishwasher safe. Watching the tea steep and swell with water is a very intriguing process, one that usually captivates my coworkers and I at lunch. This is a fun and cost efficient was to brew 1-2 cups of tea.
