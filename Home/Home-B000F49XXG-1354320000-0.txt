review/summary: works wellreview/text: I love this little machine... for the price it works well. I like to use the steamer to make euro style hot chocolates. Get an organic dark chocolate bar and sliver it up add a little milk then some good sugar (like coconut palm sugar or date sugar) and steam it into the milk so it blends seamlessly. Add a shot or two for a mocha or drink just the chocolate. I really love to do this at home with my own ingredients (like organic coffee, milk and chocolate) rather than rolling the dice on ingredients at Starbucks et all. After a few espressos you've made your money back.
