review/summary: Great if used properlyreview/text: This shelf is pretty deep, which means you have to be careful not to overload it, especially in the back, since it is cantilevered. I can understand how it might droop over time with heavy things like tin foil on it . I use it to store boxes of tea. I have a heavier wooden tea box in the front and lighter boxes of tea in the back. It works great for my purpose - helps free up shelf space in my pantry.
