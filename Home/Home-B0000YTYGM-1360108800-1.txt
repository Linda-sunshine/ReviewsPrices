review/summary: Works Greatreview/text: It makes great coffee and does not leak like the other type I bought first. It is very easy to fill as the pot pours amazingly well with the top off, very fast. With the top on it is not as fast but the valve system keeps coffee quit hot for hours.The only downside is the small LED screen. Very hard to read especially the little &#34;Auto&#34; indicator up in the corner.All in all I ma quite happy with it.
