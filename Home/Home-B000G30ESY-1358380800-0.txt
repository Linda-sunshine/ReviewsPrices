review/summary: Works but has issuesreview/text: When reading this review, please note I only cook brown (whole grain) rice so I can't say if white rice would be different. First it take a long time to cook - about one and a half hours to cook 1/2 to 1 cup of brown rice. The rice is gummy not fluffy but maybe that is how brown rice is, I don't know. The rice does taste great though.
