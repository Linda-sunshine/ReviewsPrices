review/summary: My first digital scale...review/text: I am so glad that I had read about digital scales in Consumer Reports before I bought this one. I didn't know that you had to &#34;tap&#34; it to get its attention before you got on. Sometimes I have to weigh twice before I get what I think is appropriate reading. I don't understand that; but I can live with it.The display is very easy to read. Very attractive unit.Strange that it displays o..o..o..o... after I get off.
