review/summary: Two defective productsreview/text: This may be a good espresso maker but I will never know. My first one worked for a day or two before an indicator light stopped working. I returned it for an exchange and the second one did not work right out of the box. There was a dangerous steam leak that caused steam to billow out of the coffee holder. I tried to contact DeLonghi but they did not respond. So I sent the second one back and will never know whether I am just incredibly unlucky or they make a terrible product.
