review/summary: soft sheetsreview/text: I was concerned that some reviews stated sheets were not soft in the begining. We found these sheets soft from day one, the fit is amazing and I love that they STAY on my bed, as many seem to work their way off our mattress during the night. Nice sheets, worth the price.
