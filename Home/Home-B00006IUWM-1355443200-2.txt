review/summary: Did a good job on my knivesreview/text: I am pleased with this sharpener. I have never sharpened my knives and they are around 5 years old. This made quick work of it and they are definitely sharper. I had no problem sharpening pairing knives to chef's knives. I haven't tried to sharpen a serrated knife because the directions say to only sharpen the non serrated edge, which I haven't figured out how to do. I would recommend this to home cook.
