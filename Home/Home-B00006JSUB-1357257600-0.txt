review/summary: Total winnerreview/text: I sent this skillet to my daughter in California. I had purchased one after seeing several of my favorite chefs on TV sing its praises. I also had an ancient one that was smaller that I have enjoyed using for years. The pre-seasoning makes it so easy to use. It is heavy but that is part of why it works so well. I have even set it in the oven upside down to use as a pizza stone.It is a cinch to clean even without soap as directed. Just use hot water. Get a good scrubber for when you cook sticky stuff in it. And get a recipe for a puffy apple pancake. They come out beautifully in this pan. You will love it.
