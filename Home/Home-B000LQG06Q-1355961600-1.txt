review/summary: Very nicereview/text: Have had this for a little less than a week and liking this a lot so far. Also bought one for my father's bed and he's enjoying it too.We have an 9 year old spring mattress with an attached cushion topper that's sunk a tad, which is probably why my wife typically wakes up with a sore back. We started looking at a new mattress then decided to give this mattress pad a try.It arrived in a box about 24 inches by 15 inches by 12 inches (don't quote me on this). The pad was wrapped in plastic and the air had been sucked out to make it as small as possible. A word of advice when unpacking it, don't pull it apart with too much force, I suspect it would be moderately easy to tear. After about 1-2h, the pad was pretty much back to it's full shape. Moderately strong smell of Green Tea (according to the small piece of paper in the box). Interesting. It was mostly gone after a few hours. Definitely didn't notice it the next morning.Interesting feel when lying on it. I feel snug. And within perhaps 10m, moderately warm where I lie on it. My wife, however, doesn't notice any warmth. We both feel it has good support for us.We both sleep well on the pad. My wife, as noted above, has not had a sore back in the mornings since we've slept on it.I'll report back in a few months if I remember to, to give a further update.
