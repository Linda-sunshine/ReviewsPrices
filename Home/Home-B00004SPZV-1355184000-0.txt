review/summary: Sprayer stopped popping back up after about 5 spraysreview/text: I understand you have to pump this to get pressure in, but all the pressure in the world won't work if the sprayer head itself gets jammed DOWN and won't come back up - and that's with spraying a mixture that's 99% water! It's lovely to look at, and WHEN it sprays it's lovely and even, but fighting with it after every 5th spray is enough of a hassle that I switched back to my cheapy plastic sprayer that works every time....
