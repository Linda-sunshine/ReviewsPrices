review/summary: MUST READ BEFORE BUYING!review/text: Hello there, Im writing a review about 4 months after purchasing this product. First off when I got these sheets they were great...had that nice thick 600 thread feeling. These sheets were purchased so I could trade out my other ones for these ones in case I didn't have time to get washed and put on immediately.After about 8-10x washing I noticed a piling up of the fabric! This was very frustrating cause I know that 600 Thread count sheets shouldn't do that! I cannot stand feeling that piling of the fabric while sleeping.So please take as a helpful hint because I wish I had listened to other peoples similar reviews. I just passed by thinking what a great Deal being only $50 (which I noticed now they are $60!) and reading other peoples great reviews. (which I think they did the review right when they got the sheets and not after some washing)
