review/summary: Love this little stick vac!review/text: This little vacuum cleaner works amazingly well! I wasn't even looking for a something that cleaned hard floors as well so that was a bonus! It's quiet and powerful on both carpet and bare floors. The swivel makes it so easy to get around and under furniture. The only complaint I have is that the cord is a bit too short for my house, but even that isn't such a big deal considering how well it works. I have to admit that cleaning my floors is a lot more fun!(and I'm glad I bought it before the price went up)
