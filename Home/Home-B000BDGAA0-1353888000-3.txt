review/summary: Cover too small for pillowreview/text: I know why they made the case smaller. So that over time the pillow would not lose it's shape. It is a very comfortable pillow without the provided case. I put a pillow protector over it and a regular pillow case. Much better... Now my daughter wants one... but I have finished my Christmas shopping.
