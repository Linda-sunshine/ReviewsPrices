review/summary: A good carpet cleaning unit but plastic part broke after second usereview/text: Carpet cleaner used twice so far and it did a good job of cleaning carpet. However, plastic clip holding unit upright broke off after second use. As a result, unit will not stand upright on its own. This does not effect cleaning ability of unit but it makes unit less handy to use, such as when cleaning carpet on stairs and as rolling it from location to location.
