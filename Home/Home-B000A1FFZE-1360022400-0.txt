review/summary: Its a toaster, NO, its an oven...Yes, Its both!review/text: We truly appreciate this dual toaster. For some reason its vertical four slice versatility is able to keep up with us and our demanding Sunday brunches. It does have slight amount of irregular toasting patterns and the original version made it hard to end the cycle and eject the toast, but new models have a button to end the cycle. Regardless, as toasters go and without spending an exorbitant sum of money, we believe its a good value and we hope you find it that way as well. As a final comment, we gifted one of these to our in laws and they in turn now have several friends who have that also purchased it. You can also sometimes find these in the color Red. Hope our feedback was helpful.
