review/summary: Great!!!!review/text: Bought this to replace a Bissell Proheat 2x and couldn't be happier. The clean and dirty water tanks being seperate is awesome and cleaning the unit after use is a breeze. Wish I had this one to begin with and saved the $200 I spent on the Bissell. Does an amazing job cleaning carpets and the hand held works great. My wife used it to clean the floor mats and seats in her van and it looked better than the day we got it from the dealer. Would definitely recommend this product.
