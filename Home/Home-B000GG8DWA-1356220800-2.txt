review/summary: nice and quietreview/text: I bought 2 of them one for my room and one for my sisters room they work great especially now that it's cold out i leave mine set at 400 watts and it keeps me nice and toasty I also like the fact they don't make any noise like the fan powered ones do. so you don't have to listen to the fan all night long and they have a great tip over and off feature since my dogs have knocked them over they shut right down. i'd buy them again
