review/summary: Makes one remember what good coffee tastes like...review/text: I really don't care for coffee but after purchasing this percolator I realized why. I have been drinking drip coffee for so long I had forgotten what really good coffee tasted like. I must admit I do not like having to clean and wash the coffee holder every day (a drip maker IS a lot easier to clean) BUT it is a small price to pay for a really good cup of coffee. It makes coffee super fast in the morning and it holds its taste longer than a drip maker. I also keeps the coffee really hot without getting bitter for several hours. When this one dies I will buy another. We have had this percolator for over 6 months.
