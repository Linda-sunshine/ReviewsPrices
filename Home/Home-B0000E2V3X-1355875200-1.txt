review/summary: Lodge Pro Logic Cast Iron Pizza Pans Are Greatreview/text: In the past, I have cooked pizza on cast iron griddles or in cast iron frying pans. I love the way the crust turns out. So, I decided to splurge and buy two of the Lodge Pizza Pans. I have absolutely no complaints. They arrived quickly, in perfect condition, and they cook fantastic pizza. I highly recommend them.
