review/summary: Working well so farreview/text: I got this to make the Jim Lahey No-Knead bread recipe. I have used it twice and it works great for that purpose. I will say, it did produce a slightly distasteful smell when I was baking in it. I had rubbed it with vegetable oil when I first got it, and after I used it the second time, so I'm guessing the smell was from the vegetable oil baking.
