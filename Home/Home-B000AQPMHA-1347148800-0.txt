review/summary: Keurig caused a house firereview/text: I bought this for my husband as a Christmas 2011 present. It worked fine, we enjoyed it until two nights ago when were awakened by the smoke detector. The Keurig was engulfed in flames and the fire was speading quickly. We were so lucky to be able to get the fire out with an extinguisher, but not before a ton of smoke overtook the house. If you have one of these, I beg you to make sure you unplug it after each and every use! It is not enough to have it powered off. Things could have been so much worse, I am just happy that we were able to get the kids out of the house to safety. I will never buy another Keurig. That was the scariest thing to ever have to go through.
