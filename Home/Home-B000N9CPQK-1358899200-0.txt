review/summary: Works well but is very noisy.review/text: I have this in my foyer by the litter box and it works great on the litter box smell. It doesn't reach that far into the living room to keep the smoking smell down, and it's within the 100 ft. range.It's set on Level 1 and it's still very noisy. You get use to it and with the TV on ( in a condo) it 's ok, but still noisy. It works as promised and so far I have left it on for 2 weeks straight with no problems.If you have a larger room or area, get a larger capacity unit for sure.It does seem more fresh also in the condo as far as air quality.
