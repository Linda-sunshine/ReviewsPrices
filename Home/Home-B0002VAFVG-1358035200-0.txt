review/summary: BadASSSSssreview/text: Had a Champion juice which was good but took so long to juice and clean. This juicer is perfect, regardless of how much juicing you do. Easy to clean, and pulp is much drier than from the Champion juicer. Breville sees to make a solid product. The BJE200XL is perfect if you only need 2-3 glasses.
