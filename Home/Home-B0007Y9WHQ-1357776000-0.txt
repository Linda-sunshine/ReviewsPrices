review/summary: I wanted to like itreview/text: I really did want to like it. After being on my wish list for quite a while, my daughter got it for me for Christmas. It does fine with zucchini, but did not do well at all with beets or carrots. WAY TOO THICK. The zucchini looked just like spaghetti, but the beets and carrots were really too thick to enjoy as "pasta". Some of it wouldn't cut all the way through so I had really thick slices. I ended up juicing the result so as not to waste it. In my experience, hard veges don't work well with this machine. I had to send it back. Oh well...I really really did want to like it.
