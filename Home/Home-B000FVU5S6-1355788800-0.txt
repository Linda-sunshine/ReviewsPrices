review/summary: Fantastic sheets!review/text: I got these set in Plum, about 5 years ago, and I do agree with comments about how scratchy they are when you purchase them, but after a few washes they are amazing.I've use them frequently, but during summer cause they are heavy and perfect for chilly weather.The color stays intact through the years and they are an amazing quality, everytime I use them It's like having brand new sheets! I love them!
