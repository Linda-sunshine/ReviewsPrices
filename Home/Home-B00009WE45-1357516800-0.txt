review/summary: Takes readings very fast, but inaccurate and won't calibratereview/text: The thermometer seems to have solid construction and is easy to use. Once I received I tested the thermometer using the ice bath method. It was off by about 0.8 Fahrenheit (too low). I tried to recalibrate it, but nothing seems to happen when I turn the screw. I guess you get what you pay for.Overall the readings are fast, but the quality control seems to be spotty and mine would not calibrate.
