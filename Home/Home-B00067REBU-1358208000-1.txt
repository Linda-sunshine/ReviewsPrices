review/summary: High defective assembly ratereview/text: I ordered 2 units for Christmas presents. One unit had a screw loose inside - was 1 of 3 screws holding the power/mixer drive unit in place and was in a position such that I could not get the screw back into its hole, so I sent it back. Then later I got news on 2nd unit.Its delayed start button fell to inside of control panel (probabaly missing the part behind it that holds it in place?) on the very first press of the button. I had already replaced the 1st defective unit with another one when I learned of the defective button. After testing all its buttons, so far it seems to be OK, no loose screws or buttons, but not much time has passed since X-mas to be sure how it will hold up. The 2nd defective unit will be replaced with a different brand. But it does make good bread when you have a fully functional unit. Too bad the assembly quality is so poor. Thank you Amazon for taking back the defective units no problem!
