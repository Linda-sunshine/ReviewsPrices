review/summary: Slept in!review/text: My back was hurting a little in the mornings and I was waking up frequently in the night sooooo I tried this based on great reviews. There are toppers for half this much at Wal-mart, but the quality is noticeably better with this one-it's so thick and heavy! I slept in pretty late the first night, I think because I was in the same position for hours without getting uncomfortable / achy. Back isn't hurting anymore (husband concurs). My dogs love it too, hehe. It does have a strong peppermint smell when your face is close to it, but I wouldn't count that against it.
