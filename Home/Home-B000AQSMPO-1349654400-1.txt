review/summary: Generally Good Coffee But With Problemsreview/text: I've been generally pleased with the convenience and quality of the coffee made with this brewer. However, there are problems, and a buyer should be aware. Most K-cups work well, but some, e.g., those from Tully, fail regularly. Such failures, plus the minor leakage from the average K-cup require brewer cleanup - which is far from convenient or easy. Furthermore, after 2 or 3 years, glued joints and/or internal seals will fail, resulting in water everywhere. A buyer will get 2-3 years of generally good coffee (at a price), but after that it's junk.
