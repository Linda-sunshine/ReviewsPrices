review/summary: Comfy Cozyreview/text: I have bought a lot of flannel sheet sets over the years from cheap department store sets to catalog orders. I must say that these sheets are THE BEST I have ever owned. I love them! They are so thick and soft. When you slip between the sheets at night you notice how good they feel. I'm so glad I have these. I bought a couple of sets.
