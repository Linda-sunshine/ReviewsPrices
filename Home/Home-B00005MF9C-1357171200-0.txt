review/summary: Makes good coffeereview/text: It does make really good coffee very quick. Go ahead and order the #1 filters to go with it, or just 1/4 a paper towel as the filter to eliminate the grounds going everywhere with the basket. I use the select-a-size (1/2 sheet), fold it in half and push it in with my knuckles. I am going to order the #1 filters from Amazon as the price is good on them, and you can't find them in stores. Or at least I haven't had any luck!
