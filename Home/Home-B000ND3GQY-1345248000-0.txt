review/summary: Better than expectedreview/text: After reading mixed reviews, I was extremely careful on the first few use of the pan. I was using medium heat on my gas stove as instructed but found out later that high heat worked out fine too. Very happy with purchase of this large pan that comes with a glass cover at this affordable price.
