review/summary: Love this vacuum!!!review/text: This is my second vacuum like this. I left the first one behind when I moved and regretted it so much that I ordered the exact one again. It has great suction and the attachments work for the areas that I need to clean. I do have a hard time finding the bags locally, but tried the generic bags (36 bags for $20) that I found online and am very happy with them. I highly recommend this vacuum and encourage anyone to try it.
