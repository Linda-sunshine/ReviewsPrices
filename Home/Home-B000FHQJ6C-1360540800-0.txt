review/summary: Not as Happy as I should bereview/text: I hate giving bad reviews. This juicer leaks at the top where the latch is. Well actually all of the way around. But if I push down on it while I am juicing, it helps. Half of the time it throws big chunks of apples in the (what I call) compost bin. I just get them out and run them back through. I also put the fruit or veggie bag in the bin so I can save a lot of extra clean up.+++++++NOW for the clean up, as soon as you get ready to make your drinks, run you soapy water and have it ready for the used juicer parts. When you are done juicing, set your drink to the side!!!!So that you can sit back and enjoy your drink, take this apart. It is very easy and only takes a few seconds, and dump the extra leftover veggie/fruits into the bag for your garden and throw the parts in the soapy water. Enjoy the delicious drink then thoroughly clean your 4 parts. The best thing to keep your strainer sharper and working longer is to dry it as soon as you wash it so it will not rust and don't put it back together until your ready to use it. (Just the metal basket.) Also, I found the best cleaning tool for the metal basket is a round rotating brush. The one I have is made by Dawn. It is battery operated and it cleans that basket it 1 minute maybe 2 if it got really bad. I found my Dawn Brush at Albertsons and it is blue and white. OH.....Also, I did not receive any recipes. The instruction manual had 3 recipes in it that is it. But you can either go online and get some or you can find some books. I just bought 2 books. If I can help you with anything, feel free to ask and I will do my best to answer.
