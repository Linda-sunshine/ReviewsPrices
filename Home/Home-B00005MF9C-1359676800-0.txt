review/summary: Great 1 Cup Coffeemakerreview/text: This is my second Black & Decker Brew 'n Go and I love it. I've thought about buying a Keurig but I couldn't justify it when the Brew 'n Go does the same thing at a tenth of the price. Plus it takes up very little counter space which is helpful when you already have a 10 cup on the counter as well...one for morning coffee and one for when you only want a single cup. I love my coffee!
