review/summary: love this machinereview/text: I wanted to purchase my first food processor recently. Researched many makes and models, and decided on Cuisinart, even with the $100 price tag. So glad I did! This machine is QUIET, powerful, and easy to clean. Learning to use it was a snap with the instruction book. Also came with lots of recipes, and other uses besides chopping veggies! I've only used the slicer and chopper so far, but both are GREAT! I'm now grinding my own hamburger(no more pink slime)! Huge difference in taste and texture. The DLC Pro is fairly lightweight, and takes up minimal counter space. Even my husband is impressed with how smoothly this machine operates. Highly recommend this product.
