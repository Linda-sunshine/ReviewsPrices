review/summary: My first dehydratorreview/text: I bought this based on another review and am VERY satisfied. The lack of on and off switch isn't that big a deal for me. The trays are generous, easy to clean -just be gentle. The fan isn't loud and the whole thing is very compact. My husband initiated our dehydrator with beef jerky. It did cook a little faster than we expected but it was some of the best tasting jerky I've ever had. We are doing fruit tomorrow and fruit leather the next day.....it's great!
