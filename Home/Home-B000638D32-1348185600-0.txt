review/summary: A Good "Go To" Knife in the Kitchenreview/text: The Knife is very sharp out of the box and is a good deal for the money (considering how high the price of knives can go). After one month it is one of my "go to" knives. I think I may need to sharpen it because I notice a subtle dulling of the blade -- that was to be expected, but perhaps not quite so soon. You may want to consider buying a sharpener at the same time as the knife.
