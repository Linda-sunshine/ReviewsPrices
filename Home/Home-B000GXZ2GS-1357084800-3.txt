review/summary: Spreading the coffee-makin' lovereview/text: We have an AeroPress that gets used three times a day. We gave an AeroPress to our brother-in-law. Our best friends bought and AeroPress after using ours. And this one we bought for my mom. Yep, I'm pretty sure that means I'm giving it five stars.
