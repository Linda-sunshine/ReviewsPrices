review/summary: AeroPress is great!review/text: We have a Nespresso machine too, which is also great, but a bit on the expensive side if you want more than one cup...I purchased the press after looking at all reviews...it was very easy to use, very well made, and the coffee we used came out tasting great.I highly recommend this.. Once you get the hang of it, it takes about 2 minutes to set it up, add the coffee and hot water (stirring the coffeemix with the included stirrer, push down the press slowly and you're done! Then just remove the filter (over the garbage can) by continuing pushingthe pump and spent coffee. Very easy cleanup, very neat, great coffee....what more can I say...Love it!
