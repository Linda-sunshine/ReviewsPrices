review/summary: Worked great but broke after a few months - Fire risk?review/text: I bought this for my son's room as he has airborne allergies. The product worked great and the noise was gentle enough for a baby to sleep (if you like background noise such as white noise) My son's runny nose went away quickly but after just a few months, the motor quit working. YEsterday the machine started making weird noises. This concerned me as an electronic fire risk in my child's room! I unplugged it, waited a few moments, them plugged it back in and the machine completely stopped working.While I think this machine used to be great, the fact that it stopped working within a few months is a big let down. The fact that the motor made weird noises at the end can easily make a new mom think that it could have over heated or malfunctioned and started a fire in my son's room.
