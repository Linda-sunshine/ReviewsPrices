review/summary: Wine Openerreview/text: This is my second purchase of this. It does a great job of opening corked bottles. Nice design by making the cutter behind and part of the stand. It is sleek looking and the red ball on top gives it a bit of attention.One thing though is it is not robust. I bought my second one after my first one died on me. It was just over a year old. Upon taking it apart I found the culprit to be the motor. But for a small price to pay it is worth buying a new one.Now if they can beef up that motor I would definitely give it 5 stars, but only 4 due to the motor used.
