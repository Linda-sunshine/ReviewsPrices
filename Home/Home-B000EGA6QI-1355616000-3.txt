review/summary: Great hand blender for making fresh vegetable soupsreview/text: My wife just finished using this blender to make a delicious fresh asparagus soup. The blender works flawlessly, is extremely easy to use and is a breeze to clean. My wife has been using it for years, so it's obviously well built. Also, the strong motor enables her to make delicious vegetable soups in a matter of minutes. I highly recommend this product.
