review/summary: I'm done with $16 Wal-Mart coffee makers!review/text: This one is perfect. I really like the water filtering and that I can set it to not keep the hot plate on after it is done brewing. I can't imagine why anyone would want to continue to "burn" coffee after the brew. I really like the conical filters too. This is the best brewer I've ever owned and I just hope it lasts. My cheapo brewers that I thought were such a good deal were not even lasting a year. This one seems very precision built compared to other models.
