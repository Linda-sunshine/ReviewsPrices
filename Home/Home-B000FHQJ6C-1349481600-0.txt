review/summary: Hamilton Beach juicerreview/text: It does pretty good. I would cut up bulkier pieces in to quarters. Doesnt do well with leaves and fronds from veggies such as fennel fronds and leaves.Clean immediately for best use. Use scrub brush on mesh screen while under running warm water. I got 32 pz of juice out of 3 small tomatoes 2 stalks of celery and 6 thin aspargus stems and 1carrot and a small jalopena and fennel stalk. It just lacked the vodka and horseradish!
