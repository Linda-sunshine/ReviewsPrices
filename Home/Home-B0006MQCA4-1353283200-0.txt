review/summary: Brita Switchreview/text: I have always used those Brita pitcher-like products that sit on the shelf or are slim enough to fit on the fridge door. But, given the reviews this had, I gave it a shot. It makes WAY more sense, and I hadn't realized it until I put it in my fridge. It fits nicely on the edge of a shelf and in terms of the volume that it occupies, it takes up much less space than a round-ish pitcher equivalent. Plus, it holds a TON of water, so I have to refill it far less often. But it's not so much water that it's heavy. I was nervous about the strain it would put on the wire shelf in my fridge, but it's not so heavy that it's testing the holding strength of the shelf. I'm pleased, and if needed, I would definitely purchase this again.
