review/summary: Nice waffle makerreview/text: I have never made waffle before, and I used this machine the very first time, but the waffle was still beautiful and golden brown! The waffle did not stick on to the inside surface of the machine and it is easy cleaning. The operation is very easy and straight forward, anyone who never cooked waffle before can use it easily.
