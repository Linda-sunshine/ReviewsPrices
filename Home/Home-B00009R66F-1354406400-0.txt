review/summary: Much better than I expected!review/text: This carpet cleaner was highly rated but I was a bit concerned because the negative reviews carry more weight for me. It arrived yesterday and I immediately started to assemble it but ran into a small problem. Two long bolts to attach a part were missing. I finally had to go to the hardware store to get something for it but what they had wasn't quite the right size. Even so, I used the bolts temporarily but will contact Hoover tomorrow to see if they can send me the correct pieces. Other than that I tried it out and it did a great job! I have never shampooed this carpet and it has been in for a number of years. I also have two cats and I am not very neat myself. Rather than use straight hot tap water which really isn't as hot as I would like for this, I heated the water for the tank and used the cleaning solution supplied. My carpet looks great - even an area of high traffic and much ground in dirt! A few years ago some glue had spilled when I was away from home and that fairly large dried spot has never come out. But with boiling water and scraping, then using the shampooer, I have made a good start on getting it out! It will take a lot more work, but I never thought it could be done. The sale price and good reviews got me to try this and I am so glad I did. If there are problems (I have only used it once) down the line I might update this review but other than two missing bolts this item is a winner for me!
