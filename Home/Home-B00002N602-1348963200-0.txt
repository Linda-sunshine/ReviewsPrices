review/summary: Perfect Pressure Cooker.review/text: I love this pressure cooker. The size is great for a small meal, but not too small to be functional. The quality is wonderful and I look forward to many more years of quick, easy meals. Definately worth the price for stainless steel vs aluminum. I got rid of my aluminum cookers and love this one so much more. No regrets!
