review/summary: Great for Price!review/text: Very good maker, but I needed to use cheap paper filters to avoid grinds everywhere inside the machine and also, machine will not work well if you do not use filters, regardless, of what the company says about this product. Before my implementation of the filters, it had tremendous trouble pouring/dripping into the cup. So, I decided to use the aforesaid filter and the machine works perfectly now. You can buy cheap filters, e.g., 100-200 packed filters for under $3.00.
