review/summary: Motor failed after 5 yearsreview/text: I did not use my mixer for bread often but managed to kill the motor with a small batch of challah. At KA's authorized repair center it's going to cost $140 for repair and KitchenAid can do nothing for me or even guarantee the replacement parts. I am unhappy with the customer service.
