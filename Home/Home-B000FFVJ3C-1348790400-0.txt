review/summary: I LOVE THIS!review/text: I love this dehydrator, and have raved about it so much many of my friends have purchased one and love theirs also. It is super easy to use and clean. The instruction book isn't real helpful (not that you need very detailed instructions) but very clear instructions are easy to find online. Not having an on/off switch is no big deal, just unplug.
