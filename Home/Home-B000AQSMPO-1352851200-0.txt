review/summary: Love this machinereview/text: I just received the Keurig B60 Special Edition and I am very impressed. I have wanted a Keurig coffee maker for about a year but could not see wasting so much money on the k-cups plus the added waste to the landfills it would create. But after waiting for awhile, researching and reading reviews, the Ekobrew reusable cup came on the market. The Ekobrew reusable cup works perfectly with this model allowing me to use my own coffee, which saves money, the planet, and all the while, I get the convenience of the Keurig. Using my own coffee is a very simple process and does not add that much more time. Being able to use and drink my own coffee, at it's freshest, with the Keurig is amazing. I would not have otherwise purchased this machine. But now that I have it, I love it. The only downside is that the water reservoir needs to be filled with more water when it gets to about 16 ounces. It "demands" more water and it won't work until it is filled up. Other than that, it was worth the money since I can use my own coffee.
