review/summary: Pleasant surprisereview/text: I purchased this coffee pot in June of 2010. It provided excellent coffee until yesterday morning. After brewing, I heard what sounded like water hitting a hot surface coming from the kitchen. I thought maybe it was condensation from the pot hitting the heating plate but I went to check anyway...glad I did because there was smoke streaming from under the coffee pot and the awful smell of burnt plastic filled the kitchen. I immediately unplugged the coffee maker. I was upset that I almost had a fire but also upset that my favorite coffee pot was now dead. I almost threw it away, but thought I would call the customer service line at Cuisinart. I was surprised to find them open on Sunday afternoon. I was also surprised to find that they offered to send me a new coffee pot to replace my old one. I just have to send the old one back. I am very pleased with their customer service and although I had a bad experience with the old coffee pot, I am glad to see that they are willing to stand behind their product and replace it. Thank You Cuisinart!
