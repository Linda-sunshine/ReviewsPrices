review/summary: Brita Grand Lid falling offreview/text: I ordered this item and read most of the reviews and almost everyone complained about the lid falling off and spills!But, I ordered this anyway because this was the size water container I wanted! I was at first very dissapointed , because yes the lid didn't fit snugly and fell off when I pored water! I was going to send the item back and instead read all the reviews.....found one that said" The lid only falls off when you hold the lid while pouring! Tried and he was absolutely right, if you don't hold the lid and just pour , your fine, no water spills! Weird, but true! You would think that loose fitting lid would fall off if you don't hold it on while pouring, but it stays! I wish the company would make this clear! I myself would prefer a snug tight fitting lid, but it doesn't spill if you don't hold the lid while pouring! Thanks to the Gentleman's review, that I read!
