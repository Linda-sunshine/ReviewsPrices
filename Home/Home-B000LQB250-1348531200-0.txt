review/summary: Comfyreview/text: Not as firm as we expected but after a couple of days of getting used to the different height we really like it. We no longer feel the springs of our mattress and we don't wake up with our arms asleep! Smell of mint from the pad wasn't even noticable after we left it laying on top of the bed with no covers for 3 hours before making the bed.
