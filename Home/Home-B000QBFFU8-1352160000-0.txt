review/summary: Wonderful Juicer...review/text: We purchased a few juicers over the past few weeks and they all broke. We started juicing 1 to 2 times a day, this juicer is great. It is built with great quality. It juicers everything without any problems. We do cut a few things up to make it go easier on the motor, but probably do not need to do so.I am glad we puchased this Breville.
