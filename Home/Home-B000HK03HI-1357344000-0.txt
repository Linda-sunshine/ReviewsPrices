review/summary: Magnet on top is very weakreview/text: The magnet on the opener doesn't work very well to hold or lift lids off of the opened cans. That is specifically why I purchased this can opener. It opens the cans with no trouble but most openers do!! I purchased it to lift the lids and hold them so they don't fall into the cans and this one does not do what it's supposed to. When it's time for a new opener I'll not buy this brand again. I'll be stuck with this dumb thing for years I'm sure!! Lol
