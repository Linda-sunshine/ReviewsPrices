review/summary: Awesome Panreview/text: I had an old non-stick pan and needed a new one, just so happens I was watching a favorite show of mine called " Americas test kitchen" and they had a segment on non-stick pans. They reviewed several pan including some that cost upwards of $120.00 After all was said and done they ended up recommending the T-fal non-stick as the winner in the test. And the price is right around 30-40 bucks depending on where you get. I have had the pan for about 2 mo. and I really like it! I seasoned when I first got it and it has performed great! I highly recommend it, happy cooking.
