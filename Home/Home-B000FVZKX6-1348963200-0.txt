review/summary: Soooo Soft and Fluffy!review/text: I bought the 190-gram cotton velvet flannel queen sheet set for my sister. She said they are wonderful! They are so soft and fluffy after washing and drying - and if folded right after drying are nice and smooth - no wrinkles. They are a nice weight and not thin or scratchy - again - sooooo soft and fluffy!! And the color seems to stay true even after washing. She especially liked the heavy duty elastic that is all around the bottom of the fitted sheet - fits well - stays on snug. This is the second set I have purchased for her - this time with extra sets of king sized pillow cases which she also loves. An awesome product for a very, very good price. No problems with giving this product 5 stars.
