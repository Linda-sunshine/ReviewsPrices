review/summary: The best coffee maker ever!!!review/text: I'm a coffee gourmet and very hard to please with regards to my morning coffee routine. I have literally tried every coffee maker on the market. This one makes my perfect cup every time. I accidentally put it in the dishwasher (which scrubbed off the finish) and now am ordering another one.A small recommendation for those who enjoy a perfect cup - take it off the fire before all the water comes out in the top section. It will save the clouds which will make your drink incredibly smooth.
