review/summary: Clogged constantly after the third usereview/text: I bought this vacuum on the basis of many great reviews, and the price. It worked well the first 3 times I used it, and then it clogged constantly after this. The debris never went into the canister and was caught in the connection hose every time. The hose setting never did work at all. The vacuum had to be taken almost completely apart to remove ordinary dirt. I gave up after taking it apart and putting it back together after about 10 times. I wish I had returned it earlier.
