review/summary: good, but missing essentialsreview/text: This product was super easy to put together...until I got to the side cushions. They are supposed to snap to the chair. One side I had no issues...the other side is missing one whole snap and the the other one is bent (in other words cannot be used). I'm really depressed that this product came damaged, and I will have to figure out someway to fix it.
