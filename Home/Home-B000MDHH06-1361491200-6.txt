review/summary: I really enjoy using this juicer but one small problem.review/text: I will say this is BY FAR one of the BEST juicers I have ever used in my life but it is the FIRST that I have purchased for myself. It is VERY POWERFUL and efficient, so EASY to clean, it really makes juicing a PLEASURE! My only teeny tiny complaint is I wish the "basket" that catches the ground up goodness was a little larger so I could make more juice at one time before needing to dump clean and juice again. Perhaps I should of purchased a higher yielding Juicer but Im sure glad I have this little gem.** So if your are looking to make more juice at a time perhaps enough for a day this isn't the juicer for you, but if not its MORE than adequate!!** I've been juicing almost every day since I've received this sweet little gem, Lifes never been sweeter *wink wink*I will update if any hitches come up but so far its been a lovely ride!!
