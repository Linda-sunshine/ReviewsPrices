review/summary: Excellent buy for the moneyreview/text: I was on another site ordering cotton sateen sheets for six times the money when I remembered being very pleased with the Pinzon flannel sheets I bought last fall. After reading many reviews both pro and con, about these sheets, I deleted my order at Cuddledown and bought the Pinzon sheets.They came last night. When I unwrapped them they smelled like rodent repellent and felt like paper. I saved the box they came in just in case. I ran them through the washer in HOT water and Ivory Snow on the heavy duty cycle., then the dryer with a dryer sheet. They were wrinkled but I iron all my sheets anyway so that did not matter. They smell like normal laundry..They are on the bed now, looking divine (the color is perfect for my bed). They are generously cut, they ironed up nicely and they feel good. Not as silky as the 300 Dollar sets I have but much nicer than one would expect for 60 Dollars.February 22, 13: Having said all of the above, I do not think they are Egyptian Cotton and I do not think that is a Satin weave.
