review/summary: Seemed cheap, but works great!review/text: When I first purchased this vacuum, I was disappointed by its light weight: it made it seem chintzy. However, this thing really has some sucking power and has worked great for cleaning my room (low, dense carpet). It is also sturdier than its weight and appearance led me to believe. This thing was a great deal!
