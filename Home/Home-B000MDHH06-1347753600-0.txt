review/summary: Can't imagine a better juicerreview/text: Love, love, love this juicer! It's the first one I've ever had, but I cannot imagine a better one. It's easy to put together and take apart, even for someone like me who gets confused over the simplest of gadgets. It's easy to clean, which needs to be done immediately after using. It can be put together or taken apart in about 10 seconds and it takes less than five minutes to clean, including using the included brush to remove pulp and scrub the basket, soaping and rinsing, and a wipe-down of the mechanical part and the metal bar. I wrap large greens, like kale, around hard fruit, like apples, and for small greens, I push through a handful with a chunk of hard fruit. There is absolutely no juice wasted--the pulp is bone-dry. Now if I could just get it to clean and cut up the fruits and vegetables, all would be perfect!
