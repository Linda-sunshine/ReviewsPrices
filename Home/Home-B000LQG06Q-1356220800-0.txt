review/summary: Topperreview/text: We purchased a new mattress deciding on a firm base after reading of disappointments in the toppers on mattresses that are part of the product. Since this is the weak link on a good mattress, we decided to just replace this when needed. This product is very comfortable and filled our needs for now. It can be replaced as needed for much less than the cost of a new mattress.
