review/summary: Much better than Britareview/text: We switched from a Brita pitcher to our PUR and couldn't be happier. Our Brita used to leave little pieces of carbon in the water and never tasted clean but our PUR pitcher does an excellent job of filtering our water so that it takes clean and pure. It does take more time to filter the water, but we just refill it every time we use some water to keep it full. The value of the filters on Amazon is much better for us than locally.
