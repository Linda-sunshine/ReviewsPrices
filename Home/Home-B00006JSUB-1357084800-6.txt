review/summary: Cooks greatreview/text: I am very happy with this skillet. Heats evenly and cooks like a dream. Just remember to season it yourself, as the factory seasoning is inadequate. Oil with 2 tablespoons of canola oil - inside and out - and bake upside down in a 500 degree oven for an hour. Place a sheet of foil on a lower rack to catch any drips. Turn off oven but let skillet remain in the oven until it returns to room temp. Comes out shiny and smooth. Treat skillet well and it will treat you well too.
