review/summary: Still going strong after nearly 2 1/2 years...review/text: I've been pretty happy with my little 4-cup Mr Coffee. Yes, it has its quirks, but I've never had any major problems with it, save for one time recently when the pause-and-pour feature wasn't working properly (but that seems to have resolved itself). It's a nice basic coffemaker for the Average Joe or Jane. :)
