review/summary: AMAZING, HASSLE FREE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!review/text: Bought ours at Costco on a whim as a back up to our Bunn. After owning for over a year and making somewhere around 50 cups of coffee it just decided to stop brewing. No receipt and no confidence that we'd get any help we went through the maintenance manual and performed every single procedure to the "T" to try to fix it.After getting angry and griping about it being a piece of crap I calmed down and called Keurig customer service on a Sunday afternoon and got a human being!! He walked me through a few possible fixes and after providing a serial number to him he stated that it was covered under their warranty and they would send me a new machine!!All I have to do is send back a small part from the machine. Oh, one other thing. The person spoke English and was extraordinarily nice! I am happy to recommend a Keurig to everyone since they take care of their customers. What do you have to lose. I never even filled out the warranty card (I will this time!). Oh yeah, the warranty on the replacement starts new again!!! IMPRESSIVE. BUY ONE
