review/summary: Great grinderreview/text: If you are looking for a industrial grinder this is not it. I use this grinder for making cat food and general kitchen grinding. It works great. I tried it for pasta but went out and got a pasta machine after the second time I tried it. It will do pasta but does not work well like a pasta machine. It cleans up nicely and sticks to the counter very well.
