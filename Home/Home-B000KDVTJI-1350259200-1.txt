review/summary: Totally Necessary Item! Indispensable Kitchen Tool!review/text: I use my water kettle everyday several times a day!!! I would have thought this to be an unnecessary household item, until I tried one out at someone's house. I loved theirs so much I put it on my wishlist and got my own. I love it. Great for Tea! (though a bit hot) Be sure to follow brewing times for caffeinated teas. Herbal teas tend to taste no matter how long they brew.Great for bowling hot water Fast! Great to have nearby when cooking and needing to unstick stuck on brown bits from the bottom of pans when cooking without adding extra oil. Sure you can deglaze a skillet with some fancy liquid, but hot water sitting on the counter ready and available in a moments notice when cooking is great!I fill my pot with Spring Water for the best tasting tea. As it turns out natural minerals in spring water taste good, nasty tap water chemicals not so much!! Easy and Safe!Looks Great Too. FYI... The inside of plastic white kettles start to look very gnarly very quickly.
