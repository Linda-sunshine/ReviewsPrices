review/summary: Works wellreview/text: It filters inside a 23' RV just fine and I believe it worked pretty well in filtering the air quality inside the RV. It has different settings to adjust the loudness depending on what you are doing (whether you can deal with the noise or not). Oh, let me specify that we have 2 dogs: 1 large siberian husky weighing about 65 pounds and a medium size malamute-lab mix weighing about 52 pounds. So trust me when I say it filtered the air quality. Can't miss the before and after smell.For us, it's not bad. The size is perfect and fits on a small shelf or just on the dining table. We pretty much just took it out of the box and onto the table it went. No hassles at all.
