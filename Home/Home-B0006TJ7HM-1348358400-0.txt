review/summary: arrived quickly. they cut wellreview/text: After trying to cut a tomato while making dinner one night and going through the two blocks of crappy knives we own and still not finding a sharp one, I lost my mind. I realized that my folks gave me an Amazon gift card for my birthday so rather than buying another piece of music equipment I decided to attempt returning to sanity and purchase new knives. These are great knives, especially for the price. They cut things; as opposed to the old knives we owned. Making dinner is now a much more pleasant experience.
