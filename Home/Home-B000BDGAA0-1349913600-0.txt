review/summary: It's very hard like a piece of woodreview/text: I normally like the soft pillows so this one did not work for me. My neck and head actually start hurting after using the pillow for a few min. It's so hard! feels like it's been filled with sands. Well, it's about $7 return shipment so am going to use it as back support for sitting now!
