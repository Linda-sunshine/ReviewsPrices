review/summary: Superb alternative to Technivorm, Bonavita etc.review/text: For the price, I would totally chose this hands down. While the Technivorm is $300, the Bonavita half that, the Zoji comes in at a tidy $90. Well worth it considering the other cheaper and inferior alternatives.Just pay close heed to the instruction manual and you will be enjoying your first cup of coffee hassle free.Few notes, this does not come with a starter pack of filters, so buy some #4 cones.The carafe lid needs to have the markings aligned to allow for a smooth pour. Just align the circles and you're golden.Great product (even though it's made in China), great price and awesome Amazon Prime shipping.
