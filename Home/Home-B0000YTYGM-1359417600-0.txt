review/summary: Truly Met Expectationsreview/text: I bought this a few months ago via Amazon and have used it daily ever since. I have been &#34;very pleased&#34; with this coffee maker. I had been looking for a 12 cup thermal (for some reason they are HARD to find - but 10 cup units are easy to find in thermals - go figure?!?).I have been very pleased with this unit:* Very easy to operate* Very easy to clean (however, I would HIGHLY suggest a #4 cone permanent coffee filter instead of paper ones)* Brews 'hot'. I have checked the temp of brew and find mine consistent at 197 degrees - very good for a home brewer - impressive.* Coffee remains hot in the thermal (my wife and I do drink a fair bit of coffee - so, I haven't brewed a pot and 'waited' hours to see if it is still hot. Like any coffee thermal it is going to lose heat over time - but within the two hours we have used it - it has remained very nicely hot.Overall, I have enjoyed this brewer and hope to for some time.
