review/summary: Great humidifierreview/text: Our big, old house is so dry. This humudifier is great because it doesn't require a filter and really moistend the air. As long as you follow the cleaning instructions it doesn't get gunked up from hard water. The only problem is, if you don't have it on the right setting for your area the floor ends up wet.
