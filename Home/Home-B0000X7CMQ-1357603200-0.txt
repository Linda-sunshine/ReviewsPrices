review/summary: My second Zojirushi Fresh Brewreview/text: After 5 or 6 years our old Z. quit brewing so after looking at the available brewers, decided to go with the model that served us so well. Noticed that sometime during that time the coffee maker has changed a little. The carafe lid on the old one tended to stick a little while turning it to the &#34;pour&#34; position. The new one is very smooth. Also the carafe is slightly different shaped and slightly taller. Not sure of the reason for this, but it does cause the strainer basket to open a little more, which I suppose would let the coffee come out faster. We had no trouble with the old one in this regard.As some have noted, the controls and the water level indicator are on the side, instead of the front like most coffeemakers. This is a minor inconvenience; we just turn the coffeemaker sideways. Also, as some have mentioned, if you don't set the carafe in the right spot, you will get a counter full of coffee. Let me say that it's not any trouble placing it in the right spot. It's just that over the years we've gotten careless maybe 3 or 4 times and didn't put the pot all the way in, so received a mess.Now after giving you the slight inconveniences of this brewer, let me say that it makes great coffee--far better than any other drip brewer we have had. The coffee is hot, the grounds are well saturated and the carafe keeps the coffee hot for awhile. I would have given my old Zojirushi 5 stars and so far this one deserves a little higher. Oh, and by the way, the stainless steel strainer basket is insulated, so the coffee doesn't cool while in the coffee grounds, and it is easily removable for washing if you desire.I highly recommend this coffeemaker
