review/summary: Have been making Indian food with itreview/text: A great machine-- the only drawback is that it has a bit of hard time doing really heavy duty blending. For example, grinding down whole grains into a smooth batter is hard (leaves grainy bits and machine heats up). But our final product (dosa) didn't taste grainy so it's been fine.
