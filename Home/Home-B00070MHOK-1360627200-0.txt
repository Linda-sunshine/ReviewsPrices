review/summary: SteamFast SF-435W Compact Fabric Steamer..Awesomereview/text: This steamer works wonders! I filled up to line as I am one to follow directions, took like a minute to heat up and in no time was I ironing out store made wrinkles. You know, the ones that when they are shipped to store in boxes then put on display with wrinkles still in and you bring home, only to find you cannot iron them out alone? Well with the Steamer, they came out!! I also have a very nice black jacket that gets a touch wrinkly bust mostly finds all the cat hair in my house, so I took the Steamer, along with the lint remover attachment, and got all the cat hair off and wrinkle free. Very impressed with this buy, as well as it is work the money!!!
