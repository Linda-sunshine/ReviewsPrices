review/summary: good for price; but little too softreview/text: pros: no chemical type smell, made a firm older bed feel better to sleep on. However, we also bought a different brand 2.5 gel memory foam topper for other bed. Laid both on floor -- gel one was much more dense and comfortable, could barely feel floor, great memory, cool. Visc02 3" felt way softer/thinner (even tho it is thicker) & not as dense as expected... immediately sank and could surely feel hard floor. but for the price, not bad buy.
