review/summary: LOVE itreview/text: Got this one for my daughters bed room. Easy to use, works great and the water for me last for a while just got this yesterday after work. Ran from 6pm to 7am only half the tank was gone (and my house was DRY really DRY), and its been on since 530pm tonight and its almost 9pm and i started with the half of tank and still pretty full... I do say READ the directions on how to set it you want to make sure the mist is now coming down at all if the mist is coming down you have it set up too high for that room and yes your stuff under it will get wet... directions say the mist should be getting absorbed and going up and if its starting to arch down its up too high. I know its working even though it seems not to be using a lot of water because I can see it and my humidifier reader went up TONS in just 1 hours, from 31% to 44% in just i believe 1 hour tonight since I do turn them off when I leave the house for work because afraid of fires, it running out of water, or anything else happening when Im not home. LOVE IT!
