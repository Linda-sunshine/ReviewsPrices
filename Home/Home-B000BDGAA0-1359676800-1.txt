review/summary: So far it's OKreview/text: Before buying this pillow I looked at the reviews, saw both positive and negative reviews. I already have a small version with micro beads. I have to say this pillow has shown why it received the negative and positive reviews. If you fluff it up (as best you can), it is very soft - up to a point. My head sinks down in, but then it stops sinking, as if it hit a brick-like level. I am hoping the case will stretch, so the pillow will have more give (one reviewer said it does). But when you first get this pillow, especially if you do not try to fluff it up, it can seem very hard.
