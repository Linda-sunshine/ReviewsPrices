review/summary: Great hand blenderreview/text: My kids, aged 6 and 10 years old and they love surprises when it comes to their food. Each day, I'd whip up something extra special as a reward for their great day at school.To aid me in doing this, I have this Cuisinart Blender. I had this because the other two before it didn't hold true to what they had promised in their product descriptions. But for this one, it was different. Me and my family had tasted the best smoothies so far.The great thing about this blender is that I could easily wash it; even the tiny parts. And even if I wash it every day, the processor of the blender wouldn't even cringe a bit. It would still work in its finest form.
