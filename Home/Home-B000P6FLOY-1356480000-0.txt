review/summary: Probe failed within 3 monthsreview/text: Works great... when it works. You should always have a spare probe on-hand. Mine died while cooking a roast (stuck reading HI) and fortunately I have enough experience with these units in the past to know not to be caught with your pants down.This isn't the first time this has happened and probably won't be the last, but Polder is usually good about sending a replacement probe.Still, I wish they were sturdier and more reliable.
