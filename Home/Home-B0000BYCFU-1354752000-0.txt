review/summary: BEST Decision Everreview/text: I love everything about this. We got ours a few months ago and started using it right away. I've already canned Pie fillings, Juice concentrates, soups, and so many more. We've also used it to pressure cook full roasts and chickens and the results is meat that is so juicy and it just falls off the bone in less then 2 hours. We've used just the pot to cook huge batches of stew and soups. It has done more cooking in the last 6 months than I think I've done my entire marriage. Definitely worth it!!!!
