review/summary: Great Productreview/text: Was looking for a replacement Presto Skillet and came across this one which had a glass top. My old one had an annoying metal top that never fit quite right after using it so much. This one i can bring to my table also, which is very handy. My old one I left in Wisconsin, in our rental cabin as it still can be used. I am very pleased with this product and hope to get many years of service from it also.
