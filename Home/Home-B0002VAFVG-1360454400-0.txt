review/summary: Worth the Money!review/text: Juices carrots beautifully! This is my second juicer and it is wonderful! Very powerful! Yes, it's loud, but it doesn't take long to juice so that is not a problem. I would highly recommend this juicer to anyone. It does greens, pineapples, iceburg lettuce, zuchinni, cucumber, but I think this one seriously does carrots the best! I love it!
