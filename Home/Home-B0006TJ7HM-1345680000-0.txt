review/summary: Great Quality for the Price!review/text: I have had Ginsu Knives before, and these are better than my last set because the metal from the blade continues through the whole knife, so they are very sturdy. My last set began cracking because the handles were plastic and the metal didn't run through the entire knife handle. These knives are also very sharp! I am not a gourmet chef by any means, so these knives are perfect for my needs!
