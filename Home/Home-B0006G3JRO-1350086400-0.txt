review/summary: love and hatereview/text: Got this as a gift. I enjoy and the immersion blender and the food processor. I thought I would use the whisk all the time, as I always make my own whipped cream. I LOVED the whisk attachment, LOVED it! But after 5 uses, it didn't work any more, seemed like it stripped the gears. Huge disappointment.
