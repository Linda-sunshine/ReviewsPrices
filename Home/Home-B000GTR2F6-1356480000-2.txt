review/summary: Modern convenience meets great coffeereview/text: We replaced a much more expensive coffee maker with a Keurig B70. Not only does it brew great coffee, but to have it so quickly and conveniently is very nice. Perhaps the best part is that we don't have to make a whole pot of coffee that one of us doesn't care for. I can have a dark rich blend and seconds later my wife can have a cup of decaf. Couldn't be better.
