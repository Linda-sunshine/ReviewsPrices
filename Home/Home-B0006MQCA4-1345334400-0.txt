review/summary: This sure beats buying bottled water.review/text: We had a smaller Pur picher. We were constantly filling it up. We were happy with the water that it filtered. We were not happy with the small picture. We are a family of 3 and drink a lot of water.We then purchased the 18 cup Pur filter because we are happy with the brand. We are all much happier with the larger unit. We do not have to fill it as often.I reccomend that if you are considering a water filter get Pur and get the large one.
