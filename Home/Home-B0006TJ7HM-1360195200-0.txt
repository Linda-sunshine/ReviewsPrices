review/summary: 2 Extra LARGE Knives - NOW 16 Pieces!review/text: Maybe they haven't updated the description, but I just got this set about a week ago and received 2 extra "large/long" knives. There are now 4 different sized "large" knives in the set. You get the big one pictured, a shorter "fat" one & 2 "long" ones. But no slots for the 2 extra big knives.Pretty sharp, I was cleaning the fat shorter knife and accidentally cut myself pretty good. I've been cutting lemons and grapes with them. They don't slice like butter (and don't expect serrated knives to), but they are way better then my worn out older set and for $36 this was the best deal I could find on a block set like this.
