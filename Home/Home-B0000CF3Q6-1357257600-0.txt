review/summary: Perfect personal espresso maker!review/text: I have had a pretty darn fancy all in one espresso maker, and to be honest I was less than thrilled with it. I think it is a user fail issue. It was okay, but for all the work I was never very excited over anything had more than a few incidents.Then I got this little heaven maker! Something I can't mess up, and tastes amazing! My husband was a little annoyed I bought this because I have &#34;enough&#34; gadgets, but after I received a frothing machine for Christmas that he and the kids make stuff with I had a good excuse!With this little pot all you do is fill to the notch with water, put the filter on and scoop some espresso in there without pressing (a total bonus for me as I always pressed my espresso WAY too tight with those machines) screw together the top, and you're ready to put on the stove! I do have an electric, and with the small base I find putting it off center on med/high is the best. Other wise it takes for ever. Make sure the WHOLE thing is on the burner, but off center.I did what others said and rinsed with hot water then set to dry after every use. Everything is going great. No issues with the metal, and it rinses clean everytime.Bottom line though: BEST ESPRESSO EVER! I have made shakes, caps, mochas, and all sorts of drinks for guests. They have all been very impressed, and already converted someone else from the high priced machine they were using for everyday.If you are busy I HIGHLY recommend a frothing machine. This link is the one I have (got as a present, but I saw it cheaper at many stores than this ad is showing now) All I do is start the espresso, pour the milk in the frother and start the frothing, and they both end about the same time. Little sugar and my husband has a 5 minute cap, and even has time to to whip up a quick sandwich while they are doing their magic.http://www.amazon.com/Capresso-202-04-frothPRO/dp/B003LXY2HA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1357320738&sr;=8-1&keywords;=frothing+machine
