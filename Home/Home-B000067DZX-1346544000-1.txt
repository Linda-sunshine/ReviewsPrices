review/summary: Just FYI . . .review/text: This is just an FYI for Amazon users . . . the product I received was NOT a "2 stage" PUR water filter as I had wrongly assumed it WOULD be (I compared the filtering capabilities with the ones I received with this order versus the box I still had of the TRUE "2 stage" PUR water filters. But . . . belatedly, I reread the title of the product being offered for purchase MUCH more carefully and, the blame is TOTALLY on me, so I misread it, so here is the title of the product: "PUR 2 Stage Water Pitcher Replacement Filter" . . . admittedly, the title does NOT say that the FILTERS here are going to be "2 Stage", but, it turns out that these are ONE stage filters, which will (DUH!) obviously FIT in a "2 Stage Water PITCHER"! . . . so yeah, just "caveat emptor" (buyer beware), that you are, indeed buying ONE stage filters for your TWO stage water pitchers! . . . I will keep these one stage filters and use them, but in the future, I will be careful to better research my next PUR TWO stage filters! . . . final btw . . . of course these one stage PUR filters WILL work perfectly, but I wish they would have been more clear on the fact that what you are buyin' is not "two stage" . . .
