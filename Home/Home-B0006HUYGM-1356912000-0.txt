review/summary: Sucks real good!review/text: Ok, as soon as i got this vacum, i put it to work right away and i was surprise in how well it sucked all the dirt in my carpet. I was a bit skeptics with the reviews on this thing but surprisingly this vacuum really gets the job done! The suction in the vacuum is really strong and its so easy to clean. You can clean the filter by using another vacuum to suck the dirt out. I am very happy with this purchase for $50 bucks with cleaning kit and 2 extra rewashable filters, a complete satisfaction.I definitely recommend this product to all you neat freaks out there such as myself.
