review/summary: Cute design and color options, but design is lacking.review/text: These are very cute humidifiers. We have one in each of my kid's rooms. The only down side is that the drum is very difficult to clean out. If you happen to leave water in there for more than a day, mold starts to form and even when I wash it with vinegar and water, it is still hard to really clean it efficiently because of the tiny opening to the main drum of the humidifier. I wish there was a way to take it completely a part and clean it well, but there isn't. Other than that, it does it's job well and my kids love them.
