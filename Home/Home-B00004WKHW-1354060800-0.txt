review/summary: Caution when taking off plastic wrapreview/text: My box looked perfect condition, new, and opening it appeared the same way. As soon as I took the theCuisinart DLC-2ABC Mini-Prep Plus Food Processor, Brushed Chromeout of the plastic wrap, though, it smelled like someone sprayed me directly in the face with RAID insect spray. I advise either opening outside wearing a mask and letting it sit there all day before bringing inside or buying a different product.
