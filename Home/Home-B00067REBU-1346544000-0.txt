review/summary: great price and easy to usereview/text: I spent a lot of time checking out different breadmakers, from high-end to more economical. The first recipe I tried was the whole wheat bread. I was a bit weary just because all of the machines had the complaint of whole wheat bread not coming out correctly, and that it was imperative to follow recipes exactly, etc.Well, that worried me a bit since my attention span is very short and therefore following recipes to the T was not going to happen.I was pleasantly surprised, I improvised the recipe adding both wheat and white flour, did not use bread machine flour, I also doubt very much that I was exact in any of my measurements...ok, I admit, I was not at all accurate. The bread turned out with a very nice crust while being fluffy on the inside. I had no problems having a too dark crust or a dried out loaf of bread.I am making another loaf as I write this and to this loaf I also added linseed. Anxious to see how it turns out.I would most definitely recommend this product to anyone else out there like me, that likes to experiment and suffers from a short attention span.
