review/summary: Mixed feelings....review/text: I bought this hand held vacuum to clean the carpet on the stairs. It has great suction but was very surprized to find that I could not clean with a back and forth motion. I could vacuum only by pulling it toward me. I tried it on various carpet pile heights and still could only move the vacuum toward me. Maybe the rotating brush inhibits it. The 20' foot cord was great. The product does deliver on great cleaning ability due to the suction that I doubt would be there in a rechargeable hand held vac.
