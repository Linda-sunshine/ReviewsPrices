review/summary: My thoughts on my newKeurig D60 Special Ed.review/text: This unit does everything it's supposed to do with Keurig K-Cups. I was not very pleased with the use your own filter and screen unit, which is a Keurig accessory, but I haven't really used it enough to get the right mix for my taste. However, their are so many choices in the K-Cups that you could try a different one for the life of the unit. All in all I am very pleased. It is quick, easy, clean, and efficent.
