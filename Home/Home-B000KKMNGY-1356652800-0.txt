review/summary: Terrific Space Saverreview/text: i loved the first one I bought so much, that I immediately bought another one. The arms of the under shelf organizer don't get in the way of anything on the shelf. It is important, however, to measure the depth of the organizer to make sure you have that space available when you install it. There are some boxes, such as the economy big size, that don't fit the organizer but everything else fits fine.
