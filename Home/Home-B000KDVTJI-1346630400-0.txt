review/summary: Horrible Craftsmanship, Horrible Productreview/text: When I unpacked this item from it's box I was already disappointed. The craftsmanship of this product is shoddy at best. It looks stainless steel but is in fact a laminated plastic. I plugged it in to the wall and it didn't even turn on. I tried several outlets. Still didn't turn on. I called Aroma customer service and they were of no help. I returned this item to Amazon for a full refund. Amazon was great. I went with the Chef's Choice water kettle instead. Couldn't be happier.
