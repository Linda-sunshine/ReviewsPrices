review/summary: Puts out a lot of vaporreview/text: This product got a few bad reviews which made me hesitate to buy it, but we've had it for about a month and it's been great in our son's room. There is a dial so you can control the output and turn it down if it gets 'swampy'. It's a really cute design and easy to clean. We have to use distilled water with any humidifier we've ever owned because of the minerals in our water so that was no big deal for us.
