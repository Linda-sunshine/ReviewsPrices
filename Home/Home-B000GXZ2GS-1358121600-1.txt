review/summary: Simple machine - good coffeereview/text: It makes a decent cup of espresso for such a simple device. The construction is solid and the finishing seems good.Have enjoyed the coffee it makes so far. A manual explaining how to get the most out the Aeropress would help, but there's plenty of help online.
