review/summary: Slow is the way to go!review/text: Please don't hurry out to buy the least expensive juicer just to see if juicing is "right for you." Borrow a cheap one, realize you hate the taste of foamy, broken down (watery mixed with pulp and foam) juice and THEN go invest in a slow rotating, single auger, masticating juice extractor. Fast is NOT best when it comes to extracting fruit and vegetable juice! Fast simply destroys the enzymes and nutrients while spraying a mess all over your kitchen. Not fun!Now, why we LOVE this little horizontal, slow rotating beast. You get MORE juice from each piece of fruit or veggie you use. The pulp comes out bone dry and I've seen how we use much less produce than our friends who juice with the centrifugal style juicer. The juice is smooth, not broken down from the high speed of the other juicers. And the foam is minimal and easy to skim if you need, but we find there's simply not enough to worry about.Money-wise, we paid just under $200 for this since we bought is "like new" used. Best decision we made was the use the "used" feature here on Amazon since it came in like new condition with a significant savings. And for twice the price of the other juicers, it's given us more than twice the value in juice quality, savings in amount of produce used and here's the clincher for me.... it takes 3 (yes T-H-R-E-E) minutes to clean. It's SO nice not to spend 20 minutes cleaning up the mess other juicers create. This alone makes the difference in price worth every penny.Our kids (8, 7 and 5) all like the juices we create, even those heavy in veggies. So it's completely family-friendly.
