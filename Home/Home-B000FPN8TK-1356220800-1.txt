review/summary: Brilliant!review/text: This makes drinking tea a bit too easy. It's thoroughly easy to use, highly functional, and the removable filter makes it easy to clean as well. There's also something addicting about setting this on top of a coffee mug and draining the tea from the valve at the bottom.
