review/summary: Multiply the price by 2 or 3 when considering purchasingreview/text: This juicer works quickly and does a great job. The cleanup is pretty typical for a juicer. You had just better treat it like a newborn baby because it breaks VERY easily and Hamilton Beach refuses sell any individual parts to fix it. So chances are, if you like it, you will be buying at least two or three of them. All they would really need to do is make a few of the most breakable parts available (some of which already appear to be user removable like the plastic latch on the base) and I would be currently singing its praises, but I suppose it's not worth it to them to either make a sturdy, quality product or to let consumers buy some of the most suspect parts.
