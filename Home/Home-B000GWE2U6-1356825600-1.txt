review/summary: Cute garbage!review/text: Bought this after seeing good review in consumer reports. Could not agree less. I bought two of these one just stopped working after 4 weeks and I replaced it three days ago with another brand and sure enough second unit stopped working after7 weeks. What a waste of money. Shame on you crane for selling this junk and consumer reports I will not trust your testing any longer. $80 down the drain
