review/summary: This was a gift...review/text: I bought this a gift for my brother. The reviews were good so I figured for the price this would be a nice juicer for him. He just contacted me that a part on the front has broken off---and he wanted to know if I thought he should return it (he thinks he can just glue the item in place again0. I told him it was his gift---but if he though it would give him more trouble---now is the time to return it. He has had it for about a week and a half.
