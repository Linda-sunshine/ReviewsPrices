review/summary: nice alternative for my fireplacereview/text: I purchased an indoor copper container that holds 3 cans of the fuel gel and I use it in my wood-burning fireplace instead of wood. It's wonderful. Crackles like you'd want a fireplace to sound, nice sized flame that flickers, glows, and actually puts out heat, even if it's not meant to. My only criticism is that it's expensive, especially burning 3 at a time. But it's a nice, clean burning product--no smoke is produced. The cans burn about 2.5-3 hours in my fireplace. I'd use this much more frequently if it were less expensive.
