review/summary: Good coffee... Definite Setbacksreview/text: I bought the DeLonghi EC 155 15 and had it for 5 days only before I returned it. Out of the box the product is well finished and has a sturdy appearance. Instructions are somewhat long but overall use of the machine is not very difficult, except for the confusing Steam valve on top, which you would expect only works when the device is set to steam, but it actually can work virtually on any setting as long as the machine is on, and one must keep it in the closed position.I bought the espresso maker to make my own coffee at home with quality flavor and finesse. The machine delivers quality espresso, nice crema, at the right temperature and with a few tries, anyone should be able to make coffee with consistent great taste.The disappointment came only after using it a couple of times: 1. the height between the espresso pump and the cup holding area is too short. I couldn't possibly place any of my china's cups, and it a standard corelle, so all the cups are fairly small. I had to get a espresso set that would fit those narrow limits. Then, as soon as you switch the machine to pump water, the vibration and noise that hard that the cups move out of place, and the coffee would be lost! I had to manually hold the cups until full so the vibration would not move them. I got burned by a the hot spurt while learning this feat.Then I tried making cappuccino: The steam nozzle is fast and effective, it will heat up your milk and create good foam. However, it is quite short for which you can't use a deep jug, and whatever you use, will have to be fairly full before you start. Since it is so short it is hard to keep control over it and the foam overflowed every time leaving me with the mess.I have learned my lesson. My next coffee maker will have to accomodate most of my cups, not vibrate so much and have a longer steam nozzle!
