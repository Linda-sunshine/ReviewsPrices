review/summary: Best wine opener everreview/text: I bought two of these initially. One was for me and one was a gift for a friend of mine. I used mine at my house and showed it off to the friend I bought it for. He had no idea that I had a second one for him. Upon first use we both fell in love with this thing. This makes opening wine bottles so incredibly easy. There's no worry about damaging the cork. With the press of a button the screw digs into the cork and within seconds the bottle is open and ready to drink. I later gave me friend his gift and he's loved it ever since. I've also purchased a third one as a gift for my girlfriend.You can't beat this wine opener. It's inexpensive and will change your wine life!
