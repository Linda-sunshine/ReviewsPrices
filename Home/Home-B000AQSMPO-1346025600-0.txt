review/summary: Leaks after a year and a halfreview/text: The coffee maker was great for the first year and a half, then it started leaking. It leaks when the system is under pressure, from the rear of the unit but only after the 3rd cup or so. I thought maybe there was a blockage in the system, but after cleaning it out and running nothing but filtered water through it, it's not a blockage, it's a leak. Now we only use it when we have a special occasion and keep the paper towels handy. For such an expensive item you would have thought a leak impossible especially after such a short time frame of usage. Five stars for the first year and a half, zero stars for the rest of ownership.
