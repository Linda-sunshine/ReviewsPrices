review/summary: These surprised me.review/text: I've used Brita pitchers off and on for years, whenever I've had smelly, chemical-filled water. I've never had a problem with them in the past. But for some reason, the filters that I recently ordered were a bit too small. There was a gap between the filter and the space they occupy in the pitcher reservoir, so the water was just flowing through without actually being filtered. I'm returning the filters to Amazon. I also contacted Brita about the issue, giving them the batch number printed on the boxes, but haven't heard anything back from them. I'll try to remember to come update my review if I do hear anything back from them. I did find some off-brand filters made to fit Brita pitchers:Mavea 1007930 Classic Fit 2-Pack Replacement Filter. They fit very well and I love they don't require the pre-soak, plus the price is great, so I'll probably buy those as long as they're available.
