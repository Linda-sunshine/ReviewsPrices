review/summary: Just OKreview/text: I had high hopes for this brewing system. While I was not expecting the quality of espresso I was hoping for much better than this delivers. I would rate it a below average drip machine taste. A much cheaper mocha pot produces a way better cup. The k-cups are very weak tasting. I use the smallest setting just to get a strong enough cup - this produces about 4oz. For a full cup you would need 3 K-cups. Out of all the K-cups produced there are only 2 decent ones - Donut Shop and Dark Magic (even though Donut shop is too weak for me it is smooth). Unfortunately these 2 cannot compare to even an average coffee prepared by a mocha pot. Don't bother wasting your time using the My K-cup accesory....it just does not work satisfactorily. The one plus this system has going for it is convenience. Flip a switch and 2 mins later you are ready to brew. It takes about 10 secs to brew the smallest cup. Very quick and very easy. In my opinion the K-cups are way overpriced...at 1/3 of their current price they would be an ok value. For now my unit is going back to Costco. A $20 mocha pot, cheap grinder, and Stumptown Hairbender whole bean produces a much better cup and costs 1/10 the price.
