review/summary: Best pan in my collectionreview/text: So, this was the first Cast-Iron Pan I bought, It did everything so well from day one, that I had to add the Lid - do not buy this without the lid. Stove top or Oven, this pan outshines them all. Now, I still use by Anodized pans too, but when I work with heavy meats and juices, the cast iron is the beast.
