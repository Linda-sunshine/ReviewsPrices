review/summary: Great coffee makerreview/text: Our old coffee maker bit the dust and I had to find a new one quick. This one at Amazon had the features I wanted. I especially liked the ability to select the heat setting I wanted for the warming plate (high, medium and low), and the fact that I could set the warming plate to turn off anywhere from 1 to 4 hours after brewing. My old pot turned off after 1 hour, and that wasn't enough for us to finish drinking the whole pot. However, keeping the heat on under the coffee for too long can result in an overcooked, bitter drink. For us, three hours combined with the low setting is just right, and the coffee stays tasty throughout.Most important, however, is the fact that this pot makes an exceptionally good tasting cup of coffee--very smooth and flavorful. I've been using paper filters rather than the permanent gold filter that came with the pot. I already had a supply, and I've read that paper filters out the cafestol in coffee (a potent stimulator of LDL cholesterol levels) while the gold does not.Another bonus is that the carafe pours without dripping. The only thing I don't like is that the carafe lid snaps off rather than lifting on a hinge. However, this is a minor inconvenience.This is a wonderful coffee maker, and the bonus is that it comes with a 3-year warranty. I take that as a sign that Cuisinart believes it will hold up at least that long.
