review/summary: Love this product!review/text: I used an electric kettle in the UK this summer; it was a staple in all hotel rooms. I loved the quick and efficient way to prepare water for tea, and was pleased to find that I could purchase a US model from Amazon.com. I have used it everyday since I received it. Much better than microwaving a cup at a time, or using the tea kettle on top of the burner. It shuts off automatically when it reaches full temp, and keeps the water hot for quite some time. Energy effiicient, safe, and convenient.
