review/summary: Inexpensive and easy to usereview/text: This is a solid and efficient popcorn maker. Just pour cup of kernels into the maker, place a large bowl in front of the chute, and plug it in. Within a few minutes you'll have enough popcorn for two people, or one hungry person. Some of the popcorn doesn't make it out of the chute, but it's very easy to take the top off and dump the remaining popcorn into your bowl. It's true that not all of the kernels get popped, but certainly more than a typical bag of microwave popcorn. Plus unlike microwave popcorn, none of the kernels get burnt.I do wish it had an on/off switch, so that I could have the option to keep it plugged in between uses. Also, the butter cup on the top is pretty useless - there isn't enough time for it to heat up so the butter doesn't melt. I melt some butter in the microwave first, so that I can pour it over the popcorn in batches to distribute it more evenly. Because it pops without oil, the popcorn is very dry, so if you want salt to stick to it then butter or some other coating is needed.If you're looking for a simple and inexpensive popper this is definitely a good choice.
