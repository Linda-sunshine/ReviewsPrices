review/summary: I love this knife!review/text: I loved mine so much I bought one for my sister! She loves hers too. It is very sharp and holds it's edge well. Mine has some very minor dings in it because I'm slightly abusive towards it(knocks against other silver ware, thrown in sink). It's very inexpensive so if I need to, I can easily replace it. It's been about three years and I haven't had it sharpened professionally. It still works great, dings and all.
