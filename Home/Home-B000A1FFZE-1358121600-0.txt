review/summary: I agree with the other one star reviews....it's just not worth the money.review/text: O.K. so I got one of theses and found that it indeed doesn't toast very evenly, that it requires things like Pop-Tarts to be heated in the oven per the instruction manual, etc.There are a lot of other 1 star reviews here and I won't try to repeat what they have alread said other than to join their chorus and say a few extra things:(1) I can't imagine how anyone could give the unit that I got even the lightest of tests and say it was O.K. There must be a great difference in the units manufactured.(2) We use a bread called "Dave's Killer Bread" and two slices won't fit in the opening unless you turn one on its end and that leaves an inch or so sticking out the top which doesn't toast (in addition to the portion in the unit toasting unevenly).(3) Some reviewers have said that to keep the crums from sitting on the lower browing unit shield and buring that they toast with the little oven pan in the unit. DON'T DO THIS. When toasting the two lower elements are blocked by the tray and they are on during the toasting cycle. So at best, if you toast with the little pan in, the unit will not be toasting as the designers designed it, and at worst toasting this way might be dangerous.(4) The instructions don't even tell you to keep the tray out when toasting--and they don't tell you to keep it in either. In fact the instructions are pretty useless except to tell you that a lot of things that are designed to be put in a toaster cannot be put in THIS toaster but should be put in the oven part, and sometimes you will need to toast your toast twice.Sorry, I can't recommend this unit at all.
