review/summary: Not the greatest...review/text: These sheets are not even close to being a high quality 600 thread count. Even after the first washing, they are still rough to the feel. I bought other sheets before from big chain stores while they are on sale and they are much better quality than these. They are marginal at best and will be probably be used as a back up after I purchase new ones.
