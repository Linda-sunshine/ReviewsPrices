review/summary: Fantastic!review/text: I bought a larger KitchenAid food processor that was loads more money. It's motor just wouldn't start after only having it for about two months. I was in the middle of grating cheese too. Not like a hard block or large brick or anything, just a couple inch by couple inch of Parmesan. After getting angry at the expensive unit and trying for a couple hours to figure out how to start it, complete with manual and internet searching I decided to toss it and buy this Cuisinart. Love it! Works like a charm, simple to operate, starts up every time with a strong motor. The 7-cup size is a decent volume that I think is a good medium size for most users. The dimensions of the tub/bowl area is approximately 6.25 inches in diameter x 4 inches tall and the top spout part where you insert food from is an oval shape but is roughly 2.75 x 4.5 inches x 3.5 inches tall. I've never owned one of these processors aside from the KitchenAid and this one now, but it may be of importance / preference to others that the KitchenAid one had it's motor always kick on with a &#34;soft start&#34; where you'd say press the pulse button and the blade would start spinning at a slow speed and gradually speed up to full bore over the course of a second. But this Cuisinart is not that way. It's as I'd expect a processor to be. When you press the button it's a full speed spin of the blade from the moment you press it. That seemed to make a difference to me when I'd pulse cheese in the inlet tube while feeding it into the processor. The speed at which you feed it combined with the speed of the blade spinning does make a difference in the &#34;thickness&#34; of the resulting shred/grate/cut material you're after. Seemed to me with the soft start motor it was always more difficult to get any sort of real consistency but with this Cuisinart it's much simpler. I've had it a couple months now and love it! I recommend it.
