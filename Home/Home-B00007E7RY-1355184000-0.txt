review/summary: Seems to clean air great but very noisyreview/text: The only filter I have to really compare this to is the Honeywell HFD-120Q. I owned that air cleaner for 3 years (first bought it when there was a week long fire in the Hollywood hills that made LA's bad air even worse.) Having used it almost constantly for those 3 years (cleaning the permanent filter occasionally) the bearings or some part of the motor just started getting a little noisier. I made the mistake of going to Consumer Reports to see what &#34;the best&#34; one is instead of just replacing my HFD-120Q. This Honeywell 50250 had relatively high ranking for the money so I decided to go with it instead. I have no doubt that it does a slightly better job of cleaning air - it had better since it sounds like a jet engine relative to the HFD-120Q. The &#34;Quiet&#34; setting on the 50250-S is louder than the fastest setting on the HFD-120Q.I just don't feel like keeping it on at night now because it is so loud whereas I always slept with the 120Q turned on. Now, I just turn this 50250 on before I leave for work and keep it running in my bedroom until I go to bed. Meanwhile my clean air continues to get replaced by crappy LA air while I sleep. &#60;sigh&#62;. I should have just returned it to Amazon right away but I already threw the box away when I opened it (small apartment). Oh yeah, worse yet... it has a pre-cleaner that is supposed to be replaced every 3 months. I thought I was careful to choose the model that didn't require any replacement filters but unfortunately, that's not the case.Anyhow, if you don't mind a noisy cleaner, it does seem to work really well. But I'd suggest Honeywell's quieter model - the HFD-120Q - if you like to sleep with one turned on at night and don't want to ever worry about replacement filters.
