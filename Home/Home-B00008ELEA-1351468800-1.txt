review/summary: coffee percolatorreview/text: Farberware makes a great coffeepot. The coffee is full-bodied and hot and the pot is very fast. Many other coffee makers don't keep the coffee hot enough for me; that's why I buy Farberware. I have owned several of these and my only concern is that sometimes the heating element wears out in a couple of years.
