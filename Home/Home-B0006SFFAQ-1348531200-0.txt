review/summary: Fantastic coffee makerreview/text: Over the years, I have gone through so many coffee makers that I lost count. My daughter gave me this coffee maker over six years ago and it is still going strong. It makes a perfect cup of coffee and the programmable feature is an absolute must. Some of the other pots I have owned would occasionally plug up making coffee grounds and water flow over the filter and all over the counter. I have never experienced that problem with this model. Others talked about the problem filling the water reservoir but I am right handed and have not had any problems. The carafe is still in excellent shape after all this time. I have been so afraid that it was going to give out on me at any time that I just ordered the same model as a backup unit in case it was not available when needed! I absolutely love this coffee maker and would recommend it to anyone.
