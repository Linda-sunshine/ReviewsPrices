review/summary: Unbelievable quality and what a difference a dish makesreview/text: Made my favorite brisket in this when using it for the first time. Two 3# briskets fit beautifully with room to spare. I first tried it inthe oven, and because it holds the heat so well, the liquid started to boil. I decided to put it on top of the stove at a very low simmer and it cooked beautifully as well as having browned the meat prior to simmering. It is definitely heaving when lifting especially out of the oven. Excellent quality and beautiful color. Sorry I waited so long to buy one.
