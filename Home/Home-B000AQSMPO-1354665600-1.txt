review/summary: Keurig does not lastreview/text: I have had now 2 Keurigs. The first time I thought it was a fluke (croaked at one year mark). Bought another one because I do like the coffee... This one bit the dust too at the one year mark... Totally sad because I don't think I can swallow $100 for a one year coffeemaker....
