review/summary: slightly disappointedreview/text: I was slightly disappointed with this waffle maker, yet also slightly in love. I had to turn up the heat to the 5 setting and leave the waffle on much longer than the indicator light suggested to get the golden brown crispy waffle I wanted. It also did not cook evenly, the difference wasn't huge or bad, but it might be because the top doesn't seem weighed down like it says. But all in all I am happy with this waffle maker, I did give it four stars didn't I? It just takes patience. I am happy that I no longer have to make belgian waffles, which is the reason I bought this. I'm torn on if I should have spent the 10 extra dollars on a similar one but if you aren't horribly picky this is the one for you, it does work, and can make delicious crispy waffles, just remember you get what you pay for. I will say my picky 3 year old asked for seconds, and that never happens. HE LOVED THEM! :)
